It has great presentation and terrible Gacha grinding mechanics. Buy only if you are willing to treat it as a ""sandbox"" game that you are OK with dropping at any time when the fun stops

PROs:
 + Beautiful artwork, music and voice acting
 + Interesting side stories
 + Creature collection and training mechanic is very fun
 + Some Imps can eventually take human form and even become romance interests
 + Spontaneous NPC interactions based off relationships
 + End game story and art is excellent

CONS:
 - A lot of junk skills and destinies, meaning character customization is not as diverse as presented
 - Power gaps between breakthrough levels too big, making fights unbalanced
 - Lacklustre combat that's full of flash but weak on substance
 - Repetitive NPC interactions
 - Weak as a sandbox game
 - Too many undercooked ideas, leading to a feeling of feature bloat
 - (Neutral) Surprisingly dark relationship twists and development possible (note: suicide warning)
 - Marriages are open relationships by default
 - You can't have children or start a Cultivator family
- Too much meaningless Gacha grinding


----- Full Review: The Good -----

The art direction, music, voice acting and side storylines are great, and are essentially the only things that kept me going. The core storyline of ""get stronger, go further"" felt a bit lacklustre until the end game, when the sense of desperation to unite a battered group of Cultivators to defeat an overwhelming foe, combined with the tower-defence style game mechanics, suddenly became very engaging.

There's a lot of customization options for your character, ranging from Righteous Vs Demonic tendencies role-play elements, myriad passives, and combat styles (long Vs short range, number of projectiles, synergistic effects, etc.). Face and clothes customization is also pretty robust, letting you make beautiful characters. You can do a fair bit of role-playing, for example, choosing whether or not to kill or spare lives, going after Cultivators who harm your family members, etc.

There are some pretty cool spontaneous NPC interactions in the game, which are unfortunately few and far between. Once I took a mission to be the vanguard of a team to take out a difficult monster, only to be backstabbed by the evil team leader who wanted to hoard the treasure. I killed them out of righteous anger, but this angered their family members, who then hunted me down for revenge.

Another time two of my romance partners met in town and got into a fight over who deserved my affections, and I wisely decided to slip away. Yet another time I broke up with a romance partner (she was turning toxic, slandering my other girls and demanding valuable items in order to placate her), only to randomly stumble into her later trying to drown herself out of grief.


----- Full Review: The Bad -----

Wow, where to begin.

(1) The game is principally built upon the ""Gacha"" (random loot drop) mechanic, which has no business being in a single player game. Want to Breakthrough? Chance of success if you get all the right materials. Need those materials? Chance of dropping from a Boss monster. Need Boss monster? Chance of spawning. This gets particularly bad at midgame when you need to grind ""Tao souls"", which requires you to grind for materials to reroll the RNG attributes within the dungeon, hope that you don't get killed through a bad Boss spawn, after which there is a chance of success to make said item.

If you look at the achievement statistics, 50% of players don't make it past here. It's bad. And ultimately less than 5% of players actually make it to the end of the game.

(2) Combat gets very lacklustre after early game. The initial fights lead you to think that the game has skill-based bullet hell mechanics. By about a third way in you'll realize that your character simply doesn't move fast enough to avoid many attacks, the number of AoE enemy attacks keep increasing, and you don't have a dedicated dodge or parry mechanic. There is a motion skill, but it takes too long to recharge between uses for it to be an effective game mechanic.

This is made worse by the terrible level scaling. Enemies above and below your level are so imbalanced that you'll swing between doing 1 point damage to completely obliterating them in seconds, with no need for skill.

(3) Some Boss fights are completely unpolished messes. A particularly vile one is Xingtian, where you must kill both his axe and shield together within 3 seconds of each other's defeat, otherwise they will regenerate back to full health, artificially dragging the fight out far more cycles than is welcome. After that you fight Xingtian proper, whose AoE attacks are so big you can barely dodge it and if you aren't over-grinded in defence, you will swiftly die and have to redo the fight all over again. One of the final bosses, Hengtian, has a game mechanic where you must collect glowing orbs in order not to succumb to a full screen poison and AoE spike damage attack. He would often pair up that attack with a several seconds long freeze attack (during which you can't even use healing items).

Really, it's like the combat designers can't think of any other solution other than ""go grind defence until you die of old age"" rather than making combat more responsive and enjoyable.

(4) Mission difficulty descriptions do not update to your current level, meaning you will enter a new region, take on the easiest mission and get curb stomped, or return to a nightmare level mission in an earlier region and simply one shot everything. This gets particularly bad with multi-part side missions, where you can clear one part easily and get one-shotted in the next, forcing you to stop and come back later, which feels very jarring since most of these stories carry an air of urgency (plot wise) about them. In Agar's questline you are given both an impossible mission AND a time limit (which was not told to you beforehand)!

(5) Romance and Marriage relationships, while cool and can trigger interesting events, ultimately become dull. There is literally only 1 dating spot with the exact same activities, none of which give any meaningful depth to the character that you are dating. There's also a missed opportunity to start Cultivator families. While you can join Sects and have an adoptive family, in a lot of Cultivator and Xianxia books and material, Cultivators often have families, passing on their traditional techniques and ideals. Here, marriage feels ... odd. Like after getting married you and your spouse live apart, pursuing your own adventures and ambitions, and (rather upsetting) your spouse will almost certainly seek out other romance partners unless he/she has the ""faithful (to spouse)"" trait. All these really detract from immersion in the game.

(6) The game can't figure out what it wants to be. A sandbox? The level gaps between regions means it's meaningless to go back since there is no challenge there. A bullet hell? Movement is too restrictive and level gaps are too much to provide meaningful dodging or parrying. A roguelite? With so much Gacha elements and a lot of downtime between boss respawns, it's just better to reload and try again. A faction management simulator? It's not robust or dynamic enough. A roleplaying game? I suppose there's just enough depth to barely satisfy. A simulator? I don't have 10,000 years to live in the real world doing the same grind over and over again.


----- Full Review: Conclusion -----

Tale of Immortal is one of those games that long overstays its welcome. The game does indeed get better at the endgame, but getting there takes so much effort and time that I'd rather recommend playing till the game stops being fun, then watching someone’s playthrough of the endgame.

Now i am a realm higher than my master in the sect, he asked to spar to see how far i cultivated, beat his ass within 10 seconds and not even 1% of my vitality hurt. Now my master dislikes me and somehow roams around chasing love of his life after he failed breaking through.

like for example you pick a trait that made ur healt drop to 1% in order to get a shield that protect you from damage and get another trait with the name of king chicken is here and everytime u enter a to a new room chikies will gonna be every where and burn everything into the ashes

and if u just want some classic like bullet hell then pick sword and it's trait but if u want damage combine sword + wind cause it's pretty much it for the game well not enough for chaos difficulty though
but i usually only use sword cause it's deal a great amount off damage just made sure that u have everything that u need to squeeze that juicy ass damage

and also i try to be playing like nice kind harted protagonist that always help thoose who around me but yeah it's pretty boring even thought u will most likely get tons of good thing but where's the challenge???

meanwhile on every evil protagonist play through it's always be different well beside the fact killing bunch off no goodies and yeah i got into some pretty interesting situation while i played as an evil protagonist and killing everyone who stands in may way no matter what it is and even straight up and to the point killing my disciple/family for no reason cause they have been longing for revenge againts me but they do not realize that im way beyond their expectation so i took the revenge to them killing every member of their family and left none to see another day and for my disciple/family i just chug them a pills and see that they have been resurrect like a dead man waking up like nothing happen pretty funny thought

and yeah maybe if i can request for something to the dev it's gonna be something like please made the english batter cause sometime it can be hillarious when ur on dire situations and just see some pretty off dialogue even thought i can just use mod but it will be pretty nice if u guys can do it

and for those who want to try to play with mod do it but at the cost of some bugged or do some cosmetic mod cause the cosmetic is pretty much not enough if i can say so or better do install some game changing mechanic cause it's pretty fun if you like to mess around

-To fix game launch and still be able to use mods: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2892700098

-Download a mod that has better translations (should be one on the workshop somewhere) 

Review:
Pros: This game is basically vampire survivors mixed with a xianxia plot, except you make the plotline for the most part. Has a ton of content and have a nice collection of mods that support the English version. What truly makes this game fun is the actual relationship system in this game. The characters will remember what you did and do their own thing all together. It's really not an exaggeration for most of the reviews for this game that talk about their character's backstory.  Oh, and the reason why the game has mixed reviews are due to some controversial issues throughout development and modding debacles. Most of these issues are fixed.

Cons: Quite grindy but you can fine tune it. Has some crappy mtl translations and the gameplay is definitely not all that balanced. Although I suppose that's pretty lore accurate to the genre lmao. 

Verdict: 
I'd give it a shot, this is definitely a game you will love if you end up digging the gameplay loop.",1704769254,1704769486,True,97,1,0.888781964778900146,0,True,False,False

This game is absurdly fun, and if you know a single sh*t about the cultivator/wuxia genre, this game was basically made for you.  To hell with the other reviewers talkin about ""be kind to everybody"" I slaughter entire villages of people if they look at me wrong.  Almost every monthly cycle I've no less than 2 encounters and just about every single one of them is somebody swearing bloody vengeance over their dead son/father/brother/mother/sister/cat-or-dog and I wouldn't have it any other way.  THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME FACE!! If only this crazy ass game was multiplayer OMFG the lulz..

I was made aware of this game from the cultivation angle and if you like Amazing Cultivation Simulator this game will not be completely unfamiliar to you.

The game is simple both in presentation as well as core gameplay loop. There is some depth to the combat but most of the skill gain is strategic rather than tactical in that you will not be able to ""outskill"" an opponent that has a much higher power level than you. The intricacy is in your strategic approach, choosing the right stats/improvements to your character and commiting to your build. You will find that  your reward is so much power that in the end you might not really even really know (or care) what happens on your screen anymoe as your enemies are cut down by a thousand swords per second. I found the whole experience to be very enjoyable.

There are some technical issues. Not to boast but I have a fairly good, PC with recent(~2022) hardware and the game still lags in big fights and especially when ""freshly"" launched. This is mitigated somehow as the game runs and it seems to me you only have to wait for things once per game launch. (which still is too much for a game that looks like this when hardware is as powerful as it is, there is some software bottleneck for sure)

The translation is serviceable and gets worse towards the end but the story is not necessarily something you should want to play this game for. You want to play it to see the numbers go bigger and for the screen to become illegible with effects and the game delivers on that.",1704661707,1704661707,True,1,0,0.504991650581359863,0,True,False,False

FIRST: In order to play the current version of TOI you have to right click the game in your steam library and go to local files. There you have to look for a file named ""version.dll.""Delete it and you're good to go.

 I'm a huge cultivation and martial art fan and as such, I would highly recommend TOI to anyone looking to immerse themselves in an immortal adventure of their own making. Just stay away from the new mod system and you'll be fine. There's currently an issue where the game doesn't open regularly (this will be fixed soon), again this is due, in my opinion, to what I like to call over listening to the fans. That being said they shouldn't have rushed that system into the game seeing that most of the bad reviews are centered around that and not being able to play the game, versus the game play itself. I've played TOI for quite awhile, each play through being different than the last. The devs (contrary to popular belief) really due care about the fan base, choosing to animate the dialog characters and even going as far as having in game outfits and costumes designed by players and fans themselves. Overall this is by far my favorite cultivation game and if you choose to give it a chance (with an open mind) I'm sure it could easily be yours as well. People do not hesitate to heap bad reviews on something, trust me when I say the reviews are MUCH worst than the actual game. Just look at the hrs most of them have put in, the range is between 80 -300+ hours. That should tell you it's the patch/patches not the game. It's an epic game with even more content scheduled to release on TOI's road map. Do yourselves a favor, try it for yourself first.

Exploring this world steeped in cultivation allowed me to discover numerous elements of Chinese culture while developing my combat and cultivation skills.

Visually, the game adopts an aesthetic reminiscent of manhua, offering remarkable graphics that undeniably enhance the allure of the experience.

Although the learning curve might be steep initially, once mastered, it contributes to the rewarding aspect of the game, providing appreciable depth and richness in gameplay.

In essence, Tale of Immortal is a title that will appeal to enthusiasts of manhua and manhwa, delivering an immersive and instructive adventure within a culturally rich and entertaining framework.

[Normal Mode] is good probably for entirety of your experience of this game. You can just play this mode and fall in love with the game and never touch Chaos. Probably the best way to experience this game as well. It is easy, but will still present a decent challenge for someone who is new to this game. You will die, but you can rest easy since you can respawn and repair your Mythical Artifact. If you just want to play this game and build several characters with different builds/artifacts/destinies, then this will be your favorite piece of the cake.

[Chaos Mode], however, is an entirely different experience. In my opinion, it is the way that this game is supposed to be played. A slow and step-by-step grind to immortality. 

This mode is hard, real hard. Boss fights here become a proper bullet hell/Dark Souls experience. Experienced players still make mistakes, will still die on these bosses even with the most optimized builds, especially at the early stages. 

There are many ways in which you can play this game to ease the difficulty of this mode, like being a sect leader and playing the sect management game to access more resources to prepare your character. You can also do the speedrun strategy here of romancing high level cultivators, but I feel like this is bordering on cheating (seriously which Enlightenment cultivator dates a Qi Refining no-good handsome hooligan?). 

Basically, your knowledge of the game is a better assurance of your survival and mental health, than just ""getting gud."" In this mode, you need to know how to build your character, how to differentiate a bad Manual from a good one, which rewrite destinies/reborn bird to use, etc. To ""get gud"" in this game is not just to know how to dodge attacks (which is also important), you also have to know the proper builds and other game aspects to succeed.

My point here is that Chaos mode is something that you should only touch when you have played through this game at least once in Normal mode, maybe twice. Of course, you can probably ""wing it"" playing through it the first time without Normal mode experience, but it will be painful. I knew people who just went to try Chaos mode without touching Normal, thinking that they are gaming Gigachads, who came out like frustrated soyboys saying that the game is bad after their first 5 hours.

TLDR: Normal mode is the best way to experience this game, but Chaos mode probably is the intended way to actually grind your way to immortality. Please try Normal mode first before subjecting yourself to the challenges and tortures of Chaos mode.

Other than that, here are some highlights to this game:

1.) Beautiful NPCs with their own personalities and quirks. Some will kill each other. Your NPC friends will talk you up and recommend you to other people. You can get a master, and learn skills from your master. Some NPCs (including you) are marked by the dragon border and labelled ""Heaven's Chosen"". Basically Main Characters of their own stories (there are many of them, all with boosted stats.) As a beginner, best to not antagonize them, or interact with them until you know what you are doing. Some NPCs are romantic. They are easier to court, and will leave their sect if you recruit them for your own. Some NPCs are caring. If you are their disciple, you can request for cultivation materials and they will probably not refuse. There are many NPCs in this game, each one of them you can socialize with for your own end. You can kill them, steal from them, romance them. Anything really, just play around with it.

2. Cultivation System. The first five levels only give you stats and rewrite destinies, which are fine and build defining on their own, but the last four levels really amph up the crazy meter on what your build can be capable off. You get a reborn Netherbird of your choice, you get a fragment of Primal Beast soul, a domain ability and Heavenly capabilities. In Chaos mode, breaking through to the next level gives me some of the best dopamine high in gaming.

3. Every breakthrough gives you a number of ""Rewrite Destiny"" to choose from. These are characteristics that will usually define the way you tackle the road to immortality. All of them are beneficial, though some are more beneficial than others. If you are a part of a sect, you can also acquire their sect destiny if you breakthrough in your sect spirit hall. There are destinies where you acquire a burning butt (makes you run faster, but vulnerable from behind), destinies where you sometimes multicast your skill. Some destinies can also be a bit less useful such as the destiny where you are permanently in good mood.

I'm missing a lot more highlights in this review, like the Story and random events, money making, sect management, social webs, artisan skills, artifact crafting, sect tournaments/activities/conflicts etc. But these things, you've got to try out for yourself. This is probably the best cultivator game in Steam (next to Amazing Cultivation Simulator) in my own opinion.

You're living your life and going through your daily chores to try and get stronger and earn some pocket change. You see a posting on a job bored to make some spicy soup for someone and it seems like an easy job for some quick contribution points...

But this is a world of cultivation!

One cannot simply cook soup in your home kitchen, you have to head outside with your alchemy cauldron into the woods to avoid catching some houses on fire with the intense heat! But there was one factor you forgot about and that was the wild animals around you as you start to cook.

The beast smell the delicious concoction you are making for your sect job...

Before you know it, you, a humble disciple who was stirring the soup, are surrounded by hoards of monsters who wish to eat your soup as it smells DIVINE!

But also you! Fight as hard as you can, but being a frail mortal, succumb to their onslaught for the soup.

I have never played a game with this concept done as well as this and made it an adventure to do even the most mundane things without dying. Be it cooking soup for your sect and being swarmed by wild beasts, going out the the gardens to collect some herbs...but they don't wish to be taken without a fight and turn into a hulking 30ft tall Goliath that mulches your corpse, or even picking fruits from a grove that someone requested, only to have the giant monkey living in the tree come down and stomp you to death for touching its fruits.

[h2]Pros[/h2]
+ [u]Rich content[/u] for an integrated progression experience: lots of different classes/builds, sects, story lines, systems (alchemy, etc.), character relationships/interactions, random events, items, etc.
+ Has replayability, due to RNG and the different paths you can choose
+ [u]Good for killing time[/u], can be played for at least 100 + hours or more if you are into this kind of games
+ [u]HIGHLY interactive[/u]: although this game is single-player, NPC's will proactively come to interact with you; you can form different relationships with them, and they will have relationships among themselves which influence the outcomes of your interactions with them.
+ Plenty of modding available (even R18 ones if you like them)
+ High-quality 2D graphics (for characters, mostly)

[h2]Neutral[/h2]
~ Battle system is so-so. Although there are different classes, the actual combat is very simple, click to fire, WASD to reposition or dodge, not much techniques required, so not much satisfaction you can get from winning combats. But this may not be a bad thing if you don't like actions in grindy games.
~ This game has rich content and lots of elements, but blocks of text or [b]too much information may be overwhelming[/b] and difficult to absorb or remember; but this game does include some tutorials and learning curve is relatively smooth, you can still play without reading and learning everything.
~ Too much goals and side quests going on simultaneously can be overwhelming and distracting, as with any time/resource management games.
 
[h2]Cons[/h2]
- [u]HIGHLY repetitive, VERY grindy[/u]. Endless loops of completing dungeons, quests, and farming for materials. Competitive or perfectionist players may also need to do a lot of saves scumming to combat RNG.
- Long loading and processing time

Outside of combat progress takes a very long time (years in-game) so seeing instant results isn't likely (unless you cheat, in which case you do you, have fun however you feel like).

Relationships in this game are pretty shallow.

Building this amazing bond with an NPC, thinking we're in sync, solid friends. Then she goes, ""Let's conquer this boss together."" We do it! Victory's in the bag! But hold up: she double-crosses me, takes all the spoils, wipes me out, and adds insult to injury by rubbing it in. It's like a virtual gut punch, feeling legit betrayed by an NPC.

While the game is marketed towards english audiances it cannot run on non chinese computers without editing the files, there are also a large amount of seemingly nonsensical bugs like in my most recent playthrough where I randomly got a bugged duplicate of a skill I already had forcing me to literally delete said skill so I could undoing all of my progress in it. The final stretch of the game is also complete wank, with most of the bosses being glorified damage sponges. One of the final boses whose name I forgot and can't be arsed to look up again splits up in three and all three need to be defeated in short succession otherwise they just revive each other. Issue is that they move sporedically and their health bars are at the top of the screen so it's nearly impossible to keep track of which is which. Said boss is also so poorly optimized that I had literally single digits FPS plus there was a bug where they would just duplicate into even more versions not only making the lag worse but also turning the fight into such a visual mess that I could barely tell where my character was during it. Needless to say I didn't finish this game.

Besides this there are many places where the game is blatently unfinished or just broken. For instance there is a mechanic where you can preview skills before learning them but if you try this on an ultimate skill you get the message ""currently unavailable""
As for the broken part, I had picked a perk during character creation which added an exclusive sect to rule with a special altar which could boost my power when upgraded. Thing is that you need to de certain quests to be able to upgrade it but when I tried to upgrade it to level 4 it said I needed to do a quest that doesn't seem to even exist.

But as a reviewer, I don't want to recommend this game, for now, because there's a huge amount of bugs that will ruin your play.

If you still want to try, please prepare yourself. Because you will get stuck many times as the game will sometimes just stop working (it's not crash, the game's still running but you can do/click anything), and have to restart the game. And for each update, there will be new bugs, preparing to slap at your face.

I will definitely recommend the game if they finish fixing up all the major/stupid bugs and make the game run normally.

Heres looking at you Skyrim which saw the Modders fix up the game breaking bugs in that game.

Now onto my thoughts on this game so far.
I enjoy most of the gameplay,but I feel they could or should've added a more in depth NPC system as it rarely feels like the AI seems to be interacting with me deeply.And of course the fact that for whatever reason you have to edit a file in the games files to get the english version of the game to work...Which disables some of the mods as others have noted.And really that is my biggest criticism of this game.

It seems the devs installed Melonloader incorrectly with their update. I managed to get the game functioning again by going to the melonloader website: Melonloader [melonwiki.xyz]
From there, download the melonloader.x86.zip file, and extract its contents into your game folder, overwriting the previous files. This seems to allow the game to run normally again.

Finally meet a girl who is demonic path like me, Hu Henyu. We become friendly, we train together, we trade items, I follow her on my map so I can help her if shes in trouble. Years go by, gaining strength, doing dungeons, getting loot, training techniques. She's stronger than me, she gives me items for my cultivation, talks me up to people and we eventually we become sworn sisters. 
NPCs who follow the righteous path tell me to stop talking to her, that I shouldn't be friend with her. I tell them to buzzoff. She is my most trusted ally. Get stronger, join a Sect. A higher up in the sect tells me I should become his disciple, I do. Years go by, I get stronger and still very close to my Sworn Elder sister. One day i get a message "" Hu Henyu was heavily injured in a battle with ""Loser A"" but narrowly escapes him. 
Oh fuck no, I search the map for Loser A, how dare he attack my only true ally. Hes hard to find but on the day of the great auction I find him in town and beat him with-in an inch of his life. Loser offers me every item he has to spare him. I take the option that says ""Keep your items loser"" and humiliate him in front of the entire town. ""Relationship with Master goes down a lot"" turns out Loser is my Masters son. 
Years go by they clash multiple times injuring each other. Finally my Sworn Elder Sister wins and kills Loser A. Finally its over, I was wrong. 3 Months later "" Hu Henyu barely escapes from an attack..from my Master. I'm worried she my die while my Master seeks revenge. I find her in a town and give her some items to help her advance her cultivation. I meet her father while I'm there it was nice to make more friends. Two months go by i meet her again and check her relationship board. ""Father(deceased)""...by my masters hand. I'm furious, I JUST met him and its already done. I let this go on too long. I've grow, its been years of My master chasing my Elder sister and beating her close to death. My spear techniques now surpass my entire Sect. Its time to end this, I chase my master down and we fight to the death in a grassy field. He begs for his life, I ignore him and end it. My Sworn Elder Sister is safe, revenge for her and her father taken.

I had a lot of fun playing this game, especially when using mods that offer a fresh experience with every new playthrough. The game's flexibility, which allows you to customize it, is what motivates replayability. The only issue is that there aren't many English-speaking modders in the game, so you'll need a translator to understand the story.

However, the base game itself is enjoyable, and you don't necessarily need mods to have a good time. With 80 hours of gameplay and some cheats (to skip grinding), the game becomes highly enjoyable. The only limitation is in the story quest, which extends to the reborn stage. This is where Steam Workshop comes into play, allowing you to extend the content.

I'd also like to address the negative reviews, especially those claiming it's a virus. It's not, and this has been confirmed by Malwarebytes. Furthermore, ignore the negative reviews mentioning game crashes. Yes, the game may crash, but it's fixable with a few clicks, as long as you search for a solution.

The game has received negative feedback due to its external components (which are easy to resolve, and the virus warnings are unfounded), but its internal components are highly addictive.",1665536145,1697867696,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Here's what you need to do :

Find ''language and region'' settings,
press ''admin language''
then ''change system locale''
and check the beta box.

If you're too scared to enable this you can just delete the version.dll file from the game's folder, doing so will disable mods tho.

Restart your PC and the game will run fine.


As for the game itself it's more of an Roguelike looting rpg than actual Cultivation game.

Explication : You fight monsters and bosses to get loot which you use to UNLOCK higher realms. Once your ''tier 2'' you unlock more and harder bosses. Repeat forever. There is obviously tons of side content and the game is really fun with easy 100h+ content even on the easy difficulty *has Hardcore Chaos difficulty).

If you want a real cultivation game try Amazing Cultivation Simulator, but beware the amount of content can scare off new players and even after 500h you'll learn new stuff. Just start playing on normal difficulty and once you think you're far enough restart with your accumulated knowledge (or keeping playing that save works too).",1615534489,1697830010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Easy is actually easy, especially with mods. 
Create your own mods! Not happy with story content? (Why?) Make your own!
Already sunk your life into the game so far that you've discovered all the content? Download a mod someone else created... and keep playing!
Feeling thirsty? There's mods for that. 

You don't even actually need mods! The game is great on it's own.

The easiest fix is to delete the ""version.dll"" file, but this prevents the game's mod loader from loading most mods. 
The other, more proper fix has something to do with changing the game's folder name, as it includes chinese signs, which can't be read by something important for opening the game. I don't quite remember what I did, but there are guides on how to get it fixed one google search away. This way you can use mods aswell. 

Otherwise, good game honestly. Though a bit barebones, their openess to modding pretty much fixes that. Though, it is insanely grindy, which I suppose is lore accurate lol, so I can't blame them too much. 

Probably the best ""cultivation"" game currently available, what with most of them being shitty idle games and the only other decent one I can think of being ""Amazing Cultivation Simulator"" which I only rank below as a personal preference thing.

Untouched by ""power creep"" complainers, this game allows you to outgrow even the bosses in attributes, becoming one-shotting juggernawt of pwnage, that is, until you move to the next area. There you again are at the bottom and have to cultivate further and upgrade equipment/skills.

Another interesting feature is the social system where you get relations with NPC cultivators ranging from lover to mortal foe, get various events with them and can assist them by giving gifts, or steal and murder - risking the wrath of more powerful cultivators related to your victims. ""There is always a bigger fish"" - especially true in this game.

Value per hours played is through the roof - a single playthrough takes dozens of hours unless you know what you are doing and speedrun.

The learning curve is fine if you have managed to learn games like Guild Wars 2 or Dwarf Fortress - with helpful tooltips everywhere, tips at loading screen and quest pointers on world map.

The game haves ""one more turn"" feeling familiar to Civ fans when you can't put your planned next moves out of your head and yearn to return.

Karma is a thing - the game mirrors your behaviour and throws more or less good/bad events accordingly. Keeping to middle path is safest so you don't aggro righteous or demonic cultivators by being extremely bad or good but nothing stops you from becoming super-hero/villain - if you can handle the consequences.

- Gameplay, images, game content do quite well, overall into a game worth playing. The first time I clicked on the NPC, I realized that the characters also went through countless events like a real player, how strange encounters are, how are friends and brothers, how is the master ... vivid Like a real player.
- The game's interactivity is very high, many situations arise, many new things to discover at each stage of cultivation.
- The replay value is high with increasingly challenging difficulty, both difficult and stressful, so even though you are familiar with the game, you still have to find ways to optimize the power more and more perfect, more standard.
Cons:
- The game is not the right genre for those who have never known what a cultivation, martial art is, even dev himself did not think that the game would be so well received by the community outside the mainland.
- Looking at the number of hours of play, you will understand that the game is extremely heavy on the plowing factor, at the first time I played it for more than 80 hours to explore almost the entire game at the initial play, while playing and learning while learning and costing a lot. mistake. The next times are faster but still have to plow a lot to farm materials to level up, learn secret secrets, forge exercises...
- The element of repetition is just as frequent as plowing, every time you break through to a higher realm, you will have to repeat quite a lot of familiar things just elsewhere, of course. It cannot be completely similar, but will add a little bit of spices to make it a little different, the same old bottle of old wine as a little bait. In general, the game just revolves around you going to farm enough ingredients to prepare for a breakthrough and find stronger methods and better stats.
- The game depends a lot on the Save Load trick, because the game only has 1 save slot that saves itself every month and generates a lot of other factors of chance, so you have to Quit the game or return to the menu quite often. to improve dignity, evade death and fear when the game deletes the save because of death.",1693278547,1693278547,True,4,0,0.566112160682678223,0,True,False,False

Chinese players buy this game to add mod to play, the game itself is a bit boring. 
There are different skill sets in this game, so if you're tired of playing it, it's possible that you have the wrong skill set. 
This game is a bit like Diablo 2 in that it takes a long time to repeat the brush.
I don't really like to do the main quests, I like to play freely, unless the main quests are stuck and you can't get to the next zone I'll go and finish the quests.
This game manufacturer is the first game based on Chinese mythology and martial arts novel culture, according to the Chinese players said that only a very small part of the recovery of the novel and Chinese culture.
I don't speak English very well, so I'll use a translator to write as much as I can understand. 
I hope it can help players who don't know Chinese. 
The game is good, but the person who developed the game did not do what he promised the player at the beginning and tried to tease the player with a word game in the middle of the game.

  I thoroughly enjoy Tale of Immortal. The mixed review is due to a small issue that is easily resolved by deleting the version.ini from the main game folder after the game is downloaded. Just right click the game in steam and select browse local files. You'll see the culprit in there. Aside from deleting a file to get the game to launch I have had no issues with the game in any regard. So far it has been fun to play, I love the games art style and aesthetic, and the design is nice. Combat is fun and it feels rewarding once you understand the mechanics and how to put together various character builds. If you like to focus on the character building aspects of a sandbox game this game has a lot to offer and has enough content to keep you occupied for some time. 

    For us English players you can find a ton of help on just about any aspect of the game, from simple tips, to in depth game mechanics, destiny breakdowns, skill mechanics, number crunches, builds, walkthroughs, guides, and the things that didn't translate well or may be confusing by checking out an awesome Youtuber named JoJi.

But there are a obscene amount of RNG layers that even using cheats tires you out. The biggest dealbreaker for me in not recommending this otherwise great game is how skills work. First you need to RNG a skill manual which suits you. Then you need to spend a lot of time farming resources to upgrade said skill, even with cheats this takes time, literally, as you upgrade the skills in sequences. Once upgraded, you need to save and reload while you comprehend it for RNG affixes multiple times... And that´s ONE skill out of 12, which you´ll replace at least 5 times during your game. On every region you´ll do this ritual of rng boredom and waiting or reloading saves until you have your skills ready, then do the fun part of the game... then repeat.

1，优秀的MOD或者创意工坊支持，没有MOD真的玩不下去，尤其是创意工坊订阅的前几名。
2，人物的互动及反馈机制，再配合上MOD，真的绝。
3，国产修仙题材，因为这种体量的比较少。
但是鬼谷八荒的缺点过于明显，接下来就要开骂了：
1，重复僵硬的游戏机制。每个境界的游戏过程都是打怪并收集素材，修炼并突破瓶颈。练气如此，筑基如此，金丹如此，元婴和羽化也是如此，而且炼妖壶和器灵系统的升级机制也大同小异。
2，游戏内容重复严重，连换皮怪都没有。低级时打低级小龙虾，高级时打高级小龙虾。登仙境界打混沌开天小龙虾？做梦吧，还是你登仙大能在新手村遇见的小龙虾，只是等级高了点。
3，这游戏刷怪就是个固定的流水线。每次打完都是掉一大堆合成素材，没有其他东西（比如法宝或者秘籍），而且每个区域都固定那几样材料，最恶心的是合成的物品在同境界下连词条都大差不差。
4，冗杂的随机事件。这个游戏的一大乐趣就是每次开局后的随机探图，但是每次探图都会莫名跳出一大堆与探图无关的奇遇，有的还会要求你东跑一下西跑一下，给的奖励又经常不是主修，非常的干扰体验及浪费时间。
5，等级要求断层式提高的任务系统。就拿主线的前期九足乌任务举例，横贯从练气期到结晶期三个大境界的战斗，但是该主线又非常的短，是一场战斗要求一个大境界的实力，很没有带入感。后面也有这种问题，比如药宗的任务。
6，意义不明的技能参悟以及法宝精炼系统。这两个系统都是用来洗词条的。但是同境界下，词条洗完后基本每次都差别不大，根本搞不清为啥要洗，不如花时间打材料提升境界。
7，多余的技能修炼系统。技能修炼不仅花材料、费时间还无聊，不如直接战斗来的好。
8，法宝的耐久度问题。满耐久度的法宝一般2-3场战斗就要修理，而修理材料则需要7-8场战斗才能获得，并且法宝在场上也起不到决定性作用。感觉如果不打MOD或者用修改器，法宝几乎是个废品。
总结下，虽然鬼谷八荒本体有这么多问题（有时甚至玩不下去），但这些基本上都可以用创意工坊的MOD来解决，并且MOD对于原有的人物关系及其他内容进行了有趣的扩展。鬼谷八荒本体+MOD是非常好玩的。

I gave it a chance and found myself immediately and strongly addicted to the gameplay loop and variety of game systems. I decided not to read any type of guide and to just muddle my way through, and it was a joy to discover and be surprised by the sheer array of predicaments, encounters, and events that your character will be subjected to. 

The ability to form relationships with NPCs is very meaningful in this game, and you will constantly be doing things and being brought along to things by your friends and masters. Your sworn enemies will also go out of their way to hurt you if they can, and sects will work together to harass you if they deem you enough of a threat.

This game has surprised me and given me more 'oh sh*t' moments that any AAA title that has come out in the past few years. This game also passes my 'do I need a guide or not' test to determine if it is worth putting time into, and I'm pleased to report that you do not need a guide to figure out how the game works, despite the translation being iffy at times.

There is a pokemon/send monsters to gather sort of element in the game also, which turned out to be incredibly powerful and useful. You can capture basically any boss type creature and then use it as a team mate in combat for a burst of damage or buffs.  Your stable of monsters you aren't using can be sent off to gather very important progression materials, which is practically mandatory to progress at a decent pace.

It's not without it's tedious elements, however. I felt sort of coerced into a single element playstyle since raising stats for multiple things at once is prohibitively grindy and does not synergize very well. The variety of skills you can equip at once and use in combat are initially very limited and quite boring. It is at its core a grinding game, and you will be doing fairly repetitive combat or gathering tasks in order to marginally yet steadily increase your power, which is both good and bad. There is no gear to find that will substantially change your power level, instead your power comes from what cultivation level you are on and how the skills you have deliberately cultivated work together. 

The one enormous flaw is in my opinion the lack of quick sell/sort/store for items above a certain rarity. There is a lot of clicking going on to empty an inventory, and the game really bombards you with tons of materials you won't realistically ever use.

(1) [b]Exit[/b] steam.
(2) Rename the game's folder from ""[b]鬼谷八荒[/b]"" to something in English, say, ""[b]Tale of Immortal[/b]""
(3) Using [b]Notepad[/b], open the ""[b]appmanifest_1468810[/b]"" file under ""[b]steamapps[/b]"" folder, change [b]""installdir""		""鬼谷八荒""[/b] to [b]""installdir""		""Tale of Immortal""[/b] and save the file.

Despite saying on the store page that it's in English, in the full version of the game it still shows English (alpha). This means that some parts of the events were never translated, others are simply misleading due to language miscommunication, and some sport the finest Engrish known to man.

For people who would prefer great story immersion, it may be a disadvantage.

Besides that, there are a lot of UI problems, with screens more hindering than helping the player to understand who the enemy or ally is, or what position the person has in the world. Not to mention esoteric character traits and tendencies.

If you can ignore that Tale of Immortal is a one-of-a-kind story in a Chinese-like setting, complete with cultivation, quests, artifacts, pills, and suicidal a-holes who you can't kill because their daddy is a big shot.",1689613552,1689613552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat is super fun and engaging as difficulty increases from area to area, fair amount of enemy variety, NPC's and their personalities are great but the interactions system really needs to be expanded upon and refined in order to reach true greatness.

MORE factions!

For those looking for a quick summary, I would rate Tale of Immortal 7/10, which translates to a positive review on Steam.

Here are the advantages of the game that would convince you to give it a try:
- Finally a game based on cultivation that is good (bien mieux que Immortal Taoist - idle game)
- The story is quite interesting, and you genuinely feel a sense of progress (you will and up skipping everything at the end because it's a bit boring though), especially in the last three levels.
- You might get addicted for a few days trying to reach the Transcendent level, as the sense of reward is immense when you advance. There's always something to do, whether it's gaining reputation, increasing cultivation, or gathering materials and skills. Don't forget to learn Mind skills; they are crucial for survival.
- Character customization is well thought out, except for the destinies. Although they can be rerolled infinitely, I spent 15 minutes rerolling to finally obtain the three destinies I wanted.

The drawbacks of the game:

- The game isn't fully translated, and not being able to understand Chinese detracts from the overall gaming experience.
- The game heavily relies on mods to enhance the gameplay. I particularly enjoyed the ""Training in Qi Gathering"" mod. However, the issue arises as most mods are in Chinese and lack proper translation or instructions in English.
- There is a lack of balance in the game. The available paths to choose are a bit biased,  blade, sword, and fire, are clearly the most powerful, while the others are significantly less.
- I just lost my save file at the end of the game :,)

B) This game is very addicting... once you get through a bad run or two. This game is ""Learn by Doing"" because the tool-tips will not help you nearly enough; probably because it hasnt been fully translated yet. The team is consistently updating the game, so maybe that will change. But out of the gate you will have to just try things and end up wasting resources, missing opportunities, or getting in over your head in certain events. 
Once you do get more of a grip on the various elements, your subsequent runs will get better and easier to deal with.
Also protip; try your best to not anger literally any cultivators while your in like the first 3 realms of cultivation. Otherwise They'll pile up on you, their friends will pile up on you, and their family will pile up on you; resulting in a monthly dogpile you'll have to endure.

You need to delete version.dll from your game files (or just change its name) for the game to launch. However, in doing so, most mods, if not all, won't work. This has been a problem since EA and the devs are just adamant of not fixing it. Pairing this with the mod controversy that happened, I can only theorise that they just really don't want player to play with mods, but only put it in because it was in their original promise pitch.
If you want mods to work, then you have to do a bit more stuff, which includes changing some of your computer settings and straight up opening a file on notepad and editing it.

Now, with that out of the way let's get to the game itself

1. Character creation
Character is kind of asinine. If you want to have a good start, you need to reroll you fates, or ""traits"" if you will. These traits determine what kind of character you will be. There is a trap however, which is most of them are useless. The only stat that is remotely meaningful is luck and maybe insight. However, luck (funnily enough) is one of the rarest stat to get from a trait. Only a few of them gives you luck, and fewer still give them in substantial amount. 
If you're looking to build the best character you can, you'll need to reroll your traits multiple times, which can sometimes take hours if you're looking for a specific combination of traits

2. Gameplay
This game has the rare quality of always having stuff to do. Farm artifact spirit, farm gifts, farm upgrade materials, farm sect currency, farm ascension materials, etc. As you can see, there's a lot of farming to do, which means a lot of grind. And just like the character creation, it's very RNG heavy whether you'll have an easy time or hard time.
For example, certain ascension material can be dropped from bosses. These bosses can spawn in certain hostile biomes, and I put emphasis on CAN here as it's random whether they show up or not. You can go several in-game months and they can just not spawn. And it's not like they are on a rotation either. If they don't spawn, you have to farm fodders after fodders for them to drop pieces of the material you need.
There's so many more layers of RNG in this game, but I don't have the time to go through it all.

3. NPC interaction
Basically alright. Nothing amazing but nothing terrible either. One caveat is that the names will tend to blend together as the names are translated in pinyin. So you'll have different characters with roughly/exactly the same name. And if one of them is mentioned in a dialogue, you can't check which one it is.

4. Can't have any gay relationship
I don't usually harp on things like this, but I might as well out of spite. You can't have any gay relationship. No man-man or woman-woman. Can't dual cultivate, can't invite on a date, can't marry.
I'm mentioning this for 2 reason. First, they forced me to edit the game files in order to play a game I paid for. Second is their mod terms of service which says (paraphrasing here) ""Not go against morals or values of China/CCP"".

5. Story
This is probably the best part of the game. The game is separated into 2 parts, the main and side stories. I haven't finished the main story, but so far, it's pretty mediocre. It's the side stories that brings the game up. They are well-written and can be very emotional at times. Only problem is that they are very short and you can't really revisit the characters after they end.

Final thoughts
As you might have noticed, I left the combat to one side, and that's because it's serviceable. It's dumbed-down version of a bullet hell in which it's more expedient to tank most of the projectiles because your hitbox is just too big for the amount of projectiles there are, especially late game.
Leaving the file editing fiasco aside, the game is alright. Highly addicting in the fact that there's always something to do, something to farm for your progression, it is also highly frustrating at times. 

I'm leaving a ""Not recommend"" largely due to having to edit the game files. Requiring the player to do something like that for a game they paid for is unacceptable, and the fact that it's a problem that isn't fixed yet is just a deep insult to its player base.",1641850095,1688403399,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the time of reviewing the game, I am on my 2nd playthrough with ~30hrs and the realm of Enlightened (8/10). I felt that I moved thru the realms decently fast but still grinded for the highest Heaven advancement method. I was able to fight the next realm early/mid stages with the constant best advancement methods and decent upgrading of skills. But i find the ever-increasing grind getting to me. I have played POE and D4 and am decently ok with grind. There are several types of monsters and bosses that are scaled for higher realms and i find the grind too similar to lower realms. 

I have since taken a break and am trying to get my ingame spouse to advance in realms to extend their lifespans. NPCs with different personality tags act differently and i am scared that my spouse would take their time, running out of lifespan with the ""carefree"" tag as she is less likely to seek breakthrough compared to one with ""power hungry"" tag. 
Getting attacked by an NPC with higher power levels is something out of the Xianxia novels like Renegade Immortal and I shall seal the Heavens. I try to store all the important items in the tree vault to lower NPCs chances of attacking me as I savescum it. 

One bug i encountered was that I couldn't launch the game a year ago and gave up. Recently, I followed the instructions here https://steamcommunity.com/app/1468810/discussions/0/6278597937774610474/ to launch it.",1688191493,1688191493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the best way to approach this game is to be a patient and casual player, long hours of grinding for items can be a bit of the downside. However the world that this game has built up is very fascinating, so much to explore, so many battle styles, really no rush if you want to enjoy the game.
Becoming a noob, ascending higher is very difficult, achieveable only for those who persevere, that is the reality of life, and even in game... so you would think it is impossible to beat some bosses sometimes, more even ascend to be a God

The pros,Devs actually update their game, it is more stable that 99% of new AAA games. (Given that this statement aged like milk,I will now go fetch my clown hat and makeup.)

edit: modding is not done via steam workshop but some shady AF third party tool.

edit 2: dev caved on delivering the promised steam workshop ONLY AFTER community outrage. They do shady shit then backpedal only when it hurts their bottom line, AVOID THEM.

edit 3: Dev broke the game months ago and it is a fix as simple as deleting a single file yet you have to do it yourself as they cannot be bothered to do it.

Edit 4: It has been MONTHS of people reporting the failure to launch bug that is solved by simply deleting a file from the game directory, the devs have still not fixed this.

Edit 5:With the full release of the game, it STILL will not launch unless you go and manually delete a file.

The cons, oh boy here we go.

It is pure tedium with grind built in for the sake of grinding, layers upon layers of rng timewasting garbage, gating progression by turning 30 minutes of actual content into a stretched out 6+ hour affair you need to do over and over for minimal gains.

Need to replace your skills every time you progress in realms which is a compounded rng shitfest, need to get lucky and find the skill you want with the right stats then grind rng materials to upgrade it, then grind a different set of materials to upgrade the stats which are again rng and can downgrade if you do not have enough insight to roll back.

High rank skills take FAR too long to level up through regular gameplay to the point it might aswell not even gain exp in combat.

You can get into a loop of being targeted by enemies you have 0 chance against when a parent(that is 2-3 realms higher than you) of an elder you beat in your sect(this is mandatory if you want to get better skills) targets you over and over at the end of each month, inflicting injuries, negative mood buffs,etc. also you cannot run from this fight since the higher realm is faster than you, so you are forced into unwinnable fights over and over that drop your stats. because an elder in your sect cried to their mother about losing their spot.

You then need to spend 15 actual minutes running around healing/clearing debuffs by which time half the month is gone nearly and oh look at that you get attacked again at the end of it

Your sect will also constantly throw itself into unwinnable fights, losing resources and members,and once again wasting your time.

Devs are obssesed with stuns, some bosses spam them over and over leading to cheap deaths if your stats are not far above theirs, you will also spawn into sect fights and 5 enemies will insta lock onto you before you can even identify your character model and stunlock you for up to 30 seconds.

Ai cultavtiors move at impossible speeds and seem to have a  pinpoint accurate tracking on the player, so they can move and fire abilities in motions you cannot replicate.

Ai cultivators outright move faster than you at the same agility levels.

Devs love spawning massive in both size and damage aoes under the player that if you are not at the edge of will more than likely kill you. So you waste time running around for 30 seconds before you can actually engage in combat.

Upgrade materials are an rng shitfest with lower tier items thrown in for no reason but to waste your time.

Far too few materials drop/spawn in shops 50/300 materials for artifact upgrade every few ingame months (potential hours).

Too many zones to get materials need you to farm materials to access them so you can farm materials.

Month end cycles while cool at first start to waste ALOT of time taking up to 2 minutes in some cases with all the dialogue interruptions. 27 years in game(current and last playthrough) is 324 months which means at minimum 324 minutes wasted.5 hours worth of essentially looking at loading screens, which is unacceptable.

The rng grind appears to be getting worse with each update aswell with material and skill bloat setting in.

Ontop of this the ""difficulty"" levels just add on layers of tedium by essentially boiling down to ""you now grind for 6 hours to do what you did in 2 before"" to deal with absurd stat boosts enemies get, game is not worth it if you value your time.

This feels like a mobile game with the progression blocks just missing a cash shop.

""BuT iT's EaRlY aCcEsS"" yeah,no, none of this is a fixable technical issue this is a core flaw with the game design that the devs will most likely never fix. as per the store page they excuse all the tedious and timewasting garbage with ""Always stick to your heart, dare to fight against difficulties; make choices carefully and grasp your own destiny.""",1641981135,1687078621,False,47,10,0.617778241634368896,0,True,False,True

1468810,108545961,76561198015429475,0,22,12757,0,6753,1697295837,"Before everytyhing else, you have to know that Tale of Immortal has received a lot of negative reviews, mainly from Chinese players for diverse reasons. First, the head of the studio made some comments about the players and how he viewed them as living ATM. Second, the studio wanted to work on a mobile game and a sequel when this game wasn't even finished by using the money from its sales. And third, the studio wanted the players to use a Chinese third party site for hosting the mods that required a chinese phone numbers, wanted the modders to obey the Communist Chinese Party rules and have full control over the mods, meaning to be able to modify them or erase them at will. Take that as you want.

Tale of Immortal (ToI) is a RPG based on wuxia novels and webtoons. Wuxia is a chinese genre where the main character is a cultivator (nothing to do with farming), has fantastic, even godlike powers and interact with other cultivators, in a world filled with mythical beasts and magic. Those stories have most of the time different worlds or realms (=dimension), sometimes even different planets, with higher worlds having more powerful characters. It's not rare for a MC to suddenly leave his family, friends and sect to go to another dimension in order to become more powerful. Which is why those stories can easily reach thousand of chapters; it's an endless race to a more powerful world.

Despite its setting, ToI is surpringly a twin stick shooter with a touch of bullet hell. One would expect a wuxia game to be based on melee combat and to have fights similar to those in Dragon Ball Z but that's not the case here. Unfortunately for me, that's two genres that I don't like but ToI has a lot more to offer.

Indeed, here we have an open world, separated by different regions, unhabited by more than a thousand different NPCs. Each character, and yours too, have different personalities and traits, so you can expect to become friends, partners, husband/wife even but also enemies with some of them. You can befriend them, spar with them, steal from them and even kill them - but be careful of who their relatives are, you might end up angering someone far more powerful than you. The world is filled with towns, sects (some righteous and some demonic) and a lot of random events with different results. There is also crafting, an auction house (very useful to make a lot of money if you happen to have a useless red or orange manual) and randomly generated side missions. I should also add that the more you unlock new regions, the more gameplay options you unlock.

Gameplay-wise, given its twin stick nature, ToI allows the players to use a large variety of different types of attacks, mainly because the animations are the same, the differences coming from the projectiles used. You will also find manuals, randomly generated and with different rarity, and also artifacts to help you in your journey. If at the beginning, the game is quite slow, it will quickly become a fireworks with projectiles flying everywhere. However, the game lacks some mobility options; there is one move skill with a rather long cooldown and no dodge.

Here, even though it's an RPG, how you progress is unique. In wuxia stories, characters evolve by cultivating (=meditating) and having a breakthrough. In ToI, to cultivate, find a spot filled with XP and cultivate there; that's how you gain XP, not by fighting or killing monsters. Breakthrough though are a bit more complicated. First, you'll need to have to do two or three small breakthroughs, then you will have to do a final one to reach a higher realm. That last one will generally require rare items, and the more you progress, the more will be needed. And this is one of the biggest problem of ToI: it is a very grind heavy game. Even if for some final breakthrough, you can choose between three different ones, Earth, Normal and Heaven, Heaven will always give far more stats points but will also require far more difficult items to obtain.

The second problem is the presence of the Heaven Chosens. Technically, as the main character, you are one of them. However, those controlled by the game will always have red/orange skills and a humongous amount of skill points. Those can be obtained through debate or dual cultivation and allows you to equip mind skills. Trying to compete with them can be seen as a lost cause given that they will always have the rarest items at their disposition and if you want to do the same, you will have to grind the game heavily.

One interesting thing about wuxia stories is how the world is separated by different stratas. Each of them are most of the time impervious to one other, at least until the MC find a way to access them. There is a missed opportunity here to have the world of ToI to be the same and to be randomly generated, allowing you to do a fresh start every time but that's not the case. Here, the map is separated by regions, with impassable mountains and an area filled with strong enemies to act as a buffer; unless you have the realm required, you won't be able to beat them. The map is also always the same, although the towns and sects are randomly generated. On the other hand, that linerity allows the game to offer some short stories, always the same, as you progress.

It is also important to note that right now, the translation in English is not complete. I should also add that there are a lot of mods avaible in the workshop: 6608 as I write this review. But only 284 of them are in English. About creating mods, the game offer a menu, fortunately in english, for creating them. Alas, if you want to create complex ones, all the documentation is in chinese, and Excel and Unity will be needed. So it's not like a Elder Scrolls game where you have almost everything needed inside a single exhaustive creation tool. Though, if you absolutely want to play it right now, you can install a Unity mod called Autotranslator, the MelonLoader IL2CPP version to be precise, although it will only give you a flawed machine translation.

To be honest, Tale of Immortal is not bad, albeit extremely grindy. It is also one of the rare wuxia game available on Steam. On the other hand, for some people, it might be hard to trust the studio behind it. So, you could buy it, if that's what you want, you know you won't mind the grind and you know that the developper could do something surprising, yet displeasing in the future.

Before I finish, even though I have 112 hours of playtime, I've never finished the game yet. I've spent most of my time in the first two regions, I think have restarted it two or three times when the game was in early access and right now, I'm still tinkering with some small mods of my own before I want to go further.

NPC are randomized every playthrough and their activities and interaction with you really spice up the role play experience
The game has potential if you look over all the game breaking bugs and an extreme handicap of actually typing anything in game since the engine only takes Chinese letters or something, so you have to take preset names all the time.
And a whole lot of untranslated section, bad grammar is okay but not translated at all or even through machine is kind of a problem

In short, Game is great, but not ready to be launched officially in my opinion. However, I can see the team is working hard to make it right so I advise players to wait until the kinks are ironed out.
I have played this game for a while now and a few things that are super annoying that seem like a grave over site immediately pop out. I will ignore what I've seen other players complain about and try to give some constructive criticism. 
The auction system is so frustratingly aimed against the player it actually made me review this game negatively. I might even stop playing until I see its been fixed. When the player bets, even if you wait till the 1 count, the betting reaches astronomical sums. NPC that didn't bet previously immediately jump on the opportunity to bet against you. Meanwhile when a player skips an auction, there are maximum 2-3 bets at most. If anything it should be skewed in our favour to make us feel happy for a bargain. Either balance it, make it realistic with each NPC having max funds and preferences, or just make sure it doesnt bet more than 10 times. Something! 
The English translation is not complete for the DLC and i get Chinese events that I do not understand. Better turn off the DLC until translated.
The auto movement, when you click to a far distance, often takes you through longer paths. 
Many times I find text overlaying each other, just put a slide on the textbox. I can't see any details on the difficulties screen at all. Strange how that is allowed to happen when its the first thing a new player sees.
Finally the dialogue, ""My sects martial arts is better"" makes no sense to me. I don't know if its a poor designer decision, lack of imagination but feels forced or if I am in the wrong...
I hope someone actually reads this and addresses some of these issues. Especially the first, my blood boils when I remember my last auction. If you do, I would be more than happy to change my review since you would deserve it.

Its a fun game however it has quite alot of grinding aspects in it, if you are fine with the grinding this game would be very enjoyable for you, all in all its fun and although i usually hate grindy games i didn't have a big problem with it in this game.

So yeah, basically upgrades across the board. Give this game a try, you won't regret it!

Good concept, but so far, bad execution.

I love the 修仙 genre and the novels, so I was excited when someone made a game based on this concept.

However, there are lots of issues with the design of the game and general mechanics.  
To start, this game plays like a clicker game... except it's even more tedious than a clicker game. Why? In a clicker game, you just set the game to autoplay itself, and then you come back and do management every now and then. 

This game is an action-based clicker.

This means that you'll be sitting there, doing the same routine, grinding the same enemies for the 1000th time, only to move at snail pace towards your goal. 
Which brings us to the next bad part - the action and the drops. It's an ARPG type like Diablo or Path of Exile where you could have fun not only in theory crafting but also drop grinding... except in the game none of that matters.

Firstly, you have no way to customize your weapon/spells action. Sure, you can add passives to your character, but it doesn't change the ACTION that you perform. For example, in POE you can link a gem to another one to creating something new, like how you unlock a new node in Diablo skill tree and your character plays DIFFERENTLY. Not this game tho. In order to learn anything useful, you need to specialize and specialize early. Sure, you could raise your attribute stats, but those items are hard to find or limited in supply, not to mention expensive. If you spec into fire, you'll likely be using the exact same attack for the next 10 hrs. Sure, the attack may get stronger like you can cast one more fireball from each attack, but there's about it. If you use water, you have to stick with that ONE water spell. Does that sound fun to you?

Then there's the drop. It's frustrating how useless most drops are AND there's no way to reliably grind them except for waiting for shops to refresh. The reason why ARPGs like Diablo and POE have dungeons is so that you can grind for a specific drop reliably, knowing what loot pool each boss/area has. In this game, if you want to grind for level up items, you'd be in that general area on the world map, roaming aimless hoping to find the bosses. No seriously, the bosses will be free roaming in a fairly large area that take about 2~3 months in game time to traverse, and you'll be in that area, searching for them and hoping your search area collides with their path. And not to mention the drop rate for the important items are trash. Does that sound fun to you?

And lastly, it feels extremely underwhelming when playing this game. Remember I said you'd be using the same spell regardless? So turns out you can upgrade the spells, and each spell book is considered a different spell. So... even tho you have been tossing the same 4 fireballs for the last 5 hrs, when you finally find a better version, you'd have to spend all that in-game time AND money to upgrade the same spell. You'd think that the characters would know a thing or two about their powers by now. And the worst part is that in most chinese novels of this genre, the protagonists usually can fuse different spells together or integrate them in ways that makes them stronger than others. But in this game, you'll be doing none of that.

I'm not going to refund the game because I'm interested in seeing what the devs might do. But as of now, this game is not only unpolished, but worse of all, frustrating to play to a point that it's more fun to just read a book instead. Everything feels inconsequential. Sure, leveling up allows you finally get a higher grade spell, but even then it's still just the same spell you've been using. No way to respec, no other spells variations other than the one version you're using. There's no motivation to keep playing the game beyond the first hour.",1613375358,1685127268,True,0,0,0.770431697368621826,6,True,False,True

UPDATE: Don't buy this game. The dev does not respect players at all and has turned into a greedy person. Use DeepL to translate the longer chinese reviews if you want to know more.

By the way, the grind problem is worse than ever.

Look, this is a decent game, but in it's current state I cannot recommend it if:
1. You are new to the cultivation genre
2. An English-only speaker
3. You don't like grinding

Wait for the translation and grind to improve.

Since there are many English reviews praising it, I'll point out some pain points instead. 

1.Grind. Most of the gameplay involves you walking around the map to reveal locations like cities, sects, dungeons and other areas, while running into mini events or sidequests while doing so. However, the main gameplay loop is to grind for materials in said dungeons and some dangerous areas to rank up. This becomes either very boring or addictive, sometimes both. One issue pointed out by the CN community is that the devs keep making ranking up to a higher level copy and paste with the previous, just modifying the rank up item names, which makes the grind even more boring.  Most importantly, 80% of the game is basically combat, shooting the same little monsters and big monsters with higher stats over and over again, so you might want to take that into consideration. Of course, sometimes it's addicting because you get to see numbers go up (eg: stats increasing from rank up, sect contribution increasing)

2. Little story: I know it's early access, but it's worth noting that there are only around three sidequests for each map region, and each map region takes around 10+ hours to finish. The sidequests are interesting, but still feels too little for each region.
As for the main quest, the main quest mainly involves you just ranking up which leads to you discovering characters based on Chinese mythology and helping them carry out their legend. Honestly it's pretty nice, but there is a large gap between reading story content as you often need to grind and rank up before triggering the next story event. However, there are nice item descriptions that you can read based on Chinese mythology, which are plagued with the next issue:

3. Poor translation. As a game in the cultivation genre, it is expected that many things are hard to translate and still have the same meaning in Chinese, like sect names that are actually generated based on the elements/weapon skills they focus on, many of the treasures' names and many item and event descriptions that are full of poetic and written flavor.  However, many of the easier-to-translate parts are also translated poorly, leading to loss of flavor and humor in the game.

Most importantly, translations for skills and gameplay are strange and sometimes leads to confusion, especially when the game does not have a very clear tutorial on what to do in the game on many subjects. Another glaring example is that dual cultivation is translated as ""training together"". This leads to people being confused at why you can only ""train together"" with the opposite gender, and why people who dislike you get very insulted and try to kill you when you suggest it to them.

Additionally, dialogue translation is weird. A person who just met you might say ""When I saw you I got shivers....your noble bearing, the glint in your eye, your broad chest, your magestic presence...I can't wait to get to know you better"" which really gives a different meaning from the original, which was just complementing you in the polite cultivator way.

Last but not least,, simple translations in events that are meant to be hilarious like the [spoiler] sidequest with the ice girl that cannot control her powers, she wishes for you to help her stop freezing everything she comes across to death. If you say you can help her, one option available is to(effectively) say ""Hey brat, why don't you just run back to the freezing north where you belong?"" that is basically an insult that contrasts with the other two options that are worded in a polite way. The translation used in-game is ""Young lass, why not just return to the Northern a=Arctics?"". Hearing this, the girl gets angry and puffs up her little face, throws you into an unwinnable battle with her before her father appears from the sky to take her back home. [/spoiler]

As I play in Chinese, I got most of this from seeing people be confused at the text and sending in screenshots of the game for help. I played it in English for a little while to see the issues myself.

When the translation and the game improves, I will change the review.

Feels like you are in a Wuxia/LitRPG novel, you go through the stages and become increasingly powerful with quite a range of different abilities and facing many types of enemies.  Each stage feels like a huge powerup and as you get to the higher realms it becomes even moreso though it becomes even more complicated to get there.

Hold left mouse button, while good stats. That's it.

The majority of the progression in the game is in the ""real time"" screen of running around shooting at things. But since there's no easy way to regen mana, and its cooldown is tied with health potions... there's no point using anything other than the basic attack for most scenarios.

The skills used by the enemies also seem to be pretty badly balanced, from ""easy to dodge"" to ""impossible"" all over the place. Meaning, there's actually very little mechanical skill involved. More RNG from skill books, and the stats that you grind.

The ""difficulty curve"" is also incredibly wobbly. From ""you one shot every single thing"" to 2 steps away from there ""you caress the enemy that looks exactly the same with a feather touch, while they one shot you"". Not even a re-skin, or different colour hat, but same exact look.

Somewhat grindy if you want to ""complete all the things"", and not many of them make any sense to actually do (artifacts, sect management, any of the life skills...). Since the power, or use you get out of them is negligible at best, while consuming a lot of time. What really cements this is that ""resurrection"" pills, and artifact upgrades are only available after you no longer need them, or can make use of them.

The artifact spirit gatcha is also incredibly annoying, with the environment being busted unbalanced. I had the enemies tickling me for 6hp if they even managed to hit me. I had like 30,000 hp, and was healing hundreds from some life orbs that I took as a destiny. And then the environment near oneshotting me any time I misstepped. This is so brokenly unbalanced, I have no clue how blind someone has to be to not see it. And you have to grind this for hours to randomly hope you get the spirit upgraded that you want?? The hell.

On another topic: some pet hates:
Difficulty locked until you've played the game, and higher difficulties = no saving eks dee hyuk hyuk

Final gripe:
The sect monthly report is UNREADABLE, and even incorrect if you pain yourself to actually try to figure out what the hell it says.

Overall:
Sub par ""adventure"" ""rpg"" / RNG grind

Still, that might be enough.



Revision:
After abandoning my first run (yes, hours of a ""story"" game dumped, because of a necessary ""insight"" stat which can only be changed in the character screen, who would have guessed it from this game, sarcastic eye roll), and started a new game on a higher difficulty, I've come to realise something:

This game is actually feels more Witcher-themed than some of the Witcher games.

Think about it.

Strange mystical/folklore things abound.
You're some superpowered freak, that's always scrounging for cash. 
You're constantly picking up monster scraps, and selling them for a bounty. 
As well as looking to pick up bounties for monsters that you're already going to kill.
You're always nailing hot chicks (dual cultivation), and none of them get pregnant.
People say they swear they saw you die, yet you're somehow alive.

Revision Revision:
I think this has become one of me new favourite ""games to hate"". The design is so awful in so many places, it's a good showcase of what not to do.

That said, it's still actually playable, because you can get around the game's own design, and ignore most of the content.


EDIT:
Came back to the game after a year or so of it breaking, and not wanting to launch. 
Still doesn't want to launch

And now in a bit of detail (maybe some spoilers ahead?):
Character creation is majestic, I enjoyed creating truest beauty of them all (at least an hour went into that).
After I've spent hours looking for (and chasing) handsome lads. NPCs can be hella rude if your reputation is wack and your visual qualities are not up to standart, so be prepared. 
Following my wild lad chase I did some strolling around. Map is quite big and fun to explore, if you want to feel powerless and spill some of your own blood - go into higher level zones before reaching following cultivation stages. 
Joining the sect and dominating my fellow brothers and sisters took some time, but big moneys and discounts in shop are def worth it.
Overall there's lots of things to do, but eventually it all leads back to cultivation leveling - the grindiest process of them all. 
At some point you notice that you are repeating same things at one location, then at another all over again and again. You want to stop but you somehow can't stop, YOU NEED TO BREAK THROUGH to another level of cultivation stage.
I must say I do not like grindy games, but this one held me hostage and didn't let go. 
I think I even enjoyed myself?
This game introduces you to all of the mechanics quite well, I wasn't confused or in search of info at any point, which is great. 
WuXia setting is breathtaking and I simply adore it, art is beautiful and UI doesn't feel imposing.
Music is quite nice and helps to adjust the mood, but it does get tiresome after 100+ hours, so searching for chinese lo-fi or ancient chinese playlists is a must in my book.

At current state: some things are still not fully translated from chinese to english, solvable via camera translator.
Iirc at one point after update game stopped launching, deleting version.dll helped, my saves were not damaged.
I do not use mods so can't tell if there's any issues concerning that.
The game is not finished and requires some polishing, so if you want a perfect experience of endless grind - wait till full release when everything is polished and all mechanics implemented.

P.S. If you want to have massive pain in the ass from this game, make a lot of NPCs hate you, you'd feel hunted down like never before.

Story is simple with few surprise quests along the way, personally I hope there will be much more story branches in each stage though. The game replayability will significantly boosted if player could experience different story on each run in  addition to try different builds.

This is a sandbox game with Chinese Xianxia settings, highly recommended if you are a fan of the genre, if you don't know anything about Xianxia though then I'd recommend reading Xianxia web novels first before playing this game otherwise you won't understand much. There isn't really a story as this is a sandbox game, the main quests are based on ancient Chinese mythology and they are mostly just there for flavor. Gameplay is decent and would be better as the game is still in early access, combat is fun and build diversity is great though some builds are clearly stronger than others. One thing I dislike is that you are rewarded more for being righteous, it doesn't matter too much if you want to be a villain but being righteous is way easier.

PROS：国人最爱的题材

之前买了steam上另外两个修仙游戏，都是因为玩法单一缺乏内涵而浅尝辄止。鬼谷八荒我是在朋友大力推荐下买的，一开始确实非常上头，作者很会抓人痒处这里要表扬，我光建人物刷天赋就花了一个多小时。。。

后面玩到要结晶的时候实在肝不动了用了修改器，antifun了，没意思了。

感觉游戏开发者应该玩过不少国产页游，至少城镇和门派的UI太像了游族的大侠传。别的不多啰嗦，作为辐射系列的深度玩家，我觉得整个世界里1000+NPC互相之间有随着时间推移不断变换的爱恨情仇非常棒，但是他们的存在对于游戏过程本身没什么影响，这一点很遗憾。

其实单人开发的游戏，能做到这个程度已经很不容易，而且作者一直在添加新内容 没有靠蹭热点坑一波情怀就跑路，只这一点就强过99%的独立游戏开发者了。

不过还是不推荐，单纯个人不欣赏。

The game is a sandbox, which contains several different stories spread across the game which you unlock as you level up your cultivator. These stories are also tied to your character's progression as your character has to complete some of them in order to unlock certain regions of the map you'd have to advance to. 

All of the regions on the world map are split according to cultivation levels, with 2 levels consisting 1 regions, so you have 5 regions in total + Tian Yuan mountain, the endgame content. 

Combat is based on 4 action moves plus 8 passives. These action moves are: basic attack manuals - spammable, special attack manuals - 10-15s cooldown higher damage moves, motion manuals - mobility, and ultimate manuals - 60s cooldown high damage conditional activation. The 8 passives are manuals relating to boosting one of the 8 key player stats: focus, energy, vitality, defense, attack, martial resistance, spiritual resistance, and crit. 
There's also 12 damage types in the game, 6 spiritual, 6 martial. You are never limited to only one manual to use, so you can customize your character to be built to your liking depending on whether you're fighting other cultivators or waves of monsters. 

The world of the game is alive, with NPCs that are also trying to get stronger, forming bonds with each other, fighting against each other, killing off their enemies etc.

The game continues to move forward, with regular and relevant updates.
We are getting closer to a really great game in this niche area of ""cultivation"" games.
If the modding part keeps all its promises, then the community will be able to add the few elements that are still missing to have THE Xianxia game of the decade, for non-Chinese-speaking Western players.

***

Last preview :

A very promising game, in the ""cultivation"" genre, a lot of potential, a team that is progressing on the roadmap... until the recent monumental incident.

The devs had promised a workshop, but in fact they are doing it through a third-party company, not with Steam, and registering requires having a Chinese phone number, providing personal data and the brand of underpants, a very intrusive and scary stuff, completely the opposite of what an ""Amazing Cultivator Simulation"" (another excellent Chinese cultivation game) can do.

And just because it's a Chinese game doesn't mean you have to accept anything. See the other game I quote, to understand that the excuse of government control is particularly bad faith...
So, as it stands, despite the interest I still have in this game, I can't recommend it.

I will modify my assessment if the devs regain their honesty and sincerity, not before.",1650967878,1678432136,True,0,0,0.505379676818847656,0,True,False,True

Cool action combat with a lot of styles to utilize, there are no classes, instead there are different martial arts and taoist magic.

The real downsides of the game for me are the balance and the heavy grind.
The game is still very unbalanced, the gameplay styles are all over the place. There're things really op, others barely usable, and for no reason. But at least in the lower difficulties, everything works.
The grind is a wall that put many people off, but at the same time it's ""immersive"", because this is a cultivation world, the road ahead is harsh, the walls are tall, and the climb is steep. LOL

In a gameplay sense, it reminds me of a mmo rpg, where you'll go through regions farming to get to the new tier and then move to the new region. What makes this journey really interesting though is the social and sect (clan) system.
You can make allies, enemies, friends and family on your adventure, while you participate in clan feud, tournaments and wars.

On a side note, the modding tool of the game is cool and they will improve it. Modding the game is easy (except when you need to code, because all the tutorials are in chinese), but it will becomes better.
Of my total gameplay time, at least half of it was modding.

And remember, the game is still in early access and being updated regularly.

About the bad ratings, check other reviews. It's basically because of bad early access pratices and broken publishing promises.

It's not perfect, and there's one boss fight that is in dire need of changing, but:

I became the True Disciple of a righteous sect and took home a champion's prize. I became a master of lighting in all its forms. I took a wife and gave her a magical tie from the Magpie whom I had gifted a phoenix feather. I helped a giant chase the sun, and a bowman shoot down all suns but the real one. I brought a tao mind counterfeiting group to heel, and climbed the stairway to heaven itself. I walked so far along the path of cultivation that heaven itself tried to tell me to eff off, and failed. I climbed a mountain that was not there, and with a mermaid given human form I brought low a dragon, a person who was blind despite having double pupils, and went to the summit, then to the depths. Oh, and I kicked a chicken god's backside in single combat and learned to summon the golden eggs of heaven as an attack.

Killing someone and getting chased down by their oppressively powerful friend/relative, grindy and repetitive gameplay, cultivation tiers that repeatedly send you on a fetch quest around the continent gathering soul orbs so you can breakthrough to the next rank instead of canonically sitting in a cave for two hundred years, constantly being hounded by cultivators seeking to spar with you every other month.

Most of the issues with game not opening or mods not loading in game is an easy fix that took me a few weeks to figure out. Most of the issues come with the fact that whether you play in English or Chinese affects the games framework. Thus you need to change setting in windows to allow for worldwide language support.

Here is the solution to fix most issues with the game:

Just go to Desktop settings, make sure you have windows 10 at least or you won't see the option. Go to time and language settings on windows and then go into language settings. Once you're there click on administrative language settings in the top right corner and change local region setting. Once there enable Unicode UTF-8 at the bottom of that window to allow for worldwide language support.

That's what fixed the game not loading mods for me. It also fixes the game so you don't have to remove version.dll file or replace melonloader to get the game to load in the first place.

[*]Fairly unique sandbox RPG with a moderate learning curve.
[*]You don't need to know about ""Cultivation"" to get into it.
[*]Game elements are well explained.
[*]Lots of RNG elements but the player has high control of their success.
[*]Good customization in character editor and progression.
[*]You can affect NPCs in many ways including making allies/rivals or destroying them.
[*]Item gifting system lets you directly affect an NPC's progression.
[*]Relationship systems and ""natural"" interaction between NPCs.
[*]NPCs progress with time like you do, but there's not much rush/hassle to drag you down.
[*]Surprisingly ""living"" world with competing groups that you can join yourself.
[*]Somewhat minimal yet refined action combat that's easy to learn and master.
[*]Many interesting activities to help advance your character.
[*]High replayability. Multiple difficulties that are unlocked and playstyles to build for.

[*]I am not personally concerned with modding, nearly all negative reviews are about how it's on a scummy site instead of Steam Workshop but there seems to be good news now about the dev's plans. I think the game is highly enjoyable for many hours without modding but would still benefit from it.

EDIT: They added proper Steam workshop so that's good too now.

1468810,130588632,76561198441339812,0,1,5346,0,4827,1678832519,"Okay, to make things short, here a small summary of whats good or bad.

Bad:
There are few things, as for example the strange happenings around mod support in the past, but those are besides the point when grading the Quality of the Game.

As of now it is possible to achieve all Realms of the Game and go from Qi-Refinement to Transcendend (If you don't know what I mean, note that this here is a Xianxia Game based on Chinese Mythology, which may impact your buying descision)

These act as levels of sorts and are the main way to progress the game, increase your lifespan - upon whichs end you would probably suffer perma death, though never is there any time where you get even close to that - and stats overall.

Unfortunatly for such a core part of the game, especially achieving the first several realms (Below Soul Formation) are very repetative and are way to dependend on chance of neccessary material spawning. That means, that for the first half of your gamethrough you are going to frequently repeat the essentialy same steps over and over again to advance, which greatly reduces replayability. Especially when compared to 'Immortal way of Life' they are very lackluster.

Hopefully there will be some kind of rework but its unlikely.

This does get better later , but it never quite reaches the level at which it would be enjoyable to play only for their sake.

Another negative is the grind and yes there is quite the bit. In the game you can use 6 Weapon types (Only impacts types of skills) 6 Elements and 6 Professions and each and every one of these things has their own stat, which can only be increased over more or less rare consumables. (As far as I know) If you only focus on one or two stats in weapon and element thats still alright, but of the other stats basically everyone of the six is neccessary, especially on higher difficulties.

This means that apart from leveling yourself you must allways also level these skills, which when compared with the player realm has no variation at all over the entire game.

Minigames: There is one for learning new skills and alchemy but thats more or less it and they aren't that great either. Overalls this game suffers somewhat from this lack since because of this most if not all encounters result in either fetch quests or fighting.

Version.dll      Don't know why, but you have to delet this file in order to start this game. This was not the case in the past but persists as a bug for moths now.

Good:

If you want to play this game then know that you won't be playing for the aformeantioned realms as in 'Immortal Way of Life'. You are playing for the little stories you encounter (Weak main story since its just: Meet old man -> say to find him) They make up the core of  the appeal and nothing else.

The fighting system is enjoyable over the whole course of the game and never gets annoying though its frequenzy might.

Another plus is the great variety of styles that one can use. As meantioned before there are 12 stats dedicated for the skills one may learn, which allows a great variety of (fighting) styles. Don't be fooled though when it say its creating 20.000 skills or so. They are just names for recouring types of skills.

Conclusion: (For those which dislike long and draggy sentences)

- Leveling in the earlier stages and somewhat after
- Lack of variety it minigames and the like (Consequently repetition)
- Unfixed bug rendering the game unplayable if not delted in files
- Quite the bit of grind
- increasing soe stats especially the six occupations is a pain in the ass and dependend of luck

+++ small stories based on mythology
+ fighting system not increadible but still quit good
+ great skill variety increasing replayablity if you just cheat a little with the annoing rest (But don't over do it)

Over all quit good and well worth the money for those who might enjoy this type of game and overlock some downsides as well as for all Xianxia fans though the lack of impact, lifespan has on the game buggs me a little as always.

But for those who can't, it not for you, not at all.

Review: This game is great. A bit of a grind but you usually wont notice the grind. Large map, really feels like a continent, I have only explored up to the Hundred Thousand Hills area, but It has taken me 10+ years to get there. So dont expect to really speed through the game and get to the highest tier of cultivation. Tons of interesting and exciting events and story to play through.
The only thing I wish to really see going forward is more NPC - PC interaction. I want more variety in dialogue and events. More in depth dialogue.  I want NPCs to really feel like people. What makes cultivation stories really interesting to me is the interactions between friends and enemies. I just want to see a more fleshed out system.

2) less loading screens in some form

3) Some form of action with which we can ask friends/family/sect members to team up against someone

As of writing this review, I have finished 5 saves, up to Nightmare difficulty, which I found to be hard enough for me to keep me challenged, and I don't think I will try the other two higher difficulties, as I would probably be more frustrated, than entertained. 

I love how many possible playstyles there are, my 5 saves so far were Wood, Blade, Lightning, Fire and Sword. Each playstyle felt different, and choosing Destinies after ascending a realm always enhanced some part of each playstyle. 

Crafting Artifacts and making pills have each their own minigame, and I can't wait for the Talismans to be introduced in later patches. I found the artifact system pretty fun, artifact spirits feel worth grinding for, and some of the bonuses from them really enhance the gameplay.

I was also absolutely amazed during my first run, when I saw that over 2000 NPCs got generated, with 55k+ manuals. I thought each playthrough would feel the same, but 5 saves later, I can say that while the main story line is of course the same, just the fact that even sects are randomly generated keeps each save feel pretty fresh.

On my Lightning save I have done the Following Bug series Destiny, with Elder Dragon Aura, which generated a Sect in the beginning area that I became a Sect Leader of, and helped it get into other areas. That save file I will never delete, as it was a really great experience.

All in all, this is the perfect RPG game for me, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",1645117118,1670335763,True,0,0,0.53482586145401001,0,True,False,True

Sigh I just wrote a revision and I lost it all with a misclick .. so I will just summary what I was trying to type ...

I have not played this game for a long time but saw the bad review and looked into it. It seems that the reason is because the dev stubbornly implemented their own ""workshop"" ""创意工坊"" which sounded like steam workshop in their dev plan but was not. So the gamers felt cheat. And to make matter worst, in the face of anger and bad review, the CEO initially was stubborn and unrepentant and sharp in his replies. That just made matter worse. 

Now, not to defend him as other chinese game has implemented steam workshop with little problem, he probably opted for 3rd party ""workshop"" because they can control it better, although steam workshop CAN also allow them to screen and review mods before allowing any upload (that just made the angry gamers angrier when he gave that reason) ... so as to avoid any potential problem and scrutiny from the chinese authority for ""undesirable content"". That is an understandable sentiment in view of the restrictions faced by the industry in recent years.

Anyway, they did capitulate and implement steam workshop and from what I can see, the game, whilei it can still get repetitive in the end game, is still a good simulation game about diety cultivation and offers many branches and powers (although not as much as ""amazing cultivation simulator"") and story progression. The grind can be bad, but then I suppose it does fit the theme of immortal cultivation ...

Overall, I think it is still a good enjoyable game that is more than worth its current price, if it is the genre that you like",1612735486,1669676669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This can basically be summarized by bad Early Access practices but here's the full list of things that I know of.

1:  Not fully testing updates before releasing them or having a separate ""unstable"" build.  This at least once led to the game being completely broken unless you went into the game files and deleted a folder which the devs should have.

2:  Putting in new content on all language versions without translating them first.  I've been basically playing the game while trying to avoid certain new additions to it because I don't read Chinese and don't want to complete those missions and not be able to understand what I just did.  This is easier said than done.  

3:  The whole Korean localization debacle.  My understanding of this is that basically what they did was to decide that they were going to outsource the Korean translations to a local Korean company.  The problem is that they didn't do this through Steam, and now Korean players have to buy the game AGAIN through that Korean company if they want to play it in their language.

All these problems are reflective of what is likely really shitty top level management since they're easy problems to fix.

Solution 1:  Have an unstable version where updates are released first before being pushed over to the main branch.  It's basically like letting Steam do the QA testing for you and for free.

Solution 2:  Create new branches for each supported Language.  Doing this will allow them to push through development of the Chinese version and back burner the other versions until they have time to fool with them.  

Solution 3:  Refund the Korean players on Steam and direct them to the Korean publishing site.  Assuming they're going to have DLC after the game is completed, make the first major DLC free in Korean, and that will roughly compensate them for their troubles.  It's not a massive market anyway so it's not like they'll be missing out on a lot of money, and it would be better to retain a good reputation there.",1668036370,1668036370,True,54,0,0.758635580539703369,0,True,False,True

What really harms this game is how unnecessarily grindy and time consuming it can get.

I won't go into much detail but I'll mention what I feel needs to be adjusted.

World bosses: They take too long to spawn again and their drops are often miserable. The nine tails is specially bad as you can kill it 20 times in a row without getting what you need.

Auctions: They should be held more often, they're a good way of making money but most of the time that's about it. RNG can make it so there's no point bidding for a single item.

Skill points: Getting skill points is a really tedious process, specially when every NPCs seem to have always 4 times just as much as you do.

Comprehension: Too grindy and too RNG dependent, this is a SP game, not an mmorpg...

Fruits: Fruits become the reason you end up being forced to join a sect even if you wanted to role-play a rogue cultivator.Bosses do drop them but take too long to spawn, give barely any and their elements are random. You can a few from random world events too... So you just join a sect, grind contribution and buy whatever they may have... But you also have to wait for the sect to refresh their inventory... There are a few more ways but they're all just as problematic.

Heavenly Chosen: They need to be tuned down a little bit... Or maybe not? They have your average OP MC stats... They have stats almost equivalent to two realms above them...

Artisan Systems: need to be more relevant.
Artifacts: need to be more relevant.

Just like any cultivation novel it's grindy but still keeps you addicted to the game.
Anyone intrested in the world of xianxia (Chinese mythology/Cultivation) should definitely play this game.
You are free to play as you like, but actions will have consequeces, for example i killed a guy that killed my ''master'' and as a consequence i was chased by his family (a powerful one never the less), these actions can ruin your runs (ex. in ''Chaos'' difficulty if you die the save is deleted.)
There are alot of content for example Sect wars, Sect competitions, artifacts, spirits, ect..
If you are wondering why the game has so many negative reviews is because of a dramma about the workshop that was not released while promised (but has been solved, since now is available ) 
BUT mods that you want to publish needs to be approved by the chinese gov, you know.. to check that nothing goes against the government etc. You can still play ur mods that are not approved, is just that you cant publish it.
The game is constantly being updated, and its sad that has been bombed by so many negatives reviews even tho it's still in alpha.

IMPORTANT! there is bug that doesn't let you launch the game.
SOLUTION: Find the game file and rename ''version.dll'', DONT delete it if you want to play mods.

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\鬼谷八荒
find ''version.dll' and rename it.
click play and enjoy!

If you browse the game files and delete this one, you can open and play the game normally. This will disable your ability to load mods for the game though so it will be vanilla. At least the game runs this way. 

As for an actual review of the game, I haven't reached the peak of gameplay yet but I am over half way with one of my characters. This probably qualifies me to give a decently educated opinion on the game. I may be biased because of my interest in murim-type stories and games, but I find this game actually enjoyable. It is extremely grindy if you are trying to gain max stats for each breakthrough. The combat with monsters is very repetitive, and fighting someone above your cultivation stage is extremely hard because stat jumps between stages are so big. However, you can basically beat anyone or monster above you if you learn their attacks and don't make any mistakes.. and have about an hour... and a lot of items. The relationship system with npcs doesn't feel very fleshed out. It essentially boils down to if you answer a question wrong or hurt someone they are related to, they start hating you. Once they hate you, they will attack you and if you kill them, their relatives attack you. You better hope they don't have a higher stage relative or you are gonna inevitably get ambushed by them and probably die. Another thing to note is that translations are pretty rough in some areas, especially the new mysterious gourd artifact. If you are alright with really grindy games where you can actually see yourself getting stronger, try it.

Dogshit team, will never buy another game from this company ever again. Game itself is decent but dev team is thoroughly and maliciously incompetent. Would not recommend you buy. Maybe you can borrow it from anonymous friends instead.

Original review below.

Cultivation novel fans rejoice (and wait for an official translation). Personally I'm waiting for the Steam Workshop to come out, the Chinese gentlemen are having a field day over on a certain forum with this game already. I don't recommend this game if you don't like grindy games (there's not that much content right now) and can't read Chinese... though there is a fan translation patch, reportedly, available on the Discord.

Solid game, could use a lot of polish but I suppose that's why it's in Early Access. There's a tremendous amount of pressure in China on game devs from megacorps, and all the cards are stacked against the little guy. Screw Tencent and NetEase, I hope the dev succeeds. (For those not in the know, TX and NE actually pirated the game and sold pirated copies for what's equivalent to 25 cents to the unsuspecting public - they want this game to fail, because they have no standards. Think EA but 10x worse.)",1616046939,1665479507,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,True

Pros
- good leveling system
- difference of power between realm is also believable
- Tons of ways to customized your own character (can combined different elements that suits your play style)
- The incremental of difficulty scale nicely 
- Decisions plays important role in developing your character
- Alof of unique npc and monster based of the Wuixa theme
- Can reach of playtime to 100+ for a single character if want to reach the Pinnacle of the Dao

Cons
- Leaning towards the more grindy games if u want to be strong
- Early travels sucxs 
- Really need to thread carefully as you can be killed anytime if offend the wrong people
- Some elements/arts are weaker or doesnt work properly most of the time
- Items dropped are rng, can lead to frustration if its a hard boss especially at higher difficulty

Overall
Nice game for a Wuxia enthusiast
still early access 
need to wait if developers can reconsider letting people mod again

2. The game itself has been in EA state for more than a year, despite the promised 1 year EA. 

3. The game is sold as fully english, despite that, 100% of the end-game is still in Chinese, even updates from several months ago is still untranslated.

4. Fully reliant on RNG, especially in the hardest difficulty. Destinies, in game, shape your character as you go, but some Destiny at the same rank completely obliterates others, with no method of altering Destiny, you pretty much waste 20+ hours or more just to get trash MC.

5. The game developer said that ToI focuses on relationship and interactions between cultivators. With my over 100+ hours of gameplay, I haven't really feel that, beside some occasional interaction each month.

6. The speed of your cultivation is so far ahead of any other people, including your spouse, disciples, masters, and other sect members. This leads you to move your sect (if leader) to higher area, leaving all sect members etc behind, or else, they will die in the higher area.

7. Because of the countless random affixes on skills (kung fu), there are bound to be bugs and glitch when the effects are combined. This make the game is INFESTED with bugs.

8. Mods exist, but mods with ""ENGLISH"" tag are filled with Chinese mods, which is dumb. Just shows that there are no regulation regarding mods in the game.",1662555751,1662555751,False,27,0,0.723648369312286377,0,True,False,True

It looks simple at first and can be, but it also has a lot of mechanics and possible min-maxing. 80% of the game is now in English (really only endgame is missing translation) and 95%+ of the translations make sense. 

There are 12 total damage types to choose from. My top 3 being Blade (strongest), Fire, and then Sword. That being said all are viable, just the additional skills and min maxing changes depending on which you pick.

On top of the 12 damage types you have Basic skills (~3 variations per type), motion skills (only 1 variation), Special skill (~3 variations per type), and ultimate skill (2 variations per type).

You can ""class up"" by raising your cultivation and breaking through. Giving you increased stats across the board and access to destinies which are unique character modifiers. There are currently 10 realms.

I can continue going into detail, there are a lot more mechanics and opportunities to min-max, but suffice to say the game is surprisingly deep for what it looks like at first glance. You will have subpar builds at first, but again nearly anything is playable. I reached end game, realm X & current final boss, on normal with a super jank character I didn't min max at all. ~ 130k HP and 6k(?) attack. My character on chaos I went hard on the min max and has over 300k hp, 9,994 attack, and is able to literally beat up on gods using blades, a laser beam, and mushrooms I can summon.

If you want a chill game you can pick up and put down from time to time that also has a challenge if you want it to. This is for you.",1660923225,1660923225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

big problems i had
had some problems with running the game witch took me some searching to fix.
comprehending box don`t show me skills its just blank...witch i change to chines and rely on colors to know what i`m doing. then save change back.
and i never been able to progress past foundation 2 because my character died permanently witch is part of playing on harder difficulty. 
had some minor lags when i had sect fights.
the more i play the less i care about npc...the conversation options very limited its hard to know what they want from me as i don`t have the information or easy access to the information asked about like:this guy is good befriend him...and i like who is it?! what can i now about him? if it had given me the option to ask more about the npc i would have felt more connected to him.
and its hard to persist with the build i wanted to go with...opportunities more then non make me change my course of action changing builds and keeping the main build i want on stand by until opportunities show up...
its not bad it just gives you taste like you are weak all the time with the only way to improves is finding something better...its like a rouglike and not a full out rpg as i was expected it to be.",1660715647,1660715647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Overall, I'd recommend it for its price, though there seems to be some unethical decision making going on regarding certain online communities, which is a major cause of the negative reviews.  As an English speaker in the US who doesn't use a lot of or any mods, I haven't run into any major issues with it.  Please note your experience may vary.

Early in the game, the time management mostly takes a back seat.  But as the player progresses, more and more systems are unlocked which require the player to grind for resources and spend dozens of turns meditating/training to raise their stats high enough to proceed.

The various traits or ""destinies"" available when leveling and upon character creation vary from boring +x stat bonuses to incredibly fun like having a heavenly ogre join your battle or being followed by a murderous caterpillar with its own storyline if you choose to follow it.

The combat styles are fairly unique and interesting with a focus on different strengths.  Sword focuses on high burst damage from long range, blade focuses on high sustained damage at close range with life steal to stay alive, fist focuses on blocking attacks and creating shields, water excels at disabling the opponent with area denial, etc.  If you are okay with grinding each combat style stat, you can even mix and match them to create some really unusual and potentially devastating combos.

As far as downsides go, the game can be very overwhelming at first, and some of the UI isn't very informative about what it's hiding.  Tao seed?  Gifting a pagoda gem to someone?  Huh?  You'll have to actively explore every button on the interface to get an idea of what tools the game gives you, because they're sometimes not plainly visible.  The grind is also pretty real in this game, and AI cultivators don't always play fair.  It's not unusual to blunder into a fight with a cultivator who is supposedly the same rank as me but has 200 more skill points and legendary passive skills equipped which give them drastically higher stats than me.  Fortunately, unless you're trying to kill people, the consequence of losing is usually just humiliation, so I don't consider it a huge deal.  I might randomly end up fighting someone else who is weaker next time (there's almost always a next time to everything).",1658230228,1659922794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- decent world seeding and flavor
- it seems that there are some room for theorycrafting and minmaxing in this game

Cons;
Core gameplay of fighting stuff is dull as f. It really stinks, it's not really bullet hell nor aprg, it's a cheap mess that would have felt clunky in the NES era.
There are too much loading screens, my pc is very good and I haven't tryed the game on SSD but there are loading screens everywhere, even if it is 1 or 2s every time, it's still full copium 24/7.
Lots of things happening at once every ""turn"" makes it feel really even slower, and not 4x slower, most of the things happening are meaningless.
Lots of things are unclear at first between menus/items/stats/relationships or a bit too convoluted.
Lots of rng systems that favor players who reload their save, it's like playing the game with an editor except   it's dull af f like everything mentionned above",1658683454,1658683626,False,2,0,0.425863772630691528,0,True,False,True

Feel like a cultivation story in video game format. There are some mechanics and such that I would quibble with, but nothing egregiously unpleasant. 

It would be nice though if there was a clearly shown way to contact support. I got a weird error while playing the game. It started artifacting and shortly afterwards, crashed my computer (BSOD). When I restarted and got back on the game, I saw that it had deleted my file. That was definitely less than pleasant since I had put a lot of time into that one. I have no idea who to talk to that might help or if anything can be done to recover the file. It's fine if not, but it'd be nice to be able to contact someone about it. 

Would say 4/5 given that error I think

DON'T KILL PEOPLE
DON'T KILL PEOPLE
UNLESS THEY'RE FROM 'kill a sect traitor' MISSION, THEN ITS OKAY

Rule number 1 to enjoying this game. There are a lot of 'kill this dude' quests, random people who attack you, random near dead guys who seem to always attack if you help them, etc. You kill a guy, his entire goddamn family will inexplicably instantly know. One of them will be stronger than him. They will never forgive you no matter how many times you spare them. You have to manually buy their forgiveness 1 at a time while under constant attack. Kill the dude who is 1 step above the first guy? Enjoy being attacked by guys 1 step above that. Quite possibly, guys at a level literally not attainable in the game right now. 
Its the single worst aspect of the game, effectively softlocks you unless you get the 1 skill for guaranteed escapes or reload every single month until you don't die and makes the game insanely tedious.
But its entirely avoidable.

With that out of the way, the game feels similar to something like Elona. Very similar gameplay loop. Go to town, get infinitely generated identical quests, do them, use resulting resources to get stronger.

You aim to get
 - Exp: Gained via paying sect or humping blue gas on the map
- Soul stones: Doing quests in town, used for buying stuff in town
- Sect points: Doing quests in sect, used for buying in sect, where you can buy fruits to up your fire, ice or whatever skills

 An annoying aspect is that when you finish the first area and go to the second, your sect makes you an 'honorary member' and stops you doing quests or buying at it. But fruits are more expensive in later ones. It feels entirely arbitrary and like being punished for progressing. It should be EASIER to get these less important items, not 2.5 as expensive. You make more points in later areas, but overall, it feels slower.

 All of this helps with your combat ability. You can't use attacks without enough of its respective skill, like 50 or so blade to summon the avatar ultimate. But not all sects have the fruits you may want. And the option to leave the sect and go to another is hard to see. 

Combat itself is fairly simple. Poorly balanced. Because the skills are poorly balanced. If you don't kill people, its generally pretty fair, but you can really tell the skills aren't remotely balanced. 
You just run around in a square room, hit everything to death, move on. No one takes any hitstun. And your base agility (move speed) is so low and cooldowns on dodges so insanely high that there's no real skill involved. You just have good enough stats and win, or don't and lose. 

Why are the abilities imbalanced? 
There's a few reasons.
Some skills, like blade and fist just give massive bonus like nearly 10% life steal and free shields in every room for having them equipped.
Others lack any such bonus, do less damage and hit less enemies.
One of the dodge skills turns you into wind for 3 seconds, totally invul, sucking enemies in, doing damage and able to act. Most other dodges just make you dash. 
Right mouse buttons tend to be less overly imbalanced.
Ultimates are hard to even comment on. Because unless you get a very specific passive, you can't use them until you do some arbitary task mid-fight. Its a complete no-brainer to get this passive, just really tedious to reset for it, so all this does is limit your options and make ultimates feel really bad unless you do. Imo, those passives should be removed and ultimates should just be castable.

Breakthroughs are where you have to exit the games core loop of do quest>buy stuff. Go fight bosses. Collect a dozen items. Then... very exciting... quit game and reload or close game and reload if it shoots lighting at you. Over and over again. Because when you break through, you get to pick a new ability. But it doesn't just present them all to you. No, it presents about 6. And you pick one of those. And most of them are bad. Incredibly bad. Why would I ever want this garbage, really? Bad.  So you just sit there for potentially hours resetting, settle on a worse character as punishment for not wanting to deal with this tedium or use the chinese trainer like everyone else to just get the trait you want.
When its considered normal to cheat your progression in your game, your progression is seriously messed up. 

Another incredibly tedious aspect is item management. You get too many items. Every area you beat gives you 10+. You have like 12 slots by default. 24 later. Then more later. But for some reason spacial rings, the items used to just carry more stuff, require ranking up a greater layer. I don't get why this is. Or why item limits are so low to begin with. Its tedious. You have near infinite storage in towns, but you can put everything away with a +3 spacial ring, then literally less than 10 mins later be full on items. Its the worst item management I've ever seen. And since you constantly put everything in storage, it becomes very easy to lose track of what you have. Since while you DO forge in town and your storage IS in town, forge won't use items in storage. 

Translation is good. Very good. The best in any chinese game I've played. Its missing some stuff for the recent update, but that's to be expected, its an EA chinese game. But what is there is entirely understandable.

Overall, the game has a lot of flaws. Actually a lot more than I mentioned here. But the core gameplay loop is fun. The main flaw is entirely avoidable (although, to be honest, I kind of WANTED to play an evil character). And the balance issues are only an issue if you use the weaker options. But I don't. Because they suck. So I don't really care.

Harder rec now. The fact the game doesn't open at all unless you manually delete a file is sad. The fact it breaks mods doing this is worse. But the game is just constantly shooting itself in the foot, adding insanely imbalanced (eye start option that gives you broken super moves) or insanely unpolished (dragon path) that ALSO requires you to start the game over to access it. Your guy with 40 hours? Who you made before these were added? Can never get their benefits. Ever. Start the game over. 
But starting the game over just shows how repetitive it is.

说真的，鬼谷的更新我是无感的，毕竟我游戏库里游戏一大堆，你爱更啥更啥，制作组的解释能让我接受就成了，之所以我给鬼谷差评，根本原因就是看了张三的直播，让感觉自己花了68块买了个爹回来训我似的。

其实我对独立游戏的宽容度很大的，只要游戏玩法能让我觉得好玩，未来可期我就会买单，什么画面什么BUG，只要你保持更新都好说，但制作者的态度请一定要保持谦虚，不是说要你低我一头的奉承我，但至少要保持着互相尊重态度来对话。不要让我觉得你花着我的钱还在背后骂我是花多人傻的大傻x。

But yes, the game is fun. It's grindy, I'm not a big fan of grindy but it's the kind that I personally don't mind as much. The sandboxy kind I guess. There's a lot of RNG and save scumming fates is required to have any semblance of a build. It's a wuxia game though, and the world is done so well that I feel like I'm right in a cultivator novel, and that's something exceedingly rare- so I [i]really[/i] like this game. The content is fun for me and the visuals are quite pretty as well.

If you want to play the game though you have to understand that the English version, and probably other languages for that matter, are second. The translation isn't poor, but if you've ever been following an early access game and get excited to see an update in your feed only to click on it and that it's not content but rather localization or language support or something not quite particular to you, well this time you might be on the other end of that and having to wait your turn exactly for those middle patches. I like the game enough to try and translate it by hand sometimes, but I also know that's not the choice everyone is going to make. 

This isn't limited strictly to translation, but also to the publisher's approach as well, and that's something that not everyone is going to be ok with. Wuxia as a genre is quickly growing in popularity in the West and such, but I think the main market is definitely not there, so I can understand the approach and why there are things like regulating presented modwork to be in accordance to China's censorship laws. Am I a fan of it? Nah, but I understand the reason. I get the recent backlash too, though I'm sure there are plenty of nuances that I haven't noticed or paid attention too,

The tldr is that standalone I like the game a lot. I get to be a shameless cultivator and court death with other shameless cultivators.",1657013678,1657013678,True,7,0,0.584905624389648438,0,True,False,True

Not recommended due to developer's actions from April 2022 to June 2022
- In April, modding was released on a third party hosted site which needed a China phone number. Mods were subject to review (i.e. Censorship) to be uploaded. No steam workshop at this time even though it was previously advertised.
- In May, steam workshop support was released, but developers were still reviewing mods and requesting certain mods to be ""corrected"". The words ""By official request, X feature was removed"" was not something I expected to see in a mod's change notes 
- Patch on June 22 caused the game to crash on startup. To date there's no official fix, you have to manually delete a file to play the game. This is a smaller QA gripe compared to the above 2.

Final Verdict:
The game is pretty good, just that the developer's recent actions are really not inspiring confidence in this game's future and the modding scene.

The game is amazing and the stories are great and you can choose your own story and create your own character

You can be the destined hero as in the novels we used to read
Or be the villain who wants wealth, power, and women (that's what I chose)
Or be someone who doesn't care about good or evil and just wants adventure

The game is interesting and it has no end. I became a great master of a sect and trained my students (they are all women of course) on evil and attacking the good sects.

I expected this game to receive backlash when the aformentioned launching problem happened with the latest MOD update, and I also believe the fact the problem is still present and no patch has dropped yet in at least *an attempt* to fix it is extremely unprofessional; and despite those things, I still recommend this game. 

As a fan of Wuxia/Cultivation novels, this game is the only one I have played that gets the closest to actually replicating the experience of being a protagonist in one of those settings, going along the struggle of making a place for yourself in this world, your objective being nothing but reach the peak; no matter if you go down the path of a Righteous or Demonic cultivator, what matters in this world is having the strength to live in it.
On a more technical angle, this game is the epitome of grinding; you need Spirit stones (money) for whatever you want to buy, even if its just Teleport talismans to reduce travelling time. If you join a Sect to buy juicy, stronger Skill books, you are gonna need Contribution tokens earned by doing sect missions. Heck, if you want to level up a skill without throwing yourself at combat like a cannonball, that in itself is gonna need Soul stones, and Comprehension sands to upgrade their rarity, as well as a couple of Days in-game. To put it briefly; there is a lot of things to do, and the world will not stay still waiting for you to finish them.

Before you get a Genshin Impact induced ptsd from the words you just read, bear in mind there is a ""Main Storyline"" that awaits in the world, with a ton more side-stories that really makes the world feel alive; from simple things such as ""save girl from crab, then be asked if its alright to escape from your sins"" to ""please get me a feather of a Phoenix so I can become a beautiful bird and confess my love to the girl I fell in love with"". What I am trying to say is, there is no paimon waiting to treat you like a 5 year old, and you can very much betray the people you offered your help to if the rewards are tempting enough; on the path of cultivation, all that matters is strength.

I do have gripes with the game; systems such as the Sect not really making sense on some of the finer details, because you ended the month doing like 15 missions, basically putting the same effort of 30 cultivators on your own, and then ""silent criticism"" just takes 90 points of Prestige away from it at the end of the month because F you, thats why. The higher difficulties fall into the same old song of ""your damage same, enemies now have 8 times the amount of HP"", and the fact *only* the highest difficulty offers something to balance/make things fairer is simply outrageous. And god forbid you actually kill a Cultivator, because it just so happen their Step-Aunt is 4 realms higher than you, and she is coming at Mac 5 at your location with nothing but the purpose of burying you alive. (yes I know that its very common in Wuxia novels, but since this game has a limited live system, you cant exactly get killed 3 times in a row and get away with it). Also, f*ck Heaven-Chosen.

Since this game native language is Chinese, expect some of the newest things added to the game to have unfinished or lack an official English translation on release; all core systems and most of the game has been succesfully translated, and stuff will get properly translated over time. It is still on early access for a reason.

I can keep going for hours talking about anything, even if its just mentioning stuff like ""hey, your Furnace can explode while doing Alchemy"" moments before my furnace does, indeed, explode while trying to make me some potions/Elixirs that heal me from more than 30 health... and I have 500. Point being, I like the game, and I think on its current state, despite the fact  its not finished yet, I would recommend it. I think the game has a lot to offer, and unless you are prone to heart attacks due to the fact you must *grind* for stuff, I think it will suprisingly grab you, just as it did for me. Also, forging an Artifact just to have the Snow Fox waifu be linked to it and talk about how she will protect you its an extremely valid reason, and let no one tell you otherwise. #MengyiMyWaifu

Before I end it here, I also want to bring up the matter about MODs; as I understand things, apparently the company has sadly taken a page from Blizzard, and is currently taking the stance of ""whatever mod you put on the workshop is now ours, and we can do whatever we can with it, even if its marketing"", to put in a simplified way. I am no content creator of any kind, but I think thats a really fucked up thing to do, and they deserve every single piece of backlash for it; thats a wrong thing to do, and they deserved to be chastized for it until they change it so. For any interested, as of writing the Workshop seems to only have Chinese content, but there are English mods being published on nexusmods.
TL;DR the game can be a grind, some stuff take time to be translated, and the fact the community had to come up with a temporary fix for something as impactful as ""I cant open the game"" is worrisome, but as someone that has had the game for a while, I trust that while not immediately, the game will head in the proper direction and fix what needs to be fixed on the long run.

First of all, [b] this game should NOT be described as ""unique"" or ""great"" [/b] if you have played some Chinese online games (those games only support Chinese language and never published on Steam). Because you will find these earlier Chinese online games are quite similar to this game, and they are both boring after playing for a while.

In addition, it is not just about the MOD issue, because

[h1] 1. The developer is FRAUDULENT. [/h1]
He not only promised WORKSHOP but also promised a lot of contents at the very beginning, which attracts huge amount of players. But guess what, [b] he broke his promises and not just once [/b].

1) He promised to update this game on a WEEKLY basis, then he used a lot of excuses to change the update frequency to 1 update every TWO WEEKS, and after several updates he further changed the update frequency to 1 update per MONTH!

2) He promised to add a lot of contents, but actually these so-called contents are not what we previously expected to be. The ""artifact"" version only added several artifacts into the game, but in the cultivation culture, there should be at least thousands of artifacts. And they should not only be possessed by players, but also be possessed by NPCs, and players can defeat NPCs for their artifacts. BUT what did he present to us?

3) He also promised to fix a lot of other BUGs and problems (such as unreasonable AI) which are players' feedback earlier last year, but those problems have never been fixed for such a long time!

4) His company has been exposed to assign only 8 employees for the subsequent development of this game, but assign over 20 employees to develop a new cellphone games which contains a lot of in-game purchases in attempt to cheat money from players. [b]His real motivation is never developing a good game but to cheat money![/b]

[b] The nature of promises is that they are immune to the changes in circumstances! [/b]

[h1] 2. The developer is also very ARROGANT. [/h1]
The developer is very arrogant about MOD issue in a live streaming facing players, and claimed that ""past is past, present is present, what happened in the past will not represent future"" in attempt to find excuses for breaking his earlier promises.

It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.

Edit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.

Be aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.


Official English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.

If you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.

For my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.

Progression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.

The developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.

Progression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",1615445074,1654164997,True,251,4,0.939374208450317383,16,True,False,True

This worked out and I eventually got a lot of decent stuff from him, apart from him being a cool dude just in general.

Well, years later some Cultivator killed my Master, so I found the Cultivator's Father, beat him senseless, left him a wasted husk of his former self for about ten years (while occasionally showing up to beat his ass again - I made it a personal Holiday -) and then finally killed him - all to lure his Son out so I could have my revenge. Then I killed the rest of his family and all of their friends. My Tao is tanked, but god was it satisfying. My Master was avenged.

If you're into Wuxia or Xianxia, this game is pretty damn awesome.

You should give it a try. Otherwise you'd be missing out.

My only grievance is that the ""Heaven's Chosen"" NPCs have blatantly boosted stats.
Like, the skills they have only provide 500 or so Health, yet they have twice the Vitality as everyone else.
You can tell they're blatantly boosted like cheats for NPCs.
The Devs may have tried adding this for difficulty, but I think it just makes the whole game pointless.
Why grind when you'll never be able to reach the top anyway? 
There's always that weird NPC in the corner who can one shot you at the max stats a player can ever reach.
Its a super grindy game, where you can never reach the top even if you put in time and dedication.

Here we are at the 1%... I learned about this thing called ""review bombing"" that happens to indie early-access games on steam. What is it? Well, when an update (or a lack of an update for a while) happens and ""it wasn't what I was expecting"" -> think nerfs to combat abilities that were broken and things like that -> the player base jumps right here, throws a short ""developer is evil"" sort of comment to discredit their hard work and blame the game for being terrible -> and then they up-vote other comments similar to theirs.
It happens to other games too, like Craftopia. Be on the look out. 

And here we are at ToI. This game is getting review bombed, AGAIN. Yeah, again. The first time it got review bombed, they nerfed the most over-powered ability in the game, the motion for Wind (one of the evade ability), and it was SO BAD that the devs actually apologized and undid nerf... Hey devs, if you're reading this, you should've stood by your decision and right here and now, quickly update the game with a direct nerf to it. You're getting review bombed anyway, right? Stand up against these review bombings or else you're just gonna get bullied to oblivion no matter what you do. 

Why the second review bomb? People are disappointed in the new modding tools that were released. Frankly, as someone who has nearly 200 hours in the game and tried modding the game before the tools -> and tried again afterwards, I can tell you that the modding tools aren't perfect but they make modding the game super easy compared to before. Seriously, they're great. So why the complaints? Well, I dunno. If you read the comment, you'll find a ton of them suggesting ""it doesn't work"" but it does, or something else...

So yeah... this is the 1% of the time where gamers are actually being petty untitled jerks -> attacking an indie game because of some nonsense that they feel is valid enough to do so - and I'm frankly just disappointed. Can't ya'll spam review bomb something by EA or Konami or or Blizzard? Seriously, I'd appreciate that. :U

However, after my purchase, I noted that updates almost stopped. I did not mind too much since the content that was about to come out was important. Then came this update about the mod maker. 

Allow me to explain why there are so many negative reviews recently : This ""mod maker"" is actually a third party software that require you to register on their website. And this third party is completely under the chinese government. Which means that it is heavily censored for the chinese players As for non-chinese ? Here is the cake : You just cannot use it as it requires a chinese phone number. So we end up with a big fhank you from the devs who previously said they would use steam workshop. Mods were a big part of what the game would have been after release. 

Hence my negative review despite my playing time since it is possible that I will not play anymore and the game is not even  finished. A huge disappointment.

Edit : They have allowed steam worshop in the end so review edited to positive.",1650575156,1653968990,True,0,0,0.494845330715179443,0,True,False,True

When the mod finally launched I was thinking, wow, finally. Maybe I can start playing this again, but it turns out this is all a big fat lie, the mod support is NOT on steam, it is on a third party site. And from all the information I read about that site, and this is the important part, YOU LOSE OWNERSHIP OF THE MOD AS SOON AS YOU UPLOADED, BUT CAN STILL BE CHARGED FOR IT LEGALLY  FOR WHATEVER OTHER PEOPLE DO TO IT, also, the site HAS THE RIGHT TO EDIT, DELETE, AND MAKE WHATEVER CHANGE THEY SEE FIT TO YOUR MOD WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. 

This is just outright ridiculous. So basically, to mod, you have to do all the work, take all the blame, while they get all the credit, and can charge other people for the mod YOU made as they see fit. What is this? Slavery?

Pros
[list]
[*]Be the main character in a xianxia/wuxia story!
[*]Interesting [b]game systems[/b] that feel rewarding to learn, although a little crunchy and grindy.
[*]It's so pretty! The [b]style[/b] is immaculate. Although some elements are jarring, like the buildings in sects/towns. Hope they find a way to integrate those better.
[*]The [b]story telling[/b] (main and side quests) are interesting, and the random travel events are flavourful.
[*]Plenty of different [b]build options[/b] and combat play-styles. Each of the 12 attributes has between 2-4 skills. Considering you have 4 types of combat skills (simple attack, special attack, movement and ultimate) that comes down to 576 builds if you spec in one attribute at a time. Besides the combat skills, you also get 8 passive skills, of which most are linked to an attribute.
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*]It's almost impossible to play the game as a [b]rogue cultivator[/b] (one who doesn't join a sect), unless you're a masochistic grinder for the sake of principle. Sects offer spirit fruits with which you upgrade your attributes, and they almost never drop from monsters, and even if they drop you have a 1/12 chance of it being the attribute you want it to be. Whereas within a sect you can trade unwanted spirit fruits with the sect guardian for spirit fruits you do want.
[*][b]Skill synergies[/b] are too explicit, where certain skills limit your options to other skills of the same attribute through attribute specific effects. In other words; making a build where you combine different attributes is either difficult or weak.
[*][b]Bullet hell[/b], it works but feels a little simple, I also constantly lose track of both my character and my cursor.
[*]Not very easy on [b]colour blindness[/b]: the different skills/items have colours to denote their rarity and I find those colours inseparable.
[*][b]Inventory management[/b] [strike]is pretty bad, I get carpel tunnel from dragging each item stack individually to my storage tree trunk[/strike] (CTRL + click does the trick).
[/list]

It might look like the cons outweigh the pros but I still recommend because the atmosphere and feeling you get from playing are really satisfying. Not to mention the game is still in early access so I wish the devs the wisdom to improve the game further.

Game can use a little more balancing. Some of the playstyles are way stronger than others and pigeonholes you to a few ability combinations as the fights start to get harder. 

English translation can use some work but that's to be expected.

The reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the ""official modding"" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.

But the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was ""really hard for the team"" and kept ""facing difficulties"" for the past year.

Every thing is randomized and it's awesome. The music is great, the game play is simple, yet engaging and you can spend a lot of time having fun here.

That being said? The uh. The modding.

Suffice to say it's gone all third party, and only available to individuals residing in China. And the TOS for the third party powered, chinese phone number required to verify (yes, I'm not kidding), mod tools?

Read like a bloody manifesto to defend the state from all criticism, foreign and domestic. Quite literally under the scrutinous eyeballs of the CCP and their network of censors, ready to report you to the nearest bag and grab team for re-education, should you make a mod that risks plunging your social credit score below the state approved minimum.

Or at least that's what it feels like.  If you want to play the game to play the game? Okay. Play the game.

There are almost no translation errors, and the only missing translations are a few random dialog interactions between friendly immortals. It seems to fit the Xianxia theme very well with its gameplay decisions and artstyle. The grind for superior breakthrough materials in order to achieve a better result is a clever concept, and leads to a tough choice of whether to keep grinding for those few extra stat points, or to just move on and hope your skill and luck will be enough in the next realm. The combat system is rather enjoyable, and while there seems to be some imbalances in power level of certain elements, they all have their own unique flavors that make them enjoyable. The story elements are also a nice touch that doesn't distract from the main plot of becoming an Immortal, but rather enhances, and gives you nice benefits if you choose to pursue them. 

There are some elements that are somewhat lacking, however, and seem like they could be improved with somewhat relative ease.

First, I think the straight stat boost from superior breakthrough materials isn't quite the right choice. The moment you reach the next realm, the stats you worked so hard for become a drop in the bucket. Which from both a gameplay and lore perspective seems lacking. Instead, a percentage boost might be more appropriate. That way, forming a solid foundation will keep helping you long into your career, even if each individual breakthrough's importance dwindles as their number increases in the late game. 

Next, there is a difficulty in mixing and matching different elements without losing out on their passives. It IS possible, but it requires very specific Mind skill options, and in the end doesn't really work all that well anyway. It would be a lot better if there was some synergy between skill passives, or if there was a chance of other element passives appearing on different manuals with low frequency? Or if the user could perhaps switch between skill-sets mid-battle? Or even better, customize their skills personally, and allow the use of other element's passives on different skills, should the user have the appropriate skill level or spirit root level. It might even be a new feature, where instead of just rolling for the options on manuals, the user unlocks options as their skills increase, like how the current Rewrite Destiny system works. Then, they could spend comprehension materials to change a manual and put their chosen option on it as a replacement for what was already there. This would help alleviate the hell that is searching for that perfect manual, AND allow for better multiple element play styles, while keeping with the same general mechanics of the game.

Lastly, the friendship system. This doesn't offer you all that much. The only reason to bother with it is the rare chance a partner will swoop in and save your life, or if you plan on playing as a sect Elder, and creating a crack team of True Disciples to farm for chests in the tournaments, and in raids on enemy territory. And even this isn't all that easy, as cultivators seem very bad at keeping their skills up to date. I have multiple Origin Spirit companions I've raised from the first realm, who still have first realm techniques equipped. Do I really have to babysit them and give them every manual they will ever need? I have enough trouble finding good ones for myself, let alone all the time spent fetching them breakthrough materials to keep them leveled up with me. Work can definitely be done in this department. Whether its just speeding up their acquisition of new techniques, or providing some useful services besides the occasional gift of random junk, something should be done regarding the friend system, or it isn't really worth your time unless you just feel like doing it for the fun of it.

Overall: Worth the buy

Cons: Devs really f'd up this time by publishing an unfinished product and over hyping workshop to where everyone thought it would be steam workshop then they made it independent hosted in china, which is not only troublesome to need to do additional layers of registration but also it's buggy and moderated by the chinese government. 

Pros: Aside from the obvious con above that's the result of 99% of bad reviews here, the game itself is definitely what I was looking for. It gives you the feel that you are the main character in a xiuxian novel and does a good job of being a wuxia game.

 Now away from that, it has a lot of personality and if you're into the popular myths you'll see a lot of faces you recognize, and the different ways to use your spells do make you really feel like your cultivating your own power to become stronger and stronger, the only real downside is that the cultivators are super common too, making you feel a bit more iffy often especially if you're evil which will quickly turn into you getting your shit kicked until you get strong enough to burn down an area, then repeat that with the next one.

 There's a lot of ways to interact with NPCs but it can lack feeling special unless you purposely get yourself emotionally invested randomly in a story.

請求『鬼谷八荒詐欺情節重大，故本此事件不應受steam退款基本要件限制。應立即退款。』
理由:
一.鬼谷工作室許諾開設創意工坊，而創意工坊通念為steam上的創意工坊而非外部網站的創意工坊
鬼谷八荒之官方即鬼谷工作室(下稱鬼谷工作室)對外表示許諾開設「創意工坊」
依社會通念而言，「創意工坊」係指steam的「創意工坊」而非外部網站的「創意工坊」
鬼谷工作室則開設於中國境內的網站fanbook設立「創意工坊」取代。

二.詐欺定義為使他人陷入錯誤後使其交付財產或使其財產發生損失，及本件涵攝
按照詐欺的定義，為使他人陷入錯誤後並使其發生財產損失或交付財產
本件鬼谷八荒以「創意工坊」的許諾使玩家陷入錯誤後未能退款，並推出非社會通念的「創意工坊」，
而˙時間過久才推出，使玩家群體無法及時退款。
明顯符合詐欺定義。

三.鬼谷工作室面對玩家抱怨之抗辯事由，以及退款聲請者反駁
又鬼谷工作室面對玩家反對則以""中國境內審查有利於規避辱華MOD產生為由主張fanbook的「創意工坊」存在重要性""。
該項主張有幾個盲點
1.steam本身就是非中國境內的程式 自始不受中國法律約束，何來被中國法律審查的必要性?
2.鬼谷工作室於非中國境內的steam上架鬼谷八荒，明顯知悉上開第1點事宜且同意。若鬼谷工作室自始不同意地1點則不會於steam上架鬼谷八荒。於fanbook事件爆發後則發聲明稿表示「中國境內審查有利於規避辱華MOD，主張fanbook創意工坊進行審查的重要性」。故能得知鬼谷工作室於本次創意工坊事件前後立場不一且嚴重矛盾。

四.本次創意工坊事件，涉嫌詐欺且情節重大，應不受steam退款限制拘束
steam退款要件為「購買未滿14 天且遊玩時間未滿2 小時（包含線上、離線、共享收藏庫的遊玩時間總和）」
唯遊戲營運方未來行為非當下購入遊戲時能得知，縱使購入遊戲第14天當下亦無法得知該遊戲營運方於第15天行為如何。
若遊戲營運方於第15天取消未來更新或對已付款玩家進行二度剝削如付款才能遊玩已付費的內容等，若仍拘束於steam退件
要件限制，玩家則無法進行退款，亦無法保障自己權益。
本件鬼故八荒創意工坊事件符合之，鬼谷工作室利用許諾詐欺玩家，使玩家陷入錯誤無法集體退款後，再以推出fanobook創意工坊，玩家察覺上當時已無法退款，鬼谷工作室許諾當下玩家不可能明知「鬼谷工作室所指創意工坊為fanbook上創意工坊」。事情爆發當下才知悉。
若上開事件仍受steam退款要件限制，則玩家權益無法受到保障，遊戲公司則能以此牟利不斷的施以詐術騙取財物，steam將淪為下一個詐騙集團集散地，為避免前述假設發生，stam應核准本次退款聲請。",1650525179,1651321448,False,5,0,0.541138887405395508,0,True,False,True

1, In terms of gameplay, the game is just a repeat strange, probability to obtain materials, advanced step and repeat the above steps of the game, there are a lot of boring and meaningless content, and to the players after the feedback is limited to upgrade the game a little bit of time, and then into a map in the face of numerical higher monster in the above steps. And the battle aspect is filled with more than ten years ago page tour cheap feeling and broken blow feeling. In addition, in order to improve the strength of the controlled character, the material required is complex and heavy, and the official has not set it properly. To some extent, it is necessary to turn on the modifier moderately to get a normal game experience. Such unreasonable value is a major factor causing the boredom of the game.
2. In terms of the plot, oh, sorry, there is no reasonable plot line in this game. There is only a final secret of ""Tianyuan Mountain"" given by the official, which I'm afraid I don't know how to fill in the pit. Each step of the map will make this logical chain of disconnected main lines appear a strong sense of rupture, which will greatly affect the game experience. This is supplemented by the adventures of web novels, which make up a lot of the text of the game's NPCS, while the text on the other hand is generated randomly by regular NPCS and repeated dialogue, which is simply not connected enough to form a solid story.
3. In terms of official promises, the official studio of the game hardly updated the version according to the promised time from the beginning to the end of the month. The only thing that attracts a large number of players is the ""creative workshop"". But unfortunately, the game's official play a word game, it does not mean that the steam creative workshop "", but they pulled out of a so-called ""creative workshop"" third party software platform, not only from the mod subscription to import is extremely complex, than ""steam creative workshop"" ease, and official mouth platform need to be strict and audit, A lot of players' ideas don't get implemented, and only mods that satisfy them ""say it all"" can be used.
This kind of official deception has never been seen before, so keep your eyes peeled and remember the studio behind the game to avoid being cheated again! I heard that the studio was preparing to make a second version of the game, but until we see the finished product, we are still waiting to see how it will turn out. It is the official behavior that makes players distrust.
4. How does the game go viral?
In the author's opinion, the explosion of the game is drilled in the scope of Our country for a long time no take out of the national style of game loopholes, with inferior products to fill the hungry market, triggered a wave, but when the tide receded, whether the game can really match its sales? Can it match the name of ""domestic light""? That remains to be considered.
After all, in my opinion, this operation of the game can not help but chill the hearts of many players who are expecting domestic games to develop, and also willing to give these half-finished games a chance. Official dishonesty, inferior content, repetitive game operation, etc., are not the ""domestic light"" that we are willing to expect. Maybe the game started out that way, but people change, and they get carried away and think they're really good enough to make this game, but they forget that it was paid for by a lot of people. The next official game will face a real quality test. In this regard, I can say without any doubt that the quality of the official game is not enough to face the market. Much of its success has been driven by players who feel the game is in the future, without which it would be muted......
5. Finally, I no longer have expectations for this game and its subsequent studios. I even thought that the so-called ""Domestic games"" might be just some consumer feelings. Cheat the player? Desperate for cash? . All kinds of speculation, the author has malicious, but recently many domestic games with choking operation out of the negative news of the impact. Calm down, there are people who are working on it and there are some games that have good reputation, and there are some domestic games that we can look forward to and spend on, but those games are definitely not and do not include Ghost Valley.

-You do not need to install anything but the mod you want to be installed
-Nexus has been agreed on as the place where most of the mods will be for Nonchinese speakers
-You are simply having a fit because it's not Unga Bunga enough for you to have clicked on something or did research before blowing your stack.
-these reviews have nothing to do with the core gameplay, you are doing nothing but scaring potential fans away, grow up.

If anyone is reading about the modding scene please just take those reviews with a bucket of salt. At face value, the modding scene is targeted towards CH, and rightfully so as their modding scene is gigantic to the point it leaking over to English as well, but non-CH can make mods in the engine somewhat easily. export the files to somewhere like nexus which can be installed manually or eventually when vortex gains support for it, which would be very easy for it to do.

---------
Gameplay: This is an okay game which is very fun at the beginning but quickly gets boring and repetitive after 20 hours.

The latest mod tool/mod support requires a third-party mod platform, which legally ""owns"" the mods (they deserve all rights of the mods but creators bear all potential legal liabilities, according to the EULA). For end users, using the platform requires software download, cell phone and identity (name, gender along with other sensitive information) ""verification"", which is worrisome to say the least.
The dev team has repeatedly disappointed over the past year, and the recent development is a mere manifestation of the founder's long standing arrogance and disregard to the player community. His ""explanations,"" both written and spoken during livestream, pale compare to the fact that the dev team (or he himself rather) created inconvenience to the players for their own interest.
Also, it seems that the dev team is focusing on publishing this game on mobile platform instead and already has plan for a sequel (yes, a sequel for an early access game). So [b] TL;DR: DO NOT PURCHASE [/b].

I know I shouldn't expect much for an EA game but the updates for past years doesn't seems to address the repetitive natural of the game. I feel like the developer is actually abused the EA system to make lots of bucks and then back-stabbing all supporter by forcing third-party mod sites which requires personal ID to login. If you don't really care about your personal information being sold to all sorts of people, feel free to play it. I was hoping modders could save this game by adding more contents. Now, this is no longer possible as all mods has to go through their scamming third-party site.

This is my post on Reddit about this topic.

If any English speaker wondering why the recent review of this game hit the bottom, this is the explanation.

The game developer decide not to use Steam workshop but an independent platform called Fanbook.

I just found out the developer's comment about the recent third party mod platform issue.

https://space.bilibili.com/4689610/dynamic. It's Chinese.

In short, the developers worried that they have no control over the content uploaded on steam workshop. They can not prevent some so called ""reactionists"" to take advantage of this tool to upload some bad mods and they can not censor them in time. 

The word ""reactionists"" in China is a propaganda words describing people who were anti-government, or even trying to overthrown the government.

I am not sure if this is their real thoughts. Maybe this is just a marketing strategy. It also could be just for them to get a game publication number in China. Without this number they cannot sell this game in China legally. (BTW I still can't understand how the hell Steam can survive in China this long without being shut down by officials.)",1650764820,1651014791,False,12,0,0.623654782772064209,3,True,False,True

Tale of Immortal is an excellent representation of the classical category of Chinese ascensionism (not the cult online). This game uses the idea of Chi and KongFu to create a living world where Classical Chinese Mythology and Legends come to life. Monsters such as Chinese Dragons, Nine-tailed Foxes, and spirit beasts are only basics, the comprehensive system of ascension or the road to god is what dragged me in. The more you see through the discovery of the land, the more of its stories unfold to reveal sorrow and joyful events that influence your gaming experience. This game throws you into a world of exotic possibilities, and you’re free to play according to your liking. This is one of the only games I have seen done this style of game justice. Everything is neatly done, from the music to the art style, and the hard work can be appreciated. If you have more interest in such a style, feel free to search up 修仙 or 灵气复苏 on Google. Many results are in Chinese tho.

Making someone call you father? Yeah you can do that. You not only can adopt you can get adopted yourself just don't expect to be able to dual cultivate with them. There are a few perks to having a rich adoptive mom though free skills and items to help on your cultivation journey. 

If you are starting out and don't want to get bullied I suggest the traits: Kind, Caring and Protective. The jade beauties won't stop approaching you guaranteed. If you want nearly everyone to hate you for no reason... middle way, romantic and loyal to friends is the way to go.

The combat is great with new realms you will see skills becoming more advanced in the way they attack which makes you really feel the Nascent soul realm is a lot stronger compared to  Qi refining tier attacks. You can choose different styles from one of the 6 elements or 6 martial arts. Wind, water, fire, earth, lightning and wood. For martial art choices you have Palm, finger, fist, sword, blade and spear. Each of these styles have a couple of different abilities for your basic, special, movement and ultimate ability which gives you a good selection to choose from.

If that isn't enough for you there are unique traits you get after progressing to a new realm. Following bug for instance turns into a dragon at tier 5 which will aid you in battle, pull enemies in and make your fights a lot smoother. Another trait allows you to cast your ultimate ability at the start of battle which is very useful for boss fights.

Replayability is pretty high too considering all the skill manuals and characters are randomly generated each time. Lots of sects to choose from but if you have the elder dragon aura from character creation you can run your own sect and attempt to survive in sect wars which have some pretty good treasures if you win.",1650654431,1650654431,True,2,0,0.499235808849334717,0,True,False,True

First map is a bit boring but later on sect wars, competition and other things unlocks that they  provide enough enthusiasm to play the game.
Overall it is one of its kind and gives feeling of being MC of  a lightnovel. 

If I had to complain about something, that would be lack of balance between choices. First of all is being good vs evil. Being evil provides no bonus at all, you can do theft but must check inventory of every npc (which is looking for a needle in hay) to find good(always garbage or few items) stuff.  Or try to kill them but will not get anything except more enemies. Second thing is imbalance of elements and martial arts. Some skills like wind movement skill, shines too much. Some other skills like spear and finger arts got no practical reasons to choice them unless you are looking a way to increasing difficulty as a challenge. Lastly, breakthrough fates there are some good balanced ones like early not good but last stage is pretty decent.

First I'm going to give you instructions on how to turn on English for the game. 

There is an ""alpha"" version of an English translation to the game. It's pretty good, but it is not automatically applied for you. You have to get to the settings option which is on the left side of the main menu second from the bottom. In the list there are several options the language is the third from the top. Select it then click ok which is the bottom left option and then exit the game and reopen it.

Now to what I think. If you're familiar with the cultivation/wuxia genre the devs really bring that into game format pretty well. You find spots with Qi to cultivate, you gather metals and herbs to craft and do alchemy with. There are spirits and mythic beasts and sects to join. Out of all the games I've found, which is not many, this game has done this the best i've seen. 

What it does well
You cultivate and grow stronger and learn varied techniques and skills to grow.
Combat can be both overwhelming and fun.

What it does ok
You join a sect and can progress through the different levels of that sect.

What it does poorly
At the end of every month you can be hit up a lot by various people to interact with you. This can be very tedious. Also sometimes they just want to say ""my sect is the best"" ok...you never really have what feels like a proper relationship with the people of the world.

Also in most cultivation genres it is considered poor form to fight a cultivator of a lower cultivation level than yourself, but in this world everyone wants to fight you when you're a nobody. Have little to no cultivation level. Now this is fine if the player asks to spar with a superior fighter to train, but it doesn't feel right for other people in the world to be looking to ""pick on the new guy"" in this way. Unless they're of a demonic alignment then I guess that'd be fine.

That aside, I think the game is quite good overall and has plenty of room to grow. Just don't feel bad about getting beat up in a spar, that will definitely happen. Probably a lot if you spar everyone.",1650465911,1650465911,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

I didn't want to give a negative review to this game, because China as a market is notoriously hostile to pop culture like comic, cartoon and video games. But don't buy this game if you haven't already. The dev team is involved with advertise scam.

They advertised workshop with mod support during the first early access. But turns out instead of steam workshop, it's some kind of independant workshop where mods have to pass CCP censorship. Oh, I'm sorry, I mean CCP 'Harmonization' (because prettier word make everything better). 

And also this is my own tinfoil hat theory (because I'm programming illiterate who doesn't know anything about how actual programming works), but I have serious worry the additional program you are required to download to even access their independant 'workshop' might be a trojan, or spyware. Because their official website's layout looks like one of these Chinese piracy website where you download trojan/spyware into your computer together with your pirated games.

If you're ok with some grinding, have some extra funds, like wuxia, and blasting things apart in an arpg appeals to you, then that's what you're going to get and I've found it kinda relaxing... enough for me to grind all the way to Enlightenment (VIII) (current highest tier) anyway.

There are also some small stories, and there's tools to create more of those in-development, but most of the game is really all about blasting things apart with a gradually increasing and kinda satisfying number of ways.

As the game isn't finished yet, it doesn't yet have any real story conclusion or anything, so whether there's going to be a reward at the end of it remains to be seen.

Like in your previous area there are not many npc with same level to you and then you move to new area and there is bunch of them, with very same world-system, that is really bad, it just destroy your motivation to move to new area because you know there are no new things there
And some mechanics in this game is terrible, you want to build your cult, recruit 100 members and start a war, no no no, your 100-lovely-students will die in 1 second with just 1 random overpower npc, there is no point using them, just go outside, steal something on some overpower npc and gift it to them, repeat it over and over again still they like you then invite them to join your cult and destroy your enemy

While the game doesn’t particularly stand out for the combat or as people have pointed out the grind.  Even though the grind is part of cultivation unless you are usually one of these characters who is actually some ancient sage reborn and knows all shortcuts. (Or uses cheats hehehehe)

Where the game really shines is in the journey you can write for your character.  I myself have been writing a story around the events my character has encountered and also the happenings of the world around them.  In this game the world turns regardless of your actions.  Meaning you can sit still but the world doesn’t stop turning.  NPC’s will cultivate get stronger (though it seems to be slower rate than you can).  Form relationships, friendships and rivalries with not only you but each other.  Perhaps they are spawned into the world with certain relationships.  There are far too many of them for me to keep my eye open on all of them.

This can create some interesting situations to some down right gut wrenching situations if you’re willing to roleplay and think out story situations to what happens and these situational happenings.  What got me into writing short stories based on my play periods was a particularly strange, tragic and somewhat depressing incident. 

 My character had married one of the NPC’s while they were basically sectless.  Strangely enough the demonic/evil sects don’t necessarily have nothing but “evil” members by their personality traits.  Well my characters wife ended up joining a demonic sect.  I also had a sworn sister from the sect I was a member.  Her and her daughter were both in my sect.  Long story short my characters wife killed the daughter of my sworn sibling, I only know this because you can check the “thoughts/plans” of siblings and family members for example “going to visit daughter”, well my sworn sibling wanted to avenge her daughter.  This caused my characters sworn sibling to attack the wife.  The wife ended up killing the sworn sibling as well.  At this point it became a rival sect killing two of my fellow sect members.  I was able to revive my sworn sibling because you can mark them on your map to keep track of them.

This is where the storyline got tragic, because I knew based on my characters personality traits what had to be done.  Though the dialogue was short and simple my characters wife being dumbfounded I was attacking her was painful.  After defeating her, I sincerely debated with myself about breaking my characters personality and forgiving her but it had already come too far.  I killed her.

I immediately saved and closed the game, I pondered on the reasons this could have happened.  The story behind it.  The cogs in my mind were turning to the point of a glowing bright red from the speed and frictions they turned upon one another.  I repeatedly listened to light and shadow from League of Legends imagining their battle play out in my mind as my character was torn between his love for his wife, but his love for his sect, his sibling and his hatred for what she had done and the sect she had joined.  So I began to write about the entire event in the form of a short story.  Soon enough I was writing short stories based on many of characters experiences of note, wars, lost friends, quest to find and save some, others who I simply lacked the required resources to revive.  Quest for revenge, close calls with love but fated for my character to walk away from after the tragedy of his past. 

And this is why I recommend this game.  Because if you’re a story teller, it gives you everything you need to tell a story.",1649941960,1649941960,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,True

Things I wish were better:
Make the game become significantly less grindy.
- make it so that some skills scale with your cultivation level instead of having to find new techniques every time. having to locate new skills every time is not that enjoyable and very repetitive
- increase mat drops especially since getting 100% Tao Souls is just such a pain.
- getting clothing and artifacts should not be as grindy as it is currently

Gameplay Features:
- an ability to switch between special skills or skills within battle; like all the mmorpgs out there. this is because in some dungeons you really would need to use different skills depending on AOE or Single DPS.
- this also allows for hybrid builds and makes it much cooler
- more activities in friendship and partnering
- If anything I hope more ascensions were like the Nascent Soul ascension which was actually really fun conceptually with the unique boss fights.

reminds of when i played ffx then spent hours and hours endgame optimizing my party even when they could kill the final boss easy.

If you don't know what those are, this probably isn't for you. The fights are 2d, top down view. Nothing fancy really, though some of the boss artwork is very nice. The game includes many of the concepts common to such stories, however, as far as I can tell the basis for 99% of Chinese light novels, crossing cultivation realms to defeat stronger opponents, is not a thing. If you face anyone stronger than yourself, you die. Fast. I haven't seen any magic grandpa in a ring type items, no special bloodlines that let you smash stronger enemies when you get insulted, etc. In this game, you aren't a main character type, just a pretty normal cultivator trying not to die.

Vengeance is a thing, if you kill people, their stronger friends and family will eventually pop up and smash you. I am often accosted by enemies of higher levels, angry over my treatment of characters I've never heard of. 

I enjoy the game overall, but it can be frustrating. Currently I am working on a sect competition. I take care of my own battles, but the random win/loss of the rest of the team have me save-scumming looking for a win for my sect. Also, using the special items in the sect competition is a pain.

You can do a lot of Wuxia bullshit and honestly the writing for a lot of the sidequests/quests are so much better than the average indie story. The sidequests always seem to hit a cozy bittersweet feeling while being just insane and mystical enough to be a Xia story. Doesn't feel forced and outlandish even as a Xia story. You wouldn't think this entire game was made in one year either, it already feels like a finished product.

Cards on the table, I pirated the game because I wanted to waste some time but after playing it I loved it enough to actually buy it for real.

My only real complaint is that like a lot of Chinese games you have to figure out a lot of what you're supposed to do on your own. Especially if you accidentally skipped the tutorial boss like me and a lot of people. Once you figure it out though, you can speed through a lot of previous areas on future playthroughs.

Another complaint is that RNG can be annoying at times but it's a very roguelike game. It's mostly when you're picking out your level feats though and honestly those aren't that important anyway.

Also if any Devs see this I really want a Unique Demonic sect like the Righteous have with the Dragon Sect. I know you're working on it but everybody knows Demonic are much cooler!

Let's start with the good:

-NPCs: I absolutely adore the NPC system in this game. It really feels like a living world. I love how each npc has their own motivations and how it all comes together in the auction house every year
-Sects: The sect system is amazing. I love the sect events so much!
-Combat: Although the combat isn't groundbreaking, it's good enough for the game. A game like this needs some sort of combat system and the devs really pulled through in making one that makes all of your character stats and cultivation techniques matter.
-The Gacha/Artifact Grind: This might be an unpopular opinion, but I actually really like the gatcha grind (to be clear, it does not cost money). 
-Time Management: There are lots of things to do. It can be fun to try to push yourself not to waste time!
-Different Birth options: I like the birth fates a lot, and some of them change the game in fundamental ways. I haven't experienced them all but I plan to!
-Secret cheat power that noone else has: I love the implementation. The Bagua Jade feels a bit hollow, but the Eye of Providence is really cool. I'm also looking forward to the gourd!
-Fates: I love how the breakthrough fates differentiate NPCs and your character. It makes each character seem unique, just like cultivators should. 


Some features from the Cultivation Genre that I feel are missing:

-Secret Realms: While there are secret realms, they are all solo experiences. Where are the other cultivators? Where are the hordes of hungry geniuses from Nine Star Hegemon Body Art? Where are the ""friends"" who take you to a secret realm only to stab you in the back like in Record of a Mortal's Journey into Immortality? It would be so fun to make enemies with people while looking for resources. 

-Time Pressure: Currently, there is basically no reason  whatsoever to cultivate quickly. I would love to see some secret realms or tournaments that are age gated, like in Desolate Era. The game does such a good job making each action seem important, so why not actually make it so? I'd also really like to see at least a small number of NPCs cultivate at a pace closer to yours.


-Life saving treasures: The decision to not let you run from boss fights in a game with a permadeath option baffles me. This, combined with the lack of real life saving treasures is quite unfortunate. Sure, there are pills, but they are too common and their effects too weak to really save you. Maybe the planned talismans update will address this.",1644549458,1644549685,True,5,0,0.582454681396484375,0,True,False,True

The artwork is stunning and the battle- & ascension-system is a lot of fun (especially if you enjoy grinding for more rewarding perks/maxing out your character). I also really enjoy the way the main story is bound to mythology (and even though a small detail: how it leads back to the loading screens; it gets you a bit excited for what is to come/for what you've already experienced yourself). You have a lot of freedom to chose your own path at many points in the game - to reflect on your goals or think about what the right choice is (or you assume it to be). I've quickly grown to love this game, playing it for hours on end and it's definitely already one of my favourites.

There are a few things that are a bit confusing at first (or not as well explained as others), so especially if you've only just started your first save file, you may mess up on quite a few ends/encounter a bit of insecurity what you're supposed to be prioritizing. (For example, I ascended to Origin Spirit very early without ever bothering about farming artisan skills or artifacts/artifact spirits - only in the new region did I realize I should've taken things a bit slower - you won't get too far, even with the max ascension stats.) But there are thankfully a few guides in the community that you can consult! The translation as well is a bit wonky in a few places (missing translations for the spirit roots in the ""what should i focus on?"" npc event for example), but it is still very playable and especially as early-access, it's rather well-made.

Overall, I can only recommend this game and look forward to witnessing its future developments. If you're into xianxia, give it a try! It might just become your new favourite.",1643970830,1643970830,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,True

In all seriousness, however, Tale of Immortal is a good game but not a great one. Lots of people will probably become frustrated with it at record but I do enjoy an overwhelming majority of the content anyways. I realize in hindsight that a lot of the points I am going to cover in this review seem negative but in my opinion, they actually enhance the experience. I love this game. I have lost sleep over this game. Somebody please take this game away from me, I haven't had a full night of sleep in a week.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Most stories are balls of yarn or even tumbleweeds, bunches of intertwined plot threads that end up related [i]somehow[/i]. Even if the logic doesn't totally check out, there's still the comfortable assumption that the story all resides on the same plane of existence. 

The storyline in Tale of Immortal is giant plate of spaghetti somebody dropped on the ground, because as far as I can tell, there's actually two (maybe three, more on this later) different plots being told that don't have anything to do with each other. On top of that, they are extremely weak plots, containing points you can entirely disregard without diminishing the experience of the game.

The first plot is actually a series of mini plots. This is what would actually be the main story of any rpg, if only it were blown up from the minuscule scale that it has been confined to. It is heavily based off of Daoist mythology (which you don't need to know to enjoy the game; that said, I am probably missing out on a lot of context any native Chinese speaker would have been aware of). In addition, these mini plots appear to be mainly boxed into the regions you first encounter them. Some overlap does occur in the later regions but for the most part, these plots are all bit-sized portions that mainly exist to prevent you from running too far away from the region you are actually supposed to be in. Personally, I don't care about this storyline. I reached the third region before realizing I never resolved the main quest for the first region. It simply wasn't necessary to progress anything.

The second plot is. Well, it's not really a plot unless you make it one. And that's it. A large part of the story is your own personal investment in your sect and the relationships you chose to establish. There are some really wild npc events that can go on, which makes the game both chaotic but fascinating. ""The world is evolving"", the rollover screen likes to threaten me. ""Your master just killed your apprentice.""

In the third region (this is where you level during origin spirit / nascent soul), we get [spoiler]secret societies[/spoiler]. What do they do? What is their motive? [spoiler]Okay, we actually know this one and it seems to just amount to ""let's get stronger in morally dubious ways"".[/spoiler]

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]

The stat grind is intense and eternal. You will never not be grinding [i]something[/i]. If not your stats, then it will be your skill points (which you need to equip passives). If not your skill points, then you'll probably be stuffing npcs with interspatial rings so that they'll stop trying to murder you (npcs will steal from you for no reason and the only way to stop them is to beat them up. This will cause them to hate you, even if you let them go with no consequences, and it will also cause their [i]friends[/i] to hate you, too. If an npc hates you, they will eventually hunt you down and end you).

The good news is, keeping yourself not hated by npcs becomes exponentially easier halfway through the first region. The stat grind can also be done as slowly as you would like (this is a good thing. I don't recommend rushing through the game because sliding by on the bare minimum will only get you so far). 

If you're not savescumming, you probably deserve an award. Playing the game straight through without a reload is the equivalent of a nuzlocke. Many things are RNG based or have requirements that the game will never tell you (looking at [i]you[/i], npc affection). 

There are a lot of systems in this game and some of them don't do anything. Talismans are simply not usable at the moment, even though there's a stat for it. Mining is connected to artifacts but I've never had to actually use it. Speaking of artifacts, perhaps they really do make the game easier but I'm doing fine without them? I don't really see what I'm missing out on. There are artifact spirits in the game and, to be frank, I have no idea where they are or how I can get them. I don't even know what they do now, late into the third region, the game has still not even told me that they exist. I had to learn from steam guides.

(Thank you to Z for the guide, I highly recommend people go and check it out.)

[h1]Combat[/h1]

Good but also bad. Fighting against enemy mobs is pretty straightforward but fighting npc cultivators is hellish at [i]best[/i]. Auto-aiming doesn't exist and npc cultivators will run around the screen spamming attacks like crazy while you are struggling to hit them. You can reset keybinds in the game's settings -but you can't reset the keybinds on your two main attacks (spiritual/martial and special). If you use a mousepad like I do (I know, I know), you might have issues if it has a tendency to stick.

Sect battles are fun! But also almost impossible to track anybody on the screen, including yourself. I hope you chose a distinctive outfit on the character creation screen (or bought one from a city in the later regions) because it's really, really hard find your own character on the battlefield when ultimates are going off left and right and five other npc cultivators (who may or may not be your allies) are running around in circles like it's the end of days.

[h1]Things That I Have Seen NPCs Do[/h1]

- My adoptive father killed one of my friends. Both were grand elders in our branch sect. My friend was also the adoptive father of my master, who was dual cultivating with my adoptive father. I eventually gave my grand elder friend a body reformation pill and also convinced my adoptive father to stop considering him an enemy. Unfortunately, my grand elder friend is holding a grudge over the whole getting murdered thing. The good news is that I found out that even if one of your sect rules is ""don't attack members of allied sects,"" there's no rule that says you can't outright murder your own sect members, so long as you do it out of sect territory. 

- My master killed my apprentice. My apprentice was actually the elder I originally usurped to become an elder myself. She hated me until I gave her enough rings to forget about it, and then I made her my apprentice because the sect was low on true disciples. 

- The leader of our entire sect got killed. My grand elder friend is now the acting sect leader. I hope he moves to the next region so I can take his position in this current one. 

- In xianxia, dual cultivation normally has a ... nsfw element to it. But it seemed curiously PG in the game so I hit up everybody I could, figuring that it was just group meditation. My adoptive father was offended when I asked him. And then the next month, he asked me and I accepted. ??? Which one is it, game?",1643662826,1643662826,True,1,0,0.50180506706237793,0,True,False,True

Got the manual back! Ran across this old man who gave me some spear tips for a favor, which had way more evil spirits than I'm normally comfortable with, but going into the story behind the ruins of the old sect was interesting. Deeply enjoy the saga of Jian Ke, a friend I made back when we were both in the beginning stage, who continues to shower me with notifications of the fights he got into and had to crawl away from. Initially joined a demonic sect because I thought it was cool, only to get so many scoldings for being too nice that I had to run off to a righteous sect.

Reason to recommend - 
1. If you like china cultivate style of game

2. The freedom to do whatever you want in a game that wasn't force plot n role to you

3. Training a waifu up from scatch was surprisingly grindy but fun.

4. There a lot of skill for you to try (too bad i never get to learn all of them) u can watch how the skill work in the skill tutorial. (why do final ultimate doesn't have a preview at all tho?) 

5. playing the game at your own pace 1000 age is prob gonna took few hundred k of time anw, 150 hour and i just used 91/1000+ years. 

The flaw that I felt the game has 
1. early breakthrough was surprisingly easy, until mid game, u just need to gather resources all around the area n there u go, but for the last 2 stages..is all about rng stats and rng reroll...it took nearly 1~4 day for ea breakthrough unless u are grinding it..

2. The grind you need to make lv 5 artifact spirits are ...hellish RNG+ 20 of the spirit needed sometime i need to go over 30 run for 1 similar spirit 

3. You can SL for your left and right ability and farm on bosses but beside that is RNG in auction house..it took me nearly 30+ years of skipping to get half of my passive n dodge done. which is bad


Overally I'm recommending this game cause I have alot of fun regardless the flaw it has.

A cultivation simulator sandbox about becoming an immortal, the game in it's current state is quite bare-bones and empty, events happens frequently however you'd end up repeating a couple of dialogs since there's not alot implemented in that aspect yet. The further you go in the game, the more it becomes grind intensive. Make no mistake there's a certain amount of depth in this game, the ""fate"" system that gives it a rogue-lite element, the different outcome of each quest line helping to form the history of the world you're living in, the expansive and unique skill system. BUT, if you want to buy it because you want to experience the iconic Wuxia experience of zero to hero tale, this isn't it, despite the lush and gorgeous world, atmosphere is the only thing it has so far, NPC aren't much of a threat in the earlier areas and you can cultivate yourself until you're OP before moving to a different area, monsters are varied however the gameplay boils down to bullet hell so any unique or intriguing designs they have is delegated to becoming basically a turret that spews bullet, the map is expansive and beautiful but life-less and mundane. 

Overall a solid 6/10 game, as this review was written when it's in early access so hopefully moving forward many things added and fixed as well as additional content to make the game feel more lived-in, if you want to get a creative sandbox rpg with rogue-lite elements and don't mind grinding, give it a try.",1643305389,1643305389,True,2,0,0.502381980419158936,0,True,False,True

It's currently in early access so lots of things can change, I also sped through the game in one playthrough so I could've not seen all the content. 
TLDR: Translation is shoddy at times, gameplay gets relaxed after you know the boss patterns, DON'T kill anyone until Nascent unless you have to. Concept is really fun, and the story is interesting.
If you're an english speaker the translations can get shoddy at best for certain non story elements of the game. Although this really doesn't take away from the gameplay it makes it hard to get immersed into certain side side quests of the game. Also don't get your hopes up by thinking you can actually finish the story as it's not completely finished (there are 2 more areas and 2 greater realms left iirc). Gameplay's generally pretty chill unless you're overestimating yourself/level. Once you get used to the bosses attack patterns though it gets really easy. Only issue I have with the game... you can't kill people left and right! If you kill people before you reputation becomes a certain area, you're in for a treat. Basically every living being thinks you're the devil or something so every month you can get up to 3 people challenging you and killing you. It get's pretty old really fast even if you can kill them easily. Not to mention half of the people that want to kill you can VERY easily in the early stages of the game. But if you just wait till around Nascent to go around killing people like the maniac you want to be in game, you can easily do so.",1643166154,1643166154,True,1,0,0.504103958606719971,0,True,False,True

Cultivation consists of practicing martial arts, gaining Qi energy, meditating, finding valuable medicine/treasures to consume and performing alchemy. The goal is to become strong and extend your lifespan until you reach immortality and ascend to godhood.

During your journey, you will encounter demons, spirits and other supernatural phenomena. You will form both good and bad relationships with the people around you based on the choices you make. The concept of morality is vital, you get to choose whether you grow to be lawful or evil.

The gameworld consists of tiles and uses a turnbased system to travel over those tiles. As you take turns, a certain number of days passes. At the end of each month, the gameworld evolves and presents the player with new events and opportunities. The number of people that constantly want to talk to you or spar with you can get a little tedious though.

As soon as you get into combat, the game changes from a turnbased combat, to isometric/topdown action combat. The combat is fairly simple, you've got a primary attack, secondary attack, movement skill and an ultimate attack. It becomes a bit of a bullet hell game as the game progresses. A large part of the difficulty curve is decided by your cultivation level. It helps to obtain strong skills and a strong cultivation ""foundation"".

As you progress you may find yourself becoming a member of a sect. A sect is like a martial arts group/school that you pledge your loyalty to. You can represent your sect in tournaments or help them fight against hostile sects. Eventually you may even become a sect leader and lead your sect to victory.

While it is a sandbox game and you can choose what you want to do, the progression is mostly linear. There's a story, but it doesn't really play a major component. It's more a guide to point you in the right direction. It can get a little bit of a grind at times, but the pacing of the progression is solid.",1642068356,1642604320,True,1,0,0.50180506706237793,0,True,False,True

The Pros in this game:
Many different builds you can invest your time to finding out what you like with what play style fits you the best. 
Easy enough, but challenging at the same time. 
It is extremely addicting, makes you want to max out yourself before moving onto the next part of the game. 
Main quest line have very good story to it, feels like making your own WuXia story.

The Cons in this game:
Some parts of the game isn't fully translated and is a bit of a pain to use google translate. (But the patches comes out pretty fast, so don't worry about it too much)
DO NOT pick spear for now, it is literally impossible to finish the game on Nightmare or harder with it. (Hopefully they change this as Spear is probably my favorite in any WuXia Genre)
Rerolling for the Perfect Destiny on Nightmare or Harder is EXTREMELY TIME CONSUMING. I am about to start my first Chaos run and took me almost 2 hours rolling for the perfect Destiny at the character creation page. (Maybe its just me and my terrible RNG haha ^^)

Overall: I am extremely satisfied with this game, money well spent for hundreds or maybe even thousands of hours ^^ Definitely recommended this to many friends who also bought the game already.",1642486139,1642486139,True,19,0,0.695836544036865234,0,True,False,True

I've spent 39 hours playing and have not even made Foundation yet - however, I have learned quite a bit from making a dozen characters and trying the different martial and spiritual skill sets. The tutorial is pretty straightforward and teaches you the basics. There is a lot more to it though. I highly recommend this game!

Here are some tips:

- Spend some time rolling stats before starting the game. There is no ""perfect role"", but some Destinies compliment each other better than others. For example: I always choose ""Eagle Eye"" so that I have a permanent 20 point boost to Crit. Also, ""Dragon Elder"" is good for people who are just starting the game and want to get into a sect without sect tryouts. ""Fleetfoot"" boosts your Agility and travel speed and is a compliment for melee martial skills like Blade.

- Newbies, don't try to go pure righteous or demonic at the start. Cultivators from the opposite spectrum will try to take you out right out of the gate. 

- Try to get all your Combat skills to at least Blue Level, as well as have a few Mind Skills, before Sect Tryouts. It helps!

- Get a flying sword (mount) and go exploring for towns, sects, and specials areas ASAP. Mythical beasts and other ""bosses"" will spawn around the map from time to time. Once you are strong enough to handle them, it's easy to use to portal to shoot across the map to get to them before another cultivator.

- Debates and winning duels are an easy way to get Knowledge points - which you can use to get more Mind Skills.

Those are my tips thus far! Enjoy the game!

The game also presents the stories that are currently playable in a way that is laid-back in fact that while your character has an age limit (base of 80 I believe), due to how turns are taken and mechanics are presented, that 80 years is actually pretty long. It also helps that the first real breakthrough (from Qi Refining into Foundation) gives your character an extra 40 years. 

It should also be mentioned that NPCs in Tale of [the] Immortal are not static as you would see them in other games. They also grow along with you, and they each have their own tastes. That and the starting pool of characteristics (such as the starting traits 'True Love' or 'Heavenly Dragon Arua') can shake a playthrough up.

This is a strange game, having this type of genre with an official translation is of course a novelty, and hopefully a trend. The closest comparison would be scroll of Taiwu, but I could never get into that game, because of the combat(unfortunately). So since I didn't play much SOTWU, I am sure some SOTWU fan is shaking their head at the comparison. Anyhow...

Translation: Good
You can definitely feel that the translation is not done poorly, although some parts remain untranslated as of the writing of this review, what we do have makes sense and there aren't any glaring off-topic words/sentences in letters/conversation. I am very satisfied with this, and it is no hindrance to playing the game.

Respecting your time: Excellent
&
Can you run it?: YES
I will say that this is one of my favourite things about the game, at the time of writing this review I have 70 hours logged, but perhaps I have only played the game for 30-40 hours. The reason is simple the game take up little to no cpu power, I can have this game running as a background process almost all day with no issue. This results in me having small sessions throughout the day, but also longer ones. You can accomplish minor tasks in as much as minutes, and still play for hours on end focusing on larger goals, the game world doesn't advance unless you do.

Gameplay: Dependent
There are main quest-lines varying in length and goals, and several smaller ones scattered throughout. Many random events as well. However you are left with plenty of time to accomplish these (some have time-limits). Otherwise you can move around exploring and interacting with NPC's gathering treasure etc. You can technically move along the map quite easily, but beware you will get dead if you move along too much. 
I write dependent here, because the game is very repetitive, and the NPC interaction/quests/events could be made more interesting and varied. You basically rinse and repeat the same random events, and regular quests, and your goal is always to get a better journal and optimal treasures for advancing. This sounds boring, and for myself normally this would be a show-stopper, but somehow it works for me here. The systems presents are just deep enough that it is fun to do these over and over. 

Combat: Good
You have 4 maximum active skills, 1 normal attack, 1 special, 1 movement, 1 ultimate - equipped at any time. they are decided by spirit root or martial arts. There are 6 of each, so a total of 12 typings. Per typing you have 2 variations of each active skills, so 2 different normal attacks per typing. However the skills work together, so if you are fire root, you'll probably have full fire root skill-set. Don't worry however it is easy to increase your knowledge of martial arts and fire roots, and if you need a change of pace you are not locked out by equipment, only the grind haha! but you can only remember so many skills, so it is easier to change out early on, but later on, if you intend to go back to a root or martial art it can be a hassle and a grind to get new tomes etc. 
The mechanics of the combat are fun overall, and you can easily get smacked sometimes. 

The roadmap is laid out for now, it seems modding will be allowed soon, so it will be interesting to see what content the community will make. 

My only qualm is that the NPC interaction/quests/events could be made more interesting and varied. However I absolutely have fun with the game and I can strongly recommend this.

Difficulty of normal mode is insanely easy - Get to foundation to unlock nightmare which is what should be ""normal"" if not for permanent death. However the grind to unlock Choas is a little annoying. In reality there should be three modes - all unlocked from the start, rather than 6. Or better yet, just make a slider so it can be customized.

Game encourages making new characters between perma death & achievement unlocking perks. Yet does little to actually speed up game play. End of battle screen takes forever - Getting into battles every 20seconds WITH a repellent talisman on. End of month processing + chat spam.. 

Lacks the depth you would hope it would have, and has a grindy loop with poor combat. The progression would be so much more fun if the combat (which is the only ""Finished"" part of the game) actually felt good to play.

But on serious note tho, the depth of this game is really deep when it comes to social interaction between NPC and between you basically. So say you are about to be killed by someone but then the NPC found out that you are a friend with a certain strong cultivator, he will let you go or leave you heavily wounded. Haven't seen any game have this sort of approach on relationship thus far.

There are a lot of random encounter ranging from:-
1. You are on a date with someone but some dude decided to just so happen pass by to your dating spot and jeopardize your date by attacking you.
2. You are in a dungeon run and saw some girl on the ground dying but it turns out it may/may not (depending on how lucky you are) be faking it and stab you at the back so it turn into a dead battle.

For start, it has a bit translation issue but its not game breaking, if it bothers you use an app to translate it so you can get a rough idea.  

The combat is fun and challenging early on but if you build your character a certain way you can get past most of the content a bit easier. There are 4 skill you can do in combat like martial/spiritual skill which is your basic attack, special skill, motion, and ultimate, all of this skill come in different style like aoe, single target, long range and melee. For the ultimate, you can only trigger it if you met a certain requirement in combat, its nothing complicated so make sure to read the requirement and build your character accordingly, you can bypass some of the requirement with certain destiny (traits). There's also gear you can equip like artifact and elixir to restore your health, energy or stat boost to help you in combat. A bit of warning though its a bullet hell games

Relationship is a bit lackluster, right now the only advantage i know is being given random item...sometimes its a junk sometimes its a skill book, however for the NPC having good relationship with other seems more beneficial, for example if you defeat an NPC in battle you are given 4 option which basically allow them to go, kill them, or take some item they offered. Now, if you choose to kill them, be prepared because their relatives be it friends, family or their lovers will avenged them, most of the times their cultivation will be so high they can literally end you with a couple moves, so be warned.

The progression on this game is simple, you gather your qi to a certain level, collect several item in the open world, rinse and repeat. it can be a bit grindy but after your breakthrough you will be awarded with stats, new skill in the higher realm, and destiny which is some kind of traits that benefit you either in combat or in the open world setting. The destiny mechanic heavily favor the combat as i see little benefit in the non-combat destiny. This is due to combat oriented destiny can ensure your safety in combat and give you higher chance to defeat other cultivators.

overall the core mechanic of this game is to grind your way through to progress.

Wow, this game is stupidly fun and addictive and I really can't think of anything else like it. It's basically an ""open world"" sandbox where your main goal is to get stronger through cultivation of chi, but there's quite a bit more to it than that.

Essentially you run around on a grid-based world map that is semi turn-based. The way it works is that travelling around and doing certain things like cultivating, etcetera, take up 'days'. Once 30 days are done, the month is over and you have to end 'turn'. At the end of the turn, it updates the state of the world and all the other characters in the game take their own actions - and often interact with you as well. It's not really turn-based, but it kind of is. It works fine and it's fun.

Combat takes place on battle maps and is semi-ARPG like. You have 4 active skill slots, a main martial attack, a special attack, a movement attack, and an ultimate attack. These skills are all different depending on what martial art you specialise in, and you can mix and match them across multiple martial arts if you train those skills enough. Martial arts are split across physical and spiritual - physical being spear, sword, etcetera, and spiritual being elemental magic. There are also 'mind skills', basically passive skills for which you have separate skill slots and need certain amount of mind skill 'points' to equip.

But what do you actually do? Basically, you travel around the world map trying to get stronger. There are main quests and events that pop up all over the place and cool little side stories to explore, but the main thing is you want to increase your cultivation level. Cultivation levels (there are currently 8) are basically how strong your character is, and each level is split into 3 stages: early, middle and late. To increase your current stage, you fill an XP bar and then need to use a pill to breakthrough to the next stage, then you do this again until you're ready for the next cultivation level. Increasing your cultivation level, however, is a lot more complicated. There are mild power boosts when you go from stage to stage, but when you increase your actual cultivation level, you get a major power boost.

To kind of really give you an idea of how the game works, I'm going to describe my journey to get from Qi Condensation (cultivation level 3), to Golden Core (cultivation level 4):

As a new early Qi Condensation practitioner, my first priorities are two-fold. One, I need to upgrade my skills, because there are different skill manuals for different cultivation levels, and two, I need to increase my stage to Qi Condensation late, which will give me a pretty significant power-boost and is easy to get. For the next several months, I spend my time in and around my Sect's branch base in an area I've not really explored (I moved here after reaching Qi Condensation), doing basic missions from the sect's mission board like exterminating monsters, retrieving lost manuals, etcetera. At the same time, whenever I can, I am making friends with my fellow sect members and dual cultivating with females for cultivation xp (you can only do it with the opposite gender for some reason), and also cultivating at cultivation spots on the map if I see any nearby. When I reach the points I need to progress to middle, and then late stage Qi Condensation, I take a short trip to the nearby town and buy the pills needed to do this.

Pretty soon I realise that some of the better skill manuals in my sect are only available for higher ranked members, so I issue a challenge to a higher ranked member I'm pretty sure I can beat, and then eventually beat him in a duel and take his place. He dislikes me for this, but now I can get better skills, so who cares. As a higher rank, I am now offered more difficult missions that give better rewards, and I am able to do a few to buy some new skill manuals for my level and then spend a few months learning them and replacing my old ones.

Eventually, I'm late stage Qi Condensation, and I hit the exp requirement for Golden Core, meaning the only thing left to do is the big breakthrough to the next Cultivation Level. I need multiple breakthrough items to do this, and they are difficult and time-consuming to get. You can technically settle for a less good breakthrough by collecting fewer of the needed items, but this is a bad idea. Getting all of them gives the most stat increases, making you much stronger. What do I need? I need 6 elemental Qi Pearls, one from each element, and I need 4 Heaven and Earth items. I can get 3 of these from Spiritlock Circles, but the last I need to beat a rampaging World Boss for.

So how do I get these? Well first, I explore the entire region to find all the special points. When I've found them, I know where to go. I get the Heaven and Earth items first - I go to each spiritlock circle, give an offering to a turtle, and then have to protect him against waves of enemies and bosses for 2 minutes. I have to go and learn an AOE skill for this because it's too difficult otherwise, but I manage to do it. When the 2 minutes are up, he gives me one of the items as a reward. I repeat this two more times. Then, I go and face the world boss - he's not overly difficult because I've been getting good skill manuals from my sect and have decent passives, but it's still pretty hard.

 To get the six Qi Pearls, I need to wait for bosses to spawn in each of the six elemental zones in the region. These are hostile places where you can get attacked on sight, so I can't hang around there. I continue doing missions, participate in tournaments and wars while I wait, and one by one they eventually spawn and I run over and kill them. After 5 whole years I finally have all six, and I go back and get the items from my bank (I kept them in there because other cultivators can steal them from you) and then perform the breakthrough.

I go for the G1 Golden Core breakthrough, the highest one, because I have all items. The breakthrough only has like a 95% chance of succeeding, so I save scum just in case, but it succeeds anyway. During my breakthrough, I am able to choose a permanent 'destiny' passive. I go for one which increases my lifesteal, because I use a melee blade build which uses lifesteal pretty heavily.

Now that I'm Golden Core, I upgrade my skills and get to Late Golden Core again. I'm now one of the strongest in my sect branch, and I want a higher rank. I challenge one of the four Elders and beat two of his disciples, then him, in one on one duels. They hate me for this, but again, who cares. I am now Elder of the Sect's Treasury Department, and now only do I now have access to some of the hardest missions in the sect, but I can also allocate missions to my underlings to increase the sect's wealth.

It's all going well and good, but soon I hit a bottleneck again, and now the only way to get stronger is to breakthrough to Origin Spirit. I check what I need to do to do this and... Yeah, it might take me a while. There also happens to be a giant sea monster in the way of me getting to the place I need to go to get some of the items, and an entire questline I need to beat to deal with that.  But I'm committed now, and also my smoking hot harem of chinese cultivation girls keep giving me gifts to help me along, so how can I give up? 

There are tons of mechanics that all interweave in this game. Complex relationships, sect diplomacy, stats, character ambitions and desires, thievery, three different types of crafting, feng shui, geomancy, artefacts... There's so much I've not even touched yet, but I'm REALLY looking forward to continuing.

I'm nowhere near the end of the game and yet, after seeing how feature rich it is, how well the AI works in both combat and adventuring, I just had to give it a glowing recommendation.

Also, kudos to the people localizing this game. Even though the localization is not 100% complete it's far better than in Amazing Cultivation Simulator. The reason I emphasize this is because I value quality over quantity - these kinds of games have many similar-but-different spiritual terms and getting them to be consistent across different kinds of contexts is hard. I can tell because I read Xianxia novels and illustrated content and I see that many translators have difficulties with this.

*Amount of avaiable Martial/Spiritual Skills , a lot , currently there are 6 Martial and 6 Spiritual Skills.

I will support this game as much as I can , and as I said , the potential it has is very high not to mention it could be said it is ""finished"" due to the amount of play time avaiable it has already.

The non English translated bits I daren't touch are as intriguing as the last bits of the cultivation path (currently unfinished). There needs to be something else to it though, maybe hybrid abilities when you have two strong spiritual roots? Mixed martial arts when you have a pair of strong martial skills? Perhaps just putting body cultivation in as another option.

The map lends itself to further realms too and i'd like to see something past the end of the cultivation path. This is particularly necessary because there are only small bits where you actually feel powerful before the game adjusts the environment (and annoyingly even  current NPC's moved over with the sect) to match you. It will be rather unsatisfying if you finally get to Immortal and there's no way to rub folks noses in it because everybody is only a half-step behind.

Anyway, my latest save is corrupt and i'll look forward to speed cultivating back up toward release to see if this tops Amazing Cultivation Simulator as best in genre (or theme anyway, they're quite different games, allbeit played for the same reason).",1638397505,1638397606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The combat feels so heavily unbalanced -- between enemies whose attacks are essentially unavoidable, to the way they have arbitrary boundaries by power level.  It's way too sudden that you'll suddenly find yourself being squashed when you enter the next zone.  Each power level occurs in tiers -- and if you happen to be challenged by the next tier, you've pretty much already lost.  This becomes far more apparent when you play on higher difficulties, which kind of saps the fun out of the game.  It's not 'challenging' to take on someone stronger than you -- it's impossible.

Playing it even more, I still can not emphasize this more:

Combat needs rebalancing.  Badly.  Stat gaps even between same-level, ""Heaven's Chosen,"" characters is way out of whack.  I barely damage them and they steamroll me flat.",1636341621,1638224024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pro:
Frequent update
Good English translation.
Game mechanics recreated to fit Xianxia tropes.

Cons:
Grindy and Repetitive game play.
Some game play functions are not fully realized/implemented. 


This game is a decent gateway for those interested in the Xianxia genre. 
It manages to implement a lot of ideas and tropes while making them playable without feeling out of place.
The English translation is decent enough when compared to other games of the same genre on steam.
The game gets updated quite frequently, and big updates usually comes with new game play/systems for the player to invest in.

Unfortunately, the combat system is a bit of a letdown overall, think generic ""twin stick"" style shoot'em ups. 
As the player progress thru the game and attain more skills and special abilities, it gets less tedious overall, but it doesn't change it up enough to welcome players that dislike these style of game play.

The game comes with a progressive grind.  Each subsequent advancement the player makes on their character, more and more items and ingredients gets gated behind RNG drops from boss monsters. 

While the game tries to be as faithful as an adaptation to the source material, there are a lot of things that seems redundant. As of 29/11/21, the heroic/good and demonic/bad reputation system have minimum impact in game. Personal relationship system provide surface level benefits. There isn't much of a difference when comparing spouses/sworn parents to mentors or a random NPC with high levels of affection.",1638160172,1638160172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Many customization for your character with lots of items and skills. You are also able to roll for your starting stats and inherent abilities (Red is the best followed by orange and then purple , blue, green and grey)
The artwork is also amazing and gives off a Chinese painting style.
Combat is like a shooter where you aim and attack with the mouse. One of the best cultivation type games I have seen. I seldom review games but feel that I should give this game a review to let more people know of it.
Knowledge of Chinese language is needed as there's no English at all.
The game is getting many updates daily and developers are listening to player's request. Some newly added stuffs are like expansion of save slot from 3 to 9 slots and also added a NPC search function as there are tons of NPCs in this game as well as tagging NPCs to know their whereabouts. You can steal from NPCs, romance them , challenge them to fights , increase your XP together etc... The NPCs AI is also well done where if they lose to you, they might bribe you to spare their life or threaten you with their relatives/good friends. If you do choose to kill them, their relatives and good friends will treat you like an enemy and will look for you for revenge if their level is higher than you.

Choices also do matter in this game as some events plays out differently depending on your choice. It does get abit repetitive when you are levelled up but there are supposed to be many other stuffs that has yet to be added into the game yet.

English has been added!!!",1611992061,1637929873,True,163,2,0.922399640083312988,1,True,False,True

Jokes aside, I'd compare this game to Mount&Blade for how the world map travel works, although you play as a single character. Touhou for how combat plays, a bit of bullet hell(although many attacks are nearly impossible to dodge). With a big interpersonal relationship aspect to tie the both together. Kill someone and their friends/family will hunt you down. Marry someone, and you'll find the rest of their family comes to like you. My wife is an absolute legend who constantly brings me extremely rare cultivation books that she has no possible way to obtain, so I continue to handfeed her the materials she needs to improve her cultivation.

Have fun with the first attempt of play through. Try to reroll another character with things that you've learned, once you get the hang of the fundamental. It is a game on ""cultivation"". The path to immortality is long and challenging. Your character ages as you play and gain lifespan after reaching a new tier of cultivation. While this is a single player game, there are tons of NPC's moving around the towns and interact with  you in a positive or negative way, mostly your choice. If you hurt their families, they will go after you. You can fall in love, form bonds with NPC's. You can join sect - clan or guild - and participate in sect war.

I would recommend this game. You may check out some of my in-game videos.

Well if you want details read below:

Tale of Immortal (Gang Bang Guang in Chinese:)) is a great sanbox with persistent story, choices, and endless character build customisation possibilities. Set up in the world of classic Chinese martial arts, you are to go from a useless nobody to leader of one of the sects or more. The world here is alive, and is not centered on your character - it has similar system to what Space Rangers 2 have for example - your character is merely one of the actors, NPC's are not static, they have dynamic relationships with each other, then clear bosses, missions, factions fight each other and develop and compete with you. Kill each other, too. The game is still in beta, but is already fully playable.

General pro's, why would you want this game:
-Sandbox, you choose you path in this vivid dynamic world
-Endless character build customisation. I say ""endless"" because Western players who never played any other cultivation/CMA games likely cannot even comprehend the possibilities that are present here
-Interesting combat. NPC's and even monsters (certain bosses) are no pushovers, especially in Soul Formation (VII) and later stages.
-Choice and consequence. Choose wisely, your choices will have a profound efffect on gameplay.
-Super fitting music that you'd not grow bored of
-Graphics are decent, yet at the same time game is very well optimised, it can run on very old laptop or a wooden PC. But still, SSD and AMD processor is advised, since there is a lot to calculate with 2k NPCs being in constant move
-It can't replace Age of Wulin/Wuxia/LKF of course as it being a singleplayer game, but it can help alleviate nostalgia for players of these old masterpieces:)

""A matter of preference"" moments:
-This game is grindy. For people like me this is good - I am kinda tired of other games, where after initial struggle you basically steamroll everything in lategame, and here it is not the case, you'll only struggle more with level:) But, people who want an easy effortless ride might find this a bit too hard for them.
-Only one save per game, kind of lite version of Ironman is the only available way to save. I love it, I think the inability to abuse saves makes your adventure more realistic, and it makes your choices to be based not only on what you WANT to do, but also on what you CAN do. But, again, I know many casual people won't like that, so keep that in mind.

Negative things that are still present:
-English translation is not fully completed. When it is done, I will update my review. But so far it is like about 50% of all texts are translated. But they are making rapid progress on that and I'm sure we'll see a decent English translation of everything by the end of the year.
-Sect war is a work in progress, so it may work a bit weird for now. They are also working on improving it so it is to be updated in the future.

Overall 10/10 A worthy buy not only for CMA universes fans, but is a must have for any RPG/choose-your-own-adventure enjoyer. 100% worth.",1637562213,1637562213,True,38,4,0.799465656280517578,0,True,False,True

I can't wait for future updates. We really need english tho, even if partial, because when some things are in chinese it doesn't really matter, as long as the important gameplay features are translated.

Edit: English is here, i am honestly really happy about that. The translation needs some work, but everything is well adjusted to english language so I am impressed. I just have to wait for more content because I maniacally played the game without sleeping so I am kinda done with the main story and will sometimes play on the hardest difficulity.

New: The devs are really competent and have a good plan for the game.

First of all, the story line is ok with quite alot of events which won't make you feel bored, but the more you grind, the more you may experience repeatable things. That means you should keep improving to unlock more. I don't wanna spoil but with each higher stage of cultivation you will reach different areas and features. So, keep moving forward or I mean, get good!

Secondly, the character building is a plus to me, you will see a variety in destiny and characteristics. Therefore, your gameplay would be enormously different depends on who or how you choose to be. You don't need to be good or bad in game, you only need to be creative and enjoy the game.

Thirdly, the still-need-to-improve part to me is skills and translation, I know, it's hard to translate this type and it takes time that's the reason why it would be so annoying sometimes. And the skills will become boring easily once you get into mid-game forward as the effects still the same and noting special.

WISHLIST
- Having children
- Have a family/clan management system similar to the Sect
- Have events for your descendants (EX: Offending a powerful cultivator and your clan may be wiped, or become a slave to that person, and many more)
- Having children is harder in later cultivation stages. Easier in the lower realms but the cons is that you are not powerful enough to defend your clan due to your cultivation level

- More complex and robust random events such as a Young Master that offends you. With Big clans/families behind them
- More Complex Sect Management System
- Sect members being able to contribute by providing materials, cultivation manuals 
- More Sect activities to interact with your senior brothers and sisters. Including Elders and Grand elder. Supposedly even the Patriarch themselves
- Additional positions like Guest elders, and a position for retiring elders staying in the sect until their lifespan ends (provided that they dont see any more chance of breaking through the next stage)


- More Robust and complex Cultivation System. Where minor Dao, Major Dao and Grand Dao that exists (only matters in higher cultivation realms)
- A more meaningful Talent System.  Set of Physiques 
- A new path. On top of the Daoist Path, A body forging path focuses on physical attacks and defense like in the novels. 

Talent System should have 3 sections and make it more robust compared to the current game now. 
- Talent for Comprehension (Insight) - How great are you comprehending Dao. You may be limited to breakthrough at later stages if you have low comprehension. 
- Talent of the element (Spirit Root) - Has something to do with comprehensions of Elemental Dao too like Dao of Fire. It also has something to do with your body. Will explain later 
- Talent of the body (physique)
Note: These talents are interchangeably relating to each other. I will explain below

INSIGHT wouldn't matter much in the lower realms. You don't have to complete or comprehend a Dao at this stages. What matters more is how solid and perfect your foundation is (your body as a vessel). 

Thats why when you are starting, your physique and Spirit root matters. Example: 

I am born with a emperor Yang PHYSIQUE. which means I have good INSIGHT for FIRE and YANG related DAO.  My Spirit root is also high in FIRE and YANG elements. Now this is the importance of cultivation. Right now in the game, you can change your cultivation manuals. Because you only use them for four things (basic attacks, Movement, Special and Ultimate Attacks). 

Techinically what I am saying is that we don't have any cultivation manuals TOWARDS OUR OWN CULTIVATION. What am I saying? In the novels we read, cultivators practices a manual because they use it to advance their realms. So in my situation, I can use a FIRE/YANG Manuals and with this I can easily advance my cultivation. I may not even require a pill to breakthrough smaller stages (middle and late stages). Or even Large breakthroughs (next level realm). Because I am perfectly taking advantage of my PHYSIQUE, INSIGHT and SPIRIT ROOT to use a CULTIVATION MANUAL that complements it. 

Now to add something interesting, there will be LEVELS of Cultivation Manuals. A Foundation Cultivation Manual, can only get you to Advance to a Foundation Establishment. There will be a huge penalty when breaking through to Golden Core because your Manual sucks and is shitty. So your chances of breaking through is close to ZERO. You can eat pills that lets you breakthrough (not a perfect one due to a lack of Foundation too) but your Talent will severely penalized. We called this pills in the novels something forbidden. Its something cultivators only use when they see no chance of breaking through anymore. So they get contented to eat it and stop in the next cultivation level. But monstrous genius from a lower realm may still defeat them due to their SOLID FOUNDATIONS.

Sure, the combat is straightforward - basically a Binding of Isaac style room-based shooter for the most part - but the rest of the systems don't even have an analog, and are all quite fun.

The progression system is unique; you do not get XP from killing or completing quests.  You essentially only get XP from exploring the world and cultivating at various locations.  But once your XP bar hits breakthrough points, you need to find the right items to progress to the next level - usually acquired from bosses.  You also have to progress through your sect to acquire skillbooks, because while leveling up improves your basic stats, you still need to learn higher level skills.

Each area - unlocked after 2 breakthroughs - introduces more new and interesting mechanics.  The second area introduces artifacts and artifact spirits, and the third area has some new quirks to the way leveling up works as well, giving you more choices on how to advance your character.

There are other systems - relationships, the recent sect update changes how sects work, there are arenas and auctions, etc.

In spite of having so many different moving pieces, everything in ToI fits well together.  The systems supplement each other well, and it is just plain fun.

 - 评价之前，想说这款游戏很完美的把以前看修仙小说修仙爽文的那种快感展示了出来，以前一直各种想象要是有一款真正的修仙游戏该多好。如果你曾经有过这种想法，可以往下接着看。

喜欢沙盒开放世界成长类的游戏的人 强烈推荐这款游戏
就像骑砍一样你觉得你很厉害了带着100人的满级骑兵乱晃，总有人能带着200满编枪兵混骑兵制裁你
这款游戏也是一样，每当你觉得你修为无敌的时候总有你打不过的人
换句话说一直都有提升空间
自由度很高，有各种奇遇，能带给你为我独尊的感觉但是就像小说里边一样，你的修为还可以更牛逼。

The graphics and the gameplay is so good that even after playing it for hundreds of hours, you'd still find new things to do. Of course, this may differ from each player but I honestly think that with the new updates they've put out and all the subsequent updates coming soon (not to mention the final product), it will be worth the money. It does have repetitive grinding and it can get a bit dull with some breakthroughs having the same mechanics just slightly different from each other though I hope they improvise it soon but like I said, there's tons of other things to do too. You can roleplay as a demonic cultivator who kills all their enemies and directly opposes Heavenly Chosen NPCS, side with the dark side and cause absolute chaos. Or you can roleplay as an ordinary cultivator who started at the bottom but rises to the top and do good (essentially acting as the protagonist). You can cultivate disciples, lead your own sect, fight in a sect tournament and bring glory. And even after, you can also reply your gameplay if you'd like to try other builds or try some self-imposed challenge. 

But like some have said, the quests are far from many and I also find it lacking at times but this doesn't take away the enjoyment you'd get from playing it.

60 hours with 1 completed playthrough and 2 attempts at higher difficulty.

People are giving this game a negative review after only clocking in a few hours, equivalent to reading the first 30 pages of a book and saying "" It has no plot ""

The game offers 2 way to progress:
-Take the easy route and receive mediocre stat upgrades.
-Grind a bit / headhunt rare spawns for larger stat upgrades.

Honestly, the ""grinding"" isn't even bad, 5-6 encounters where you oneshot screens to assemble and orb of which you need 6 orbs total.

The grind times are entirely based on your own competence in creating a build of which there are MANY to choose from.

You can probably do the current content of the game in roughly 20-30 hours depending on a bit of luck.

The runt that I completed the content in, took about 50 hours and that was because I decided to hit the soft cap of ALL skill schools before moving onto the next zone which requires you to wait for monthly vendor resets while grinding currency to purchase the refreshed stock.


The biggest challenge for this game is its struggle with translations. Up untill a few months ago of writing this review, the game didn't even have english support.

I believe the current situation for the devs is a struggle to choose between delaying general content release for the majority of their audience which is Chinese (Game had 90k reviews prior to even releasing english support) or wait longer for the release of content to allow the translators to catch up.

I've played for over 50 hours have I'm just starting to learn the intricate details of how to build a character. I would definitely recommend this game to a friend, and already have.

For a more in depth review, the game in its current state is well worth the price. I typically get through most games in 20-40 hours, and beat it, and don't feel a need to revisit. This game is not in that category. From character creation to alignment, choices matter. Interactions with NPCs matter. The world evolves, and it matters. The element you choose to focus on, artifact you equip, potions you take with you and dungeons you enter all matter. It's very detailed, and to make a truly powerful character, you need to make a coordinated effort to align everything. As you progress, you choose new special skill from a few choices. Stacking them properly matters. Everything matters, and it makes the game great. I had 2 characters be very mortal before I made one that started to resemble anything close to an immortal. The only drawback is the game can get a bit grindy at times.

Unfortunately, the game is not fully english yet but this should be fixed in the coming updates.
The developers are pretty active on updates from what i can tell and seem to be trying their best to make a quality game.
With the soon to be released workshop access this game will definitely have a lot of replayability on top of the already random and diverse content available.

The simplest way to explain this game is an Open World Roguelike RPG based around Eastern Asian Fantasy.
Some people may dislike the game for a lack of indepth tutorials, but i think the basic tutorial on how to play is enough.
This puts you into the shoes of your character who is new to this world and trying to make their way as a legend or powerhouse of the lands. You learn as you play it brings a refreshing experience.

While currently there are some major issues with the game translation due in big part to the last patch they didn't translate yet I still strongly advise you to try this game out. They are working actively on it and the content already in there is truly great. Last patch added more dept to the martial art sects and if that patch was any indication for the rest of the game, this is going to be a great game all around with a LOT of dept in the systems. (already is in most regards despite its half completed state.) 

Despite the fact that it is still in development, the bases are solid enough for the game to not feel empty or unsatisfying. Combat is a challenge (don't take the easy difficulty as any indication, it gets PAINFUL when you go unlock higher ones) and you can develop pretty nice stories with the proceduraly generated npc rp content. In my last run my girlfriend I was trying to marry got mortally wounded by someone I antagonized. She fought against him a few times but at some point she got done in. I had 1 year to complete my next lvl up that would unlock the possibility to make an elixir to fix her body. I got the level up, by doing a few hairbrained schemes, constantly hounded by my numerous enemies more powerful than myself, got the recipie, finally get the herbs... only to arrive to make the pill on the day of her final death, too far for me to administer it, my save too far in to save her in any way. I then just wenth on a rampage on my enemies, damn the consequences, only to make more and die a dog's death.

If you're looking for a finished game you're not getting it. This game as a very active development bringing big changes complete core mechanics being redone is usual business.

This game is developed Chinese first since that's the biggest market share. We are not used to that so translations being later we find stupid. But for people who normally play in Russian Spanish or anything but English this should be more common.

This game has an insane amount of depth and you can sink hundreds of hours into it.


Overall: 
Buy the game if you want to play it right now and are fine with starting new saves when big changes happen. (or just roll back to the older update to continue your save)

Don't buy the game if you expect your modern cash grab early access game

Though the game still has it's last two realms locked until future update.

Warning to people thinking of buying the game. This game is very grind heavy, every major realm requires you to grind out special items to advance into the next major realm and every skill needs you to grind them out of level or grind out the right material that speeds up skills lvl. Also you need to grind comprehension items to reroll your skills buffs.  Grind for better rarity manual skills, alchemy item ect.
So if you don't enjoy repeated grinding this game might not be for you.

You can move at your own pace, there is no race to go up realms besides your Lifespan however even after all these hours played I haven't even reached 70 years old yet.

The social aspect of the game is a bit bland at time, people will either like you or they don't based on alignment (from what I can tell) as well as your charisma. Most of the time you can still get them to like you late game with gifting them items. However having friends, masters and family can make other npcs reconsider killing you if you are being hunted.

Combat is pretty basic as well, have bigger numbers and try and avoid attacks as much as possible while hitting your opponent with you own. While each cultivation path may be unique in some areas such as their personal buffs they mostly feel the same in how they work. Also some paths have MUCH better buffs in their skills then others making other paths seem pointless.

Overall I still think the game is good and has a lot of potential for growth in the future, looking forward to the sect update and the last two realms being unlocked.",1634787412,1634787412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I got it suggested through Steam earlier this year and found it interesting. I can't read Chinese, which kept me from buying it, but I still put it on my wish list. Now with the implementation of the English translation, which is really good, I could finally buy and play the game.

I love that you can change the title screen with 3 designs and different music. You can also save them on your PC and set them as wallpaper. I don't know this from any other game. You can also have all the announcements displayed in the title screen, just like updates, patches, what will be integrated in the future or even what is technically not possible at the moment. Flawless communication directly in the game without having to search for it! ((... I wish this for some other games as well ...))

Attention: It should be mentioned that this game is completely text-based and no words are spoken, neither by the NPC's nor by your own character. This could be off-putting for some, but the story is nevertheless beautifully and atmospherically told.

The game is based on Chinese mythology which is very interesting. The developers have chosen a good setting, as there is a lot of room for ideas and creativity. 

The evolution of the character is very complex, there are many things to consider and you should read carefully if it suits your own play style. There are many ways to develop skills and link the four elements to them.

The map layout is built like a grid, which means that each ""move"" of the player corresponds to one day. Each month has 30 days (thus 30 moves), then you have to move to the next month.  This means that the world changes (explored caves are reset and recreated, new possible random encounters, as well as some events the character has heard of) based on the player's choices. Even if the player ignores it, a change will take place.

So far, a beautiful game that I can recommend 100%, even in Early Access. I am curious how it will continue in the future.",1634196948,1634196948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Also, disregard the note about permadeath. If you, as me, are not a hardcore player and just like grindy gameplay, then you simply have to adopt and follow the Dao of Alt+F4.

====================================

In general, the game is very addictive. There are always lots of things to do, so it is head to leave it and go tend to other stuff. 
I love how it follows all those Chinese fantasy tropes, that a regular reader of xianxia novels should be quite familiar with. If you arren't one of these people, it may be a fresh experience for you as well.
I really hope devs will make something about all these load screens. It feels like we are playing 2 separate games, one is the main map, the other is the fighting mode, and every time we switch between them, it feels like we restart the other game (3-10 seconds of load screen time). I'm fine with the waiting time at the end of the month - we have had a similar thing in civilization-alike games for many years already. But these load screens really annoy me a lot.
Besides that, sometimes you run into fights that you weren't supposed to because there is no way to tell the strength of the enemy if it is an event fight. But, I guess, on the second playthrough I won't get into these frustrating situations.
The same goes for dying at hands of the family members of a person you killed later. Even if you saw a warning about that on your load screen, you still have to step on the rakers to learn from mistakes. 
Do inspect other people's power before making any decisions like helping them (consider that they may backstab you) or attacking them if they are robbing you. This world is harsh, so endure until you get stronger.

Update: I dropped my first character after getting somewhere around the 7th power realm, and started a new one, on the 3rd difficulty (out of 5). The first playthrough is indeed mandatory because you must learn the ways of this game.  On the new difficulty, it gets more interesting, because you have to choose your build more carefully, and min-max your stats before approaching the hardest challenges. 
My wife was killed by someone, and I didn't even have a chance to help, but later NPC helped me and she said she used a mark on me. Maybe marking your spouse can help somehow, I haven't tested it yet. 

Advices:
1. Using red quality pills allows fighting an enemy from one major realm above you. 
It is important to get yourself red-level active and passive skills, and roll their stats. This also amounts to a power gap of 1-2 smaller realms. Because of that, you must grind duels to some extent.
2. Having a stock of money is important, or you'll miss good opportunities in random encounters.
3. The best advice for getting money - use auctions. You can auction any orange or red item, but manuals are the best, and can fets 10-30x of their price. You can buy the manuals you don't need from your sect using contribution points, and then sell for a huge fortune. Obviously, you may also find gook skill manuals there, but you need a huge amount of money to buy them. But if your items have been auctioned first, you still may have them by the time you need them.
4. Ascending with the best foundation is important (very similar to the novels). Makes your life much easier after ascending, though becomes irrelevant once you reach the peak of your current major realm.
5. If you have a stock of sect contribution points, after ascending it is better to cultivate quickly at your sect up to the peak of your major realm.
6. You should have learned approximate power levels within a new territory. Each territory usually coves content of 2 major realms. When you come to a new place, you can only farm l2 dungeons. After you get to the peak realm or after you get a least blue grade (of your current realm) main attack, you can attempt l3. Once you get min-max rolled purple/red skills and passives for your realm, with stats that suit your build, you can attempt l4 dungeons and ascension content. l5 content can be dealt with after ascending to the second major realm of the territory. Note that quests on the furthest edge of the territory are intended for the power level of the peak of the second major realm, as they may be a part of your progression to the next territory.",1631089877,1633760102,True,7,0,0.596306085586547852,0,True,False,True

<Features>
•Cultivation levels/Breakthroughs: 
The game really uses the same concepts as wuxia themed manhua! Like Qi Condensation state, to the Golden Core state, and to much later states like the Nascent Soul
•Partnership/Spouse/Sworn Brother or Sister/Master or Apprentice [systems]
•The Auction Hall: The infamous auction hall that you see in every manhua! This game has it! I really love this feature.
•Storyline & Plenty of Side Encounters
•Various Sects to join or you can be a Rogue Cultivator! 
Sects provide you benefits and a yearly wage + you can also climb up the ranks from Disciple, Inner Disciple, Elder, etc.
•THE GAME IS STILL UPDATING! There is so much of this game that has yet to touch on. 
Like becoming a Sect Leader or the various starting artifacts that completely shape the way you play your campaign! 
Really thankful that they finally translated this game to English!


<Combat>
Point-click shooter style. 
You have a motion skill, auto attack skill, special skill, and an ultimate skill at one given time.
How this varies is through the various selection you can choose from;

Martial Skills: Spear, Palm, Fist, Finger, Blade, and Sword
Spiritual Roots: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Lightning

Well, simply put, it's a 2D Sandbox that lets you have a Wuxia-style adventure.  While it is still in Early Access and a lot of the features are kinda bare bones, it certainly does have its charm.  However, while it does have its side activities, the core gameplay loop is relatively simplistic at this time once you leave the tutorial area.

It goes a little something like this: You go to a new area.  Explore a bit, locate all the towns, cities, and sects.  You get invited to a couple of sidequests you're not ready for, but will engage in once you've improved your cultivation enough.  You join a sect that sells manuals for the combat style you like.  Then, you farm money, Mayor Decrees, and Sect Currency so you can buy the manuals you need to improve your character's strength.  Once done, you begin cultivating.  

You gather ki until you reach a bottleneck, and then use pills purchased in the city to break through for an increase in stats.  Then, once you reach the max for that cultivation rank, you go hunting for the item or items needed to break through to the next rank.  Every other rank, you're given three options for your level of breakthrough, which can be broken down to Easy, Medium, and Hard.  The level of difficulty (Read, items needed to upgrade) has a direct correlation to how much your stats increase.  Gathering the items involves fighting bosses, gathering items, and performing alchemy to create pills.  While not all breakthroughs require pills, some will, so don't neglect alchemy.  Gather everything you need, breakthrough.  Complete two major breakthroughs and it is time to move to the next region.

Lather, rinse, repeat.  Later on, you gain access to things like creating artifacts, artifact spirits, and other side activities, and there will be various side missions that will grant items and bonuses, but at the core, the game is simple.  It's just that these can be a large amount of grinding involved.  However, there's also the issue of Destinies, major bonuses that can have a major impact on your character's growth and development, and unfortunately, they're randomized.  At character creation, you choose three from a list of nine, and at each breakthrough, you pick one from a list of six.  You can savescum in all but the hardcore mode of the game to get something good, or vital for a build, but be prepared for a lot of it if the Destiny involved is a rare one.

Combat is simple enough, guiding a character with the ASDW keys and aiming attacks with the mouse.  You have normal, special, mobility, and ultimate attacks.  There's six martial styles, and six elemental styles that a player can choose attacks from.  Typically, moves from within the same style have synergy, abilities that work off of one another.

But the real ""star"" of the show is the social system.  Let's get this out of the way first: This is a very active world you're jumping into, with characters with their own personalities, preferences, and agendas.  Having high charisma and getting along with others can grant you a lot of benefits, while having low charisma and getting on peoples' bad side will get you a lot of headaches.  If you have a strong reputation and are well liked by many people, it will open a lot of doors for you that might otherwise remain shut.  A bad reputation and having many people hate you will mean that, in addition to dealing with everything you need for cultivation, you'll regularly have to deal with people jumping in and attacking you for no other reason than they hate you.

But with all of that said, can I recommend this game?  I.... guess so.  The game can be really grindy at times, but if you don't mind grinding and are a fan of the genre, there's a lot of potential to this game.

I have no idea if the devs plan to improve the localization but there's a lot of awkward phrasing, and some of the skill tooltips are kind of unclear what they actually mean.

That said, the gameplay is pretty solid for a cultivation game.   As expected of the genre you start off as a 1st realm nobody.  Early abilities are pretty basic - ""I shoot one projectile every few seconds"" kind of stuff.  The combat is a kind of bullet hell esque thing, but frankly your stats matter more than your dodging mostly (at least at the Normal difficulty).  I've only had a few fights where I went ""huh, if I'd played a little better I could have won that"" as opposed to ""okay, that guy was 2 realms above me, there was literally nothing I could have done""

I'm the kind of guy who enjoys taking his time with things and the game doesn't rush you.  As long as you're not an asshole who pisses off a bunch of other people, generally you can take your time and do what you want to grow stronger.  There's various story quests and endless procedural ""go kill a monster over here"" quests.  Again, some of these are better localized than others.  

In combat, you have 4 active abilities, which can be broken down into ""Regular Attack move"";""Special Attack move"" (which costs MP), ""Movement skill"", and ""ULTIMATE MOVE"" which usually has some kind of pre-requisite condition before it can be unleashed which varies from skill to skill.  These seem to get easier as you get farther in the game, both because the requirements are lower on higher tier versions and because you have a lot more ways to fulfill them.  

I have only played on Normal so far so all my comments will be based on that difficulty.  There are 4 more difficult settings, but you have to unlock them by getting to various stages of the game on Normal first.  

I have tried 3 main branches of attacks so far - Sword, Wind and Lightning.  Lightning and Sword both felt pretty satisfying.  I haven't used Wind much since the start of the game, but I probably should go back and give it a try since I have a Destiny that lets me use Wind and Lightning Ultimate techniques instantly.    I've seen some pretty crazy Blade users (What's the difference between a Blade and a Sword?  Blades seem to be axes, daggers, and 'jagged swords', whereas Swords arts are much more clean and holy looking, mostly, but this is one of those localization issues I was mentioning).  Spear and Water are the only two styles I haven't seen anything impressive out of.",1631752116,1631752116,True,9,0,0.629683971405029297,0,True,False,True

The abilities comes with different rarities and affixes which means combat is always refreshing and you can always find ways to make your build stronger so progression is very horizontal. Also, there is a great deal of abilities and combinations. 

While it certainly does not hold your hand and has alot of complexity, most things can be figured out intuitively, unlike some other games (yes you amazing cultivator sim) which its impossible without a guide and even then.

Some feedback:
the time mechanics at the end of each month, where you get this clock circle on screen feels really long, that coupled with you getting multiple request from other characters really interrupting the flow of gameplay.  The game kind of forces you to interact which is ok but sometimes i want to do something else. I dont know if it gets better with travel speed though (more travel before the end of month?)

The other thing is inventory management. Im not a fan of limited inventory. Its always full and I have to keep putting things in storage in a town, things that I dont even know what are they for, which means I just forget they exist. Really hard when items have wierd names and huge text for description. 
 If your in town the game needs to act as if your inventory and storage are the same thing becuase its really annoying to go back and forth between screens to get specifically 20 bear pelts to turn in a mission or check if you have enough qi to craft water qi. Also, quality of life buttons should be added to transfer items between inventory and storage in bulk.

On the note of quality of life, keyboard shorcuts needs to be used more to navigate menus and selections when interacting with events/characters",1631375664,1631375664,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,True

So far this game seems to be the best xianxia game out there and kinda nails a lot of aspects of most xianxia novels/mahuas so if you are interested in these kind of histories/worlds you should definetly give it a try, the game is tough af at certain points but also very enjoyable, just to put you how suprisingly good this game is out of my 50h 20-25 where in a row beein 30 the ammount of hours i was awake durin that session.

If you havent ever heard about wuxia or xianxia histories i cant recommend you the game at all and more how ""weirdly uncommon"" these kind of gameplay/type of games are currently, this is no casual game where you understand the whole game within 10 minutes of gameplay, it keeps gettin more and more complex with a crap ton of skills with different modifiers, different roots that affects specific stats, etc...

The cultivation aspect of this game is nearly perfect, you get rare resources that will help you breakthough from your current cultivation, and, dependin which cultivation you are you can choose which cultivation base you want but ofc, the one that gives you the more stats is at the same time the hardest to prepare, even if you manage to get all the items if you did not prepare items with high purity, durin the breakthrough, you may face Divine Tribulation. The cultivation is tough and sometimes takes a lot of time which is, how it should be, if it didnt take too long to breakthrough or the resources were to easy to get and find this game should not be called a xianxia game. Doin a breakthrough is insanely rewardin, probably the best ""feeling"" of progress i've experienced durin the last years in any videogame.

Another point to talk about is the OST, is top notch, if you dont believe me just go to youtube for example and try to find the ""Spirit of Taoism"" track, you will understand me when i say this OST is one of the best released this year if not the best. 

There are a lot of problems ofc like NPCs, i personally think the devs can remove them and the game will be 1 trillion times better, NPC interactions are so bad that you can literally get your stuff stolen by a friend and thiefs are, almost always, one cultivation level above you so forget about keepin your stuff.

Overall, good stuff, i cant express how amazin this game is, i hope the devs will add at some point higher realms and remake the artifacts which are currently a complete utter garbage.",1631053233,1631137435,True,0,0,0.435381621122360229,0,True,False,True

The game isn't complete by any measure, and the bullet hell mechanics isn't anything to write home about, but the hybrid ""Hero Management/RPG relations"" side of the game is fun enough to keep players engaged.

The game has many subtleties, and I'm not kidding when I say that you will need a few retries. The character creator menu is really important to get you started, and there's no real guide out there that can help you decide how to creator your new hero (yet). The only suggestion I can give is to make sure that you have Extraordinary Charisma, or talking with NPCs will be that much more difficult. Perception and Luck are also important, and you only really need ONE Martial/Spiritual Art to be the main focus. Until the mid-game, you won't need to worry too much about the other Arts (trust me).

The game is full of fateful encounters true to the Xianxia genre. With many paths and builds to take, each play through has the potential to be a new adventure of its own. Be careful of the enemies you make though, as each NPC has social and familial relaitonships of their own and they will seek revenge. Link in the webnovels of the genre it is possible to defeat an enemy whose power level is on a different level than yours, but this requires adequate planning and preparation.

That said, there are some points I didn't like, as is pretty much bound to happen in most games. Here they are:
This is something of a sandbox cultivation game. The story is very loose and only serves to nudge you along further in your path of cultivation. It won't have you grabbing your mouse and staring with wide eyes by any margin. Once that is realised then you start to look at whether or not it is a good sandbox game.  Can you do anything you want? Pretty much.... there's nobody to stop you from not going on a rampage if you want, or from trying to be a do gooder and be in everyone's good graces, or trying to woo  every lady you meet (hark all ye harem wuxia novels out there :D). That said, to me at least there are two things that are most important in any sandbox game to feel worthwhile long term: 

1. The player must be able to affect the world. 
2. The world must be able react authentically to the player. 

And it is here where this nice little indie game falls short. To be honest I'm not surprised. Its something that any sandbox game will struggle with, no matter developed by a small or large number of people. The two things sound simple but I'm sure anyone can imagine how difficult they would be in practice since they basically have limitless scope. 
That said, realistically speaking, what I can expect is that if I am a Grand Elder in a particular sect, that some pipsqueak kid of one of the disciples does not come to attack me, then get defeated, and then threaten me that if I kill him, his mommy (who is just a pathetic little disciple in the sect) will ""deal with me"". Not going to happen kiddo. 
What I also do not expect is for everyone everywhere to be aware of who is fighting whom, and who is killing whom despite the said fights happening in the middle of nowhere. 

Moving on to the next big thing that goes against this game - grinding. This game is a huge grindfest. And if that wasn't enough, there's heavy rng involved in particular things, which just multiplies the grinding exponentially. Now I don't mind grinding if it is fun. But here it is just too repetitive to be fun. There will be a lot of loading screens you'll have to go through if you're grinding a particular realm or for artifacts, and the fact that this game has a moving timeline which saves every month, thats also like a loading screen in itself considering the time it takes to make the save and give all alerts for the month. 

There are a few more nitpicks like lack of in game explanations of various systems, but the game is still EA and translation is being worked on, so I'll hold out on that. Considering this is first cut translation, its quite good. I was hoping this would be the wuxia / xianxia game that would hit the sweet spot for me, but it wasn't to be. Lets see though, there's more to come here, and if they improve some of the things mentioned above, it could get close-ish for me.

Overall Rating: 6/10

Pros:
+Some pretty drawings, especially for the characters.
+Engaging character creator (best part of game)
+Cute references to Chinese folklore
+Relaxing (if a bit repetitive) travel music
+Downloadable menu art
+Lots of hot characters running around the world for the player to stare at while calming down in the face of the annoying game mechanics :).

Cons:
-Annoying game mechanics.
-Character progression is strictly tier-based, and you have to do a confusing farming process for each one.
-Any enemies outside of the player's current tier will either be ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard, and the moment you switch tiers, the difference is staggering.
-The player can be forced into encounters with the ridiculously hard npcs. 
-There is no way to tell whether some encounters are above the player's tier.
-The combat itself is pretty basic repetitive rpg stuff, with worse graphics than other games that have done it before.
-The npc AI can randomly steal your stuff, and only rng or frequent save scumming can protect you. They can take extremely high value items from you.
-Travel on the map is often interrupted by random, choose-your-own-adventure style events that don't always make sense, and are sometimes useless for how much they interrupt you
-Travel on the map is also interrupted by the monthly(game time) update system, which is kind of cool at first, but gets really old. It sort of plays like Civilization, but the only things this provides are opportunities for random grinding, and opportunities for the npcs to randomly annoy you/steal from you.
-There is no way for characters of the same gender to date/marry, so if you made yourself a hot waifu player character, you will have no choice but to get with the male npcs if you want to experience the romance mechanic. 
-You will also be constantly harassed by random npcs looking for dates.",1630890203,1630890203,False,7,3,0.519446253776550293,0,True,False,True

1. Cultivate (Gain Experience) for a while. 
2. Hunt for good manuals for the one or two skills you are focusing on. 
3. Hunt down and grind bosses for materials so you can advance your Cultivation. 
4. See step 1. 
This does not change at all throughout the game, and with the lack of a really complying main story your  only objective is to gain power. Forever. But hey at least you get really flashy techniques the more you progress right? Right now it's a very hollow game right now from the npc cultivators that all act essentially the same way (the only difference being whether they like you or want to beat you to death) to the mindless and almost relaxing combat that is almost entirely a stat check every time. You either have the stats to beat the thing or you don't, unless that is, if you're a Blade Cultivator the far and away best path since it gives you life steal. You'll also have no idea what each path does starting out or what their abilities will do, so you're just hoping it's gonna actually be good when you join a Sect and start developing it.

As a fan of old school roguelikes and Xcom, I adore the emergent story I can read into this game. The art style is fun and the English translation is almost completely comprehensible. The gameplay is roguelike-lite mixed with Diablo-lite mixed with high strategy-lite. There are enough surface levels of each to create a pleasant overall experience if you like those genres.

There are three modes of play: Overworld, battlefield, and town. In the overworld you travel one day per tile, and each tile might have an event or an enemy or a town on it. You don't need to consume food or any other resource to travel. At the end of the month character relationships and world events progress. You can also teleport from town to town to save travel time.

Town mode lets you buy and sell items, craft potions, accept missions, and access your stash. Different towns seem to have different items generally available.

Battle mode is Diablo-ish. At the moment, it's pretty barebones. There are many magic and martial elements you can use, but some are clearly better than others at the moment. You have four slots for attacks: Martial/Spiritual, Special, Motion (dodge or charge), and Ultimate. My combination of skills hasn't procced any bonuses yet, but there's a lot of ""consumes stacks of (insert condition) on target to deal extra damage"" text on your cooldown skills. I have an ultimate Lightning ability which requires me to have instakilled three enemies before I can use it, and it took me forever to realize I needed a Martial/Special skill which performs a specific instakill trigger before I can get those stacks. I finally found a Blade skill which has that text, though I've not yet gotten the three instakills needed to proc my ultimate.

In my opinion, cooldowns need to be shorter and there need to be more attack slots for combat to be satisfying. Most of my combat time is spent waiting for my fun abilities to be available.

Also, experience rates need to be adjusted. You gain experience all over the place, but you're gated behind rituals before you're allowed to progress. The ritual quests themselves are fun and don't take terribly long if you simply want to complete them without 100%ing them for extra stat bonuses, but a player should never be in a place where they're gaining fistfuls of experience they simply can't use unless they're deliberately remaining at a lower level of power for the moment so they can achieve a better breakthrough.

I like the game. So far I've gotten my seventeen bucks' worth. It looks like the devs have plans for much deeper and broader gameplay, and if that's true, I foresee this being one of my most played titles.",1630843979,1630843979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Even though i have only liked multiplayer games this far i have to say this game is very fun. Also the art is beautiful. The game feels immersive and rises heartbeat each time the month has to be skipped as i have so many enemies they come looking for revenge. Even though the combat has only 4 skills, there is a large variety to choose from and it doesn't feel so limited, especially after you get artifacts around qi condensation realm. 

Of course there is some bugs and so on but none of them has come between me and enjoying the game. If the game keeps getting updates i see potential in it. It's well worth the price already and i'm not even nearly done playing.

Just a tip for those who are broke, Just farm those breakthrough materials from like land of spirits and those sorts, put them up in auction with lower reserve then suggested and they usually sell well, the first tier qi orbs sell well as well, highest i got from 1 qi orb was like 5k with maybe 1 min effort of killing the beast next to a city.

Also if you find someone with a lot of spirit stones without any connections, way lower realm then you and no friends, you can just farm them. Mark them and then just keep stealing the spirit stones. They are too scared to fight you when they notice it and can't run away either. It's best done in towns as you can rest in inns for stamina back. Keep repeating it till the month ends and then you can follow to the targets new location as you marked them. 

Got like 35k that way easily, the target was foundation late without any parents nor friends but after a year i see him in the third area being qi condensation late with like origin level parents and golden core master or something while me being qi condensation late, happy little incidents. He and his parents were still too scared to come at me though as i would put them six feet under eventually. Moral of the story is that pick your opponents well, they might be favored by the heavens and have parents pop out of nowhere like mushrooms in rain.

When i was still gathering the breakthrough materials to reach qi condensation realm i got farmed by one girls family who i killed for some bounty mission i think. Husband, mother and father all qi condensation late, can't run nor kill them on foundation (which i was back then) so lost like 6 resurrection jades or so for them and had to make a hurried breakthrough attempt to qi condensation with 2 bad items so got worse stats then possible and very bad elixir with like 30% success, failed the try but then passed through the lightning and got there and defeated all of them easily :D

First of all you can't change the default first two skills which is a downside. Currently this game is not controller compatible, but I can see it being easy to make it so possibly? This is a linear game very strategic base and linear in the combat style which not a lot of people may like. 

If you are looking for a DODGE button which is what I thought this game did not have, it is cleverly labeled as ""motion."" Motion is a move you will not find in the default skill set. It is the space bar and you have to grind for it, but it is fairly easy in normal mode.

I WILL ADMIT THAT CUSTOMIZATION IS SO MUCH FUN. New character new life different stats. Choices matter and reflect who you are as a person, demonic or righteous. Even the smaller marked areas have little choices that affect your stats. 

I think a lot of people will be bothered by the combat style because it feels very strategic almost play for picks play style, but I prefer this combat style over a chess board one at a time turn style. 

The music is beautiful and in the beginning interface you can change the backgrounds as well as create a mobile wallpaper of your character with different backgrounds. I didn't think I would like the game at first. I knew I would like the art, but I can't drag myself from the game surprisingly.

Pros: 
High Character Customization
Choices Matter
Art Style
Music

Cons: 
Two locked keybinds
In the customization you won't get everything you want
You might spend a lot of time trying to get the perfect customization XD

this is a wuxia game with a focus on interpersonal relationships. if you don't know what wuxia is, it's the fantasy chinese setting from all those bootleg fandub videos your vietnamese parents rented from asian blockbuster and watched on their VCRs in the 90s. (if you didn't have vietnamese parents in the 90s i don't know how to explain it to you. just look it up)

if you are a well known powerful/young/successful woman, you will be constantly bothered by men who want to become your husband. i don't know if getting a husband will actually stop them from trying, my guess is they would instead try to murder my husband instead.

if you murder someone, their friends, family, sect, and mentor will all try to exact vengeance upon you. ""my dad will kick your ass"" is a surprisingly effective way to deter death in this world (you don't start with a dad, but you can be adopted). if you find someone who somehow has no friends that's free real estate.

The Good
+Plenty of skills
+Choose how and in what order to grow
+Random Events [Ones that have some type of interaction beyond something automatically happening.]
+ARPG mechanics combat style [More like bullet hell but, yes, if you look close enough, has some ARPG mechanics.]
+Different Difficulty settings
+Unique Art Style


And I think that's where all the good unfortunately ends.

The Bad
-An absurd amount of grind for a single player game.
-They have planned 12 tiers, yes you heard right, 12 tiers, but I think that will be like making a game for themselves. [Who would grind out 12 tiers?!]

-Monster reskin/reuses plenty of times and combat will get stale after the 1000 time of doing the same thing.
-Can be forced into fights with enemies much stronger and no way to realistically win or even run.
-RNG for breakthroughs. [You can get choices with passives that provide little to no value.]

-Unfinished systems galore. [Besides the starting artifacts, there are none to craft. No swords, No armor, nada.]


After two play throughs and reaching what is the 3rd breakthrough on nightmare, I can say that this game has potential but is not worth it in it's current state.

Some reasoning:

Player is required to farm out resources from monsters to buy abilities and then level up said abilities. The same is also done for passives. After a breakthrough, if you want to continue growing, you must buy new skills of your appropriate new ""level"" and continue the process. The skills you learned before? those skills are ""unlearned"" you get a small refund for what you paid and all your efforts are basically undone, and that is for EVERY BREAKTHROUGH. This feels like cellphone game grind allure all over it, the only thing that was missing was a cash shop to skip and I wish I was joking. You want people to play your game? Make this into a single player game that is enjoyable without needing the grind.

Other things I didn't like:
-Social system is so barren, no real reason to interact with anyone.
-Difficult to have synergy between skills when there is something like a 3% chance for something to happen and only lasts a few seconds. 

Things that are done well:
-Some of the music is really enjoyable
-The Artwork can be great at times
-The Sect system is really good and with some updates could be fun to play around with on it's own.
-The difficulty system is really good but I wish players could select from the offered options instead of it being one tier forced. I would like to play with normal grind on nightmare difficulty. Why? Nightmare difficulty feels like it gives you something to work for. It's hardcore mode before breakthrough 6. That, and bosses actually feel appropriately challenging. The extra materials needed? Literally adds nothing to the game.

With that, likely will shelf the game until the next big update. Hope the devs keep working hard on this, as with a just a few more systems fleshed out, more options and reduced grind, I think this could be a nice gem for repayable HC type ARPGS for a few months to even a few years.

1468810,98742690,76561198362915114,0,23,2811,0,1180,1691364249,"This game has been on my wishlist since about a week into early access, waiting for an English update. Well, it's here, boys, and it's great. 

Much of the content is missing still, which should be expected for an early access for a small developer. If this game were to never be updated from this point on, I would still say that $20 is worth it. As much as there is missing, I have hardly made it through even a 10th of the content in the last 19 hours.

To start off with, some of the things I think this game needs to do better with:
1. social interaction. You're encouraged to interact with other cultivators throughout the game, earning affection. There, currently, is really only 2 benefits to this. They give you items randomly, that you usually use to complete gathering quests (accept mission, submit mission immediately because you already have it, easy rewards) and any social interaction with others grants knowledge, which you can use to get 'mind' skills. These are basically passives or stat boosts that you get quite a few of. Hard to come by good ones, but when you do you need a lot of knowledge to use them.
2. Combat Skills. You can only equip 4 of these (martial/spiritual, special, movement, and ultimate). Really, your special and ultimate are how you do damage. Your martial/spiritual hardly does anything of note. It's just a slow sprinkle of damage that you hold down through the whole fight. The movement skill is simple. You either jump out of the way, charge and do some quick but small damage, or in only 2 cases that I know of, both but weaker. I think that this should be 5, honestly. Longer cool downs would be a fine trade. I think either a second special, but weaker, or splitting marital and spiritual skills would be better. mainly, i say this because it would allow you to break the pattern of just holding your basic (martial/spritual) for the whole fight. You only use your special or ultimate against bosses because of the long cooldown, so most of the combat at the moment is just running in a circle holding the left mouse button.
3. XP. I can't believe I'm saying this, but getting XP is far too easy. You max out your cultivation almost immediately and then spend the next 3 years looking for 12 items to break through to the next stage. It seems like a waste to max out so quick only to stay there for so long, especially when it doesn't effect your stats at all until you break through. I never cultivate, either. I accept cultivation when a random character asks to practice with me and get XP from chance events. There is no inventive to waste 5 days on gaining XP that you'll get anyway.

And that's about it, so far. There are some repetitive things and many features that are entirely pointless at the moment, but a lot of that is just because it's unfinished, like any early access game. 

So, what does the game do right? Well, a lot.
1. The cultivation break through's require you to, well, play the game. You can get many of the required items by just exploring the world at your own pace. As daunting as gathering 6 qi and 3 heavenly treasures may seem, you can get them all in about an hour and a half of playing without feeling any grind. It's paced really well.
2. skills, though limited in variety at the moment, are modified easily and extensively by re-rolling the additional abilities they come with. Rarity determines how many with the rarest having a whole 10 extra abilities tied to a skill. It's expensive, time consuming, and you'll want to avoid doing that early on, but as the game goes on it gets more and more viable.
3. I did bash the combat a bit above, but even with the issues it has it's still loads of fun. A lot of the skill required is timing and aim. You're running around trying to dodge while hitting moving targets, like with any hack and slash, but what you hit them with is at the front of your mind. If you use your special on that big hoard of enemies will that leave you with extra time taking damage from the boss that will spawn after you kill them? or do you just wait and kill that boss with a special - ultimate combo and suffer through the grunts?
4. Graphically, the game is pretty neat. I've always like the Wuxia fantasy stuff, so i'm probably biased here, but it looks cool. Especially the menus and bosses. the backgrounds and some of the events could use more attention, but it's fine.
5. Randomization. from your stats to characters to literally the entire map and everything in it is generated at random. They did this really well. And you can, with a little observation, figure out the structure of a lot of this quickly. For example, you like using fire skills? look for sects that have Yan in their name. They'll teach you fire skills and allow you to upgrade your fire affinity. the best part about this randomness is that you can control it to some extent. when making your character, for example, you can re-roll your stats. pick something you want to focus on and try to get it as high as you can from the start. Give yourself a head start.  I recommend luck, attack, and critical personally. Weapon and qi affinities rarely make much a difference past the immediately early game, so I wouldn't recommend those.

Honestly, games a lot of fun and i'm looking forward to the developers next update. I would recommend this to anybody who likes indie games.",1630716948,1630716948,True,8,0,0.569410562515258789,0,True,False,True

Recommended for : people who want to experience living on a wuxia planet OR a grade-A chuuni.
Not Recommended for: Peeps who dont know much about chinese cultivation and or dont like to play RPG Grinding games.

As for it being Early Access,
I bought this game on the spot when it started offering English version. The English adapted version is quite a new thing in this game but its quite mapped out and you dont feel the need to scratch your head and figure out what it means in most of the game.
The amount of content is A LOT. (That is if you grind it till the end)
If you are looking into a whole lot of stuff right at start, it is still a bit lack luster but to me it just feels amazing with just what they have got!

As a comparison, Mount and Blade Bannerlord has been in EA since i was a wee babe (or that's what it feels like) and it has yet to be fleshed up.
While this baby which Steam says is arnd since Jan 2021 (I am skeptical of that) has 10x more stuff to do than a regular MB:B game. Comparison wise, it beats the grind of Bannerlord with a fresh perspective and fun things to know/play with.

For its current price point, i recommend you go for it. It will help the devs whom I have found out to be real hard workers and the game is worth the money you are spending even at this stage.",1630681904,1630681904,True,1,0,0.483592420816421509,0,True,False,True

If you are not familiar with those themes, then this game might be hard for you to get into. However, if you are into simulation with focus on relationships, random events with mini-plots here and there, decent grinding, beautiful hand-drawn art and 2D mechanics and linear progression, then this game is for you. 

This game has captured what a Cultivation Simulation game is all about giving you full control of character creation and what they would be on the game. As it is still in Early Access, understandably that it has a lot of features that it should have but isn't there yet, however, the features they already have make this game really addicting. 

The combat mechanic is simplistic 2D style hack-slash type of game but in my opinion its actually really beautiful. You don't get a lot of games with those mechanics. It doesn't convert itself to be a ""combat game"" and remains true to being a simulation. The combat mechanics are just an added bonus and the mechanic works well with the overall theme and design of the game.

Pros:
-Beautiful hand-drawn 2D landscape
-Random mini-events with their own plot
-Focus on relationships and giving side-characters personality (and has potential to give more)
-Perfectly captures the Wuxia life in a Simulation
-Linear progression 

Cons:
-Theme may not be for everyone
-Repetitive bosses
-Some minor bugs 

Overall the game is 8.5/10 for me. There are some minor bugs that you would encounter but not gamebreaking. The game has a lot of potential from Multiplayer prospects, to adding more detail and personality to Cultivation Sects and cultivators present in the game.",1630681047,1630681047,True,1,0,0.50180506706237793,0,True,False,True

I proceed to humiliate him in front of 100s of people, leave him face down in the dirt and I get chosen to be the clan's next initiate. That's cultivation baby~

The amount of depth and progression in this game is amazing, all the designs for enemies are really well done and invoke the wonderment of Chinese mythology, the amount of options and choices can be overwhelming at first, but it definitely feels like a cultivation game because of it. I highly recommend it if you like sandbox roguelites, games with huge amounts of progression, and top down shooter elements.

First of all, big thanks to the devs for creating this game! I've had and i am still having so much fun playing this game. 

Now, back to the actual review. For someone who reads light novels (Wuxia, Xianxia) this game is total gem. I mean it. And since game is based on Chinese mythology, you will see some creatures that will blow your mind. This game is so unique that its hard to explain it properly. Graphics are awesome as well, unique artstyle that goes with this type of game very well. Another surprising thing for me is actualy soundtrack. I loved it. In other games more often than not, i turn music off and listen to my own. But not in this one. All of the things mentioned above blend in perfectly with each other and together they will definitely hook you in. The most surprising this tho was  the immersion. I don't even remember the last time i was this immersed in any other game. I really appreciate this especialy in this type of game.  You might think i am being overly positive about this game, but once you try it out, you will understand just how good this game really is. 

Character creation in this game is surprisingly rich. There are lots of combinations to pick from. 
That goes for appearance as well as personality. Do you want to be an upright person? Dont worry, the game got your back. If not, dont tell me you want to be someone who kills left and right without any reason..? Ha!  Why not? Because you can totaly do that too. Whenever you want to play as a goody two shoes or a baddie psycho killer who goes around killing anything that moves, game got you covered.

It's also pretty slow paced, which is a big plus for me personaly. Game doesnt make things too easy for you either. To actualy win a fight you have to know what you're doing, even on a lowest difficulty, which makes me wonder how tough its gonna get on higher one.. 

Game also has an active community on discord where people chat all day and help each other, which is awesome considering that some parts of the game are tough and help is always appreciated. 

There are regular updates and many things are added to the game all the time. 

There is absolutely no pay to win, hell, i haven't even seen a single microstansaction! Thats so rare nowaday lol.

Last but not least, the cultivation system. It's exactly as i wished it to be. Its not overly difficult, yet to actualy breakthrough, it requires considerate effort. You can't speedrun this. But i love it, because once you breakthorugh, you can easily see how much stronger you are and it just feels so good after all that effort you've put in.

Now for the cons.

This game is not for everyone. The uniqueness of this game can be considered a double edged sword. I personaly love how different this game is compared to other games, but there is considerate amount of people who prefer ''stereotypes''

Another issue are bugs. There is a decent amount of bugs that will sometimes make the game awkward. So far none of them was gamebreaking, usualy either a visual or translation error here and there. But hey, its early access, so you cant really blame them. 

Some of the abilities are either too strong or too weak, even repetitive. I myself used one specific ability i got at the beginning till Golden core, which is quite  a few realms higher. Yet that ability was still very powerful on bosses. Some balance here and there would be great.

This game is definitely 10/10 for me.

I definitely recommend at least trying this game out. Thanks for reading through all of it, and damn, i really wrote a lot. Anyways, i hope you have a great rest of the day!

It plays like a single-player MMO, with a combat style similar to Wizard of Legend (but less move-spamming).
Lots of character interactions and relationships, and your actions decide your levels of Righteous/Demonic, affecting how the world treats you.
There's SOOOO many different Fighting styles to mix + match with various strengths, weaknesses and playstyles. Changing skills to adapt to a type of Monster or Cultivator keeps your movelist fresh.
It can be pretty overwhelming at first, but the tutorials are pretty good. First Lesson: Change language to ENG (see other comments, it's not hard. Don't even need the mod anymore)
Seems like one of those games where you can easily hit the 100-1000 HR playtime marks without even realizing you haven't slept in days.

Fun combat system with the ability to become op.
In depth relationship system (you build up rivalries and friendships).
Devs seem pretty good at putting out new content.

Cons:
The grind, this game is extremely grindy.

Wait until the full release. There's a lot of balancing issues when it comes to power, killing one person can result into a cycle of death due to higher ""level"" and inescapable cultivators (essentially each level has three phases, you can win against someone in a higher phase, the moment they level up you're basically garaunteed to lose) that will kill you over and over until you die permanently. Or maybe they don't and instead they harass you every month leaving you on one health point and massive debuffs to your mood which inflicts even more debuffs. This hinders your ability to catch up in power to them so basically you can get stuck in a cycle.
You also have no way to track specific people from what I can tell, so basically AI can avenge their friends all they want on you but you can't do that for your buddies because it's a big open world. Then there's repetitive dialogue options at the end of each month.

The games' not finished, it clearly isn't. It could be good once they figure out the balancing on all the martial arts in the game and the balance in cultivators because it can very easily get one sided.

I walked out of tutorial and went into a fight with a cultivator who I immediately didn't like due to their arrogant text bubble. 

The cultivator was typical trash, unworthy of even my breath. But he defeated me, I decided i would rather die than beg for my life. He killed me, and i wrote down his name and reloaded the save. 

I then proceeded to respec into sword, and cultivate my ass for revenge. 

But i couldn't find him... So i searched the internet and found a trainer for this game. By some miracle there is a section that lets you teleport to people whose name you know... hehe

I ignored all the level up cheat nonsense and immediately teleported to this bastard, i attacked him and beat him. He begged for his life and offered me some garbage to spare him. He was lying. I knew he had better stuff in his inventory but he was saying the garbage he was offering was the best he had. I decapitated him. 

After this, his wife, kids, friends and family all hated me and would periodically come to me and try to kill me. 

Like mosquitos, they wanted blood. 

So I had to chop off all of their heads one by one as they came. This snowballed into even more people hating me and trying to kill me.

I always killed the bastards that tried to kill me. 

As the snowball got bigger and bigger, even tougher bastards were coming for me.

It wasn't easy, but trash is trash and I killed them all. 

Sometimes they would escape so i would just type their name in, chase them down and finish them. 

Every month-end I'd prepare myself for stronger and stronger trash. Like some kind of garbage dump they just kept pouring in.

By the time I had reached the end of the current content, I'd have wiped out entire bloodlines and generations of people.

All this, just because I didn't like the way one guy spoke to me. 

Indeed, if this game has shown me anything, it is that they are all trash, not worthy of even being called trash. How dare they even think to approach me. 

btw the game is pretty good, very accurate portrayal of a cultivation story.

If I were to anagolize this game I'd say it is a combination of Rogue-likes with a lot of Random Generation, Mount and Blade, Elona, Touhou Project and Dwarf Fortress' Legends and Adventurer Mode, wrapped in the very popular theme of a Chinese Xianxia novel.

The main draw for the game for me is the procedural generation of characters and their development of relationships which is in particular is highly entertaining (quite reminiscent to Dwarf Fortress, but with much more breadth). Each generated character has their own alignment scale (how Righteous or Demonic they are), their own likes and dislikes (which you can consider when giving gifts), and comes with their own family tree and relationship tree that outlines the rivals, people they have a grudge against, friends, companions, parents, spouses, masters and disciples - allowing you many possibilities for ideas for role-play and creating a story in your head as you play.

For instance, in my first playthrough when I first joined the demonic Sheng Xing Hong (Holy Star Rainbow) sect filled with many demonic characters despite my own character's somewhat neutral disposition. There, impressed by my performance in the sect's entrance duels, one of the sect seniors, the venerable Kang Qin (70 years old) offered to become my master. I accepted hoping to receive guidance and training of the martial arts of fingers and lightning spirit arts. But my master rarely checked on me as he was far too busy getting his ass handed to him by other righteous sects, and especially kept getting defeated by his rivals and enemies. To make matters worse, other members of the sect and other acquaintances kept coming up to me and badmouthing my master, calling him despicable, evil or hypocritical, advising me to break ties with him. Of course being a neutral fellow my character was I just agreed with all of them, making many friends on the way at the expense of my Master's notoriety. One day, while I was breaking through the Foundation stage of cultivation, I received news that he was finally slain by his rival, whom I never even met before. Come to think of it I only met my Master for a second time just after the entrance trials where he told me to work hard on my cultivation and development of my skills. And so was the rather hilarious Master-disciple relationship between me, Yu Tuo the agreeable fellow, and Kang Xin, the old timer who kept getting humiliated by literally everyone around him including his own disciple.

Another interesting story that I can share is how my character met and eventually married his spouse. Also from the same Sheng Xing Hong sect was my female sect senior, Xiahou Hanyun. Intially she invited me to some leisure activities in a nearby pavilion, and was impressed by my art of gift giving and defeating and sparing a rival of mine (who killed me twice before and was quite shocked by me being alive after she slit my throat) who insulted her and my appearance (despite my high appearance stat XD). From then on, we coincidentally met a number of times and grew in amiability. Somehow, she ended up as the sect's leader, and named me an honorary disciple as I moved on to another region to further my cultivation. One thing that was very interesting was how Xiahou Hanyun had more of a demonic alignment but somehow still clicked with my slowly growing righteous character, which opened up many possbilities for thinking about their relationship. I simply just explained it for myself that my character was a very carefree fellow though and my own character was not really as amiable to her as she was to mine (perhaps due to the fact that I kept giving her cultivation breakthrough materials that I no longer needed). My character and Xiahou eventually tied the knot in a snowy village of Feng Kou (Phoenix Mouth), and that was the start of all the badmouthing by strangers and other acquaintances pertaining to her demonic alignment. What is even more hilarious to me is how the righteous sect I joined later gained me a few female admirers, and when one invited me to a pavilion for leisure, my own wife came to find me, demanding an explanation. Thankfully she did not think that it was my fault and developed a grudge and enmity towards that female sect colleague who invited me there. Such Shuraba. 

While the combat is can be said to be rather repetitive, reminiscent of bullet hell games like Touhou Project (but thankfully very much less intense) - it allows a bit more room for customization, offering you up to 4 different moves that have procedurally generated stats and effects alongside equipable passives that boost your abilities alongside pills you can buy or make yourself (which can be more potent than those available in shops or stolen from people). This system lies on top of 6 different martial arts (sword, spear, blade, fist, palm, finger) and 6 different spirit arts (Earth, Wood, Water, Fire, Lightning, Wind) - which have various types of moves each, allowing you many possibilities to mix and match and create your own build. One lost opportunity though for builds which I hope the developers add more on is the cross compatibility of moves from different martial arts and spirit arts which only seems to apply to defensive passive skills for now... which means that if you stick to one art, you will most likely only use that for the rest of the mid to late game.

Nevertheless overall, I was satisfied with this level of combat which provided indeed some challenge especially when fighting bosses mid-game, and sometimes beating a character whose cultivation stage is higher than you (which is often very difficult) using your own strategic build can be extremely satisfying. A word of advice to those seeking to fight those of higher cultivation level - focus on dealing damage + criticals + optimize your build to activate Divine Power immediately as they can deal a ridiculous amount of damage even to higher level cultivators.

As the game is still early access, there are still a lot of systems still not present such as Fengshui, Talisman making, Tool Crafting, Sect Management (sadly you cannot become a Sect Leader yet) etc that will be slowly updated as the game takes shape. So far, as it is I highly enjoy this game and am around halfway through (Hua Shen stage), and the gameplay loop is fun and challenging enough (at mid-game especially). The music is decent, and the artwork is very nice to look at, especially the world map cells which unfold like a neat Chinese painting. I will perhaps update this review again when I am complete, but if you read Chinese, enjoy a good Xianxia novel or comic, love thinking about the in-betweens of character interactions, and love that neat random generation in roguelikes then this game is for you.",1624819765,1624819807,True,57,7,0.843678116798400879,1,True,False,True

I am fluent in Chinese so I can understand that the Chinese players are not so pleased with the development of this game. There hasn't been any significant update for the past few months and it doesn't seems like the developers care for the players' feedback. Although it is still in early access, I doubt it will be out of EA any time soon judging from the progress.

Gameplay:
it is basically a MMORPG played in a single-player style, except that it took all the flaws from MMORPG into this: Tedious and endless grinding. Now imagine a typical MMORPG, you play as a nameless adventurer along with other adventurers but they are controlled by AI. So you have all the friend, guild, marriage system, etc anything you can think of from an older day MMORPG except that you are playing with souless AI instead of making friend with a human, which is horribly boring and saddening that it feels so lonely for playing this game. But that is not all, this game is abysmally grindy and tedious, it makes you collect all sorts of materials from all over the places just to ""unlock"" your next tier level. I used a cheat engine to ease the grinding yet it still took me more than 3 hours to ""upgrade 1 tier"". Note that every tier has 3~5 different ""upgrade method"", basically define the effectiveness of your ""upgrade"". Eg, you either get extra stats boost, or no bonus/perks, or reduced stats boost after upgrading. So if you wanna make the most out of your ""tier upgrade"", you have to grind for a long time. Did I forget to mention all these tedious tasks were just for the ""1st tier""? Yes, they currently have more than 5 tiers, probably gonna add more in the future (if they ever will, LOL). 

There are still many flaws I can talk about this game, but I think I have already made my points clear so I don't want to bother whoever is reading this with more boring criticisms.

In conclusion, unless you got too much time in your life to spare, don't bother playing this game, it is a waste of time and money, and I regretted so much for buying this game thinking that I want to support a ""potential nice developing studio"". Seriously, who would wanna play such a grindy game in this modern age and offers little sense of achievement? Unless this game gets a complete overhaul of its mechanisms, I doubt i can recommend this to anyone. I will recommend another game called ""CrossCode"" which has a similar setting but with a western MMORPG setting and it is many times better than this game.

Initial thought of this game as a fusion between sid's civilization and Diablo, but after playing for a while I find the tasks in game are too repetitive and lacks new elements to build upon.  There is not much strategy except to continue  collect exp and buy better fighting technique for combat.  I wish they could explore more of the strategy component  adding elements such as building a base and fight along-side npcs.  Also there needs to have story so the players can get attached to the character.  Currently it feels like a jet shooter game with the main character being the plane.  There is no emotional development to the character which makes it boring currently. 

The fighting is also monotonic.  You get a basic attack and 3 special attacks.  Though there are lots of different techniques to choose from but they mostly do the same thing.  It's like the airplane shooter type of fights where you pick up different types of weapons.      You mostly  just shoot the monsters to death and there is not much to it.  You either have enough fire power to survive or you don't.  If you don't then just keep collecting exp till you do.

Gameplay is fun and engaging if you're into the cultivation genre. The problem I have is how repetitive it gets after about 20-30 hours played, and you hit a crazy difficulty wall around the nascent soul/spirit forming breakthrough (probably 3/5 of the game). 

The game, even at the easiest difficulty, requires some min-maxing for you to have a smooth time in the last few breakthrough realms, which seems absurd considering its the easiest difficulty and new/casual players at easiest difficulty wouldn't know much about builds, useful perks, etc. Going for min-max strategy feels like something you should be doing only at the harder dificulties.

 Just did a 2nd playthrough.
It would be great if there's a choice to skip the initial tutorial/starting area. 
For the new players, do not worry about the character's age. It's almost impossible to die of old age, so take your time farming the best materials you can get for breaking through realms as they matter in the long run (eg, red-tier mats instead of purple-tier mats)

Where Cultivation Simulator has you controlling an entire sect and does a very good job about simulating cultivation by comparison to this it is very shallow. The two things Cultivation Simulator has that this doesn't is Shendao and Body cultivation. With that said the Ki cultivator path includes some body cultivation methods and is true to that path of cultivation as per the stories of heaven and earth.

The game has a fan made English translation you can patch it with. The Discord leading to the download is talked about in the Discussion section. I would say about 90% is translated and the translation is pretty good. 

Graphics: This is stuff from maybe 2001, this wont be impressing you on the graphical side at all but this is a small team doing fantastic work in other areas. The particle effects, shading and so on are nothing to really write home about but are still passable.

Art Style: Bringing this up right after graphics because I don't want these two confused, the art style is a mixed bag some places it seems bland and in other places its fantastic. There is no consistency to the quality of the arts direction but the direction is constant. Where the game is doing the art well it does it knowing it's doing it well.

Music: Pretty generic music from the orient, nothing to write home about here but it does match what you are looking at and I could ignore it and still enjoy the game.

Story Design: The way the story is told doesn't work well with the game design, that is you have a set amount of time to accomplish things but really it's like Skyrim in that you can pretty much explore and encounter things at your own pace... But the story can mislead you to odd dead ends. It's better to ignore the story and cultivate. Then go back and attempt the story. After a while it gets better about telling you that you can't accomplish things without being stronger. This might also be the fault of the translation or just my understanding.

Game Design: Amazing, we buy games to play games and while none of the other parts of this game are bad, in fact they are mostly mediocre, this is one of those weird moments where game play alone saves the day... a game that remembers it's a game. As mentioned above this is about cultivation so there is that, then it's also about creating your own cultivator and finally executing your build on the world.  This does all of that and then includes those xianxia tropes we all love. Unlike path of Wuxia that forgets its about the main character and keeps throwing characters at you to learn about this game simply adds aging to the mix which then forces you to take a CK3 approach and at some point start making a family before trying to conquer Tainyu.

游戏中过于多的选择对角色有长远且不可逆的影响。这些影响错综复杂，系统过于庞大 ，导致玩之前需要查看大量的资料。一个玩家应该是在玩游戏的过程中不断进步，而不是查看资料库后，排好之下来的路。这将游戏直接变成了需要完成的工作。而玩家知道这工作需要那些配件就可以很厉害，不知道的话就很难。总结下来这个游戏是阅读>计划>枯燥重复的流程>鼠标重复点击+垃圾小游戏练功。大部分玩家看前辈研究出来一套体系，抄作业，然后看小人释放技能。 没啥可玩的。
所以说游戏体验不是很好。不仅仅是在设计方面，游戏本身重复性极其的高。对角色影响深远的话就需要玩家创建多个存档，而游戏却让我完全没有新建角色的欲望。重复性实在是太高。其实游戏本身五个区域每个区域都是做类似的事情，玩一遍好像玩了五遍。
游戏体系十分鼓励sl。 很多有长远影响的事件（逆天改命，纯度，词条等）只是有几率出现。如果玩家想要之间计划好的完整的流派，就需要重复sl去有几率碰见。不然就弃档从来。
游戏中读条也很多，在2021年一个2d游戏读条不仅卡顿半秒，还异常频繁真是说不过去。很伤游戏体验。
游戏数据和属性伤害缩放非常易燃易爆炸。minMAX, min过低MAX过高，这就导致了平衡性难以调节的问题。你的角色要是鸡肋那是真的鸡肋， 你的角色如果厉害那就是神一般的存在。

总结下来游戏枯燥，重复性强，体系鼓励sl，阅读词条游戏，抄作业游戏，更多时间是告诉自己要完成什么东西，而不是给玩家做相对即时决定的自由。游戏过程就是先铺好路 然后点点点，计划好之后一点脑子都不用，就看脸。",1618865927,1618866535,False,29,6,0.628921747207641602,0,True,False,True

Yet I did found myself enjoying this game for some reason. 
Because there's isn't much Xianxia background games? Maybe, but it doesn't really explains other non-Chinese speaker having fairly positive opinion on the game. Maybe for pure role playing value?

The main story is poor, but it's fine. We all know this game still in EA. The main issues of this game are the design of the game and the general game mechanics. 

1.if you wanna breakthrough to a new level ""境界 ""you have to DM dungeons over and over in order to obtain necessary materials. However these materials are only useful in a breakthrough specific level, which means the materials you use to level up from lv1 to lv2 can only be used once. And you never and ever would use these materials again in the follow-up level, although these little shit may take you hours.
2. The worst part of this game is the design of skills, and this is the reason why I quit this game once I achieved ""金丹 "" 
Badazz skills = Badazz gears
You have the possibility to get skills from"" 宗门 ""(need to spend contributions""), some specific dungeons, sellers in the cities and some particular tasks ""奇遇"" 
You DM dungeons to get contributions and coins to switch skills, or you are lucky enough to get a skill.
Skills need exp to increase dmg
You DM dungeons again to get enough materials to boost your skills.
When you finally maximize your skill proficiency, and it's about time to get to a new level. Congratulation! All the skills you already have are fucking useless at the new level. Make the above progress one more time.
Overall, I love this game, and I hope the developer would do something to improve the gaming experience in the future.

简而言之， 游戏不错，垃圾游戏机制，我到金丹就退坑了。花费大把力气刷的材料只能用来升级，然后除了卖就再也用不到了，后面也是重复刷材料升级，蛋疼到死。小境界提升吸灵气就行了而且提升神速，所以基本等级机制是 练气后期，筑基后期，结晶后期，金丹后期。。。。。
技能机制是最扯淡的，游戏里没武器，技能就是武器。
技能获取途径有琅琊阁，宗门，遗迹，奇遇。运气好爆个紫色与自身灵根相符的。或者有钱去拍卖行买橙色或红色的（基本被抬价到想吐血）。
升级技能需要魂石魂晶（不升级打不过，而且心累），刷词条需要悟心砂，刷吧朋友。我金丹期下个本也就个位数中品魂晶。
升满技能你也就可以去刷天才地宝了（锁灵阵，封魔阵），然后突破。
然后重复上述内容
其实能吐槽的点还有很多，但这个重复度真的是致命伤。等改了的时候别忘了告诉我，我来改评论。",1615076225,1615076225,False,3,0,0.52087092399597168,2,True,False,True

If you outrange your enemy, he'll have to run up to you. 

If you have a higher speed than the enemy, he'll never catch you. 

Is blitzkrieg time

OK let's get serious:

This game is a top-down shooter in randomized dungeons with rpg element in it. You'd be disappointed if you take it as a RPG cuz its system is quite shallow on tha tfront.

The most important attribute when making a character is Intelligence, as it cannot be raised by any means as of now. The strength between tiers are staggering, so don;t off yourself by challenging sb w/ a higher tier.

Ways to improve your stats:

ATK/DEF/HP/MP/InvP/PD/MD/Cr: Tier up, passive skills
SPD: Passive
Weaon Proficiency/Magic Proficiency: Pills in Faction stores
Alchemy: Random world event, rogue alchemist
Detection(Feng Shui): Random world event, blood sucker
Botany: Random world event, mushroom man

About tiering up:
You should always go for the most difficlut path available, since you'll be encountering enemies stronger than you at all times it's crucial to get every point of stats possible

Alchemy is mandatory for certain tiers, grab a crucible from the facrtion and farm for rogue alchemists

About Character Creation:
Don't bother with rolling a better starting stat, it's trivial in the long run. Focus on high tier traits as they can be the difference between life and death.
Some orange traits are better than red ones, although if you can't read chinese you'd be screwed

About skills:
For active skills, get the one with highest tier that you can use, the damage gap is staggering
For passive ones: get ones with highest quality, what you need is the additional effects,not the meager stat increase they provide",1614197765,1614665230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

npc不是作为玩家了解，与世界交互的窗口，而是随机生成，帮助玩家修炼的道具。交谈、论道、送礼、双修等功能，毫无代入感。尽管世界很大，npc数量庞大，但非常容易在10-20小时之后感到枯燥。游戏中期随着刷出的npc多了之后，进入城镇后，我已经完全无法想起标记为”好友“或”仇人“的npc是谁了。

[h1]这个游戏是我第一次玩到回合外的时间比玩家自由回合时间还要多的游戏.[/h1]

由于游戏中有上千个随机生成、毫无特点的修仙npc，每个月过了之后系统又要重新计算、安排这些npc的轨迹，所以在月初玩家要耐心等待10-15秒左右的”八荒世界演变中。。。“的loading screen。更烦的是，如果你魅力值太高，这之后下个回合开始前，还会有不少于5个npc过来找你切磋、论道什么的，再花去你5分钟分钟时间。完全没有必要

建议：减少npc数量，增加同一个区域（格子）之内，与玩家有亲密关系的npc能够为玩家的奇遇有所互动，比如战斗时候提供援助等。或与玩家有敌意关系的npc在战斗后偷袭玩家的互动。并且标记只有这些npc能够突破关系上限。

难度分级拼的是爆肝程度，建议想要体验游戏的玩家直接选择魅力丑陋+简单难度。木灵气功法和其他功法对树妖这种boss伤害是相同的，没有搭配功法，准备战斗，利用功法之间相生相克的优点弱点取得战斗优势的。所以难度升级只是伐木资源的频率和次数不同，没有任何提高游戏难度的意义。",1614596592,1614607631,False,9,2,0.537840306758880615,0,True,False,True

本人很喜欢探索打怪升级类的游戏~ 所以非常享受这游戏。
要说一些意见呢，我觉得：
可取之处：
1. 画面精美，不需高配置电脑也能通顺游玩
2. 战斗系统相当流畅，操作容易上手，功法词条搭配也很广，不会出现两个一样厉害的人
3. 小游戏颇丰富
4. 消息系统不错，方便我满世界打boss

可圈可点：
1. 道友的交际后来略显单调，基本上如果本身太厉害了，没人敢惹，如果我是杀父仇人嘛，挑不过我也应该一头热血舍身就义嘛，而不是见打不过我就逃。
2. 特别关系的道友玩法可以更多元化：道侣、夫妻如果可以一起打特殊副本就好，或者做一些嘿嘿嘿，这样才有动力泡妞嘛
3. 义父母、义兄弟等如果可以邀请我们去帮助完成人物也不错
4. 师傅总得教教我们功法心法修炼才叫合格的师傅嘛
5. 做坏人如果不能抢劫商店还干嘛做坏人
6. 如果做坏人可以去抢拍卖会也不错，然后正道道友一起群攻，打败全部人（没有回血）可以抢所有的道具
7. 宗门升级除了多钱和可以买高级功法外，好像也没啥特别，一些特难的任务（高风险高回酬）只有大长老才能做才make sense嘛，派一个外门弟子去击杀宗门叛徒好像不是很合理

I like the concept behind it, I like the combat more than other games in the same genre; controls are fairly intuitive, the game isn't too complex to learn, but isn't over simplified either. Most of all, it has very lovely character art for character creation, the best in its genre in my opinion. 

Will I recommend it? No, I can't. Why? The gameplay, as of the writing of this review, is atrocious. In short, this game plays like a single player MMORPG, replete with all the grinding and time sink features. 

Let me break it down for you.

First of all, calling it an ""open world sandbox"" is misleading. The game world and map is ""zoned"", like an MMORPG. That means, you have your ""low level area"", where you only meet people around your ""rank"" (there isn't a level based system in this game, but you have a rank whereby it denotes where you're at in your training to become an immortal), and your goal to reach the next ""rank"", is to grind for materials to upgrade. In that low level zone, you can interact with people, and even join schools/sects/clans, perform their quests and learn skills from them, which is all great and fun, but as you upgrade your rank after hours of grinding, you'll quickly encounter the next problem.

All your friends you've made, the progress you've had in your school/sect/clan will become quickly irrelevant as you're forced to move over to the ""mid level zone"" if you want to continue progressing the game. Only in the mid level zone can you find the necessary materials (of course, with a new set of dungeons and bosses you need to grind) to progress to the next rank. In the new mid level zone, you have a slew of new schools/sects/clans, and a whole bunch of NPCs who are around your new level and rank, making whatever friendship/alliances you've made before this irrelevant. You're then forced to rinse and repeat that same process, except with longer grinding time.

Everything feels out of place, and feels extremely ""zoned"" and ""tiered"" like an MMO, than an actual open world game. In terms of being ""lore friendly"", in most Xian Xia or cultivation based games, you don't usually find legendary manuals or skills in the auction house, nor do you find legendary beasts as buyable mounts in the shop in the city either. You have both of that in this game. That feels more like again, an MMO, than an actual open world, exploration based, single player game. In short, the developer designed this game almost entirely with an MMO design principle on the outset.

It is a real shame as well, because I quite enjoyed the parts of this game that actually felt like an open world game, like for example, the interaction with NPCs, making friends and enemies, interaction with your companions/lovers, and how they'd visit and initiate conversation, saying how they've missed you; or vice versa, how your enemies might seek you out and attempt to duel you and kill you off. 

Their random generated quests you can find on the bounty board are quite well done as well, with slightly varied outcomes in some of them instead of a static result, including how performing certain quest with NPCs might end up with them wanting the loot all for themselves instead of splitting it with you and dueling you for it, after you're worn down by the boss. 

All of that are quite well thought out, but as long as the main problem with its gameplay isn't fixed, or changed in a drastically better way, I can't recommend a single player game that is all about grinding materials to progress, consuming hours of your time while making whatever progress you've made previously with NPCs meaningless.",1613930455,1613930455,False,3,0,0.481789946556091309,5,True,False,True

I had high expectations about this game, since everyone's talking about it and it has very good reviews.
Apart from the language which is a big barrier for non-Chinese-speaking players, the game has a bunch of GAME BREAKING bugs that makes it almost unplayable in certain situations and i don't know why they didn't fix them yet.
Basically, there are 2 kind of escape spells that makes you invulnerable for a certain duration, the problem is that the duration is higher than the skill CD. Not a big deal you'd say, it's just 2 skills CDs . If you mess up something with some random npc, you most likely get hated by the said npc and his parents/friends (it's a good mechanic don't get me wrong) and they will come after you. The more npcs want to kill you the more likely it is to encounter one user of these skills and... god if you meet one of those you better restart the game and hope to avoid the meeting. NPCs will use the said escape skills off CD and you won't be able to hit them for 10-20 min , in the later stages of the game where the mana is very high you can fight them for 1 hour straight, not being able to touch them even once. And when i say this i am being optimistic, because this only happens if you use one of the said skills for yourself aswell and manage your mana accordingly, cause if you dont... well, you DIE.
Other problems the game has in my opinion, the enlightment reward system is very underwhelming, apart from the flat stats it gives you, the talents you can choose are very disappointing. I rerolled a lot of times, so i kinda saw every possible talents, and for the first 3 enlightments they are exactly the same, after the 3rd they add some other talents but nothing special. 90% of the high tier talents are for socializing/escaping from encounters.. i just slayed a bunch of nine tailed fox and thunder dragons, for god sake, give me something epic!
After the first, i'd say, 2 enlightment the game gets very grindy, and RNG heavy dependant. For example for the last enlightment, you gotta destroy 1 monument (of the right kind and you only know if it's the right one when you step on its location) and 1 boss, to HOPEFULLY get one of the 6 items you need for the upgrade. Just finding those thing is hard, fighting them takes a lot of time cause they both have like 30k+ HP. You have to do this untill you get 6 DIFFERENT items for the upgrade, cause yes you can also drop multiple times the same item. 
The enemies variety is very little, you find the same monsters in every biome, just with higher stats.
The stats progression is kinda meh, your damage stays the same as you progress in the higher zones, but the enemies BOSS hp, goes from like 500 in the beginning to 40k.. so it gets more tedious to farm those bosses.

简单评价一下几个我希望快点增加的东西吧，（排前面的更加优先）第一，玩法过于单一，建议加入更多获得7种气的方法，不要每次都刷碎片。同时尽快开启画符和炼器系统，增加后期可玩性。第二，加入更多npc之间的互动，比如说npc之间会自己结义啥的，最好再来个
npc目录。同时更新门派的内容，除了老生常谈的那些，还可以如一下整个门派都可以参与的任务。比如说可以更新个武林大会啥的，你带领你的门派拿到第一后可以获得功法奖励啥的。第三，除了双鱼，增加另外的玩法，同时也可以加入新的种族（拥有不同的初始资质）四，堆内容，增加更多怪啊，有更多的副本可以打啊，有更多的任务种类，功法啥的。

But the game also has some flaws, with the most prominent one being the need to grind.

比较好的是整个流程始终有主线任务（升境界）作为明确目标，但行动自由度很高，想赶快修仙还是想乱玩都看自己。回想起来每次突破找材料的流程都挺重复的，但肝在其中的时候还是觉得挺有趣，可能是因为（我主观认为）普通模式boss的数值配置比较仁善，剑修打不过的时候都只是差一点儿，换下好技能就ok了😂

所以，鬼谷八荒有到神作级别吗？
没有，如果制作团队不是在做修仙为主题，而目前这一主题不坑的单机游戏严重稀缺的话，我觉得这只会成为我毫无兴趣购买的作品。
游戏仍然有一些bug，但是恶性bug比起一周前已经有所改善，可以说制作团队相当积极的在解决这些问题。
游戏本身素质中等偏上而已，我给55分。如果你没有看过修仙小说或者接触过类似的设定，不了解筑基、结丹、元婴所谓何物，那么这款游戏的九成乐趣你将无法体会。
我买这款游戏并有兴致玩下去主要是在追的up主的系列视频让我觉得很好笑、很有身临其境的感觉，所以才在看了一个星期的视频之后决定玩玩看的。之所以等了一周，也是因为游戏初期bug很多，在up主的视频里也出现了好几回，而且来来去去就是打那几个小怪，很单调，让我感觉up主玩的这么起劲是不是纯粹的对中国游戏的双重标准。
但我最后还是玩了，原因是我同时还在重温《凡人修仙传》，所以在这种多方刺激之下，我才下了订单。
现在中国武侠或仙侠类型的游戏，要么是《古**谭》或《仙***传》之类的。老实说这些作品声名在外，但是近年都没有很好的作品。还是8、90年代智冠、大宇的剧情套路，但是放在当下，就感觉人物情节虚浮，再加上技术力的丧失，角色动作及系统都陈旧僵化，实在是食之无味。
相比之下，鬼谷八荒、太吾绘卷、了不起的修真模拟器等，背景的骨干框架来自于起点文学等网文小说，在今天的中国有更多的受众和支持。我本人感触最深的莫过于很多修仙小说之中流露出来的【大道无情】、人与人之间的利用与暗算。我认为这些是合理的，因为【长生不老】【追求强大与逍遥】本身就是极大的欲望，在这样的背景之下，人和人之间的互动一定会更加残酷与现实。如果说这些小说的内容适合进入社会工作的人的话，那么前述台湾公司的作品就更适合青少年或家庭主妇，因为后者不那么痛苦。
再说回游戏。从游戏素质来说，鬼谷八荒有不少让人能够情愿肝的点，比如一些很有代入感的物品介绍，虽然它们只是加一些属性的物品，但是说明文字却让有看过修仙小说的玩家非常的有感觉。游戏整体地城难度还可以、而且不长（通常一场boss战10秒以内），这些都是让这本来平淡的游戏有了能够留住玩家的理由。
所以，总体来说如果你看修仙小说，这是今天少有的你能在游戏里体验到小说情节（还不太糟糕）的游戏了。",1613275530,1613276372,True,1,0,0.465449601411819458,0,True,False,True

游戏的一些问题：NPC有点傻，不会换功法，你塞给NPC书他都不学。一个金丹NPC使用筑基期的功法随处可见。然后，NPC互动性一般，就那么几样：谈话，送东西，切磋，仇杀，偷东西，双修。奇遇什么的感觉··少了点，毕竟30个小时后，所有的奇遇你都碰上几轮了。
期待后期游戏添东西吧，总体上游戏很有意思！希望后面能补更！

1. 八荒世界演变中，个人觉得这东西刚开始还好，玩到中后了就很烦，尤其是开拓地图的时候。很多时候在修炼技能或者在宗门、城里做东西的时候就被踢出去演变，回来的时候又要按过。
2. 控制上有点奇怪，比如背包右键是关闭窗口。。每次用东西就要去背包，划一下把道具找出来，然后按那个很小个的使用按钮，还要选用几个。。通常直接右键用一个吧。建议背包显示多点。每个月的新闻要去按小小个叉，右键不能用，esc也不能用
3. 个人觉得难度有点苛刻，很多时候都要SL，可能是游戏的一部分吧。突破收集了六个元素还不是100%的，就算过了也可能不是自己要的逆天改命。
4. 成长过程算压力的。怪打起来还没有很轻松的感觉就要准备突破，没有那种把自己练到很强然后轻松突破的途径。

After playing for 20 hours and reaching the golden core stage the main thing is that the gameplay is very repetitive. Hopefully this will change as more content is added to the game increasing the variety. But as of right now, i will only recommend the game to those that really enjoy cultivation theme games and grinding. Granted, due to the current price, it is still a decent deal. 

Now with that summary out of the way, let's take a comprehensive look at what is good and bad.

Pro:
-Good Graphics. I really like the character portraits, there are a ton of variety and I dont think i've encounter any of the same character in my 20 hrs or gameplay. The same cannot be said about some of the other games i've played like Scroll of Taiwu and ACS.

-Variety in usable Techniques/Skills. There are 6 elemental, and 6 martial school/category of skills. Each with at least two different basic attacks, special attack, movement, ultimate, and passives. Then there is the rng system which increase those flavor with ""minor"" attributes and stat. The issue is that currently, you probably wont switch in mid or late game as those skills will have a hefty stat requirement .

-Good UI. The user interface is a lot better that Scroll of Taiwu and ACS imo. You wont need a ton of screen hopping just to compare the different techniques or look up certain stats. There are good tooltips, which should help especially with translations. The design is pretty clean, relevant information are generally shown on the same screen. Obviously other QoL features can be added but those will probably be knocked out in the final polishing stages.

-Interesting breakthrough system. Basically you have to collect certain boss treasure for higher breakthrough chance, or better stats after breaking through. However this is only interesting initially while becoming a chore later on; as a Munchkin there is no reason why i would not get all the necessary items for the best breakthrough always.

Cons
-Obviously the lack of English translation.

-Repetitive zoning. This is my main qualm with the game. Basically your first initial three cultivation stages will be stuck in the starting/initial zone. Then you progressed to the next zone for the next thee-ish stages. And you probably repeat this process maybe for a total of 3 times? Once for each corner of the map, at least this is what it feels like from the first half of the map. And in each of these zones, you basically track and hunt those ""boss"" creatures for treasures so you can breakthrough to the next stage. This is a major design questions which may or may not get addressed; but its symptoms can be alleviated with more variety. Currently each of these major zones or segments of the game just feels too similar.

-Repetitive boss/elite/monster. This will probably get changed as more content is added to the game, where we will get more variety in enemies. But as of right now, a lot of creatures are recycled between zones. And this is not helped by the fact that you will be repeating a bunch of similar quests in order to farm up sect contribution points, money, or stat consumables. The other major issue with this is that i get no joy from killing all those popcorn enemies; it really starts to feel like a chore once you are doing the same thing in the next major zone. I personally think the gameplay will be better if some of those dungeons are shorten and kept to be just boss/elite fights (with more variety of course).

-Repetitive combat. Basically just hold left mouse button to spam your auto attack, then click right mouse button to cast your special skill whenever its out of cooldown, and same with the ultimate. Press space to dodge enemy's ultimate with the movement skill. While there are a ton of variety in skills and their animations etc, the core concept is the same. Just keep casting them when they are not on cooldown... Perhaps some form of defensive skill in addition to our current movement skills should be added.

Closing remarks
Npcs are still lacking some basic functionality if you compare this to Scroll of Taiwu where they actually have more useful items, along with the ability to teach you skills. Its really weird that you can kill some high level cultivators (when they only have 1 hp), but they only drop sucky high grade pills or garbage ingredients which you cant use anyway. I guess too many items are tiered or stat locked.But functionality wise, this will probably be improved as more development is done.

Also, sure the game may get ""updated"" daily, but this is all due to modern software's more Agile release cycles. Having more updates does not mean you have substantial content in each update. However this has yet to be seen as the game has only been out for a couple of days. One thing for certain is that the developers are at least passionate enough to add content each day for minor fixes.

地狱模式需要提供一些特别的激励和特别的难度，比如地狱角色特有的天赋、逆天改命，特别的BOSS、剧情，并且因为地狱模式都不是新手，很多东西可以简化而不是单纯的更加耗时。现在的情况是单纯的增加数值来提高难度，且没有任何特别激励，地狱模式并没有太大意义。

剧情做的也很一般，都是拿神话故事填充，同样的社交系统是我觉得最傻逼的，送个妹妹她喜欢的兴趣的物品她竟然不要？结婚了以后老婆也不要送的符合她兴趣的东西，什么情况，然后就是对话太重复了，看多了就有点乏味，所以我也是沉迷了十几个小时突然就不想玩了。

但是还是要给一个好评，一是刚开始玩确实有那么十几个小时的沉迷期，确实很不错，文案和美术风格方面也很棒，有那种蛮荒的风格，同样的也要为独立游戏制作人们点个好评，但是对于这款游戏的未来我并不看好，看了一下更新计划我不觉得未来加入的东西能改变当下的玩法和一些剧情上的缺陷。",1612171992,1612171992,True,2,1,0.47223934531211853,2,True,False,True

1） 装备系统。很多玄幻/仙侠小说里的角色都使用神兵宝甲等, 为什么这个游戏没有呢？如果是担心装备强过角色可以使用属性需求。我认为装备可以大大增加角色可模型。
