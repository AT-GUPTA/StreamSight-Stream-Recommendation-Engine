This is one of the best games of all time and it deserves 100% of the attention it got. I remember first playing this some time in 2016 or 2017, back when I was only around 9 years old. I would play with my best friend at the time, David, and sometimes I'd play with my brother. It was one of the most fun games we played, and since my best friend moved away a few years ago, this game holds an extremely special place in my heart. Earlier today, I realized that even though I've played hundreds of hours across Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC, I've never actually seen the ending to the game. I decided that I had nothing better to do and decided to finally see the ending after so long. I had no idea how emotional I would be when i beat it, but after 7 years it made me cry like I've never cried to a game before.

The game's charmingly awkward protagonist stumbles and flops through surreal environments, turning every mundane task into a slapstick adventure.

The open-world design allows for endless possibilities, encouraging players to experiment with solving puzzles and completing challenges in their own zany ways. The multiplayer aspect amplifies the chaos, turning cooperative tasks into a symphony of laughter and collaboration.

The physics engine, while intentionally clumsy, adds an unpredictable and comical element to every action. Maneuvering your character may seem challenging at first, but it quickly becomes part of the charm, leading to unexpected and hilarious outcomes.

The game's minimalist aesthetic complements its whimsical nature, and the soothing background music enhances the overall laid-back atmosphere. The level design is ingenious, presenting players with puzzles that require both thought and experimentation.

Human: Fall Flat is a testament to the idea that gaming should be about joy and laughter. Its unique blend of physics-based antics and cooperative gameplay makes it a standout experience for friends looking to share a good laugh. Whether you're solving puzzles or tumbling through the world with friends, Human: Fall Flat is a delightful adventure in awkwardness that guarantees smiles and laughter throughout.",1689271856,1707036594,True,1,0,0.511278212070465088,0,True,False,False

What I don't like is:
- the character is too wobbly, sometimes it's pretty hard to control
- some puzzles can be very obscure
- the devs just keep adding achievements to the game for no good reason

The last one is the reason I'm ""review-bombing"" the game (although one review won't matter much). I'm tired of going back to an old game I'm not particularly fond of just to get 1-4 achievements added together with a level from the workshop (I can use workshop, you know?).

Grieving, I found solace in the virtual world of Human Fall Flat, a whimsical game that unexpectedly became my lifeline.

Through its charming puzzles and quirky physics, Human Fall Flat offered me not just a distraction, but a new perspective on life. As I navigated the game's whimsical landscapes alongside my children, laughter replaced tears, and joy slowly began to fill the void left by loss.

With each puzzle conquered and each silly mishap shared with my kids, I rediscovered the simple pleasures of companionship and play. Human Fall Flat became more than just a game; it became a catalyst for healing and a beacon of hope for brighter days ahead.

In the end, Human Fall Flat taught me that even in the darkest of times, there's always a glimmer of light waiting to guide us back to happiness. And for that, I'll forever be grateful.",1706995583,1706995583,True,10,1,0.583726584911346436,2,True,False,False

Devs/Publisher pulled a really nasty move and silently removed Linux support.

Not only removing it, but entirely breaking it by walling off Linux users to play with Win/OSX users due to version checks.
Could be fixed if the Linux depot would be deleted, but that is apparently too hard.

Now to play again with other platforms, Linux users have to force Steam to download the Windows version and use Proton.

I'm not against the decision, it's understandable that more platforms are a pain to a small team, but this could have been handled extremely better than it has been.

I've been playing this game for years on console and i'm coming up on 10 hours on Steam spent on this game in two days. I've really been grinding the achievements, so far I have 70/122 achievements completed and I haven't gotten bored of the grind, so far it seems like a relatively fun and mildly hard game to 100% but the challenge keeps it interesting.

[list]
[*]Quirky Physics-Based Fun: Human Fall Flat brings a unique, physics-based approach to puzzle-solving and platforming, creating an environment where creativity and experimentation thrive.

Charming and Unconventional Design:
[*]The game's whimsical art style and character design contribute to its charm, making it a visually appealing and lighthearted experience.

Solo Struggles:

[*]Multiplayer Mayhem:
The true magic of Human: Fall Flat reveals itself in online multiplayer. With friends, the game transforms into a chaotic and hilarious adventure, turning even the simplest tasks into moments of shared laughter.

[*]Cooperative Puzzle Solving:
The puzzles in multiplayer mode often require teamwork and coordination. Solving challenges together enhances the gameplay experience, fostering a sense of camaraderie among players.

The game supports both keyboard and controller (I prefer using an Xbox controller for it) but allows for split screen, remote play together and if your friend owns the game you can just play normally together with each having their own screen. That said I have played it in both scenarios and while each player having their own copy works best, remote play together works just fine with me on my Xbox Controller and my friend using their keyboard

In all of the co-op sessions we had so far, we had a lot of fun. For this reason, Human: Fall Flat earns a very easy recommendation even at full price.

Besides cleverly designed levels there is also a thriving steam workshop community. And every few months there is a new level added to the core game which usually comes from the workshop community. So in these few years that I wasn't playing, there was a lot of levels added. So I decided to try them out.

And it just came back to me how great this game is. Of course the core mechanic is controlling a stiff human that needs to climb around and move objects. It is a physic puzzle game - the genre I am very fond of. The human isn't that hard to control. You can move, jump and grab stuff with left and right hand using triggers on your controller. When using a controller, the position of your hand depends on the angle of camera. This is probably the most annoying aspect of the game. For example: when you want your human to extend hands to the sky (something you will do a lot) you need to point the camera to the sky. Considering that it is a third person view, you will clip into objects a lot when doing it. When playing in split screen, it can help a lot looking at the other player's screen to provide different angle on your character. Thats's a coop right there.

But for me the controls never were a big issue. The game luckly doesn't ask you to do very crazy platforming or hard to execute movements. Rather it makes you figure out the way to get over the obstacles. It is a puzzle game after all. And levels are insanely imaginative and beautifully themed. One of the most memorable levels is for sure water in which you steer the big ship. And ""dark"" where you resurrect frankenstein. Or ""Ice"" where you go skiing. And the game is filled with such beautiful discoveries and easter eggs.

This game hardly has any music. A beautiful melody is usually triggered when hitting a checkpoint. Not bad to be honest, but richer OST would definitely be welcome.

With that said I cannot recommend this game enough, especially for the multiplayer experience. It is clever and lovely at the same time. It is for sure one of my all time favourites..",1635896813,1700726817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's the kind of game where even the simplest task, like opening a door or climbing a ladder, becomes a sidesplitting performance. As you grapple with physics-defying puzzles and try to coordinate your character's flailing movements, you'll find yourself in a perpetual state of chuckles. The beauty lies in its absurdity; it's a playground where chaos reigns and laughter thrives. Each stumble, flop, and misstep is a comedic gem, making ""Human Fall Flat"" an experience that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear long after you've closed the game.

You try again and again, fail, fall, struggle until you complete one puzzle. And then there is the next one.
The game also lacks a bit of interesting gameplay mechanics for this length. You do pretty much the same at the end of the game as you did at the beginning. 
Also even though the game features a local-coop mode there is absolutely no reason to play it in co-op. All the levels are designed to be completed solo so one of the players will probably get bored if the other one will be taking the initiative or will be better at climbing.
The music and the narrator's commentaries are very charming but there are so little of them in the game...

In ""Grow Home,"" you guide a wobbly robot named BUD as he uses physics to solve puzzles and climb a giant plant. ""Gang Beasts"" features blobby characters wobbling around, employing physics for multiplayer brawls. Now, in ""Human: Fall Flat,"" you control a blobby character named Bob, who's equally unsteady on his feet and uses physics to tackle puzzles and navigate through various rooms.

At first, I was a bit skeptical. The initial levels felt derivative and somewhat clumsy compared to its peers. Bob, with his blank expression and featureless appearance, didn't immediately win me over like BUD did in ""Grow Home."" However, my opinion took a turn once I got the hang of climbing.

Bob's animations, initially clumsy, suddenly appeared endearing as I learned to manipulate his independently controlled arms for climbing. The whole process, from jumping a gap to raising Bob's hands above his head and then running toward the edge, became oddly satisfying. It was as if I'd stumbled upon the secret to making Bob lovably daft, and I found myself rooting for him.

But here's where ""Human: Fall Flat"" veers into subjective territory. While BUD in ""Grow Home"" had a clear goal of reaching the top of a giant plant, Bob's objectives are less defined. You're not entirely sure where you're going, except that each sprawling level eventually leads to your plummeting to the next one. For BUD, it felt urgent and desperate; for Bob, it's more casual, albeit entertaining. Whether you find this patience-testing or not largely depends on your mood at any given moment.

The game's ability to let you improvise solutions is undeniably rewarding. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, and the game's open-ended approach often leads to unexpected ways of solving them. It's immensely satisfying to think outside the box, even if the game sometimes interprets your antics as being stuck and drops a hint.

My affection for ""Human: Fall Flat"" oscillated between delight and annoyance. The later levels, with their vibrant colors and character, provided a lovely contrast to the initial blandness. Yet, I occasionally found myself frustrated by Bob's unwieldy movements and wished for more straightforward controls.

In the end, ""Human: Fall Flat"" exudes charm and offers genuine fun, as long as you can endure its unpredictably goofy physics. It's a natural evolution of the ""Grow Home"" concept, successfully making it their own. And that climbing animation? It's simply delightful.",1697909487,1697909487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't know whether the levels come directly from the workshop or are made/overhauled by the devs, but if a level is put into the game as official content with achievements and all, is it too much to ask that it at least works?

The fact that new achievements pop up every few months means that you never get to keep the 100% achievement badge for too long, so if you're like me and aren't that interested in the game itself anymore (I bought the game 7 years ago) but would like to keep the achievement badge, it's even more frustrating if the levels are bugged or boring.",1469470599,1696802817,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing ""Human: Fall Flat,"" I couldn't help but draw comparisons with games like Ubisoft's ""Grow Home"" and Boneloaf's ""Gang Beasts."" This quirky physics-based puzzler seems to follow in the same wobbly footsteps as these titles, but it manages to carve out its own unique charm.

In ""Grow Home,"" you guide a wobbly robot named BUD as he uses physics to solve puzzles and climb a giant plant. ""Gang Beasts"" features blobby characters wobbling around, employing physics for multiplayer brawls. Now, in ""Human: Fall Flat,"" you control a blobby character named Bob, who's equally unsteady on his feet and uses physics to tackle puzzles and navigate through various rooms.

At first, I was a bit skeptical. The initial levels felt derivative and somewhat clumsy compared to its peers. Bob, with his blank expression and featureless appearance, didn't immediately win me over like BUD did in ""Grow Home."" However, my opinion took a turn once I got the hang of climbing.

Bob's animations, initially clumsy, suddenly appeared endearing as I learned to manipulate his independently controlled arms for climbing. The whole process, from jumping a gap to raising Bob's hands above his head and then running toward the edge, became oddly satisfying. It was as if I'd stumbled upon the secret to making Bob lovably daft, and I found myself rooting for him.

But here's where ""Human: Fall Flat"" veers into subjective territory. While BUD in ""Grow Home"" had a clear goal of reaching the top of a giant plant, Bob's objectives are less defined. You're not entirely sure where you're going, except that each sprawling level eventually leads to your plummeting to the next one. For BUD, it felt urgent and desperate; for Bob, it's more casual, albeit entertaining. Whether you find this patience-testing or not largely depends on your mood at any given moment.

The game's ability to let you improvise solutions is undeniably rewarding. Some puzzles have multiple solutions, and the game's open-ended approach often leads to unexpected ways of solving them. It's immensely satisfying to think outside the box, even if the game sometimes interprets your antics as being stuck and drops a hint.

My affection for ""Human: Fall Flat"" oscillated between delight and annoyance. The later levels, with their vibrant colors and character, provided a lovely contrast to the initial blandness. Yet, I occasionally found myself frustrated by Bob's unwieldy movements and wished for more straightforward controls.

In the end, ""Human: Fall Flat"" exudes charm and offers genuine fun, as long as you can endure its unpredictably goofy physics. It's a natural evolution of the ""Grow Home"" concept, successfully making it their own. And that climbing animation? It's simply delightful.",1696736346,1696736346,True,10,0,0.647435903549194336,0,True,False,False

Human Fall Flat is a great execution of a flawed idea. That idea is to combine wily ragdoll physics/controls with a 3D puzzle platformer, which makes for an immeasurably frustrating experience. Unfortunately, that single reason made this review ""not recommended"" because it's the soul of the game. It's a shame because the dev team created a solid product in many other aspects.

Its strongest feature is that it's a good game to play with young kids. They don't need to be a master of the controls to play along, nor do they need to ""keep up"" to progress with you to the next area.

[h1]Ragdoll physics / Controls[/h1]

Let's start with the very core of my complaint. This is one of the most annoying games I've played in my life and it's entirely due to the design of the controls combined with the ragdoll physics. Those who have played Gang Beasts will find this one familiar. While the controls/physics feel more refined and functional than in Gang Beasts, this approach is in the wrong type of game. In Gang Beasts, it's more fun because it's a casual, button-mashing, brawling, party game. But in HFF, it's a nerve-wracking nightmare because you actually need to [i]do[/i] things in this one besides just wildly hurling yourself at your opponent. A certain level of precision is required.

For those not familiar with Gang Beasts let me put it this way: The gameplay is like having all the side effects of being the drunkest frat boy at the kegger, but with none of the fun of being intoxicated. You can't walk straight. Your arms flail around with the accuracy of wet noodles, and then you're expected to perform seemingly simple but practically frustrating feats. It's fun if you're the drunk, but not if you're the one controlling the drunk person, and that's what this game feels like. You have control of your character, but only [i]some[/i] control.

If any of these tasks sound appealing, then this game is for you:
[list]
[*]spending a couple minutes simply trying to plug in wires, pick up something off the ground or flip a switch, because your character can't keep his freaking arms steady
[*]spending five minutes trying to stack a couple blocks that easily topple because they behave like styrofoam in a low-g environment
[*]spending ten minutes trying to climb a wall because your floppy dude can only inch his way up a few pixels at a time. It's about 30 button/stick movements just to climb up three feet of wall.
[/list]

Ill give them credit, I used a controller in ways I've never used before. So if that sounds fun to you, then by all means, jump right in. Looking at the other reviews, I'm clearly in the minority here.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2949433534

[h1]Puzzles[/h1]

The puzzles are decently challenging; more than a few are clever. Every level had something unique to accomplish in it. A few puzzles made me stop and think for a bit, however there wasn't anything so complicated that I was totally out of ideas and had to come back another day. It is well done in this regard, but not a brain buster.

Keep in mind that the hard part isn't solving the puzzles, it's executing your ideas. That is where you'll spend most of your time. You may know full well that you need to stick a key in the door to open it, but you'll spend a full 60 seconds just trying to get the freaking key in the door. Other times you may spend five minutes doing the wrong thing because you'll believe ""I'm just not getting the pieces together right"", only realizing after many attempts that it was never going to work.

There's a loophole built-in that allows you to skip over some puzzles. Your character can grip just about any surface. This means that instead of solving a puzzle to get over a wall properly, you can spend ten minutes making your character climb over a wall or obstacle. It's extremely tedious, but it can be less frustrating than some of the puzzles. Sometimes I looked at a puzzle and thought ""screw this"" and just opted to slowly climb over a wall rather than be bothered trying to do some feat of precision with imprecise controls. It's nice that this loophole exists, but should this kind of thing exist in a [i]good[/i] game?

[h1]A few positive notes[/h1]

If I haven't scared you off yet, you'll be pleased that there is quite a bit of content. The early reviews comment on it being short, but it is anything but short now. Since it's original release the devs have continued to roll out new levels every couple of months. There are a total of 23 official levels now. On top of that, the workshop area is fairly vibrant with many quality fan made levels.

There is also quite a bit of customization you can do for your character. There are many preset combinations, but for the creative types out there you can go into great detail to assemble, draw and paint your own unique character. Importing of webcam images is supported too.

The soundtrack is a soothing solo piano, which is actually quite good.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]

All of the levels are possible to complete as single-player, but it's a tad easier to complete multiplayer as long as you have a competent teammate. While I'm glad they didn't hamstring single-player, it makes multiplayer pointless. Which is ironic, because this game is meant to be primarily played multiplayer.

I've tried both local multiplayer and online multiplayer. Online play was a little laggy. Incompetent and sometimes counterproductive teammates made a frustrating game even more frustrating. Most people I played with either got in the way or weren't helping. You really have to cross your fingers every time you join a lobby and hope others are on the same level as you or better.

[h1]Good for kids?[/h1]

I'll admit, this is a good game to play with a young kid. I went through nearly all of the game this way. As mentioned before, all levels are designed to be complete-able by a single player, so if your kid is too new/young to gaming to contribute you can still carry your kids through all the levels (as long as they don't actively sabotage your efforts). They don't need to master the controls as long as they have fun tagging along. Furthermore, you aren't attached to them like a ball and chain. They can get distracted and wander off, and it will not slow you down in the least. My five year old enjoyed it, but she was mostly just wandering around, while I was mashing buttons attempting to solve the puzzles. It was fun for her!

[h1]Achievements and completion time[/h1]

It took me 54 hours total to get through all 23 levels, 115 achievements and play a few community workshop levels. Yes, I actually did play through this entire game, earned 100% of the achievements and still left a negative review. I have this nasty habit of wanting to finish things I start, but I digress.

Other than that, the achievements are an ok balance between challenge and obtainable. Some achievements are rarely earned (0.1%) but that's only because they are related to levels that were recently released (thus few people have had a chance to play them). None felt impossible, and only one was grindy (""Speedrun"").

The levels take over one and a half hours each to get through the first time, which to me was too long. It was a big relief when each level was finally over.

It's quite a simple game, too and has no really advanced graphics (not in a bad way). Quite fun to play with friends.

My only downsides are:
1. There is no cross platform play (e.g People who bought Windows store version cannot play with people who bought Steam version)
2. Characters can sometimes glitch out and have for example one leg gone (or when I was playing online, my character got totally stuck and could not move)
3. Most of the ""levels"" that other people make are in a foreign language and cannot be read by somebody who does not know said foreign language. I would like for the game to have an inbuilt level editor, so that players can edit levels more easily and so that level making is more accessible, especially to platforms outside the Steam version, since for PS4 and Windows store version, there is no community levels.

I realize it's a physics game and that this is intentional, but the player character's lack of maneuverability is inherently frustrating. While the puzzles aren't conceptually difficult, it's not particularly fun to be stuck in a level for a technical reason, even though you've identified the route out and the mechanism by which to get there. It's also easy to get physically stuck on or behind objects. In a group, that frustration can sometimes be funny.

That's not to say this game isn't worthwhile or interesting. I didn't find the puzzles particularly engaging to begin with, but this game isn't really about complicated puzzles: it's about failing to do basic human motion properly (and having fun with that). Admittedly, it is fun at first, even in singleplayer. The physics engine and its whole ""flinging yourself around"" approach is amusing. It was neat to think about individually coordinating each of your hands to grab objects, climb, move things, etc. Perhaps this is how toddlers feel every day.

Still, it didn't do it for me. An additional pain point is that the way the camera moves is at best disorienting and at worst nausea-inducing. (I don't typically get motion sickness in video games either.) I wasn't engaged by the narrator's remarks and the soundtrack felt out of place. The graphics are intentionally low-poly, and some of the levels are a bit cute, but I felt the plainness was lacking some artistic spark. Performance was perfectly good though!

If you want a game that lets you fool around with your friends, this is it! If you want a more technically playable puzzle game, there are more suitable options out there. Personally, just not my thing.",1693614107,1693614107,False,1,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆

Human: Fall Flat, released in 2016, invites players into a charming and surreal world of physics-based puzzles and goofy escapades. Developed by No Brakes Games, the game offers a unique blend of puzzle-solving, creativity, and lighthearted humor that results in an entertaining and often hilarious gameplay experience.

The central character, Bob, is a customizable and delightfully clumsy humanoid who stumbles and tumbles through a series of dreamlike levels. The game's physics-driven mechanics are intentionally wonky, leading to comical and unexpected interactions with the environment. This intentional quirkiness is at the heart of the game's charm and appeal.

Each level of Human: Fall Flat is a sandbox of possibilities, tasking players with navigating intricate puzzles and obstacles. The game encourages creative problem-solving, allowing players to manipulate objects, climb surfaces, and experiment with the environment in their quest to reach the exit. The open-ended nature of the puzzles means that there are often multiple solutions, fostering a sense of accomplishment and ingenuity.

The cooperative multiplayer mode enhances the enjoyment, allowing you to tackle the challenges with friends. The chaotic and collaborative nature of solving puzzles together often results in hilarious outcomes, from inadvertently launching each other into the air to trying to coordinate complex maneuvers.

Human: Fall Flat's visual design is simple yet endearing, with its charmingly minimalistic environments and quirky character animations. The dreamlike settings, from ice caves to industrial complexes, offer a visually diverse and captivating backdrop for the puzzling adventures.

The game's humor is derived from the absurdity of the physics interactions and the ragdoll-like movements of the characters. Watching Bob stumble, flop, and flail through the environment is a constant source of amusement, and the unpredictability of the physics can lead to genuinely laugh-out-loud moments.

Despite its strengths, Human: Fall Flat does have its limitations. The intentionally awkward controls and physics mechanics, while a defining feature of the game, can also lead to occasional frustration when precision is required. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive narrative or progression system may limit its long-term appeal for some players.

In conclusion, Human: Fall Flat offers a delightful and entertaining blend of physics-based puzzles, creativity, and humor. Its charming visuals, open-ended gameplay, and cooperative multiplayer mode make it a standout choice for players seeking a unique and lighthearted gaming experience.

If you're looking for a game that will tickle your funny bone and challenge your problem-solving skills in a whimsical and imaginative world, Human: Fall Flat is a delightful choice that promises laughter, creativity, and hours of engaging puzzle-solving fun.",1691440481,1691440976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1691190161,1691190161,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

again, i absolutely LOVE the game, and everyone needs to be able to enjoy it. i have over 40 hours of play time, playing with friends is def the best option if u wanna play this game. and... again.... its just so fun, i love how it works your brain in different ways yet keeps it HIGHLY entertaining 🫶 these ppl did a really good job making this game. i cant talk about it enough 😭😭😭 please keep adding more levels, they really never get old <3",1690435387,1690435387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who's witnessed the world evolve in countless ways, I never expected to be so amazed by a video game. The sheer fun and joy it brings, even in my older years, have left me pleasantly surprised.

In my younger days, we couldn't have imagined exploring virtual worlds or interacting with characters as we do now. But this game has managed to captivate me in ways I never thought possible. Playing as an adorable, bobble-headed character, I navigate through charming landscapes filled with puzzles and laughter.

When my grandchildren first introduced me to ""Human Fall Flat,"" I must admit I was skeptical. How could something seemingly simple hold my attention? However, I soon discovered that the game's delightful graphics and physics-based challenges provided endless entertainment and moments of laughter.

Seeing my digital avatar stumble and fumble, much like my own real-life movements, is both funny and endearing. But what truly surprised me is the sense of achievement I feel when overcoming difficult puzzles or finding creative solutions. It keeps my mind sharp and reminds me that learning and growth never stop, no matter one's age.

One of the most heartwarming aspects of the game is the co-op mode, where I can play with my grandchildren. They patiently guide me through the virtual world, just as I guided them through life when they were young. The shared experience strengthens our bond and creates treasured memories.

""Human Fall Flat"" is a testament to how technology can bring people of all ages together and provide endless enjoyment. It's more than just a game; it's a source of laughter and happiness, proving that joy knows no age limits.

In my time, we believed that laughter was the best medicine. Well, I can confidently say that ""Human Fall Flat"" is a potent tonic for the soul. It keeps my heart young, my spirits high, and my wonder for the world alive",1652335322,1690185297,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has a lot to offer. The physic's based puzzles are a fun challenge, the custom options for  models are great, and it's great to play with friends. IF they're sitting right next to you. It's certainly viable to play the game by yourself and still have fun, but the servers have Nintendo level control delays at any given moment. For a game that requires the player to maneuver with already floaty controls (that make the game fun...), bad server connection is the absolute worst (...if the server works). Half the people when you join a server kick you out, or you lose connection regardless of what the host does. The delays in the controls last a whole second and the couple times I tried to get this game to work with friends, their models weren't working, workshop levels weren't loading, or nothing was working as intended.

I still love this game regardless. The levels are challenging and very replayable, and if you have no friends to play with you can still host a server and wait for people join without the issue of bad connection. But for a game to be centered around co-op, and knowing that not everyone can play locally, the game should not have bad server connection.",1583691147,1688563593,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Без лівої ноги, без правої руки.

Плаче і ридає, жалує його.

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

Human Fall Flat, developed by No Brakes Games, is a quirky and physics-based puzzle adventure that offers a unique and entertaining gameplay experience. Players take on the role of Bob, a wobbly and whimsical character who must navigate through a series of challenging levels using his unconventional movement abilities and problem-solving skills.

Graphics: ★★★☆☆
The graphics in Human Fall Flat adopt a charming and minimalist art style that adds to the game's whimsical atmosphere. While the visuals may not be the most detailed or realistic, they suit the game's comedic and lighthearted tone. The physics-based animations of Bob and the interactive objects in the environment provide a sense of playfulness and unpredictability.

Gameplay: ★★★★☆
The gameplay of Human Fall Flat revolves around controlling Bob's ragdoll-like character to solve physics-based puzzles. Players must manipulate objects, climb, swing, and jump through the levels, all while navigating the challenges presented by the game's unique physics engine. The controls can feel intentionally clumsy, adding to the game's humor and creating hilarious situations as Bob stumbles and flops his way through the obstacles.

Puzzles and Challenges: ★★★★☆
Human Fall Flat offers a variety of puzzles and challenges that require creative thinking and experimentation. Each level presents a different environment with its own set of obstacles and puzzles to overcome. From using objects to create makeshift ramps to swinging on ropes and levers, players must find unique solutions to progress. The open-ended nature of the puzzles encourages exploration and invites players to approach challenges in their own way.

Cooperative Multiplayer: ★★★★☆
One of the standout features of Human Fall Flat is its cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing players to team up with friends or other online players to tackle the puzzles together. The multiplayer aspect adds an additional layer of fun and laughter as players collaborate or unintentionally hinder each other's progress, leading to amusing and unpredictable moments.

Replayability: ★★★☆☆
While Human Fall Flat may not have extensive replay value in terms of storyline or branching paths, its physics-based gameplay and cooperative multiplayer mode offer some replayability. The joy of experimenting with the game's physics, discovering new ways to solve puzzles, and the potential for different experiences with friends make it worth revisiting.

Conclusion:
Human Fall Flat delivers a unique and entertaining experience with its quirky physics-based gameplay, charming visuals, and cooperative multiplayer mode. The game's humor, puzzle design, and open-ended approach provide a refreshing break from traditional puzzle-solving games. Whether playing solo or with friends, Human Fall Flat offers plenty of laughter-filled moments and enjoyable challenges, making it a worthwhile adventure for those seeking a lighthearted and creative gaming experience.",1686686171,1686686171,True,26,1,0.749302804470062256,0,True,False,False

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have
often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1685835094,1685835094,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Human: Fall Flat is an absolute gem of a game that deserves all the praise it receives on Steam! From the moment I started playing, I was hooked by its unique blend of physics-based puzzles and whimsical charm. This game is a true delight for anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a fun, lighthearted adventure.

One of the standout features of Human: Fall Flat is its physics-based gameplay. Controlling Bob, the endearing and slightly clumsy protagonist, is an absolute blast. The controls may seem simple at first, but they lend themselves to a world of hilarious possibilities. From swinging on ropes to climbing obstacles, each action is subject to the whims of the game's physics engine, leading to unexpected and often side-splitting outcomes. It's impossible not to laugh when you and your friends are flailing around, trying to coordinate your movements and failing spectacularly!

The level design in Human: Fall Flat is fantastic. Each level presents a new and imaginative environment to explore, with its own set of puzzles to solve. I was constantly surprised by the creativity and variety of the challenges. Whether it's navigating a construction site, scaling a snowy mountain, or even exploring dreamlike fantasy realms, the game keeps things fresh and exciting throughout.

But what truly sets Human: Fall Flat apart is its charming art style and endearing protagonist. Bob is a lovable, blob-like character with customizable features that allow you to make him your own. The visual design is simple yet captivating, with vibrant colors and a whimsical atmosphere that adds to the game's overall charm. The soundtrack perfectly complements the gameplay, enhancing the immersion and creating an enjoyable experience.

The multiplayer aspect of Human: Fall Flat is an absolute blast. Whether you're playing with friends or joining a random online game, the laughter and chaos that ensue are unparalleled. Working together to solve puzzles or simply messing around and wreaking havoc, the multiplayer mode adds another layer of fun and unpredictability.

In conclusion, Human: Fall Flat is a must-play game that delivers endless laughs, creative puzzles, and an overall heartwarming experience. Its physics-based gameplay, charming art style, and multiplayer mode make it an absolute joy to play, whether solo or with friends. If you're looking for a light-hearted adventure filled with laughter, this game is an absolute gem that deserves a spot in your Steam library!",1661594482,1685216931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Reminds me of Gang Beasts, although this one is more of a Co-Op experience and less of a PvP one.
The multiplayer is really laggy sometimes and it can be difficult to do a lot of the objectives or just jump. Otherwise, it is pretty funny to pick people up or just climb straight past puzzles.
The vehicles in this game are so weird and probably the most fun part of the whole experience, among all the incredibly silly puzzles.

Human Fall Flat is a physics-based puzzle game that provides a unique and hilarious experience for players. The game revolves around controlling a clumsy, wobbly character named Bob as he navigates through various puzzles and obstacles.

The game's physics-based gameplay is one of the highlights of the game, and it is truly impressive how well the game engine simulates Bob's movements and the world around him. It can be a bit challenging to get used to the controls, but once you do, it adds to the game's humor and charm.

The puzzles in Human Fall Flat are inventive, and the game constantly introduces new mechanics and challenges as you progress. The game is also incredibly open-ended, which allows for players to come up with creative solutions to the puzzles.

The game's graphics and sound design are simple yet effective, and the game's visual style adds to the game's charm. The game also has an excellent multiplayer mode, which allows you to play with up to 8 players online, which can be an absolute blast with friends.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Human Fall Flat. The game's quirky humor, inventive puzzles, and physics-based gameplay make it a unique and memorable experience. It's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a fun and challenging puzzle game with a touch of humor.",1682179498,1682179498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a game that's full of laughter and silliness, but also requires some serious brainpower. Let's take a closer look at the pros and cons of this charming game:

Pros:
[list]
[*]The game's physics-based gameplay is unique and engaging, as you control a character that wobbles and stumbles through a variety of obstacles. It's a lot of fun to watch your character stumble around, and it adds an extra layer of challenge to the puzzles.
[*]The game's graphics are charming and whimsical, with a cartoonish art style that's full of personality. It's a visual treat that will make you smile.
[*]The game's puzzles are challenging but rewarding, with a variety of obstacles to overcome and solutions to discover. It's a game that will keep your brain engaged and your creativity flowing.
[*]The game's co-op mode is a blast, allowing you to play with friends and work together to solve puzzles and challenges. It's a great way to bond and have fun with others.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]The game's controls can be a bit finicky at times, especially when it comes to moving and manipulating objects. It may take some time to get used to the character's wobbly movements.
[*]The game's difficulty level can be unbalanced, with some puzzles feeling too easy and others feeling nearly impossible. This can lead to frustration and a feeling of unfairness.
[*]The game's replay value is a bit low, as once you've solved the puzzles, there's not much reason to go back and play through again.
[/list]

Overall, Human: Fall Flat is a charming and engaging game that's perfect for anyone who loves puzzles and physics-based gameplay. With its unique mechanics, whimsical graphics, and challenging puzzles, it's a game that's worth playing.

PC and Xbox players cannot play together. Furthermore, even playing the game solo was a terrible experience. While the soundtrack on the loading screen is nice, finding a good match is difficult due to the lack of servers and players.

But even if you do manage to find a game, you may end up waiting for 20 minutes in a loading screen only to find yourself stuck. And even when you do join a game, it may not be what you were expecting. I joined a lobby that ended up being a roleplay server, with no indication of that in the lobby name or description. And to make matters worse, the other players were talking about ""e-dating"" and having weird personal conversations.

The game lacks any real objectives or sense of purpose, and the gameplay is a letdown. I was hoping for an arcade/cartoony feel with fun minigames, but instead, I found myself disappointed and wishing I could get my money back. I normally do not write reviews, but I had to warn others about this game's false marketing and lackluster gameplay. Don't waste your money on Human: Fall Flat.

This game is really fun when it comes down to it's puzzles! Although they are really easy. The hard stuff is the puzzles that involve movement, because the physics in the game are so unbelievably bad that if you aren't extremely careful and take like 1-2 minuets making sure your legs are up, your back is straight, and more before you let go you will get launched forwards. Which sounds like fun! If it didn't completely fuck you over in almost half of the games puzzles. And if you body is slightly twisted in a way you can't fix, you are just going to get launched no matter what.

This game is a hilarious and wacky adventure that will have you falling flat on your face - literally - and loving every minute of it.One of the best things about Human: Fall Flat is its physics engine, which allows you to control your character's movements in a hilariously clumsy way. You'll stumble, bumble, and flop your way through each level, trying to solve puzzles and reach your objectives despite your character's complete lack of coordination.But don't worry, falling flat on your face is all part of the fun!

The game mechanics are brilliantly designed, and the physics-based puzzles will keep you engaged and entertained for hours on end.

The game's graphics are stunning, and the beautifully designed environments are a delight to explore. The levels are varied and well-crafted, and each one provides a unique challenge that will test your skills and creativity.

The controls are simple and intuitive, making it easy to pick up and play for anyone. However, mastering them is an entirely different story, and it is what makes the game so much fun. The game is designed to be played with friends, and the co-op mode is an absolute blast. Working together to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles is a great way to bond and have fun with your friends.

Overall, Human Fall Flat is a fantastic game that I would highly recommend to anyone. It is a game that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and keep you entertained for hours on end. The developers have done an excellent job creating a unique and fun experience that is accessible to everyone.

The mechanics are deceptively simple, very easy to learn but hard to master.

I spent my last $20 to my name thinking this was gang beasts and needless to say I was crushed. To my ignorance I discovered a silver lining, my father in law (who held disdain towards me) owned this game and it was the perfect opportunity to make a good impression. The first time we played was incredible, we worked together completing puzzles and i could already tell that he was warming up tom me. I told my wife about it and she was so happy. Eventually we were playing everyday for hours on end enjoying each others company. one day I logged on after my wife had gone to sleep and i noticed he was offline (this was out of the ordinary). But just then I hear a knock at the door and to my disbelief it was my father in law. He was dressed as my favorite character from the game and told me he wanted to play the game IRL. My wife woke up the next morning and found us in my sons bed (who was at his friends house that night).

The game's simple yet charming graphics, combined with its physics-based gameplay mechanics, create an immersive and enjoyable experience.

What sets Human: Fall Flat apart from other platformer games is its focus on physics-based puzzles. Players must use their creativity and problem-solving skills to navigate through each level and complete the objectives. The game's physics engine allows for a wide variety of creative solutions, and the levels are designed to encourage experimentation and exploration.

The game also features a highly customizable character, allowing players to create their own unique avatars and express themselves in the game world. The ability to customize your character is a nice touch and adds an extra layer of immersion to the game.

Another aspect of the game that I love is the multiplayer mode. Playing with friends can add a whole new level of fun to the game, as you work together to solve puzzles and navigate through the levels. The multiplayer mode is seamless and easy to use, making it a great option for online play.

Overall, I highly recommend Human: Fall Flat to anyone looking for a fun and engaging puzzle platformer game.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my husband had died.

The game's protagonist is a customizable humanoid character with floppy, exaggerated movements and animations, creating a unique and entertaining gaming experience.

One of the strengths of Human Fall Flat is its simple and intuitive controls. The player can move the character's arms and legs individually, allowing for a wide range of movements and actions, from running and jumping to carrying and throwing objects. This, combined with the game's loose physics, creates a sense of unpredictability and humor, as the character's movements are often comically awkward.

The game features a variety of levels set in different environments, including construction sites, castles, and dreamlike landscapes. Each level is filled with obstacles, puzzles, and secrets to be discovered, requiring the player to use their wits and creativity to progress. The game also features a local multiplayer mode, allowing up to eight players to collaborate or compete on the same levels.

In terms of graphics and sound, Human Fall Flat is well-designed and aesthetically pleasing. The game's whimsical and cartoonish art style is well-suited to the game's tone and theme, and the sound effects and music effectively create a sense of atmosphere.

Overall, Human Fall Flat is a fun and entertaining game that is well worth playing for fans of puzzle platformers. Its simple controls and humorous take on physics make it a standout in the genre, and its variety of levels and multiplayer mode ensure that players will have plenty to keep them engaged. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a good challenge and a good laugh.",1676039331,1676039331,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Training is required. Unlike most paratroopers, skydivers often wait until they are low, before opening the parachute. The jump can also be made from a helicopter or a balloon that is high enough in the sky. Skydiving can be an exciting sport.

Skydiving includes free falling (usually from an airplane) through the air prior to opening a parachute. Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time. Longer free fall times can be achieved by exiting an aircraft at altitudes much higher than 4,000m, but very high jumps require pressurized air within the aircraft, and bottled oxygen for the diver.
During a skydive, total freedom and control of the air can be enjoyed as well as many complex and spectacular maneuvers including flat turns, somersaults and formation skydiving. Skydiving can be enjoyed either as an individual - doing solo(alone) jumps - or as part of a team carrying out formation skydiving. Generally, the term ‘skydive’ refers to the time spent in freefall from exiting an aircraft to deploying a parachute but skydiving does include some disciplines such as accuracy landings and canopy formation flying which concentrate on the time spent once a canopy has been deployed",1675661766,1675661766,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The game is very fun and I have at least put around 200 hours into this game total on all of my platforms and I even used to speed run the game at the time when Aztec was still the final level of the game. 

There was always a bug at the time with the online mode where if you weren't the host, you'd have sometimes a 2-10 second movement delay. This was caused by my guess being host sided servers, or something. In 2022, almost 2023, games that are still supported shouldn't be having this issue and should have stable game-play for all users. It's a shame because this bug has been around since when the game first came out 6 years ago, and it's a shame to see that it's not fixed despite this game receiving large amounts of success.

It's one of my favourite games ever, but I wouldn't recommend it just due to this reason for online players. :<",1672547916,1672547916,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1672530527,1672530527,True,1,0,0.47826087474822998,1,True,False,False

I don't have any friends to play this game with, and so I ended up playing it alone. It was just a reminder of how much I miss having someone to laugh and have fun with.

The game itself is okay, but it's not something that can make up for the lack of human connection in my life. I found myself getting frustrated and depressed as I played, feeling like I was just going through the motions and not really enjoying it.

In short, Human Fall Flat is a game that is best played with friends. Unfortunately, I don't have any, and so it just ended up being a sad and depressing experience for me.

If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1640102902,1672047064,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. ;)",1646650777,1669287515,True,2,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I finally start to learn how interesting this game is. Official levels are so well designed that there is always some cheat path that leads you directly to the end via wall climbing or super jumping. But if you really want to dig deeper into the game and try to get all the achievements, you will start to appreciate how puzzles are put up together. It urges you to think outside the box, [spoiler]to break glass with rubber boats, to break a wall with wooden box or just another stone, to step on the tip of a tree or to step on a rolling ball[/spoiler]. And there are more paths for you to explore. 
It also provides players easy ways to make your own map. While crafting their game with unity engine provided by others, some of them might grow to be excellent game makers in the future. And I love how the community of Human Fall Flat to keep on creating to inject vim and vigor to the game to this date.

I do understand their reason, but I don't think taking out like that was a good move afterall. Linux users already have so much to deal with without Proton.

This makes the game quite compulsive. You will hate your character though - sort of wobbly bag of pale white jelly and always slightly unstable. Just what you need for serious 3D platforming. Actually sometimes this adds a little real challenge and subtlety to the game in a good way.

Only real negative is the save system or lack of one.. Uses checkpoints which actually work okay while in a level, but sometimes eventually you want to take a break and leave. Later levels get absolutely huge and each takes hours to play. When you reload and continue you restart back at the last checkpoint - the hell comes because everything you've done in the level resets.

My son recently started playing and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.
