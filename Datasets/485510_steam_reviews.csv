    Combat is unique and fun with some intricate systems hidden in there. It is the main reason to play this game and succeeds in carrying the rest of the game on its back. If you like a challenge this game isn't too shy to mushroom stamp you in the face and let you know whats up. The Bosses are all pretty unique and challenging in there own ways also there are a few cool duels in the dojo. Sadly there aren't many enemy types and you will see a lot of repeat offenders, including returning mix and match mini bosses. Despite this Iv yet to get bored playing.  

    There are something like 8 weapon types and they all have a distinct move-set, with a skill tree to learn new moves. My favorite has been so far is the single sword/katana. It just feels so great to use and has some incredible abilities. I accidentally came across a way to animation cancel sheathing the blade while practicing the Iai skill and having a blast getting it off quickly. 

    This game has so much loot that i spent hours in the beginning trying to make sure i saved one of every thing. My one biggest complaint is that I spend way more time in the inventory than i would like but others may enjoy going threw every little detail and difference in each equipment piece and I can respect that, it's just not for me. That being said there are many items, some with niche use cases, but because I was able to try a few at a time I was never overwhelmed, instead I welcomed the variety. Some skills and items cross over doing the exact same thing and are still welcome because that opens up slots for other talismans or ninja scrolls.   

    The Elemental system works great however it's far from intuitive. I mean who would expect fire to beat water. Basically its fire>water>electricity>wind>earth>fire. Easy to understand once you know it but not exactly what I would expect. I feel like the same system in reverse make way more sense but that could just be a cultural thing for all I know. They got creative with status such as paralyzed, poisoned, confused and even one the called stench that makes you stink so bad you can't consume items without puking. There is a whole slew of buffs and debuffs at your disposal as well. 

    If you were on the Art team you deserve props. Great job with so many cool equipment and weapon models. The characters all have interesting designs and their personalities reflect there visual identities. Environments look great and and really draw you in. Cut-scenes are there mostly to introduce characters and bosses but are nonetheless welcome and fun to watch. All game effects seem to flow well in combat managing to be flashy but not distracting. The spirits are all amazing!

   Nioh has story elements mixed in it's cut scenes and pre/post mission talks and its not bad at all. However I wouldn't go purchasing this game for its story alone. Buy this game for its advanced systemic combat. If you like confronting challenges head first and dodging, blocking, parrying, and slicing your way to victory than this game is for you. If you have no tolerance for death or loss you may want to look elsewhere. For those whole are willing to endure Nioh will reward you!

    bugs/notes: proper buttons prompts will not appear after changing the controls so you will have to remember what the original button was too. Also sometimes randomly my custom controls just stop working and it uses the default controls regardless of custom still being selected. Resetting works most of the time in this case but not always. The system they use from changing controls can get confusing if you need to make a lot of changes. Be carefully not to accidentally change your accept and decline buttons to the wrong thing. In my case I somehow managed to change them to the up and down on d-pad and had to use some gymnastics between my keyboard and controller to even reset it. 

    In conclusion, despite its flaws, this game is great and you should play it!",1708759611,1708759611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I do not have a lot to compare Nioh to in the Souls-like genre due to it being my first, I think that it does a lot of things right. The wide variety of weapons and different stances allows you to find what suits your playstyle the best. The game rewards mastering more weapons with powerful skills and an achievement per every weapon if you want to try something new later on.The Revenants also being armed with different weapons makes them stand out from each other when facing them. Often giving tips to what you need to be looking out for in their cause of death.

I really enjoy that the difficulty can be felt even in normal encounters. The incoming attacks look or sound distinct. Its a great feeling to go from struggling with new enemies at first to feeling like you can more confidently roam the map later on. There are a few maps where you can get lost tho. Earlier on the game is paced well with introducing different enemies so it feels like once you got the previous thing down theres a new challenger. When you feel up for it you can replay a previous map as a Twilight Mission, changing  all the enemies into more difficult ones and usually having more enemies than before as well. Also modifying bosses attacks with something extra from their original fight. This does mean that they do re-use some of the same maps 2-3 times as sidemissions, it hasn't bothered me personally tho. There are a lot of different ways enemies sneak up on you too as a surprise attack, which always feels refreshing and keeps you focused. Some of the boss arenas allow you to use the environment to your advantage and gain the upper hand. I do enjoy how much loot you get, even if not all of it is useful and managing your inventory can take a bit.

I feel like it doesnt have as many cutscenes like Sekiro for example, but I have always enjoyed them a lot. The traditional theme is very well done and can be seen in gear, the enemies that you fight and many of the spirits you can collect. The spirits designs are some of my favorite things about the game. Often depicting animals. As someone who cares a lot about the looks of gear, the Refashion gear transmog mechanic is much appreciated. The optional collecting of Kodama is rewarded too with some of their boons making a big difference in how much healing elixirs you are able to use as an example.

The game running this smoothly is so important for this genre. The only rare tech issue I've had is that there is a chance for your game to crash if your controller disconnects. This doesn't happen every time tho.

Has a new game + with more challenging enemies at higher levels after your first playthrough. Recommended to play with a controller. Optional online co-op. Comes with all the DLC. Choice between Japanese or English voices. Offers trading cards and badges. And a Points Shop with emojis and backgrounds. All of this made me very interested in the 2nd game too. And I will definitely be picking it up.",1705015102,1708451182,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Full review: [url=https://antares.neocities.org/blog/review-nioh]https://antares.neocities.org/blog/review-nioh[/url]

Nioh strikes an adequate middle ground between facilitating co-operative play and providing a challenge. Even though Nioh follows the “Dark Souls formula”, I think it has enough merit that warrants recognition beyond a “clone”.

[h2]Perks[/h2]
[list]
[*] stances add variety to combat
[*] quirky but poorly translated special effects on items
[*] kusarigama, a cool Japanese weapon
[*] RPG stat scaling doesn't appear to restrict or constrain player choice
[*] adequate opportunity for respecs
[/list]

[h2]Warnings[/h2]

All tooltips and hints are labeled for controllers. Prepare for some confusion and guesswork if played exclusively on mouse and keyboard.

[h3]EULA[/h3]

EULA states the game can only be installed on one computer. The user must delete a copy of the game before installing it on a second computer. This does not appear to be enforced by DRM.

[h3]Performance Issues[/h3]

On [b]Proton 8.0-4[/b], the game will intermittently slow down as the frame rate remains stable; this is not related to any bullet-time mechanics. Some cutscenes can not be played and will be replaced with a placeholder graphic. This also applies to any tutorial related videos.

On [b]Proton 6.3-8[/b], there are major performance issues on the 2D overworld map. This will not be apparent until after the second boss of the game (45 minutes or 2 hours of playtime into th game). An error message appears in the place of unplayable video assets.

When you die to a boss in a Souls game, 99% of the time it's your own fault and you work to better yourself and correct those mistakes. In this game, 99% of the time you die, it's because of the games dumb mechanics. Ki recovery, attacks using 80% of stamina bar per swing of a weapon, being stuck in place for 5 seconds when you run out of stamina, being staggered by literally every attack so you get combo'd easily, enemies dropping areas on the floor that outright stop stamina recovery, enemies killing in 1 hit despite putting every level up point into HP and wearing the highest spec armour available for the point you're at in the game. The enemies in the first level (after prologue) take 5 hits to kill with your starting weapon but they kill you in 2. They can also block all your attacks while taking 0 damage and they maintain full stamina while you're losing it swinging at them. The first level feels like the final level. There is no sense of scaling difficulty, everything is hard from the start with an overly complicated combat system with stances and ninjitsu aswell as the modifiers on the weapons. I'm not playing Diablo, I don't wanna see +3.8% defence and +2% fire damage.  

When you die to a boss in a Souls game, you want to learn what went wrong, learn the attacks and beat it. Beating it then gives you a massive sense of accomplishment.
When you die to a boss in this game, you just want to uninstall. There is no desire to get better and when you do beat it, you don't feel accomplished. 

This game is bad and the people that say it isn't, just like to pretend it's good because they're good at it.

I love souls games, I love souls-likes, almost every game I have played in this genre I've had a great time with. I hate this.

This is the game that everyone hypes up and claims to be the closest thing to Fromsoft's quality of game design? 

I hate that my inventory is constantly full of junk. I hate that progress is tied so heavily to levels + loot drops. I hate that they somehow went with a worse version of blood vials as their healing item. I hate that I have to double tap to doge-roll and the regular sidestep gives next to no I-frames. I hate that there is an ""I win"" button where you just become invincible and deal crazy damage, and if you have that before fighting a boss or elite then it's a joke but if you don't have it then it's a slog. I hate that when I put 1 point into the skill my weapon scales with I get +0 damage, implying it does not scale with this stat, but when I put 2 points I get +3... I don't like that there's and incentive to replay old levels with a new objective in order to gain more levels for main missions progress.

I'll start with what I really enjoyed about the game. It always felt like a challenge, and as the tools available to you evolved and changed, thus resulting in combat always feeling fresh. To go along with this, every weapon choice is suitable and everyone will surely find something that suits them. I mainly used the katana as my main weapon, but I was flexible in switching to the spear, odachi and kusarigama to help deal with larger groups. 

My main gripe with the game  design would be the pacing of recommended levels for missions. At the start of the game you'll easily power level to 20+ levels about the recommended level, but by the end of the game even if you do every side mission you'll still be 20 levels below. This is exacerbated in NG+ and the 3 DLCs. I ended up beating the game 40 levels below the recommended level. I recognise that this game is mainly based on your gear quality, but the stats provided by levels is nothing to scoff at. Also, didn't really care for the story. It was pushing 'the last samurai' themes really hard. You're a foreigner that's incredibly strong and can solve all the issues and everyone always comes to you to fix their problems. That's the gist of it.

Overall, I wouldn't have finished the base game + 3 DLC if I didn't resonate with the gameplay combat. Getting into the flow of combat and the rush of beating a boss first try was intoxicating. I'm very excited to play Nioh 2 one day, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Sekiro (and if it goes on sale).

En 2004 comenzó el desarrollo de Ni-oh por parte de Koei inspirado en un guión descartado de Akira Kurosawa, pero acabó siendo cancelado en 2008. Su desarrolló fue reiniciado poco después a manos de Omega Force como una suerte de Dynasty Warriors, pero nuevamente a Shibusawa no le gustó el resultado. 

Fue con Team Ninja en 2010 que Nioh empezó a tomar forma, aunque conservando un estilo demasiado cercano a Ninja Gaiden; y en 2017 finalmente ocurrió, después de entre 12 y 13 años de desarrollo Nioh fue publicado.

Nioh es lo que ocurre cuando le das a Team Ninja la posibilidad de plantear su propio título en base a la fórmula de Dark Souls. Está tan cubierto de capas de mecánicas y dinámicas extrañas que el resultado es fabuloso pero apela a un nicho muy específico.

¿Te gusta Dark Souls? ¿Te gusta el loot por enemigo/zona con características únicas? Además, ¿te gusta una dinámica repartida en misiones principales y secundarias, cada una con sus respectivas subcategorías? A todo eso sumale un sistema de posturas en función a la posición del enemigo y a la defensa del jugador, dos monedas de cambio (Una para la tienda y otra para subir de nivel), un Espíritu Guardian que explota al activar y dota al jugador de un bufo exponencial con su propio kit de habilidades, dos tipos de Jutsus recargables al regresar o reaparecer en un santuario, un sistema de familiaridad con las armas, un árbol de habilidades y un sistema de crafteo.

La simpleza de Dark Souls es parte de su gracia, por tanto la complejidad de Nioh puede acabar asustando a muchos.

No obstante quienes nos tomamos nuestro tiempo en aprender de todo esto e intentar disfrutarlo somos quienes terminamos recompensados con uno de los combates más dinámicos y entretenidos de su subgénero hasta la fecha, puesto que cada mecánica previamente nombrada hace, en conjunto, a un título gratificante.

No obstante y por desgracia comparte muchos pecados con Dark Souls 2. Nioh también es injusto, repleto de emboscadas sin aviso y de enemigos capaces de matarte de un hit sin importar cuánto hayas invertido en vida.

Por suerte la historia nos resulta atrapante a quienes nos gusta Japón, esencialmente la mitología adjunta al Japón feudal.

Enemies are spongy, the loot system is needless and adds nothing more than constantly looking for up arrows on gear, menus upon menus of several dozen mechanics and skills, an overwhelming amount of mechanics in a genre that should just be about learning attack patterns and finding a favorite weapon, death is frequent and instantly dying is usually the cause.

I picked up Nioh again after picking it up for $5 for nothing more than justifying my hatred towards this franchise. I can't explain it, maybe a stroke hit me between playthrough attempts, maybe dementia is hitting me at 30, maybe my bar for soulslikes is has gotten lower, for whatever reason... I ENJOY this game.

Its not a GREAT soulslike, lets get that out of the way. Its needlessly littered with mediocre mechanics that you can flatout ignore. Smithy? No idea what she does. Money? Had a lot and never used it. Magic and tools? I throw a shurikan once in 16 hours. The game wants you to constantly experiment with weapons to unlock new skills and diversify your loadout for encounters, but i stuck with Odachi and solo sword with 0 issues. Once you understand how insanely important your stamina is, and how to manipulate your opponent's, the difficulty lowers a few notches. 

Im still aware of how polarizing this game is. The amount of streamers and tubers i've seen pick it up for 3 hours and never pick it up again is staggering. Its not dark souls, its not even close to dark souls, Nioh is its own thing and i promise you there will be no games that look at Nioh for their inspiration. For what its worth, i don't hate this game anymore. I'm enjoying my time but look forward to seeing the credits roll.

มือคือเกม พยามยามที่จะเป็น Dark Soul ในเวอร์ชันตำนานญี่ปุ่น แต่ออกแบบ Level และการพัฒนาตัวละครได้ไม่ดีเท่า Dark Soul แต่ไม่ใช่ว่ามันไม่ดีนะ มันดีกว่าเกมอื่นๆ  แต่ระดับความยาก  ยากมากสำหรับคนที่ไม่เคยเล่นพววก Soul ซีรีย์  

จุดเด่น
-เกมที่หยิบยืมไอเดีย อย่าง Dark Soul และ  Diablo มาไว้ในเกมเดียวกัน
-ทรีม ญี่ปุ่น เกราะ Set เท่ๆ  อาวุธและอเนเมชันเท่ๆ
-ตัวละครสาว น่ารัก 
-พัฒนาตัวละครได้หลากหลาย  อัพค่าพลัง  อัพสกิล  อัพอาวุธ  สกิลเซท  เวทมนต์  พลังนินจา  อาวุธระยะไกลปืนคาบศิลา-ปืนใหญ่ 
-ความสนุกของเกมนี้  คือความท้าท้ายของเกม   ที่มีความยาก จากมอนเตอร์  บอส และข้อจำกัดของ map    
-ระบบ co-op  pvp  pve  
-ระบบ newgame +


จุดด้อย
-การออกแบบให้ผู้เล่นค่อยๆ ไต้ระดับความยากของเกมทำได้ไม่ดี   ออกแบบโดยไม่แคร์ผู้เล่นใหม่  หรือ คนเล่นไม่เก่ง เลย  แต่ค่ายนี้ก็เป็นแบบนี้เกือบทุกเกม  ตั้งแต่ ninja gaiden  
-ความยากของกม  อาจเป็นทั้งข้อดีและข้อเสีย
-การที่มีระบบพัฒนาตัวละคร หลากหลาย อาวุธ หลายสกิล  หลาย build  และปล่อยให้ผู้เล่นเลือกได้ตั้งแต่ต้นเกม  อาจทำให้เกิดการอัพผิด  แต่การสามารถรีเซทได้  แต่ต้องผ่านเนื้อเรื่องไปหน่อยหนึงก่อน
-มุมกล้องบางมุม  อาจมีปัญหาบ้าง  ถ้าเจอ บอส หรือ มอนเคลื่อนที่ไวๆ
-เหมือน Soul ซีรีย์  คือถีบผู้เล่นเข้าไปในเกม  สอนนิดหน่อย  แล้วพวกเมิงไปหาวิธีเอาตัวรอดเองละกัน

Team Ninja has shown they can make games at a level of quality that is as close to FromSoftware games without being from From. I previously platinumed Nioh 1 & 2 on PS4 and loved them so much I bought them again here. 

Combat is similar to Souls but the focus is more about position than dodging attacks. It's fast pace, difficult but rewarding, and with flashy effects. Gear is similar to Diablo in that they are random drops. The shear amount can be overwhelming and takes time to sort through but over time you'll learn what to look for making that a little easier. You can min-max as much as you want. There are extensive skill trees for every weapon and style. I was initially put off by the level of complexity but after ~5 hours you'll have a good grasp of the mechanics.

Graphics, art design, music, and environment are all superb. Level design is akin to Souls but not as complex and interconnected. World is hub based. The art style is what drew me to Nioh but it was the gameplay that kept me play. Combat is fast paced, precise, and very satisfying. Difficulty is moderate on New Game but the skill cap is extremely high once you unlock Way of the Demon and Way of the Wise on NG+++. Replayability and customization make the value well worth the ~$100 for both games plus all DLC.

Absolutely a 10/10 for me. I highly recommend Nioh 1 & 2 for anyone who likes Souls. Looking forward to Rise of the Ronin from Team Ninja in 2024!",1705167329,1705167329,True,1,0,0.51188814640045166,0,True,False,False

Team Ninja and KOEI have done a fantastic job of portraying all of our favorite historical figures (plus some others that aren't so often portrayed) in a historical fantasy setting that is constantly blurring the line between historical fact, widely accepted folklore, and modern fabrication.

[h1] TL;DR – Koei Tecmo’s excellent take on the souls-like genre set in feudal Japan with gruesome monsters and men alike. A challenge even for veterans of the original Souls series but, an absolutely welcomed one. [/h1]

Story (3/5) – In Nioh, you play as William, a British privateer, who finds himself in feudal Japan battling mean samurais and even meaner yokai (monsters). Along the way, you come across various historical characters from Japan’s warring period of which Team Ninja has tried their best to weave into the existing conflict. Nioh’s strongest points in the story are its moment-to-moment interactions you have with certain historical shoguns. Otherwise, the story on a whole is not much to write about.

Gameplay (5/5) – Players have access to 7 types of melee weapons (of which 2 were added in the Complete Edition) and 3 ranged weapons. Each melee weapon has 3 stances each with its own skill tree. These can be further augmented by magical, Onmyo, or ranged, Ninja, skills. Combat is tough and unforgiving but wholly rewarding and challenging. Multiplayer functions included PvP and cooperative play with a particular stand out being the ability to play the entire campaign in co-op. 

Controls (5/5) – Played on an Xbox controller, the controls in Nioh feel precise and weighted. Players have the option of picking from several pre-determined button layouts or customize each key binding individually. For a game that lives and dies on split second controls in combat, Nioh’s certainly did not disappoint. 

Graphics (4/5) – Nioh was originally designed for the PlayStation 3 with a long and arduous development dating back to 2004 and this shows in some of the game’s background assets which are painfully low resolution. Nevertheless, the graphics and artwork of Nioh remains to be one of my favourite aspects of this game. Nioh’s feudal Japan has been meticulously re-created even including various iconic shrines, battlefield, and locales in Japan. Character animations and details are top notch down to the fine details of William’s armour and weapons. 

Audio (3/5) – Keeping with the feudal Japan setting, the ambient music is suitably themed while being unobstructive during key combat moments. Positional audio is passable. While audio cues are crisp and clear – a very important component of souls-like games. 

Issues/Optimization – Nioh’s PC release is well optimized with high quality assets, quick loading times and seamless multiplayer functionality. I did however run into an odd surround sound bug necessitating me to play with headphones on for the entire game.

Also worth noting, the PC version of Nioh: Complete Edition does not receive the next generation updates seen on the PlayStation 5. Supports for 120 fps is not available on the PC version.

Overall (4/5) – Koei Tecmo has managed to do something extremely difficult and that is to make a souls-like game that is wholly unique and distinctive from the original Souls series and yet, still play so well. Much of this can be traced back to Team Ninja’s roots with the Ninja Gaiden series but, Nioh is very much its own game. 

Just like the original Demon/Dark Souls, Nioh is a timeless gem that comes highly recommended.

Overall this is a ""souls-like"" in the general sense of the term, meaning 2-3 hits from most enemies will kill you and you just have to ""git gud"" in order to win. That is all on the surface though. Once you start to scratch Nioh and dig deeper, you are greeted with a convoluted mess of mechanics that are simultaneously interesting and frustrating. The first thought that I had when I played this game was ""too much"". Too many mechanics to keep track of and many are required to be utilized for your experience to not be insanely frustrating. Some mechanics as follows...

- Hitting critical points on enemies
- Utilization of magic buffs on yourself/ enemies
- Yokai realms and purification / Ki buff 
- 3 different stances in which to swing melee weapons that all have different move sets that can be individually programmed
- Ninja skills that will F!# you up or can be used to cheese
- You have an ""ultimate spirit attack"" gauge that you can swap in different spirits for different effects.
- Looting mechanics for your armor and weapons where you randomly get good gear.
- Blacksmith which can not only improve gear but can also help re-roll your gear stats. (this becomes a big deal NG+)
- And on
- and on
- and on 

Too many mechanics. 

If everything is complicated, it just gets annoying for regular people. Only autists/masochists can enjoy it at that point, which seems to be the games' devoted fan base. 

I'm not saying you cannot enjoy this game. However, I am saying that most people will find it tedious. The lame story or lack of story doesn't help much. I started asking myself ""Do they assume Japanese people are stupid?"" / ""Everyone who is offered Amrita just takes them up on it and all the retainers follow 'FOR HONOR/MY LORD?'"" I got tired of hearing ""I'll do anything for my lord/ people"" pretty quick. I'm not Japanese, but as a Westerner it would be a tall order to convince half the population to sacrifice their morals/ body to the Devil even now, let alone hundreds of years ago. 

You could probably enjoy 1 play through as a souls-like enjoyer who really wanted to see some Japanese aesthetics. 

Edit: I almost forgot why I wrote this review in the first place. The ""lock-on"" is abysmal! Not a problem if you are taking on one enemy at a time, but 2+? You are boned if you can't take one out quickly. I could never figure out what the actual F the ""lock on"" was trying to do, but it apparently will lock on to whatever enemy is closest. Which can really mess up your strategy of killing 1 enemy before the other, or perhaps prioritizing the most dangerous enemy in a group of enemies. Also your attack animation will not continue in a linear progression, but will contort to the locked on enemy. Usually not an issue (even helpful at times), but can really wreck your tactic of ""crowd control"" if instead of hitting 3-4 guys, you immediately lock on and only hit the one which then opens your back up to the three recovered enemies. 
 
For comparison, I would recommend Dark Souls(1-3), Elden Ring, Diablo 2 & 3, and even The Surge (1) BEFORE i would recommend trying this game.",1703300811,1704083092,False,1,1,0.445246309041976929,0,True,False,False

I want to enjoy it.. But I just spent several hours and two different characters trying to get past the first boss... Im not new to the genre.. this is a bit ridiculous.. If I cant even get beyond Boss 1, Im certainly not going to enjoy the goddamn game!

The Bosses are TERRIBLE!  Split second tells, if any at all, and theres no way to tell some combos apart.. Take boss 2 for example. She has kick combos that look similar, and no way to tell how manyconsecutive kicks she will do.. Its ridiculous!

And there are ABSOLUTELY parts of the game that are ""unfair""..  the Bridge of Bone mission comes right to mind! Throw multiple enemies at the player, large Monks, several flying heads that shoot magic, and ranged attackers simultaneously!  This is NOT good design, or difficulty.. This is cheap, artificial difficulty!

The damage enemies do,is absolutely ridiculous.. Im only on NG, and keeping my gear up to level. This time, light armor build, and I expect o take more damage.. But dyign in two swipes is just not fun. Currently on the mission where you face Nue for a 2nd time, and even a dumb fox can combo you into game over. 

it also suffers from the same piss poor community anything resembling Souls suffers.. Any critizism is immediately met with your typical fanboy-fare. Instead of answerign a question, or havign a conversation, the very helpful ""git gud"" childishness, or blatant hostility are often the responses given. It gives these games a terrible rep, leaving only the hardcore to stick around.. 

It does a poor job relaying information to the player.. The story, how you got anywhere, or even stats.. Just ""Here ya go.. Good luck""!(I found these answers in player guides through Steam)

The weapons, and armors look AMAZING! Some weapons you dont get in most games. Very nice movesets, and with three stances, no stale animations.. This is where the game truly shines!

I discovered (after a dozen hours) that there is a skill tree, and magic skill tree.. Im hoping they were waiting until after this area to show you this?  I was pretty annoyed when I found I had something like 20 Ninja points to spend, and 10 on Titles...(turns out it IS shown to the player later, in the dojo)

There is also alot of... well, 'crap'... Dozens, and dozens of little consumable, or one time use  'items' that have very specific uses. They also take the same slots as Ninjitsu skills, and Onmyo magic.. Just weapons buffs alone can fill up all of those. (there are 2 more if you upgrade via Blacksmith for a toal of 16)

It looks beautiful, and runs well. I was told low shadows could be bugged, so on medium shadows, Im getting a pretty solid, and stable 60fps.. Even running an old 660Ti.. The ONLY time I have any significant framerate issues, are in areas with fog effects. I have every other setting turned up, and boxes ticked on, in 1920x1080 Id say the worst of times, Im in the mid 40's fps.

While I enjoy the mythodical combat, I do not like the movement.. It feels weightless, like Ninja Gaiden, or Devil May Cry or something(yes, I know who made it).. I expected it to feel weighted, as it borrows so heavily from Souls.. Even the tiered weight limits.. All your attacks sound like youre cutting into a fat wet fish, unfortunately.. Blood stays on weapons and armor, which is nice touch! I did get annoyed when enemies are able to ignore my combo, and strike back while im bitchslapping the piss out of them.. But that rule does not work in reverse! Buut, it works well as a game, and fits the universe.. Its just different than I had expected.

Im just finding the lack of direction in story, and difficulty to be too steep, which is the only reason I cannot recommend.. a full day(13hrs total, 10 of which were spent on the boss) on the very first boss, and no progress is pretty ridiculous.. Ive beaten DeS, DkS1 & 2, the Surge, and Lords of the Fallen, each multiple times, but cant beat boss 1 here?(not counting Tower of London. thats more a tutorial)

there is also a staggering amount of misinterpreted, or misleading text/descriptions within the game.. For example.. ""Saboteur"" skill in the Ninjitsu tree says that it increases carrying capacity of bombs. It even has the bombs as a prerequesit to unlock this skill.. But.. It does NOT add to the bombs of the same name within the skill tree, ONLY for the consumable bombs found.. Its not only misleading, but completely asinine! You will find many similar misleading texts in stat bonuses for gears. Its overwhelming at first, but majority of it is garbage, or SO specific, that its silly to use certain stats(even if its the items/skills/weapons youre using)

As far as optimization, Im still running an old 660Ti, and have only turned shadows down to medium (I read somewhere low may have been bugged) with only one of the three boxes ticked to off, and have been at a stable, steady 60fps.. Resolution 1080x1920, and everything else set to high.. I have been floored by how well its run.. the very first boot up, I was staying low in the 50's, even dipping lower.. But every boot up since, has been steady,so i raised the settings, and viola!  Runs like a dream!

The maps are gorgeous, but recylced FAR too often.. Even when going to an entirely new region, you will see reused maps from completely different parts o fthe continent.. Makes no sense!

Id like to add, that the Exclusive Blacksmithing texts locked to region or Demo, or Pre Order bonuses, are a real D**k move on the part of Team Ninja...

***Update***
After some time with the game, and further familiarizing myself with its mechanics, Ive come to enjoy it.. I absolutely love this game! But damn, was that learning curve harsh!  Im not gonna retype everything, as they were honest opinions as they were typed. Its extremely overwhelming with all the information, stats, combos, and stances, thrown at you almost all at once.. Then Onmyo (Magic), Ninjitzu, & Samurai skills.. Very in depth!  I cant follow the story to save my life though. The people all sound to similar to me. I hear that if youre familiar with Japanese history, youre likely to recognize many of the characters, and parts of story.. Alas, I am not.

It still has 'some' EXTREMELY unfair mechanics.. Specifically with larger enemies.  Im using the heaviest weapons in the game, and nothing staggers then, unless they run out of Ki. they WILL attack you no mater how hard you hit them, which means youre often swapping blows.. Ironically, their attacks can, and WILL stagger you, and stop your combo.. I HATE this mechanic in games.. Its cheap, and ruins the experience!  Theres also alot of tiny rooms with large enemies whos attacks not only takemore than half your hp, but also have such a large arc, they can cover much of said room.. Later in the game, they begin stacking these enemies on you, coupled with ranged attackers, and several tiny annoyance (example To Giant Monk Ogre guys, with 2 Ninjas, Some flying heads that shoot elements, and an archer in the backround.. This becomes common).. I love the game, but Ill not pretend there isnt a metric ton of cheap  crap, relying on artificial difficulty..",1529202474,1703534458,False,0,0,0.479265213012695313,14,True,False,False

It's a positive for me and people that really like banging their head against a wall and figuring out how to beat a unfair game on it's own terms, by being unfair right back.

Here even the most basic enemy can easily take your entire health bar for most of the game's content, and it doesn't really get better through the entirety of new game at least. While i enjoyed my time till here, i'd be lying if i said it wasn't due to just having high anger tolerance.

One of the earlier examples is the succubus boss that has the paralysis debuff. Paralysis in this game isn't something you can play around if you actually get hit by it, you will basically be completely immobile and unable to dodge whatever that particular boss throws next, which in almost all cases will be something capable of one-shotting you.

At that point of the game the only counter you'd have is if you looked through everything and found that the onmyo tree gives you a talisman buff to resist paralysis. otherwise you're shit out of luck and you're about to get your ass served anytime you slip for a second. Reminds me of how the mikiri counter in Sekiro is somehow optional and not something everyone has built in, even though is by far one of the most useful moves in the game.

Nioh does give you a lot of options to deal with bullshit that will in many cases turn many boss fights into cakewalks, and some like divination talisman feel absolutely necessary for exploring the map, as they will give you the location of all kodamas, enemies and treasures on your radar. 

It's a very interesting game for very patient people, that are willing to forgive unfair design as long as they are given options to strategize, at the start it will feel absolutely overwhelming, jesus christ i'm still traumatized by how many things just straight up one shot me in this game while i figured out onmyo magic and ninjutsu, and then how many things one shot me after.

so this review is more a warning than anything else, its good but it's bullshit, but it's kind of a addicting kind of bullshit cause the combat systems feel so satisfying to play around.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Samurais vs Yokai are some of the coolest ideas out there but i just CANNOT DEAL with this combat system. its so clunky and the control schemes were designed by a person who i'm certain has never actually played a video game before. Even if you change the controls none of the text changes for the variety of moves you'll do.

The game just feels like it lacks polish on all the parts that matter. Namely the combat and interfaces.

Then theres the difficulty curve...which never straightens out it just stays as a curve i imagine, Ive played plenty of Fromsoft and love Sekiro so i'm no stranger to a difficulty curve but many of those games give you the proper tools to navigate those dangers. Nioh i'm sure has them but they are discount, second hand thrift shop tools that just don't do the job.
lastly theres the Yokai should be a big focus of course but they've got several special mechanics focused almost entirely just around them, things like banishing their aura (which is needlessly jank) and how every Oni i've encountered does 90% damage in the first hit of their 3 hit combo (oh and course THEY don't flinch from damage)

The combat system, with its deep stance and skill options, provides a good level of challenge and requires strategic thinking, which keeps the battles engaging.

However, the game does have its drawbacks. One notable issue is its tendency towards repetition. As you progress, the game often recycles enemies and level designs, which can make the experience feel somewhat monotonous after a while. This repetition might detract from the excitement for players seeking continuous variety in their gameplay.

Overall, while ""Nioh"" has its strong points, particularly in story and combat mechanics, its tendency to become repetitive over time means that it might not appeal to everyone.

(or if you are in my case, both)

If you are coming from Nioh 2, read the following paragraph, otherwise skip to the next one.
A small spoiler for Nioh 2, proceed reading only if you already played it:
Now, for those who are coming from 2, and are now mentally prepared to play this shit to see wtf happened with William and why do you fight him in the second game in a certain mission, and what does that have to do with the story of Nioh 2:
Nioh 2's timeline starts before Nioh 1, and Nioh 1 comes in place in the middle with William's story, and the franchise ends with Nioh's 2 final battle (you know who i am talking about).

If you happen to be like me, and bought this game back in the day, you are probably regret buying it since it was given for free on epic games store, yes the game was so F tier it was given way for free, a shame even for Nioh 1 if you ask me. Despite all the hate i have given to it so far, and despite being a literal downgrade compare to the second game,  it is still, enjoyable, because it's still a nioh game, despite being a complete fucking mess, i will say at least for only a New game run, the main story only pretty much, if your guts can handle it, it's an enjoyable experience, nonetheless. (it should be noted that both games are rough at the beginning so give yourself some time and try staying calm, this game is way more ""punishing"" and frustrating than any of your typical dark souls or other jprgs you probably played)
I would give this game a neutral review instead of a negative one if i could, since this game should literally have no reason to exist despite being fun and enjoyable at times. Why did you gave it a negative review then may ask? It's because Koi Temco perfected nioh 2 instead of fixing their first game, they moved over from their first game because it was probably holding them back and as a typical company, they never cared to patch it up, many of the assets of this game (and even entire levels) are being re used in nioh 2. Its your typical fromsoftware style of recycling™, however in this situation, its the first game that get hurt, not the second one, remember how many people hated dark souls 2 for many reasons? well its kinda the same situation here, nioh 1 being a ""dark souls 2"" game, but only in a bad way.

Now my favorite part, the controls:
Something very, very important that i should mention, this game doesn't support keyboard and mouse overlay (which buttons do what, shown on your screen), unlike the second game, so if you are not playing on a controller, good luck opening the key binds settings window, many, many times. (they keybinds that ship by default in my opinion are horrible i would say unplayable, i am only putting this in parenthesis because i wasn't masochist enough to try beating the game a second time from the beginning to the end with the default keybindings profile)
One more thing about Nioh 1 that has to do with the controls of K and M:
It doesn't support mouse button 4 and 5 (the side buttons of your mouse) as well as a few other buttons i can't recall, which for some people, almost myself included, almost, could be a real downer to play the game.

This game itself is a challenge in many ways, should buy it? can you even play it on a keyboard and mouse properly?  the question to whether you should play it or not varies from one person to another, i will contradict myself and say that you can completely ignore everything i said in this review and go for it if you are ""that"" person, but that wouldn't be very informative and honest, let's be real, picking your next JRPG will always be a challenge itself, if you value your time, and money.",1622663047,1701633808,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is loosely based on the story of William Adams, a 17th-century sailor who arrived in Japan and earned the favor of the Tokugawa Shogun. The game is filled with iconic Japanese monsters, authentic equipment, and richly interwoven environments.

The game’s combat system is rich and technical, offering a terrific, Asian-influenced visual style and setting. It includes all of the console DLC, providing dozens of hours of action to master. However, the complex combat systems can be overwhelming for new players. The game also features randomized loot, which can make weapon progression tedious.

Despite these challenges, “Nioh: Complete Edition” won’t disappoint gamers hungry for a rich and immersive action game. It has been praised for its hard-hitting action, sophisticated and engaging combat systems, punishing difficulty level, and flexible character progression. 

However, some players may find the bosses too brutal and the story not the strongest or most coherent.

Overall, “Nioh: Complete Edition” is a package brimming with content, challenging gameplay, deep combat mechanics, and a fun crafting system. It does not stick to its peers’ blueprint, but it endeavors to evolve into a different beast, and for the most part, succeeds. It’s a balanced game between action and RPG, but it has an irregular level design. Despite some minor issues, it’s a great game that offers a frighteningly fair challenge.",1701009449,1701009449,True,3,0,0.539394974708557129,0,True,False,False

However, what initially seemed like an engaging adventure quickly devolves into an exercise in frustration, thanks to a poorly balanced difficulty system that leaves players feeling more powerless than empowered.

The most glaring issue with Nioh is the constant threat of being one-shotted by almost every enemy, turning what should be a challenging experience into a maddening exercise in trial and error. While difficulty is expected in a game of this genre, the lack of a gradual learning curve makes it feel like the developers intended to punish players at every turn. The random difficulty spikes only exacerbate this problem, as encounters that should be manageable suddenly become insurmountable without warning.

The player power progression is a major disappointment. Despite investing time and effort into improving your character, the game's expectations seem to skyrocket, leaving you feeling underpowered and ill-equipped for the challenges ahead. It's disheartening to see your efforts go unrewarded as you struggle to keep up with the game's increasing demands.

One of the most frustrating aspects is the apparent encouragement to grind for weapons and levels. Instead of a rewarding and skill-based progression system, Nioh often feels like it pushes players into a monotonous cycle of farming for resources just to survive the next encounter. This repetitive gameplay loop takes away from the enjoyment of the experience, making it feel more like a chore than an immersive journey.

While the game's initial stages hold promise and intrigue, the more you delve into Nioh, the more apparent its flaws become. What begins as an interesting adventure turns into a tiresome grind, with the unbalanced difficulty overshadowing any enjoyment that could be derived from the game. The frustration of constantly facing overwhelming odds and the feeling of being pushed to farm for progress ultimately make Nioh a disappointing experience for those seeking a challenging but fair gameplay.",1700973144,1700973144,False,5,2,0.494702845811843872,4,True,False,False

You're never forced to farm or grind for anything, i reached NG++++ without ever having to farm or play the same level even twice, so i don't know what these people are complaining about nor do i understand complaints about enemies being too tanky, that means you don't know what their weaknesses are. try to utilize different elements for chaos debuff, aim for the weak spots etc. skill system gives you freedom for anything you want to try, weapons and gear are done in a way which allows you to experiment as much as you want. weapon variety is huge and each one has 3 different types of stances with their own separate skills that you can use to enjoy combat and find your personal playstyle, whether its playing patiently and waiting for a proper time to parry or to barrage enemies with powerful attacks. more skilled you are more satisfying Nioh becomes, so get good and have fun.",1700512719,1700512803,True,8,2,0.608219146728515625,0,True,False,False

O jogo é bom, mas tem muitas coisas que acabam tirando toda a graça.

Tem lugares que foram feitos pra você morrer, de propósito.

Tem inimigos que ficam estrategicamente só te esperando para te matar, não se trata de habilidade, mas sim de dar sorte de conseguir se desviar.

Os mapas são muito repetitivos, mudando apenas o que fazer dentro deles e com algumas áreas fechadas.

Esse é o tipo de jogo que te exige fazer uma ""faculdade"" pra aprender tudo que ele tem a oferecer, este excesso às vezes é chato.

That's important, so I'll say it before anything else, otherwise you may come and expect a ""Dark Souls"" like experience and not be happy. Yes it's difficult, yes it has a stamina bar and yes it has ""bonfires"" and ""Souls"" (Amrita) you lose when you die, but other than that it's a Hack 'n' Slash, complete even with stylish combos and unlockable abilities to extend your combos or increment them.

The game functions on a mission system. You have an overworld map, in which you can access missions and shops. You select a mission, you enter the level and have an objective. Usually this objective is to just get to the boss or destroy specific things.

The levels are fairly open and exploring them is nice. Their level design also mirrors that of the ""Souls"" series, with shortcuts to earlier parts of the level and the like. When you finish the mission, everything in the level dies, you become immortal and sometimes you can still run around to collect anything you might've missed, but most of the time you get locked in the room and your only option it to get back to the overworld map. No open world here. You can still repeat missions as much as you want though, in fact you're even encouraged to. When you re-enter the mission it's back to square one, though, as in you have to re-unlock the shortcuts and even mini-bosses revive. It's as if you've never played that mission before.

Combat: Do [b]NOT[/b] treat this as a Dark Souls equivalent, it's not. Don't let that stamina (Ki) bar fool you. Unlike Dark Souls (and Souls-likes), the stamina bar is there to prevent you from spamming moves forever (like defending forever), not for you to manage it, it's a very different approach. Even the controls are very different, more akin to an actual Hack 'n' Slash game. For instance the fast attack is mapped to the X (Square) Button, the strong attack is mapped to the Y(Triangle) button and so on.

Your character has three stances: High, Medium and Low. High for puting extra strengh in your attacks, favors your attack at the expense of your dodge and speed; Medium for... everything medium lol; and Low for quick attacks and putting emphasis on your dodge. You'll be switching between them all the time depending on the situation. You also have a way of regenerating your Ki faster if you time your RB (R1) right. That's to say that even though you have that stamina bar, the game is way more focused on being a fast paced hack 'n' slash then a metodical Souls game like DS1. You (almost) never stop attacking and dodging. Of course your Ki might run out, but only either after a long time or after you mess up too many Ki recoveries with the R1. I mostly ran out of Ki in very specific situations, like when I was dealing with too many enemies or had to dodge/block like 7 attacks at once. Other than that maybe once or twice during a particularly fast boss but that was it.

Art direction: Great, absolutely love it. They did a great job representing the Yokai in the game. The game in general looks beautiful.

It has an actual story, unlike souls-likes, and it's good. There's not really much to say about it without getting into spoilers, though. It's not groundbreaking or unexpected, we've seen this type of story in basically any game that deals with the Sengoku Period of Japan... and it could've used a little better pacing at some points, but overall it's still good. None of the speculative lore some of you Souls fans might be after. This game has a very defined story, with cutscenes and a linear progression in time. The loading screens also offer extra trivia and bits of the story.

Complaints:

The game gives you equipment left and right and they all have like 5 different rarity types, so managing the inventory sometimes takes like 10-15 minutes of scrolling through itens and comparing stats/bonuses to decide which ones to sell, which ones to keep, which ones to scrap for materials, etc. If any of you ever played Darksiders 2, you know the issue here. It's not the same, but pretty similar. It's not game breaking by any means, but you should be aware.

Remember the bloodstains in Dark Souls? You could touch them to see how the other player died and avoid traps or hidden enemies, right? Well, when you die here you leave a Bloody Grave. The difference is that you can instead see a description of how the player died. And also, when you touch them to summon the avatar of the player that died there (called a Revenant), controlled by the game's AI and fight it for a chance to drop the equipment they were wearing at that time and to earn Glory, which is used as currency for multiplayer. 
""Dude, that sounds really cool, why the hell is it in the complaints section?"" because it's the primary way to get equipment. When the servers die or when people enough stop playing this game, getting equipment will be grinding hell. I like the revenant system, it's cool, but the way it is implemented this is something to think about. It's not an immediate problem, but it will be in the future. Time will not be too kind with this game.

There are some Revenants placed by the devs themselves, also. They mostly serve as a way to give you a tidbit of insight to other character's fates and hints about how to get past a Nurikabe, this game's version of the False Walls. An Yokai that's basically a wall with eyes that gets in your way and you can communicate with them through gestures. If you use the right type of gesture (there are friendly, neutral and threatening gestures) they greet you and get out on their own. If you use the wrong type of gesture or attack them they attack you back.

Overall, if you're just looking for a challenging game this one is great. Some of the post game missions are absolutely brutal, but awesome to play. If you're looking for something that ressembles more Dark Souls though... Well, there are other games out there.",1631866695,1698650274,True,24,0,0.751646578311920166,0,True,False,False

Coming from Dark Souls, I wanted to have a break from it, so I decided to give Nioh a try. At the beginning it needed a bit getting used to, as the fighting is similar in a way, but still different enough, but in a good way. Its much faster, then DS which requires you to play more agressively, but you still need to be more strategic as well.
The levels are quite small, but the bosses are really interesting and quite different so far. The levels itself are kind of  small but labyrinthian. However, the placements of the shrines are very fair,and if you explore the map, then you can always find shortcuts, so you don't have a complicated runback to the boss area.
The structure of the game itself is quite traditional I would say, so you have a large map, with all the levelsand you choose where you go to. Once you selected a mission, you are locked into it, until you either defeat the boss or use an item to quit it. No travelling back and forth. It's not an open world game.
I also needed some getting used to the amount of stuff you get dropped, as you get tons of it. Basically any enemy will always drop something, and you have to sort through it, looking if there is something better available. As there is an (generous) inventory limit, you have to get rid of it eventually. The good thing is that you can trade the items for gold (only between missions and not quite so important) or for Amrit directly in the mission. So if you have enough stuff to offer, you can level up just by converting the uneeded items. Between missions you can also use them items to craft upgraded weapons and armor of your favourite stuff or dismantler them for materials. So all the items you find, are not just cluttering your inventory, but can be very usefull even if you dont need them on it's own.

The QoL alone is amazing; not only can you see damage numbers so you know if your attacks are effective or not, they're split by damage type, making it infinitely easier to determine an enemy's elemental weakness. But there's so much more that is so well-designed.

And where Dark Souls always has piles of completely useless consumables and items, everything in Nioh is useful. Buffs and debuffs are extremely useful, unlike in Dark Souls. Defensive buffs cut damage in half, status effect resistances actually protect you from those status effects, etc. All magic is actually usable in combat since the animations are shorter. You can dabble in multiple weapons or magics without completely screwing yourself over (and very early on you can get access to items that let you respec, if you want to switch). Some magic takes the form of consumables that regenerate every time you die or use a shrine (the bonfire equivalent), which in and of itself makes them infinitely more useful. Every successfully blocked attack deals 0 damage to you; you only take damage if the attack was unblockable in the first place.

The game is hard, but it feels so much more fair because it doesn't hide things from you. Deaths feel like they were your fault, and you learn from them. The effects of level-ups are clearly shown, everything has a useful tooltip. Even when you die, you get back into the game so much faster than in Dark Souls. And the levels are designed so that the run-back to a boss from the nearest shrine is either easy or free, so you don't need to learn speedrun strats just to reach a boss. (None of the Sir Alonne gauntlet corridor nonsense)

The bosses themselves are extremely brutal and even in heavy armor can take out huge chunks of your health each swing, but it's not too hard to learn their tells and formulate a strategy against them, especially since you have more options from useful buffs and debuffs. Struggling against a boss feels fun, rather than frustrating, because you can make much better progress and actually properly strategize.

It's going to be really hard for me to play a FromSoft game after this. I'm not looking forward to returning to useless consumables, terrible and clunky magic, entire spells and weapons that are worthless, and completely opaque mechanics.

The play time listed at the time of this review is roughly how long a single play through took. 
Here are some thoughts:

Graphics:
Personally, I found the graphics to be very visually pleasing. I played at 1440p with an rx6700xt, and did not experience any graphical errors or glitches. If I did, it was so unnoticeable that it could go without mention; aside from a certain level with rain, where I had stuttering here and there, but that wasn't a problem in itself.
Overall, I'd rate the graphics as better than good, slightly below beautiful.

Gameplay:
This part of the review is the part I thought I'd have the biggest field day with. The gameplay of Nioh could potentially be compared to a couple of different FromSoftware games. Without giving spoilers, a lot of concepts resonate with those games. However, this game stands out greatly. The combat is very vast and diverse, even having certain parts of combat I myself wouldn't have known about if I didn't have a friend watching most of my playthrough (this gentleman essentially showed me how to become one with the Nioh). Instead of being an open world game, there are dozens of missions you can do, main or side. There are things to collect for the completionists. There are certain times throughout the game where the gameplay does start to get a little stale, but if that's ever the case, you can entirely switch how you play and try somehting new (albeit a challenge).

Audio:
The audio in this game is almost as vast as the combat system. The music is beautiful, despite some boss songs being reused multiple times. The ambient level music was nice too. On calmer levels, you would have a more peaceful, stoic sort of song with traditional flutes and the likes. On more intense levels, you would hear a faster paced passionately played string ensemble. Weapon sounds are very nice in my opinion as well. I found certain enemy death noises to be comical, but aside from that I believe the audio was very well done.

Difficulty: 
I know you don't want to hear it, but this game is only as difficult as you make it. 
I compare a lot of my first 30 hours in Nioh to ""Einstein's Insanity"", which is the act of doing the same exact thing over and over and expecting a different result. I can use the first actual boss as an example, without giving spoilers. I would keep trying things that clearly weren't working, and then I'd get frustrated because of that. Now, obviously that was a personal problem I needed to address, and upon changing just one thing about my approach to that fight, I was able to overcome the boss within two more attempts. There are certain missions/scenarios that outright feel unfair, and I'll be honest, some of them are. But on the other side of that coin, there are more than enough resources within the game to counter anything and everything thrown at you.

Story:
The story had me hooked almost instantly. Again, without giving too many/any spoilers, the story of Nioh is based around real historical events with real historical figures, just with an otherworldly twist to it. This game will have you travel around Japan around the Sengoku period. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the story the whole way through, it does feel as though one would need prior knowledge in this era of history in order to understand it, as a lot is left to the imagination.

Game Time:
The play time I had at the time of this review is roughly how long it took my to complete my first playthough, including the DLC. I'm sure the main story could be completed in around 50 hours, but that's if everything clicks for you and you breeze through. Even then, the average game time for Nioh is completely dependent on the individual playing at the time.

Price:
I would say that the $50 price tag is very reasonable, considering some games come out broken for $70 these days. Even then, Nioh, as well as Nioh 2, regularly go on sale within steam. If one doesn't want to pay the full $50 for the game, it wouldn't be unreasonable to wait around for the next time it goes on sale. 

Bugs:
Fortunately for me, I only experienced literally one bug. It had to do with my controller becoming disconnected, which then disconnected my audio. I doubt that has to do with Nioh, as it's happened in other games. Still felt worth mentioning.

Overall: 
After 120 hours of hacking and slashing, blocking and dodging, dying and saying ""what in the ever-loving, Samuel L. Fuck is this game doing to me?"" I have come to the conclusion that I love this game. It surely isn't for everyone, but I will at least recommend it for people to try. 
This game can also be used as a sort of character development outside of the game. This game sure is frustrating, and it genuinely isn't for the faint of heart, not because it's scary, but because it's intense. I used this game as a way to try to get over a personal issue of getting mad at things unjustly. This could just be me, but the opportunity is there.
My overall score for this game would have to be a 7.5/10. Despite the trials and tribulations this game put me through, nothing beat the feeling of finally slaying [spoiler]the nine tailed fox[/spoiler]

Nioh is a pretty good soulslike game with it's own spin, which makes it a fresh experience in this genre. It needs a bit of time at the beginning to pick up (there's a few abbilities that I consider a must have before the game picks up pace, but you can unlock all or almost all while doing first main mission after prologue), but after it does, it becomes one of the better soulslikes when it comes to gameplay loop. 
Story is okay, nothing special, but not bad also. Soundtrack is good. Graphics are a bit outdated, but still hold up. Gameplay loop is fun as hell. 
Oh, it's also difficult, I would even risk saying that it's harder than any of the Dark Souls games. A bit unbalanced in higher difficulties, but it goes BOTH ways, which means - even tho enemies can 1-2 shot you, you also can deal massive amounts of damage.

However, it doesn't feel responsive enough.
Maybe i'm not good at it enough but it seems like you can't switch mid-combo.
The experience system is greatly woven in the story.
Graphically, it's good. There are several resolution, presets (cinematic, best perf, best graphics, 30 or 60 fps but it's capped...
The story starts slow for a while but when it picks up boy-oh-boy it's awesome. Due to the setting it takes place in, it might be confusing for some.
The DLCs are short but really good and add a lot in terms of story. Some new stuff in the DLC does count for trophies.

However, even though it was originally release on PS4 it has forced box prompts (even using k&m).
That's a huge let down. This game can be demanding at times so if you're not used to those, it's down to muscle memory. So the learning curve is needlessly amped up. It's not optimized for k&m as you can guess if you have two brain cells or more. It makes PvP even more of a problem given it's already broken but not mandatory.
Were it not for that i'd give it a 8/10.
Due to this problem added to the steam version, i'll give it a 6/10.

Well, to start off, the mechanics and combat system surrounding this game are beyond impressive. You got three different stances, all of which gave your weapon of choice a unique moveset that really spiced up the combat, which I really, really love. Then there are the ninja and omnyo magic skills that give you more ways to approach a fight. And finally, the Diablo-esque loot system, which is just heavenly for me, but I can see why people might hate it, and also the many ways to customize and create your own build.

All of these mechanics just come together and are even more pronounced after you reach NG+ (Way of the Strong) and are great until you reach NG++ (Way of the Demon) and NG+++ (Way of the Wise). During NG++, regular enemies and bosses start to get buffs applied to them and also get one more move, which is fine in NG++, but after that, enemies can one-shot you, most especially the bosses and the atrocious living weapon gangbang of DLC bosses. Gear is the name of the game, and if your gear isn't optimized and is up-to-level, then you will lose every time, except if you are a god dodger.

But the nice thing in this game is that you can cheese enemies by using different tactics (e.g., sniping them, sneaking behind them, falling over them, etc.), and you can overpower most opponents by knowing their weak points and elemental weaknesses, and lastly, you can summon another player that has gear that is way overpowering and hits like a truck. The base game, or NG (Way of the Samurai), is balanced for me (I did that without much help from visitors), but after that, it's all about gear levels, rarity, and stats. Still, I really enjoyed this game, and I am eager to play the sequel if I get the chance to do so.

For the story, I would say it is good, but most of the finer details are hidden in a journal in the map menu which is really confusing for me at first and will definitely confuse most players playing through it for the first time. The music and sound design tho are really great. The music really elevates this feeling of being a samurai in an anime, which is sick and cool. The enemy and level designs are also great [spoiler](all except for the Magatsu Warriors in the DLC because they are so OP and the first mission in defiant honor fuck those raining arrows and tracker cannons)[/spoiler]. All in all, is it a must-buy for you? Yes, if you are a soul-like/hack 'n' slash enjoyer, then it is a no-brainer, but if you are the type of player that gets angry easily, then maybe this game is not for you.",1694454469,1694610349,True,9,1,0.607376575469970703,0,True,False,False

Nioh isn't inspired by Dark Souls, it's inspired by what people who never played Dark Souls think that game is about: horrendous balancing issues, very poor enemy design, extremely over powered bosses who can one hit kill you no matter your level, buffs or equipment, padded content beyond any feeling of accomplishment or fun. Levels are reused during side quests, they are boring and never goes beyond ""japanese village"", japanese village but on fire"", and japanese village but snowy"", with the usual dark cave inbetween. But it has a ""stamina"" bar and you can roll, so it's a souls-like.

The game floods you in mechanics which most of the time are useless, for example: the parry and riposte feature, present in every souls-like, only works with humans. It would be cool if 90% of the enemies weren't just monsters and demons; but don't worry, the game itself will never clarify that to you. It has a ton of weapon based combos, skills and magic, each one with its own hability tree, besides your own character sheet. It's a feature creep ""RPG"" just waiting for you to break your build dozens of hours into the game.

Did I mention the enemies don't follow the same rules as the player? Yeah, there's that too. Imagine you take a hack & slash set of enemies and just put them in a souls-like with a slow and heavy protagonist. That's the idea of hard, not fun. If you don't wanna die of a heart attack based on pure hate and frustration, keep away from this. If you really want a ""souls-like"" there already are 3 Dark Souls for you to play, but after finishing the whole Dark Souls series, The Surge, Lords of The Fallen and trying this one, I must say I'm through and done with this genre.

However, when it doesn't work, the game feels extremely tedious and the sense of difficulty turns into frustration. There are some truly horrible boss fights in this game (bad enough that they are almost universally regarded as horrible by the player base) where you will whale on a punching bag that does the same 3 moves over and over again for 4 minutes and if you make a single mistake the boss will one shot you and you'll have to start all over again.

Nioh is a gigantic game with so much attention to detail and so much care, that even the players that try to hate this game will look stupid. I'll break stuff down in bullet points and talk about each thing that's important to try to get my thoughts across, in order to make the people reading this understand. 

(Base Game) 

Levels: For starters, Nioh is a bit different from Dark Souls or Soul-Likes in the sense of not throwing you into immediate hell, only to navigate the world around you like a headless chicken, but more so goes into the linear route of levels/missions.  In Nioh however there are a total of 6 Regions + 3 Extra regions (DLC's). Each mission(s) you choose has difficulties that tell you whether or not they are hard in terms of swords. ex: 1/5 swords = easy or 5/5 swords = hard. Now for level design, each level is unique and flexible as well as artistic. As the levels have purpose that make gameplay and story interesting. 

Enemies: The enemies come in two types; Humans & Yokai. The Human(s) enemies are pretty cool to fight against as it feels like a 1v1 and its fair as you can use all your ""skills"" against them, The Yokais on the other hand are pretty much the main enemy of the game and come in more variety than the gender spectrum. But for some people, can get pretty boring as you see almost all of them within the first 3 regions. Which is kinda nice. Because at least now you got time to come up with a strategy. 

Weapons: By far are the most innovative and meaningful aspect of Nioh are the weapon(s). With 7 weapons to choose from all tied to your stats aka (Strength, Heart, Body, Skill, Magic, Dex, Spirit, Nin) Its almost hard to pick which one to use, however while it may scare you that some weapons are just trash because of other souls likes, where a weapon just sucks and falls off hard in late game. In reality every weapon in Nioh actually works and can easily be used to crush anyone depending on what you wanna rock with. 

Combat: For adrenaline - junkies that love that octane, high risk action. Combat can be a make or break in a game. However Nioh not only does it flawlessly but also gracefully, with so many options and mechanics at your disposal, you can always switch up your fighting style whenever and however you want, and especially more with ""skills"". Each weapon has certain skills that you can do that make fighting just more fun. Have a Sword? Just parry a dudes weapon and stab them in the back without looking, like Raiden from Metal Gear. Got a Spear? Shank them hard enough and fling them in the sky and then shank em again and throw them on the ground. Got no weapon? That's okay, just hand catch a dudes sword and then stab em right back, like Jackie Chan. The skills are cinematic, effective and most importantly. Stylish...so you look like bada** doing it. Plus your ""Ki"" which is the games stamina. Can be used to stun people. Yes stun people, using.....stamina???? Plus you have the option to do a series of attacks, regain your ki and then do it all over again.....and thats just a few of what you can do.....oh yea plus theres cool magic, spirit and ninja stuff you can do. But we would be here forever bro. 

Bosses: While Bosses in Dark Souls or Soul-Like(s) carry weight to their name and legend. In Nioh half of the bosses are more so of a laughing stock....now Im not gonna lie. Some bosses are cool like I mentioned, but there are so so so many bosses in the game, half of them are humans but with different weapons. and all of them start to slowly blend in and aren't much of a threat when you look at them. Which in return kills the vibe. 

Story: What can I say? The game really isnt a story telling game in the sense of being a narrative driven masterpiece that was written by Shakespeare, but it isnt a snooooze-fest either and it keeps the player well fed on whats going on with cutscenes....which then later jumps right back onto the action with more bada** Samurai combat. But the thing that's awesome about it, is that if you ever choose to learn more about the lore. You can legit pause the game in the menu, rewatch cutscenes, read upon enemy lore in your enemy logs, read about spirits and even read about character bios when you come across a new character. and let me tell you....its a lot. Which just shows the attention to detail that the devs want to give.

Now heres where things start to get rough...Ik there will be some braindead Nioh fanboy out there that will disagree but anyone with a brain and a life can see where im coming from, but ill like to talk about the problems of Nioh and what sucks about it.

(The Problem.....)

Starting NG+: For most Nioh players, this is apparently where the game ""truly"" begins. As builds start to matter as well as the gear or weapons. But for me...its where the fun starts to die. 

(NG+ Way Of The Strong) - For starters NG+ (Way of the Strong) is pretty much payback time. All those enemies that have killed you, by being cheap or wronged you in the past by killing you before reaching your guardian spirit to get your lost amrita, don't know whats headed their way....and neither do the bosses themselves as hell is just around the corner. and that hell is you.

(NG++ Way Of The Demon) - Is ultimately where the game died for me.....back in base game you could literally play the game regularly and still manage to beat the game because every level you played dropped the recommended gear for that level. So theoretically your gear was up to that level and at that point the burden of skill fell on you. But on ""Way of the Demon."" Not only do the gears drop the same for every. level. in. the. fk***. region. and slightly better in the last region. But you also had to grind and combine armor/weapon pieces to get better ones and it was pretty much a time consuming slog that the devs did to pad out the time....So the games difficulty by that point, was no longer relied on skill...but instead....relied on gear....to which just ruins the point of a Souls-Like game by removing the challenge and having the challenge instead be entrusted into the next enemy RNG drop. Mind you, on Way Of The Demon, this was the run where enemies ganked you, 1-2 shotted you, enemies also had modifiers that boosted their attacks and could paralyze you and the NG+++ list goes on.....btw i stopped on the last NG++++(Way Of The Nioh)....

To end this review, The base game of Nioh and NG+ is what really matters, the attention to detail and effort in this game, clearly shows and despite my problems with the game at the end. It still is a game that is worthy and unique that defines its own self and is at least worthy of something to try out.

If you're new to the Souls genre, do not play this. It is not a very good representation of the genre and has some really frustrating aspects that other games in the genre don't have.

If you're a fan of the genre, I think there's a lot of fun to be had in Nioh. The combat is phenomenal. Every weapon type is unique and every weapon is viable. However, there are some issues with the game that I think you should be aware of before you buy:
-The enemy variety is abysmal. About 1/3rd the number of enemy types as Dark Souls 1. It gets pretty stale.
-Enemy health damage scaling gets out of control later in the game. There aren't new enemies to spice up the difficulty, so they just turn up the health and damage numbers.
-The game is too long, especially because you are always fighting the same enemy types. I cleared the game once, but you have to clear it 5x in order to unlock all content. Going into a NG+ is a hard sell for me because just getting through NG meant fighting most bosses multiple times (some of them 4-5) and it's all just more and more of the same enemy types.

Combat is very good so far with a wide variety of option with weaponry and even stances to benefit your playstyle whatever it may be. Hard hitting/slow, Mid damage/average pace or low damage/high combos/very fast. 

The sheer amount of skills to learn and weapon types to yield makes this game highly addictive and replayable, Starting off using the basic sword, I quickly realised just how balanced of a weapon it was, posing no real major advantages in certain combat situations.However switching things up I moved to dual swords hoping to some quick but low damage weapons and I was kind of right, they're hella fast hit hella hard and stack status and elemental effects extremely quickly making what was a challenging early game really quite easy having managed to complete region 1-3 solely with this weapon and not struggling since, showing just how much a players preferred play-style can result in a different experience.All Levels are built with one objective in mind, get to the end. However there is alot of option for the avid expolorer if you want to find all of the chests in the map aswell as all of the Kodama to buff your elixirs. Using the exploration path I quickly realised you get rewarded more for exploring for example on the mission with the Giant water thing for a boss, I had lit all of the torches outside the boss arena and it stopped the minions from spawning making my life tons easier this same effect worked with the spider boss in a later stage. The First area boss - Having played a wide variety of Souls games at this point including Wo Long and even that was easier than this first boss.The boss is extremely cheap and between the dips in Fps even with all the fixes in place, he would still get such cheap swings in or throw the balls from his chains so fast I couldn't see it happening. Having reflected more on the early game, you are put at a severe disadvantage with no omnyo and no ninjutsu or elements to really bolster yourself and your weapons the beginning of the game really is more about skill than anything because when you come across these same bosses later in more difficult situations, I wiped the floor with them, so just stick with it and get past the early game and Nioh becomes a very rewarding game.

Having completed the first difficulty and all it's sub-missions I have to say this game has given me one hell of a ride, Nioh as a Souls-like/Hack and slash really hits the mark, such an amazing game and such good mechanics within Nioh make playing this game absolutely addicting.

Conclusion: Nioh is simply amazing, boasting very complex but simple game mechanics and challenges for the gamer and I gotta say they're welcomed in this generation of games that are all simply too easy or casual so i'm glad to see games like Nioh are on the rise thanks to Dark Souls setting the Genre in to motion. Hopefully Nioh 2 fixes the majority of the problems with the PC port with it's dippy FPS and frame taring it really was the only part of Nioh that really annoyed me but I've managed to make do even with the technical problems and it hasn't dampened how Nioh will be scored by me.

9/10 - Lots of options for replayability, lengthy game dependant on skill/exploration, Story isn't anything special and finally for a 2017 game the graphics are quite shocking for it's age.

Edit: After putting in over 200Hours into Nioh, it is truly amazing, having time to trial more builds and to test the different weapons and the sheer pace of Nioh really puts it into a category all it's own, Truly enjoyable and almost 100% skill based, Nioh is one of the hardest if not the hardest game I have ever played to date, having achieved 100% I can tell you you don't need to go past NG+2/3 unless like me you couldn't find a Yata mirror and end up making your way entirely to NG+5 like I did, where it gets very very challenging.",1689694412,1692117721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The areas are re-used and just a tad too convoluted considering that you have no map. There is no incentive to explore areas unless you just like grinding. I wanted to get all the Kodama at first but I can't even notice the difference between areas I got them and areas I ignored them. Loot feels very micromanagey and tedious.
There is a nice variety of weapons and I like that you can use a small cannon as a ranged weapon if you want. But ammo doesn't auto replenish because you need to micromanage more.
Some people praise the combat but it's honestly excessive. five different weapon types with 3 different stances each and those have your standard light and heavy attack, charge attack, running attack plus a bunch of skills that you have to unlock that add more moves too. Then you've got up to like 22 guardian spirit which come in 7 different elements/effects.
After you've decided on all that you've got to decide if you'd like to be one shot wearing light, medium, or heavy armor and which of the dozens of tiny stat bonus on all of your gear you'd like to pretend are helping. You might enjoy it if you like organizing spreadsheets. Personally I was hoping to play a game and not get another job.
Enemy AI seems all over the place. Sometimes you can just beat someone to death in a second. Other times they read your button input and dodge every attack or interrupt you before you can complete the move. If you don't have skills unlocked for a weapon it's much less efficient so it's more tedius to try new things out without fully respeccing. Access to respec is easy but it's just another layer of tedium.

Is this game overall as great as its sequel? No. But that doesn't make it bad, nor does it make it obsolete. I only bring this up because there is this strangely common view that the existence of Nioh 2 makes Nioh 1 obsolete. Though Nioh 2 does indeed improve on most aspects of Nioh 1, there is still a significant enough list of things Nioh 1 does better that make it worth playing. 


The game is still a Nioh game at its core, so it's still fun, and it also has numerous fantastic bosses and levels that didn't make it to Nioh 2 (Sanada Yukimura and Yuki Onna alone are enough to make the journey into Nioh 1 worth your while). It also is still a game that has Nioh's well-known playstyle and build diversity that makes for insane replayability and bang-for-your-buck value. These things alone will always make Nioh 1 a game that deserves to be played, and is also enough to give it at least a ""Very Positive"" average recommendation score.


But beyond that, you have the following aspects the game does better than its sequel:


[olist]
[*]In Nioh 2, when you go up to higher difficulties, enemy placements only change for main missions. Side missions all remain untouched. In Nioh 1, when you go up to higher difficulties, enemy placements change for nearly all missions regardless of whether they're main or side missions.
[*]In Nioh 2, the endgame dungeon of the Underworld is only available after reaching the final difficulty tier. In Nioh 1, the endgame dungeon of the Abyss is already available after finishing the first difficulty tier. This is better because it makes the endgame feel less tedious since you can do it piecemeal. 
[*]Nioh 1 has far more extensive gear customization options than its sequel. For example, a favorite gear property of mine is ""Parry Disabled Vs Guarding Enemies"". Having this on your weapon means that no matter what attack you use on a blocking opponent, your attack will not bounce off. This gear property is removed entirely in Nioh 2, as are many other gear properties that could have been kept on but were just removed for no clear reason.
[*]Nioh 1's enemy encounter design relies more on denser waves of enemies. Though sometimes it can get overboard with this (think, for example, of the Night Falls Again side mission, particularly on the higher difficulties), these enemy waves are generally is designed with fairness in mind, and are fun to go through, as they encourage you to use all the crowd-control tools the game provides you with in abundance.
[*]Nioh 1 is overall faster paced thanks in large part to the player's ability to stack up insane Running Speed gear properties that allow them to move around the battlefield as if they permanently had Tiger Running Scroll activated. In fact, in many ways, Nioh 1 allowed players to create more broken setups than are possible in the sequel. This is my favorite specific element of Nioh 1. 
[/olist]


That said, even I can't gloss over the long list of things it does worse than its sequel. Here is a brief list:


[olist]
[*]Many of your weapon moves have the kind of target tracking that makes it feel like your character is drunk. Tonfas in particular are almost unplayable because of this. As a result, many moves that should otherwise be safe to use are often unsafe to use, because you never know if it might miss against an opponent who happens to just slightly be one degree off axis from where your weapon tracks. Nioh 2 fixes this aspect for the most part, while also speeding up a lot of weapon moves that often feel unsafe to use in Nioh 1.
[*]While humans in Nioh 1 are more fair in the way they behave when trapped in hitstun, they also are more frustrating to fight when out of hitstun because they dodge and block your attacks way more. When you play this game, it's quite clear that its developer Team Ninja was very much still in the mindset of designing enemy AI similar to how they designed enemy AI in their previous game they made prior to Nioh 1, which is Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge. That game was legendary for having enemies that autododge and input read a vast majority of your attacks. For a really illustrative example, compare the dual katana tall samurai general enemies in Nioh 1 and 2. The Nioh 2 version will still occasionally dodge around and block some of your attacks, but nothing of the spastic nature of its counterpart in Nioh 1. 
[*]In terms of its boss roster, I would describe Nioh 1 as having ""higher highs but way lower lows"". I mentioned earlier that fighting against great bosses like Sanada Yukimura and Yuki Onna make playing this game worth your while, but I also have to mention that players need to suffer through absolutely horrendous bosses like Great Centipede, Ogress, Gasha Dokuro and the infamous Triple Kelley room. Nioh 2's boss roster on the other hand feels way more evened out. 
[*]Weapons having normal attacks that bounce off of walls is never a good idea in any game, especially in a game like Nioh where a huge chunk of combat encounters are done in narrow and enclosed spaces. This is one of many things that Nioh 2 removed that proved that Souls-like elements are unnecessary to making these games good. Another similar thing that Nioh 2 thankfully removed was the need to grab your corpse from a failed run against a boss. In Nioh 2, once you re-enter the room of a boss you just died to, the game automatically collects the corpse for you. 
[*]All of Axe's block-based moves straight up don't even function the way these moves are intended to function. Tonfas input buffers for its triangle button enders are also unpolished, leading to tons of dropped inputs.
[/olist]


In conclusion, despite its flaws (which mostly originate from it being a fresh IP that was being made by a developer who had never made a game of this sort before), Nioh 1 is still very much a game worth playing even with Nioh 2 around. When you compare it to Nioh 2, the game feels inferior in many regards, but it certainly isn't inferior to the point where it deserves only a mere ""Mostly Positive"" average rating on Steam. So why did it get this ""Mostly Positive"" average rating? I can point to a few reasons:


[olist]
[*]The PC port isn't as good as it could be. It's a 7/10 at worst and an 8/10 at best. I can run it well on my GTX 1060 6GB setup, but I can imagine that it won't run much at all on lower-end PCs.
[*]Due to the excessively sensitive target switching bound to mouse, the game's mouse and keyboard controls fall apart when you encounter multiple enemies simultaneously (which is very often in this game), so anyone used to M&KB controls are going to suffer with this game. So it's entirely fair to give it a negative review on this basis alone.
[*]People are just bad at the game and misunderstand it or refuse to learn how to improve. Which is a huge chunk of people. Instead of trying to get better, they blame the game as being bad and leave a negative review.

And this game could've been something special, and could've been one of those if the devs made different decisions when it comes to the game's gameplay design, because genuinely the game has some fresh and well done systems outside the game that add good depth and build variance and great replayability value, also the cutscene are solid somewhat fun to watch. 

But to experience all of that you have to make peace with the fact that this game is difficult, but not fair. It sucks that it is designed that way, it makes it so when you kill a boss it's rewarding, but the process is not fun. You rarely see a move that a boss does be like WOW that was cool, like in some other souls games, you tend to think dude! That's BS! What am I supposed to do about that?! 

Not only that but you are always questioning your build or your gear when it's not you, it's just the bosses in this game are designed to one or two shot you no matter what, so there will be many moments where you will die, but it's not necessarily your fault, it's just the boss has a 4 hit combo that you can't dodge if you get hit with the first swing. Or the boss is too quick for the game's movement system, and you see that repeat with most bosses in the game. I always thought no this boss is just more difficult than the others and carried on with the suffering just to get to the content that's past them, then realized later that no, the whole game is like this. That's their design choice.

Not to mention that everything in this game is a grind, when you finish one mission you will not be automatically ready to play the next one, you must level first to get to the mission's level, so it's not insufferable. 

I really wanted to love this game, but it made it really hard. Also, there is a lot of stuff that screams laziness/rushing the release of the game that suck, stuff like mobs repeating through the entire game or 5 scores of music that repeat the entire game, side missions that are just existing mobs but larger with more health or existing areas just closed off with different time of day. 

Despite all of this I still went ahead and finished the entire game, and when it came to DLCs I cheesed through them because I was really done with the game at that point, I wasn't having fun, I just wanted to see what happens in the story. 

It's really sad because this game is a 6/10 that could've been an Eazy 8/10 or 9/10. But it isn't unfortunately.

Tldr: the game has some good elements, but ultimately destroyed by some dumb game design choices that make the whole experience frustrating instead of fun.",1689500269,1689500269,False,4,1,0.4853363037109375,0,True,False,False

In my opinion, Nioh has surpassed every single Souls game in terms of combat. It is fast, aggressive, difficult, and incredibly rewarding. Knowing when to change your stance, mastering the Ki Pulse, and becoming proficient with the weapon of your choice is an amazing feeling.

Please be warned that you will need to put in the time to get good. Persistence and patience are essential to mastering Nioh in all its depth. The game knows this, and the first chapter (until Onryoki, the first boss) is designed to make you a better, more agile player. It will be brutal at first, because there is no shortcut: you need to be good at the game. Changing stances, dodging attacks, and Ki Pulsing all at the same time will feel like mental juggling, and you will fail at first. But once you understand the game's rhythm, you will find yourself not only avoiding death, but thriving - making complex decisions in split seconds, navigating elegantly between enemy attacks, your stances, Ki Pulsing, and weapons.

You can play it like one and still do fine, especially since weapons are fast enough to reward hit-and-run. But you'll get bored playing passive after a while. The combat revolves around cancelling animations to string actions together, giving you insane control over your character in exchange for low health. Almost every enemy will two-shot you. Some bosses will one-shot you. Armor and stats barely matter in most cases. You level up not to overpower enemies but to tread water as enemies get progressively stronger. Your character is a glass cannon from start to finish - any gains are offset by equal or greater gains by enemies. 

What DOES improve are your skills as a player. That's where Nioh beats Souls in my opinion. It bombards you with stats and mechanics until you finally learn what's important and start to experiment. You use combat stances, improve your stamina use, and chain together attacks in creative ways. Enemies get tankier but you mow them down faster. And once you've learned their attack patterns, you can stay aggressive with close-range dodges instead of retreating over and over. You really feel the improvement.

The question is whether the good outweighs the bad. This game has too much going on for its own benefit - it's got 10+ skill trees, hundreds of gear bonuses, complex smithing, and piles of loot to sift through after every mission. You'll wonder if upgrades and modifiers really matter in fights where one mistake gets you killed. You'll also wonder why that variety wasn't applied to mobs instead. You fight the same enemies all game, with new ones appearing occasionally but the vast majority being recycled. This wears on you if you do sidequests, which are literally the same levels you already cleared with a different skybox. Repetition leads to burnout and I nearly dropped the game because of it. I highly recommend sticking to the main questline. Everything else feels like a blatant attempt to pad your playtime.

In sum, it's a solid game even if it misses the mark in some ways. It suffers from being the first of its kind and not having a proven formula to copy - any resemblance to other games (i.e. Souls) is surface-level. It's got unique combat and a high skill ceiling.

It borrows various elements from those games and changes them to deliver a fun and unique experience. I could write an entire essay about why I love and hate this game at the same time but to keep it short I'll just list Niohs strengths and shortcomings.

The good 

-from any ARPG/soulslike Nioh has without a question the best combat model. Different weapons with lots of techniques combined with 3 stances that you can modify to have different move sets bring insane variety to combat encounters. It's fast, brutal unforgiving, incredibly satisfying and leaves a lot of room for growth. 

-there are many different weapons with unique styles and techniques. You can use 2 melee and 2 ranged weapons alongside ninjitsu techniques and magic. The game also tries to force you to use all of your arsenal. There will be times where you will pick enemies from a distance with a bow. Other times you will slay an Oni using a no dachi. Then you will cast magic to debuff a boss or simply play dirty with ninjitsu. 

-There is a bunch of stats, items, armor, consumables to help you create a build to suite your needs. I've beaten the game first with a no dachi and axe combo supplemented with light armor. After that I chose to respec to a more tanky build with heavy armor, spear and katana. It was a different experience and people come up with crazy builds. There's even a ""spin to win"" one with the axe. 

-good enemy variety. You will fight demonic Yokai or samurai warriors. They use different tactics, skills and mechanics to keep you on your toes. 

-bosses are a pain. You need to study them carefully and ideally debuff with magic to keep them manageable. 

-beautiful music and presentation of Sengoku Jidai Japan

The mixed

- some enemies and maps are reused or reskinned. 

-there is a fair amount of grinding and powerfarming 

The bad

-the game is not keyboard and mouse friendly. I highly recommend a controller. You can play it on m&k but it will require either lots of practice or some tinkering with the limited control settings.

-lack of some QoL options, especially at the smith.

-unbalanced difficulty. Nioh has a very step learning curve. It's very difficult to get into and it gets progressively harder. To put it simply one shots are a common thing and the devs design maps and encounters to kill you. Example being one final encounter of a short side mission. You are locked in a very small area with two demonic enemies that can kill you in 1 or 2 hits. This can and probably will lead to large amounts of frustration.  After all the game was made by the same guys who created Ninja Gaiden. A game famous for it's unfair difficulty. It can get tiresome at times. 

-the game is a little bit over bloated. There are 5 difficulty levels with new gear rarity effects, bigger stats on enemies etc. So you need to adapt to the new difficulty spike, farm for better gear etc. This can potentially lead to a burnout. 

Overall despite it's flaws I've enjoyed Nioh immensely and it brought me lots of fun and satisfaction. It's one of the few games that I can recommend at full price.",1687897504,1688052010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And obviously if you do damage character and take a hit or two you're dead, the boss game is unbalanced and unfair, not like in the case of Sekiro or MGR in reveangance i past the first three bosses without slow and the second,third are just unfair not matter if you go full damage the result is the same be deleted in a ''combo'' or One shots because the bosses balance is awfull.

I enjoy the bosses of Sekiro and MGR and not was more than four Attempts in this game i cannot say the same.

My main issue with Nioh is the constant feeling that a valve has been tightened around game pacing, and everytime you make decent progress, Nioh turns that valve even tighter with no reason beyond pointless grind.

Enemies feel reasonable enough at the start of the game, but rapidly start to tank up as you complete levels and become more tedious to fight when new types of enemies show up infrequently. As a result, new enemy formations and tactics become really unfun to fight against, making it more preferable to fish out and bait singular enemies away and whittle down the enemy numbers one by one. Of course, if you die once, every enemy you killed in the conga line respawns as well, as a Dark Souls clone would. Not a super great feeling when that happens.

The equipment grind adds nothing to the game but slowing you down by checking out menus trying to compare 0.5% differences or just mindlessly checking off all the useless garbage you picked off to cash in, and makes finding treasure and secrets really dull as you know most of the time it'll be a +2 axe for your spear build or something pointless. But don't skip on item hunting or you'll miss out of fixed items that give you skill points. Good luck redoing a level if you missed it, all the items respawn when you do, forcing you to sift through it all again if you don't remember what you got the first time around.

On top of that, if you're not constantly updating you're equipment, enemies will become even more tedious, and they level up much faster than you're upgrading yourself. So you are forced to micromanage your level 15 pants and such.

I will say that actual combat is way more polished and indepth than what Nioh is ripping off, but is pulled down by the above flaws. However, I feel like the combat system is too complex for what you need, with the enemies most effected by your weapon skills being the easiest, but easily more than half of them become useless when pitted up against anything thats not human AND human-sized. You are not going to be able to use any of the [i]three[/i] parries your weapon has for the giant sea blob's laser cannon, sadly.

I'd just say the main gameplay feels like bringing Devil May Cry combat to fight a military tank (yes I know that happened in DMC 2). You have too many moves and no applicable use for them beyond the most damaging or fastest ones.

Story-wise, I have no clue whats going on and I have no one to get invested in. Maybe its good, I stopped paying attention at some point.

I'am not a big fan of the locales you are dropped into either. A lot of the areas feel like 'generic Feudal Japan area' with no character to them beyond that. It doesn't help that the game takes a mission-based structure, rather than an open-world one, so there's nothing connecting these places in an interesting way or something.

Overall, its okay, but wastes too much time just so you can do the same thing you were doing before. I don't even know how I sunk in 43 hours total on this in my two attempts to playthrough it, feels like I was doing the same five hours of gameplay for most of it.

Nioh takes place during the 1600s in the Sengoku period of ancient feudal Japan. You take on the role of William Adams, an English sailor who arrives in Japan while following his nemesis, Edward Kelly, who is gathering Dark Amrita for his own agenda. Before long, William is enlisted by Hattori Masanari to help defeat the Yokai (demons) that are surfacing from the chaos of war. If you're a fan of Samurai Warriors, you'll probably find a lot to like in Nioh's usage of Japanese historical figures. The game blends Japanese history with fictional supernatural elements. Most of the story is told through cutscenes and text with voice acting in between stages much like Samurai Warriors or Ninja Gaiden.

The game is composed of main missions and sub missions. The main missions play out just like an area of Dark Souls. You get to explore a vast area and fight enemies and pick up tons of loot along the way and eventually you'll fight a unique boss shortly before ending the mission. You'll unlock several sub missions as you progress through the main missions. The sub missions usually take you through an area that you have already been through only with different enemy setups and a powerful normal enemy that serves as the boss of that stage. Some sub missions change it up a bit by offering a single powerful boss however. Tutorials will unlock as you progress through the game and you'll mainly want to play these to get unique items or skills that are exclusive to that tutorial mission. The game does a great job with teaching players all the basic aspects of the game.

Nioh has a lot to offer through its loot that you'll find in enemy item pickups and treasure chests. You'll likely be equipping a new weapon and new gear multiple times per stage so you'll be grabbing SO much extra loot along the way. Players will be getting so much loot that it becomes overwhelming on the inventory screen, but you can sell the loot that you don't need for Amrita or Gold. One cool part about the game's weapons and armor is that you can take a high powered armor/weapon then combine it with a lower level armor/weapon and switch their appearance while upgrading the armor. So if you find a helmet or piece of armor that is high powered but ugly, you can switch it to look like a lower-level armor that looks more appealing while you keep the higher stats. This is a great way to keep your favorite armor style, but eventually, you'll probably get tired of all the item swapping and just start to equip whatever equipment offers the best stats at the rate you'll be receiving new equipment. All equipment has a certain rarity rating shown by the color of the name of the equipment.

Now let's dive into the best part of Nioh - the combat. The game seems to be set to a smooth 60fps at all times so all the combat is usually super smooth. You can actually adjust the game to where it will run at a smoother framerate or have higher visuals. Nioh has a good overall selection of weapons, such as dual swords, swords, kusarigamas, axes and a few other weapons. Each weapon has two button attacks that can lead to combinations and all weapon types have unique skills associated with them that can be unlocked for extra attacks. You also have the option of a low, medium or high stance that can be switched between during gameplay. Low stance is more of defensive stance with quick attacks and more maneuverability, medium stance is a good balance between defense and attack power and high stance is the most offensive stance that will give you some of the highest damage per attack. Each stance will give a weapon new attacks and it changes the way you will dodge. There is also a weaponless stance that allows you to recover ki energy faster.

You can guard attacks with all weapons and you can also perform a different type of dodge depending on the stance chosen. High stance offers a roll and the other two have a quick sidestep. By completing certain tutorial missions, you unlock ninja skills and magic skills. Ninja skills offer the ability to throw shurikens and perform other ninja abilities such as a stealth attack. Magic skills allow you to use elemental magic for projectiles and to empower your weapons with elements. The ki gauge is the stamina gauge in Nioh and this is used up whenever you dash, attack, dodge, get hit or guard attacks. Ki recharges when not in use and if you use up all your ki, your character will have to stand still and catch his breath for a few seconds, allowing the enemy to get in a free attack. You can also perform a ki pulse move with the press of the R1 button that will instantly recharge some of your ki after an attack - it's similar to DMC4's exceed system with rev and instant revs. If you perform a ki pulse at just the right time, you can recover even more stamina and also get rid of any ki dampening puddles that yokai enemies put down.

All enemies and bosses in the game have a ki gauge displayed along with their life gauges while fighting them. You can allow enemies to use up all of their ki and get stunned so you can perform attacks against them or you can wait until they are nearly out of ki then attack them so that they get stunned from a guard break as you deplete their remaining ki. The ki gauge really changes up boss fights and gives the advantage to the player. One unique part about Nioh is that you feel the enemies (including bosses) and player feel equal since both you and your enemies have life and ki gauges. You never feel like a boss has infinite stamina like some bosses in Dark Souls games.

Nioh looks absolutely beautiful and runs really smooth. Some of the environments that you'll go through on missions have some great environmental effects such as rainfall and there is one stage where you go through a battefield where soldiers are fighting. Enemy designs are mainly made up of yokia (demons) and other human-like enemies. Nioh seems to repeat enemies a bit too much as the game progresses. The game really needs a few more normal enemy designs since I got tired of fighting the usual yokia with sword, cyclops and a few other overused enemies per mission. The bosses are all unique at the end of each mission and they provide a good challenge but they all have weaknesses that can be exploited. Even though I respect Nioh approach for using Japanese historical figures in its story, the overall story does get boring. I started to feel as if I would enjoy the game more if I started skipping the cutscene since they became too lengthy and just plain boring.

Much like Dark Souls, Nioh is an overall hard game. I did eventually get used to the difficulty of the game however that's not to say that it ever got easy. Nioh has a LOT of content to offer with its numerous missions and unlockable sub-missions. The game offers a good bit of exploration in stages such as secret areas with treasures and collectible frog spirits that can be lead back to shrines. You'll constantly be unlocking shortcuts as you progress through a stage much like a Dark Souls game. All enemies return once you save at a shrine much like a Dark Souls game as well. The game borrows highly from Dark Souls, but you can really feel the Team Ninja presence when it comes to the combat since it feels a lot like a ground-based Ninja Gaiden overall. If you're a fan of Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden, or difficult action games in general, it's worth giving Nioh a try.",1686084242,1687994692,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

For people comparing it to the warriors series: Nioh is basically Warriors, but you're the helpless soldier. Without any gear, even the weakest soldier can two/three-hit you. Don't expect to win a fight against two soldiers until you really get the hang of this game. Oh, and there are huge monsters that can one-shot you if you're careless.
This is the Warriors series in a Dark Souls setting.

For people comparing it to the Souls series: If you've played both Dark Souls and Bloodborne, you know the difference in pace. Bloodborne is much faster. Nioh is much, much faster than Bloodborne. I haven't played Sekiro or Elden ring, so I can't compare it to them, but I can say that Nioh is a lot more reaction-based than the Dark Souls. Patience does pay off, but quick thinking/fingers is more important in Nioh.

I enjoy the fast paced speed of everything but my main gripe with this game is the fact that they're trying too hard to be a souls-like, so much so that it really takes enjoyment out of the game. The Boss design is what I really hate, I really hated some of the bosses in this game. I'd rather have played as the wretch in elden ring and fought the Tree Sentinel LVL 1, that would feel more fair and enjoyable compared to some of the bosses in this game. Asmongold said in a stream that Wo Long is a terrible game because ""the devs are trying to make a hard/challenging game but are too stupid/bad to design a game thats fair"", and I think this also applies to this game.

The Devs way of making this game challenging is by making the bosses deal a shitload of damage or have some sort of gimmick. Malenia from Elden Ring is a lot more manageable than some of these bosses. Like Hino-enma has paralysis that basically doesnt where off because she kills you before it does anyway, and in NG+ she just kills you in 1 hit most of the time. And I dont understand why some of the Human bosses feel like Im hitting them with a stick but take half of my health if the shock wave of their stomp hits me.

TL;DR
To summarize, this game is a very mixed bag. There's a great game in here but it's buried under savage early difficulty and complex systems. It also doesn't encourage trying new things out because you are actively punished for doing it in some form or another. The stance system and weapon variety are fantastic but it's muddled with the baffling skill animation-locking leading to many accidental deaths. The bosses are often cheap and unfun which makes the player want to play as cheap and unfun as possible just to win. There are tons of items with different ability modifiers but you might not care as you're getting your head bounced off the sidewalk hundreds of times. I simply lost interest at about the halfway mark. I skipped all the side missions because the gear would instantly be outclassed in the next mission. The experience too accelerates very quickly making those side missions a waste of time.

I want to love Nioh, but I don't. It has too many baffling design choices. I'm glad some people enjoy it but it's not for me. I'm hoping Nioh 2 is more streamlined. I'll try that one next probably.

The Bad:
-The difficulty- I'll start with this since it's what folks are typically curious about. This game is brutally difficult to learn. There are myriad systems, skills, and gear stats to learn. Not to mention there's a pretty complex stance system allowing for a wide range of different attack styles across various weapons. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem. With a welcoming first-playthrough difficulty it would be awesome to learn all these systems and challenge it again. However, this is an RNG loot-based game like Torchlight or Diablo. Even worse, the base difficulty of the game is absolutely savage right out of the gate. The developers did this game absolutely no favors by making the initial difficulty as high as it is. There are many, many more harder difficulties but after finishing the first time through with often severe frustrations at times, it makes me want to play something else instead of rolling it a second or third time. Thanks but no thanks. Masochists only.

-The combat- My issues with this stem from enemies(mostly bosses) having little to no wind-up to their attacks; all of which are devastating. This is exacerbated by most of the game's command-throws being instant kills. Other issues are things like your weapons smacking into walls. This can be quite a problem on a few of the bosses. Another major problem is animation locking. If you do something, you better be sure you can finish it to block or move out of the way. Because if it has a long animation, you're open to counter attacks the entire time. Most of the enemies you fight in this game have armor. They don't usually stagger until you break their gauge. You have to play carefully around this or you will die.

-The skills- There are many skills in the game. This makes the combat even more diverse and customizable. Ordinarily this would be a great feature. Unfortunately while learning them and experimenting with them, I noticed I would get animation locked and killed very often because of all the armored enemies. It became so bad, I stopped learning new skills and threw the system away entirely and stuck to as basic a combat system as possible outside a couple early techniques. I ended the game with tons of skill-point boosting items unused and I didn't care. The funny thing, too, is that after you are able to open up most enemies, they are dead. This means the skills you learned are mostly worthless anyways. I did use some basic Ninjutsu and Onmyo, though. That stuff is handy.

-Enemy variety- It's pretty lacking. That's all that needs to be said.

-The bosses- Most of the main line enemies in this game are either cheap or annoying; often both. A handful are fair and almost fun. As mentioned before, the game hits you hard with attacks that often have little wind up or lethal command grabs. This gets old real fast. I'll just say, as with other games similar to this, the bosses are the weakest area for me.

-Cannot leave boss areas- If you want to return to the stage to find items or Kodama after the boss, tough luck. Do the entire stage again!

-Healing items- I had too few of these much too often. I had to use the Kodama blessing to find as many as possible and I still often had too few.

The So-So:
-The living weapon / guardian system- At first this seems like a really cool idea. It sort of is, but also isn't. Living Weapon is like an ultimate attack that varies a bit based on your chosen guardian. The guardians also give different stats so the playstyle can change quite a bit just by equipping a different one. I'll break this into two sub-sections.

The Living Weapon problems arise when you realize how absolutely fragile you still are when in the powered-up state. An enemy can still absolutely faceroll you removing your powered status and quickly killing you. This is likely to happen on bosses where you will quickly learn that the Living Weapon doesn't come back unless you charge it with amrita/exp. But there's a problem since the guardian sits on your lost experience to allow you to recover it. If it's in a boss room, well, your guardian is locked away and you cannot infuse it with amrita before trying the boss again. Meaning this system is an all or nothing, use it or lose it gamble. You can recall it at a shrine but it forfeits all your lost experience. It's not encouraging anyone.

The guardians themselves, as mentioned, give a variety of different stats. So you want to use the best one for each boss. However, how do you know which one is best? After you die, of course! But the problem is that your guardian is in the boss room. Recalling it destroys your bloodstain/recovery point losing all that experience. To try a new guardian, you must throw away your lost experience.  This is totally backwards for encouraging players to try new things and experiment with boss strengths and weaknesses. I went through most of the game with Kato because I usually ended up dying with tons of experience in the boss room because they are often not clearly marked areas.

I am aware there are items to mitigate these issues, but that seems like a bandage on a wound rather than a solution to a self-imposed problem.

-Gear stats- I mostly ignored this as the game didn't encourage me to do anything. I stuck to mostly base stats only until very late in the first playthrough. I got a set together and it was kind of nice but by then I wasn't interested in playing the game again for better gear.

The Good:
-The gear- It all looks pretty cool. There is a customization system but I didn't play with it due to losing interest in the game's features.

-The stance system- I love this. It gives the player a lot of control in how to engage certain enemies. I went almost the whole game with just the starter moveset and skills and it was entirely doable.

-The stages- Most of these places I loved. They are all very different and no place seems the same. There are often places in the walls you can blow up if you have any fire bombs/ninjutsu opening new short cuts and pathways.

-The weapons- A great variety and with the stance system allows for a robust combat experience.

Things I Didn't Engage With:
-The dojo- I didn't touch it a single time. Learning new skills often resulted in my death. Since this was so encouraging I decided to complete the game without any advanced skills.

-The teahouse- By the time this was unlocked, I didn't care anymore about the game's intricacies. I also ignored almost all the revenants throughout the game. Why bother fighting unnecessary enemies in such a cheap deathtrap of a game?

-The blacksmith- Again, who cares by now? I didn't want to play the game much so learning new things became meaningless.",1687652973,1687663786,False,2,0,0.481678396463394165,0,True,False,False

I will be playing Nioh 2 in the future, i hope most of this has been changes or fixed.



Not really a fan of the level based system, once you are in a level and want to change stuff at the blacksmith, for whatever reason, you just fucking can't unless you want to replay the entire level? Or at least thats how i assume it works, luckily never had to do this, but i was always at the back of my mind, like why can't i just go change smth real quick if I want to.

Arrows and Bullets don't auto replenish from Storage system?

The way the healing items work is also shit, its based on a collectible in the main quests, but it resets everytime you go to a new area? WHY?

The loot system can fuck right off, every enemy will drop some dogshit item, your current gear becomes useless after almost every level, it's a massive pain in the ass to redo equip all the time. I am not reading all the fucking stats the items give, idc, just give me the purple one.

Enemy scaling is crazy/not done well, after about 10-15 hours i was constantly at LEAST 20 levels under ""recommended"", I did all the side missions though so idfk.
A normal yokai would absolutely oneshot to twoshot me towards the end of the game

The run-backs to some of these bosses are the fucking worst ive ever done, most of them indoors as well. 

Enemy variation is not a thing in this game, theres 10 different fuckers plastered all over the place.
Bosses are reused as minibosses, but personally dont mind that part.
Some of the levels were confusing as fuck/even with the map indicator

Game defintely overstayed its welcome, if it had ended after 20 ish hours I might even have recommended this, but it just drags on and on.

Some of the hitboxes can fuck right off

Probably one of the worst final bosses ive seen yet

You have gear that you are constantly upgrading at the blacksmith so that keeps you quite busy. The graphics and sound are good. It does NOT run in ultra widescreen 3440x1440 natively. You have to find a fix online. I found one that works really well and is safe to use. If you search the forum for the game you can find a thread where I posted regarding ultra widescreen. The fix in on github and is done by someone called LeonardF1989. Looks like I cant post links here.
Ive got over 230 hours in the game and managed to complete every mission in the game, main as well as DLC. It was a very difficult task. I ended up finishing NG+ too, so im now on NG++. Im going to keep the game installed and go on every now and then and help other players. You can co-op with strangers as well as invite friends. The co-op works pretty good. THere dont seem to be a lot of people playing it now and looking for co-op, but I usually found help within 15 minutes tops. Many times I would play through the entire mission and get to the end but be unable to defeat the boss, and thats when I summon help. Playing through on NG+ I was able to defeat juat about all of the bosses on my own.
Equipment level and your level play a very big role in what you are able to complete and not complete. The end game, after you finish all of the missions, is s bit of a grind IMO since you end up playing old maps all over again. There is something called the abysss which is really cool, but it has limited maps and those maps are based off missions in the main game. It gets a little old playing the same ones over and over, but its a bit different each time. When you do NG+ and NG++ the missions change a bit from the first time, but the overall map is the same. Things are placed differently and the mobs are different. They did a very nice job of changing things up.
I almost never play a game anymore after I finish it, but this game has me hooked! It captured my interest enough to keep me playing. In fact, this is the first time that I ever even started a NG+!

It's not perfect, the co op isn't very well made (one player has to have completed the level, which defeats a lot of the purpose) for example, and content is often re-used for missions.

Set in late 1500's Japan, Nioh tells the long secret tale of how two westerners factored into Japan's history.  As already referenced, Nioh is strongly influenced by Dark Souls.  The combat, while adding its own wrinkles, is strongly based on From Software's masterpiece, as is the gameplay loop of enemies coming back when you saving, losing your xp when you die, and yes, the difficulty is just as high.  That being said, the combat and the gameplay are fantastic.  

Yes, it is influenced by another game, but it is no mere knock off, it is exceptionally well done.  One large difference between the games is that Nioh does not seek to overwhelm you in all ways, the way the Souls games do.  It has a coherent narrative, a strong tutorial/training dojo, and discreet levels rather than giant maps.  You never have that feeling of being completely lost and wildly out muscled, like in a souls game, for better or worse.      

Nioh does not give the user quite as much agency in its graphical settings as some games do, but it is a great looking and sounding game that runs well.  The game has a ton of meat on the bone, main missions, sub missions, twilight missions, a ton of different weapons to master, each with three different stances, ninjitsu abilities, Onyo magic...  If you find yourself enjoying Nioh you will definitely get your moneys worth.  I got the credits to roll, and did every sub mission available before the last main mission, but did not do any of the post credit stuff.  Not because I was not enjoying the game, I just have way too many games to play and would rather move on to the sequel and other stuff.

9/10   

I enjoyed the game both on my main rig and my Steam Deck.  Deck protip - if you put everything on low and turn shadows completely off, you can pretty much lock 60.  Game still looks fantastic on the small screen.  Shut the SteamOS frame limiter off and enable ""allow tearing"".

If you have never played Ninja Gaiden before but are a fan of Dark Souls then let me explain what that means.

Imagine Dark Souls except let's start by increasing the speed by 2 times because this is Ninja Gaiden. Okay, now, you know how Dark Souls has different weapon types and each weapon has a Light Attack and a Heavy Attack combo string and these vary based on One-Handed vs Two-Handed grip? Okay, let's get rid of the One-Handed vs Two-Handed thing and replace it with ""Stance Switching"" which gives each weapon THREE (sometimes FOUR) different move sets (Low, Middle, High, and Sheathed). Low stance is a fast-paced move set with weak power and high evasive abilities. Middle stance is a medium-paced move set with medium power and multiple defensive tools. High stance is a slow-paced move set with high power and not many defensive or evasive options. Sheathed leaves you unguarded but you may have access to new abilities/combos depending on your weapon (like Iai Quickdraw with Sword). 

Okay, now let's throw in combo-finishers so that transitioning from a Light Attack to a Heavy Attacks mid-combo will initiate a combo finisher that differs depending upon the number of Light Attacks that were input and is unique to each stance. Let's also add directional input commands as well so, pressing something like left-stick forward plus dodge will be an attack which differs for each weapon/stance. On that same train of thought, let's add commands that can be triggered while guarding which vary per each weapon/stance. Okay, let's also add the ability to switch stances mid-combo which will initiate a special attack that varies for each weapon. We will be using the Stamina bar from Dark Souls in this game as well (called ""Ki"") to limit our actions BUT we are going to reward skilled players by adding the ability to recover lost stamina mid-combo by timing a certain input correctly. We are also going to reward aggressive play by making it so that the player can stagger an enemy and initiate an ultimate finisher by reducing their Ki to zero. And... that should do it for the combat? Oh wait, I forgot to mention that each combo finisher, ultimate, and special move can be customized by the player for each weapon/stance. Also there are Magic and Ninja abilities as well which are their own beast. 

""Wow, that sounds pretty complicated. And you said this game was faster than Dark Souls as well?"" Yes and yes. This game's combat is more complex, faster, combo-focused, and rewards aggressive play whereas Dark Souls is the opposite. Dark Souls is simple, slow, poke-focused, and rewards defensive play. But... that's what makes this game SO fun! This game is unashamedly about the combat whereas Dark Souls is more about the atmosphere and exploration. If you want to play a challenging, intricate, and stylish action game with fun combos then this is the game for you. I hope this clears up any confusion about whether Nioh is like Dark Souls. It's not. It is like a spiritual successor to Ninja Gaiden with Action RPG elements and... that's a good thing!",1681503802,1681503802,True,104,1,0.860879778861999512,6,True,False,False

The combat is exceptional, with each weapon having its own skill tree with additional abilities and combos, this is on top of the stance system with 3 unique options that all play differently. High Stance is your glass cannon, with high damage but low mobility and guard, Low Stance is fast but doesn't hit very hard making it an excellent choice for defensive play, and Mid Stance manages to ride the line between the two. Frankly the combat is so satisfying that it makes the Souls games outside of Sekiro feel clunky and awkward.

The setting is Japan during the Sengoku Period, shortly after the death of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, focusing on the power struggle that followed their deaths. If you're like me and know next to nothing about Japanese history, the game does a serviceable job of explaining the key players and the different factions, but you could completely ignore the story and ultimately still enjoy the game a tremendous amount. You play as William, an Irishman who comes to Japan following the theft of his guardian spirit, which is both a key plot point and game mechanic. Something that's a bit unique is that William and a handful of other characters speak English, while the vast majority speak Japanese. It doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, but it's a nice little detail.

Performance is excellent, though there is a 60fps lock on the game, but it's stable enough where I never really felt like I had to find a way to disable it. Combat is brutal for both you and your enemies, and it's fairly easy to become an absolute powerhouse if you structure your build correctly, but don't feel like you need to min-max, you'll have plenty of time to experiment.

1. The combat and control is better than the DS1,2,3 or even ER... why? There's no action queue. Movements and attacks are way more responsive and not as clunky.
2. There's stance dance, giving the combat and your movement more depth. New moves for every stance and weapons, and stance also affects your dodge speed and distance. (eg. low stance, short and fast dodge)
3. Clever enemy placements, but it does get repetative, when you see a lootable corpse right in front of a pile of boxes
4. You are not forced the use your living weapon (ultimate) at all, but it's there if something gets annoying and you want to plow through it.

---The Bad---
1. The leveling process is an exponential curve. Both leveling speed and difficulty of enemies. The whole game is a quick breeze with no challanges, then you get to the last zone and suddenly everything is 100 levels higher than you. So you either grind, or face with 15-30 minute bossfights, but you do have a ninjutsu option to carry 3 extra lives.
2. The story is abysmal, no character development, you don't feel the need to care for either the MC or any NPCs. Almost all plot advancements or romances feel forced. The lore is standard history with eastern exorcism legends.
3. The late game consists of back to back double-tripple-quadruple-etc. bossfights. Remember the good old Orstiern and Smough? Reduce the room size to 5th of that big church, put two more O&S in the same room. Fight!
4. The itemization consists of getting random drops, dismantling, then reforging (rolling for randomized stats) - similar to PoE in a way. Throughout the leveling you just put the lightest armor on with x sense stats (sense enemies, treasures, etc), and equip the highest level of your main weapon type. You only need to care about actual crafting when you arrive at the last zone.
5. The game does have pre-placed corpses and items laid out on the maps. So if we have random drops, what's the point of even checking them out? They drop permanent skill point increases... Thats it.
6. There's an enormous amount of reused assets. The maps, the enemies, the bosses, bosses becoming trashmobs. How can they make the endgame harder then? Just slap more of different enemies in waves and pair them for double bossfights and spawn them in either in a fixed interval (overwhel tactics) or right after one of them died.
7. Now then what about the infinite challange, The Abyss? You go in, you fight in 4 gauntlet style challange runs, then you run to the big arena, fight a few bosses, repeat. Why would you repeat this? To get more items and fix the bad randomly rolled stats on your items.",1681125827,1681125827,False,10,6,0.496061593294143677,0,True,False,False

It takes the general formula of Dark Souls (clear areas, fight difficult boss at the end, die a lot), adds in the loot system from Borderlands (every enemy drops equipment, with varying rarity and RNG based stats/substats), while the speed of the combat is quite reminiscent of Sekiro (which was released later, I know). By no means is it an easy game, but frankly, if you're going into a Souls-like and expect a walk in the park, you're doing it wrong. I'll try and summarise my thoughts below: 

Positives:
+ The weapons: There are 7 different weapon types, each with its own move-set and skill tree, allowing you to completely swap your play-style. Adds a lot to replay value too.
+ The build variety: Huge number of equipment options, with set-bonuses adding layers to the build variety. There are hundreds of viable build combinations that could be used, and bonus points for relatively easy respec.
+ Combat: While not quite as smooth and polished as Sekiro, the combat in Nioh is very fast paced and responsive, and tends to reward taking risks.
+ Boss design: The bosses in Nioh are designed exceptionally well, each one with unique movesets and appearance. The lore-relevance of the design is also a good touch.
+ Level design: The levels are generally designed in a way that they are interconnected, with plenty of unlockable shortcuts and such. The actual visual aspect is also quite well designed.

Neutral:
~ Graphics: Given how it's a slightly older game, the textures are certainly rather low resolution at places, but quite frankly, not jarringly so.
~ Balancing: The game does have an easy mode option for bosses, in the form of Sloth talismans. Basically a skill that you can pick up with low investments, allowing you to slow down bosses to a crawl for some time. The game doesn't force you to use it, of course, and it's an easy way out if you're having trouble.
~ Difficulty: The game's difficulty isn't really uniform, it does tend to jump at times, especially in the DLCs. Depending on your builds though, you might not even feel it.
~ Story: The story is there if you want it, but is nothing exceptional. Loosely based on Japanese history with tons of 'fan-service' aimed at Japanese-history buffs.

Negatives:
- Instructions: The mechanic explanation in this game is really poor, and more often than not, you'd have to consult external resources to understand the finer points of mechanics such as the confusion status, soul matching (inheritable traits) and so on.
- PC Port: While the actual performance of the game was great, the fine-tuning and customisation of settings could have been significantly better.
- Length: While I like longer games in general, a lot of the length of the game was using side missions that just reuse maps from the main ones (or some exclusive ones), and are primarily fetch/kill quests. The end game content wasn't really compelling either.
- Late/end game content: Once you 'finish' the game, they give you some missions which are basically just masochist-bait. They generally go in the form of a boss gauntlet or multiple bosses at once - sure, these are just optional challenge missions, but they're quite tiring. There's also the Abyss, which I can't say I enjoyed at all.

Overall, I really enjoyed Nioh, and would rate it around an 8/10. Most of the complaints I had about the game were relatively minor ones, and the positives greatly outweighed them. I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good souls-like. I'll mostly be playing Nioh 2 soon, and I've heard it's even better - definitely looking forward to that.",1680691672,1680691672,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You are a foreign samurai, trained by a legendary ninja, fighting in a (real) war that took place long ago. The enemies are based on folklore ghost and goblins tales (yokai and yurei) and the characters are based on real people.

Why? To me, it seems to have a much steeper learning curve than any other souls like and it takes way too long before you can start playing the game to the point where it becomes enjoyable. 

It is not necessarily a bad game, I personally love the boss designs and that's what kept making me come back to the series because it bothered me that I wasn't able to beat it, despite having completed most other souls likes that are arguably more tedious (Looking at you Dolmen & Hellpoint). 

This game just doesn't mess around, while there is a ""tutorial level"" it really doesn't teach you anything about the game. Hell, even the dojo missions doesn't teach you anything about the game. 
I had to sit through hour long videos explaining the game in a proper way for me to try and get better at it. 
And one it finally clicked, it was like how it was trying to play Sekiro. It went from being near impossible, to being a breeze. 

I downed every boss on first try using sloth talismans and odachi (Which is appearently the worst weapon type in the game, what?) and I only ever struggled on Hino-enma and the first DLC boss. 
Which is another negative aspect of this game. 

The DLC is way too overtuned, because the developers saw all the sweatters having no trouble with the main game, so they turned the difficulty up. If you are fresh out of NG, you are going to get your butt handed to you, simple as. After going through most of the campaign again in NG+ and getting full divine gear, THAT'S when it started to be playable. 

Again, the game isn't necessarily bad. But it does everything it can in every way for you to dislike it. And either the combat clicks for you and the game will be a cakewalk - or you will struggle and be stuck on the same enemy for days.

If you try it to play it 'your way' most likely you will die a lot. The high difficulty spike at the start is notorious. It does not make sense to you at that time but later you understand that the difficulty is necessary to get better. When you ready to give up you are close to the point of defeating your enemies. Every death means you learned that whatever you did got you killed. The game is brutal and will not give you an easy time <ever> - not paying attention or rushing means you'll die. [/list][list]But you will also need to discover the synergy between a combination of skills and weapons - when you do there will be nothing in your way. The story is just an excuse for great combat and is the weakest part of this otherwise great game.[/list][H1]The good[/H1][list]The combat is done really well - similar to martial arts in real life it's about your mind, body and form. Fights can finish in seconds: it depends on how you plan them. If you played Elden Ring or similar games you will find similar mechanics although Nioh is different as it allows much customization and I would not think of Nioh as a clone or anything like that. It definitely has its own unique flavours.[/list][list]I really enjoyed how different each weapon feels and how much creativity is offered with a combination of weapon, stance and skills that you can unlock.[/list] [list]The in-game interface takes some time to get used to, but it effective and keeps you inside the game instead of having to go through menus.[/list] [list]When you die, you will have to restart from the last saving point. All the equipment and the skills you've collected between when you saved and when you died will remain. So, you're getting better and strong and more efficient with your weapons so you can try it again with a different strategy.[/list] [list]It's possible to visit your grave similar to Diablo 2 and regain the ""experience points"" (amrita) you lost. At that point you need to decide shall I go back to the previous shrine to pray and level up or should I move on risking my level progress as you don't know where the next shrine is.[/list][list]If you are connected to the internet, you can see the graves of other players and can challenge their ghosts to get some of their equipment if you're successful. Similar like the blood drops in Elden Ring the more graves you find in an area the more you know it will be tough ahead. It gives a feeling of being connected to the community :-).[/list] [list]I didn't try the ""ask someone else for help"" option - it was a bit complicated with having to collect an item that randomly drop and then hoping that someone is at the map when you ask for help.[/list] [list]The graphics are fine, the sounds are good and the voice acting is good (Japanese) to serviceable (English). The level to detail is outstanding and having finished the game I can look back to a great experience.[/list] [list]Nioh is not open world like Elden Ring: you play through levels that are in general well designed. Interestingly enough the first round through Japan is more like an introduction - there must be another 400 hours of gameplay available with more challenges, more loot and more missions. It's like playing Diablo the first time more for the lore and stories and later you repeat but you are like a half-God.[/list] [list]The game slowly opens up after each large mission - from dropping you straight into the action to a tutorial, then a longer mission with the first boss (good luck with that) and then you get the regional map which is followed by more main missions, side missions (sometimes shorter variants of previous played main missions) and shadow missions (harder variations with specific goals).[/list] [list]There is a reputation system and you are rewarded for tasks and achievements with small improvements that you can apply to your character. Later in the game you can join a clan for clan battles against other clans. You can donate weapons and armour to help your clan and in return they reward you.[/list] [list]There is a long list of in-game achievements. If you get an achievement this will usually give you additional points (another system) and you can use those to add minor bonusses to your character like doing extra damage to humans, finding more items etc. If you later change your mind how you spec-ed your character you can reset the skills with an item and then make a completely different build.[/list][H1]The not so good[/H1][list]Saving is done using praying at shrines; but to be fair dying is not so unfair and the shrines are located quite centrally throughout the levels and as you progress you unlock shortcuts. The worst thing is losing experience if you happen to die before you can collect your spirit animal again. But even for that there is an item to help you with.[/list] [list]Sadly only 30 and 60 FPS is supported :-(.[/list] [list]You need a controller: I cannot see how you can play this with M&KB.[/list][list]I had three hard crashes in 130 hours: the game would freeze and I had to force close Nioh and restart.[/list][list]The in-game description for skills, items and stats are quite vague.[/list] [list]There is no difficulty setting: I play games on hard usually and even for me at times it was frustrating. I can see people that like less of a challenge will not have a good time with Nioh especially until the middle of the game. It does make a difference what weapon you use as they are not so balanced: with some you will struggle and with others you will have a much easier time.[/list][list]The loot is pretty much the same at each level: to see better or new loot you need to level up and then suddenly you only get all the same 'new loot'.[/list] [list]Later in the game levels are being reused with just different enemies: when I entered the same area for the third time, I felt that it became a little repetitive.[/list][list]You can lock on enemies but the camera can get lost when an enemy suddenly has different targetable zones or when you are in narrow hallways or low areas.[/list] [list]You can unlock skins of other characters if you have enough glory points (you earn those with ending high in the weekly clan wars and defeating revenants) however what I don't understand is why the skins for female characters are 10x more expensive than those for male characters?[/list] [list]There is a huge spike in difficulty finishing the campaign and then moving to the DLCs. It's probably best to complete NG+ before attempting the DLCs as the game becomes totally unfair with multi-elemental, massive hit point sink enemies. OTOH it will give you access to better loot quickly making the other parts of the game easier.[/list][H1]Summary[/H1][list]If you like to be challenged and then overcome those challenge that are thrown at you by the game then Nioh is one of the best of its kind. Nioh manages to offer unique twists with a variety of weapons, stances and skills. The story is forgettable but the combat makes it up for it. Even though the game is already six years old it is visually still strong and plays better than some of more recent released games.[/list] [list]The amount of detail is just stunning. There are some minor issues though perhaps the worst is the huge spike in difficulty between main game and DLCs. Nevertheless, this game comes close to a masterpiece but there is a price to pay: you need to invest and learn Nioh - there is no easy way around it. I suppose that is part of its charm. I can highly recommend it.[/list]",1679776218,1679777320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update: After 200 hours finishing the game and its DLC, its still a great game.

The usual problems with games this long really, while the main missions themselves were great. Everything else is either good or great, so its an 8/10 for me.

However I needed a good Deck game, and Nioh actually brings a lot of interesting new mechanics to the table and I love the integration of loot. In Elden Ring, once you had most of the gear (there is a ton) there was not much point in continuing as NG+ balance still leaves a lot to be desired, but this is not the case with Nioh.

The main downside is Nioh can be a bit grindy. I also tend to overlevel for each area because I suck, did same in Elden Ring. But unlike Elden Ring where at a certain point you become a walking battle tank, Nioh even when you are overleveled you will die in about 2-4 hits - which is essentially a single combo. From both enemies and bosses, more the bosses tho. It feels real bad to nick away at a big ball of goo's health forever only to slip off the edge of the arena because you attacked to far to the side, or you accidentally drop an extra attack when you should have dodged. I do feel like the movesets are much easier to learn/fight, but not in a bad way. It is hard to say it is more tactical when it feels faster paced than ER/DS, but it does feel like a more tactical or at least mechanically rich combat system. Maybe the punishment is just worse in Nioh - healing flasks are not as good in here, dmg is more painful, and you will have like several pages of quick access items to manage.

The main upsides that make Nioh stand out to me, other than the awesome samurai setting, are the combat stances, skill system, and ki management (namely recovering it via Ki pulse, as otherwise it is like Elden Ring). Chaining together combos from different stances is super satisfying and I love how you can make each so different depending on what combat skills you assign. Many skills use the same keys, so you have to pick one at a time and it can be different skills for each of the three stances (low,med,high). One skill might be a ki-killing kick, another a sailing sky slash from behind, but you can only use one at a time. It really makes your stances feel different and allows some customization (I like my medium stance to kill ki, my high stance is all slashy slashy). Also when I learned low stance helps with landing hits on crawling enemies - so so nice. Refashion in here is great too, especially since soul matching costs to your level after early game requires black market organ sales. I like that you can use any weight (L,M,H) armor for visuals without compromising encumberance. I was a touch sad the PS4 Nioh Armor never made it to PC, the Steam helmet is pretty damn ugly.

If you don't get the game, go watch The Last Samurai and we'll say you beat the storyline :)",1660223345,1678971006,True,3,0,0.527417600154876709,0,True,False,False

The PC port is decent- runs max on a mid-range AMD GPU. You can easily play 100+ hours and more. This game has better NG+ than any Souls Game, with loot and enemy mechanics built around it, and with the Diablo loot system you're constantly upgrading your build, your skills and your gear: it feels like your growth is almost limitless but the game is always a challenge. Beware, though- this game is also harder than any of the Souls games... and while there is magic, mages are not strong in this game.
Bottom line -- if you played Souls games and liked them, you would really benefit from Nioh.

Long Review: I played souls since Demon's Souls. For 15 years I've been playing in this genre. I am an Invader in souls games and typically play for hundreds of hours; even without the same pvp (duels are in nioh, but no invasions) I was quickly addicted to this game and did not tire of it until I had exhausted all of the NG+++++ (way of the nioh) content. There is an insane, massive, stupidly amazing amount of great replayability in Nioh. In a souls game, NG+ is a chore I do to farm items. In Nioh, NG is just a tutorial- the game changes drastically in NG+++ and beyond, giving enemies unique buffs, adding entirely new enemies, and NG+5 feels like a fever dream nightmare that is thrilling to conquer!

But I'm not going to tell you this game has aged great, or that it's perfect. Playing a mage in Nioh is not very fun except at the high levels; magic is not really used to deal damage, it is best used to stack all kinds of debuffs on enemies and buffs on yourself. Magic will help you find money, make your drops luckier, recover your used ammo, show you where things are on the minimap... it's very cool and I don't hate magic. Despite being mostly for support it gives you so many non-combat benefits it's honestly worth dumping your stats into magic especially for farming. 

Once you use Living Weapon at low HP- you're hooked, you've already started the path of the Nioh, and if that sounds interesting to you then you really need to play this.",1678934805,1678934805,True,4,0,0.547291874885559082,0,True,False,False

Originally released on PlayStation 4 in 2017, it was later ported to PC in 2017 as the ""Complete Edition"" which includes all DLCs.

Gameplay: The gameplay of ""Nioh: Complete Edition"" is fast-paced, challenging and rewarding. It draws inspiration from the ""Soulsborne"" games, but it adds its own unique elements such as the ""Ki pulse"" and ""Living Weapon"" mechanics. The combat system is deep, offering a variety of weapons and playstyles to choose from. The game also features a Diablo-like loot system, allowing the player to upgrade and customize their gear.

Story: The game is set in feudal Japan during the Sengoku period, where you play as William Adams, a western samurai who is tasked with stopping an evil sorcerer who is raising an army of Yokai. The story is well written and engaging, featuring a mix of real-life historical figures and fictional characters.

Graphics and Sound: ""Nioh: Complete Edition"" features excellent graphics, especially on PC where the game can be played in 4K resolution. The environments are detailed and atmospheric, while the character designs are stunning. The sound design is also top-notch, featuring an excellent soundtrack and solid voice acting.

Replayability: The game offers a lot of replayability, with its New Game+ mode, which features harder enemies and better loot. The game also has a PvP mode, allowing players to battle it out with each other online.

Criticism: The game's difficulty can be overwhelming for some players, especially those new to the ""Soulsborne"" genre. The camera can also be a bit wonky at times, leading to frustrating deaths. The game can also feel a bit repetitive at times, with some levels feeling too similar to each other.

Overall, ""Nioh: Complete Edition"" is an excellent game that offers a deep and rewarding gameplay experience, an engaging story, and stunning graphics and sound design. While it can be a bit difficult and repetitive at times, it's a must-play for fans of the ""Soulsborne"" genre and those looking for a challenging and immersive action RPG.",1678423205,1678423205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would argue that most people should pass on this one, and only people who enjoy torture would like this. I've heard many call this a souls-like, but really it's not like a dark souls or even a sekiro. It's mission based with a much different combat style, and a diablo-style loot system. Sure, there are souls-like elements, the typical level up system and such. but at this games core it's different than what you would be used to.

First off, this game is what I would call ""too hard"". I genuinely believe that this game is worse because of the difficulty. Every enemy can kill you in like 2 hits, and they are crammed into EVERY corner of the map. So many enemies are quite beefy and take multiple rounds to take down, while they just one-shot you. The bosses in this game are even worse, with absolutely no wiggle room and you constantly have to fish for the moves that allow for a safe punish. Even after I got really good at the combat system, every level was a booty clencher. It made it so that I HAD to play the game exactly how the game needs to be played. There's no room for creativity in your build because you can't afford to waste stats with trying different gear that need different levels. And while i know so many people will say ""just git gud"", that really doesn't justify alot of the design choices for the balance.

The loot system is by far the most egregious part of this game. Having to pick between a sword with +1% ki or a sword with 5 more damage is just pointless. Your inventory is constantly a mess of loot that is mostly useless, and the best way to USE that loot is never explained. Sell? Disassemble? who knows. It's so complicated for NO REASON.

What I can say is good about the game is the combat. It isn't souls style. It's its own thing. And that is good. Once you really understand ki-pulsing and the stance system, you can start to go crazy. I started really having a good time near the mid game once I was able to understand the games systems and before it cranked the enemy sliders way too high. I think that if someone is gonna like this game, its because they like the combat system. But it's hard to tell if you actually like the combat until like 5+ hours in once you actually practice it.

Overall this game has a lot of poor design decisions layered on top of a great combat system. So I had a good time with the game yes, but I still felt a lot of frustration that I feel a lot of people will share. It's up to you to judge if you will overcome that frustration. This game is basically just a badge that says ""yeah i suffered through this game and came out the other side"", which is fine. I also acknowledge a good chunk of people who get through the game will have a great time in the end game min-maxing a build, grinding to the highest level and 100% the game, but not me.

Most of these problems occur later on, one of the big ones being the repetitiveness of the game. Not only is everything copy paste from beginning to end, with the exact same enemies that are introduced in the first 5% of the game prevalent throughout, but the game has grind built into its design. If you're like me, you've probably never actually considered grinding in a souls like before. Even if you died a few times and lost a big chunk of souls (level up currency), you never really fall behind what level you should be at for the next area you need to go to in a FromSoftware souls game. This is not true for Nioh. I never lost my Amrita (level up currency) a single time; if I died, I was always able to use a summoner's candle to get it back. Despite doing every side mission (some of which I did MULTIPLE TIMES), I was under-level by anywhere from 50-80 levels in the endgame and dlc. If you're not interested in the crap dlc, then I'll just speak about the rest of the game, where I went up to 50 levels under-leveled. Due to the random nature of the drops, this is more of a Diablo-like than a Souls-like. Which feels like a weird comparison for me because I love Diablo 2 and the Souls games, but not Nioh. All of the mechanics that are done great in other games are just done so poorly here. It would seem that because of the randomness of drops, they expect you to grind their missions over, and over... and over again. And even without grinding them, its still repetitive, so I can't imagine how terrible the game would be if I did that, too.

Pros
-Faster combat
-Stance system (more varied combat)
-Skill trees for all 5 melee weapons ( offering multiple combos to switch and choose from)
-Miles better Co-op system that doesn't feel ancient to operate
-Fight players dead avatars for gear/glory(Revenants) (bloodstains)
-No more invasions
-Simpler/straightforward story (borrows from real medieval japan history)
-Build variety 
-A LOT of content
-Some bosses (humanoids)
-Good optimisation (locked 60)


Bad
-Boss runbacks (inherits from dark souls, WHY?)
-Living weapon is basically useless most of the time and is just very underwhelming to use
-Creature bosses have some questionable hit-boxes/tracking
-Music not good sadly (alot of repeats on the soundtrack of what feels like 5 tracks in total, and a really out of place credits song)
-Messy UI
-Overabundance of useless loot (like Borderlands and Diablo)
-Not the prettiest game even for its time, can look rough in some areas 
-Level design doesn't hold a candle to dark souls levels
-Serviceable story, play for the gameplay
-Campaign overstays its welcome towards the end abit

You could maybe test if the save file is the one nioh looks for by cutting it and pasting it outside where you found it and seeing if your save is still there, then just put it back. Thats what I did because I had to check as I have two different places where I found save files. I have no fukn idea whats up with this game and how it functions with its files and stuff.

After the success of Dark Souls, it amassed a large cult-like following and it increased the demand for challenging games. Plenty of developers took to creating their own ""Dark Souls"" type game, but a lot of them lacked heart, or originality, and were ultimately just pale imitations, (see Lords of the Fallen). Team NINJA then turned the genre on its head once more by taking the core mechanics of Dark Souls, (leveling system, bonfire-type checkpoints, currency lost on death with one shot to recover it), and infusing their own creativity and vision into it, resulting in an entirely new and incredible experience.

The visual design is astounding; I love that Nioh feels more closely grounded to real life than Dark Souls, and its aesthetics match the feudal era of Japan that the game is largely inspired by. Combining that with the mythical yokai as William's main adversaries, Team NINJA pulled off a brand-new look that manages to stay true to its artistic influences while also adding an air of the ethereal.

Combat in Nioh is one of the most satisfying systems I've touched. There are several weapon classes, each with their own unique movesets, and you can switch between low, medium, and high stances on each weapon in order to tune the playstyle even more to your liking. Each stance and weapon presents different combo possibilities, and you can even switch stances mid-attack, which is incredibly difficult and rewarding to master. You've also got the ki pulse system which allows you to cleanse yokai-tainted areas and also more quickly recover your stamina and keep up the offensive. 

The enemy design is very cool; there is a lot of mythological and spiritual influence, and I think it combines very well with the game's setting. All of the yokai represent terrifying and realistic interpretations of ages-old paintings and stories, and I think it's cool to see a modern telling of it. A very prominent feature of most yokai is their horns, which, once broken, immediately stunned the monster and gave you a prime opportunity to punish them. This feature is awesome, as it rewards the player for going out of their way to tackle an encounter in a different way, and it's done in a way that makes sense with their design. 

Honestly, I think Nioh presents a master class on how to take the soul of a genre and really make it your own. While some of the key features are reminiscent of Dark Souls, it's done in a fresh way that makes Nioh stand out far above the cesspool of trashy, copy/paste souls-likes that you can find littered all over Steam. I'm excited to get to the second entry!

In the beginning, every single enemy has a reliable way to kill you off a single stray hit (often, this ""reliable way"" is just the single attack one-shotting you). This tones down slightly as you progress, meaning that by the late game, only MOST enemies have a reliable way to kill you off a single hit. Every boss still has a moveset that is AT LEAST 50% instant kills. This is compounded by the poorly designed, unreasonably active hitboxes. Many stay active for what appears to be only a frame or two less than the invincibility on your dodge, meaning you need to be nearly frame-perfect or die instantly. There are many other minor issues compounding these. Bosses often have gargantuan health pools, drawing out even lesser boss fights (which, recall, you must restart if you get hit ONCE) up to and beyond the length of the FINAL bosses of other games. A good comparison I saw was, ""it's like fighting Demon of Hatred every time you want to progress"", though obviously the comparison won't make much sense if you've not played Sekiro. The other minor, but compounding issue, is the prevalence of poise/hyperarmor as a supposed ""strength"" on many of the player's attacks. Those that require charging or just come out slowly often have some protection from being staggered. This also applies to every attack in Living Weapon Mode. This sounds good, right? Wrong. Because of the armor, it seems the developers felt very comfortable gutting other key aspects of these moves, like speed. That'd result in the attacks being niche, but still usable. HOWEVER, because functionally every enemy in the game chunks out 60-400% of your health bar in one attack, there's absolutely no situation in which armoring through one of these attacks is a good idea. Congratulations, you just traded 2 healing elixirs or your entire run for 200 more damage on a boss with 50,000 HP.
Oh, last note on the one shots: no, leveling up health and wearing heavier armor don't tend to help much. Like I said, the range of attack damage is roughly 60-400% of the player's expected health for that point in the game. However, most of the one shot attacks hover comfortably around the 300% area. A hundred more health from level grinding isn't going to help when the attacks you're dying to are dishing out 3,000 more damage than you can take.

IMO, you shouldn't waste your time, unless you like difficulty regardless of fairness, in which case, this is a game you'll genuinely like.",1665260819,1676841360,False,1,0,0.457752764225006104,0,True,False,False

This game takes the souls formula and puts its own spin on it. Combat is much faster and more in depth than a typical souls, with 3 different stances and multiple skills per stance for all 10 weapon classes, along with magic and ninjutsu. Enemies are viscous and most can kill you in a couple hits. There's tons of content here to keep you occupied for over a 100 hours on a single playthrough.
This game sees Irishman William Adams arrive in Japan and immediately start slaying buckets of samurai, bandits, and yokai. This game is set during the tumultuous closing years of the Sengoku period, so, expect to see plenty of the big players of the time if you're familiar with the history. That being said, there's a healthy dose of fantasy and creative license taken here, with yokai and spirits in particular playing a central role.

fast paced, strategic combat

Map variety is rather low (for every mission, there's another mission that makes you traverse exactly the same map, but this time in reverse) and some maps are a little too labyrinthine for my taste (there's never a map of the entire level, so getting lost can be easy), but combat is quite enjoyable (I recommend exclusively using the spear in middle stance until you get the hang of the system) and the third-last boss's Guardian Spirit is perfect for finding all the secrets that you missed the first time through (without having to micromanage your armor or use temporary magic to get all four of the minimap-improving effects).",1519053159,1676826781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest issue in this game is the number of one-shots, or 100-0 combos. Once you get 1/3 into the game, pretty much every mini-boss and definitely every main boss will have at least one move that will one-hit you. These aren't super wind-up moves or grabs either. Their damn normal moves will just insta-kill you. This problem is further exacerbated by the hit stun in this game. A move may not kill you, but you'll get hit-stunned into another that will kill you from full health, and this isn't even considering moves with hitboxes incredibly larger than the boss attacks themselves. This is excessively frustrating when you're first playing the game. I did get used to it and beat the game, but these deaths never feel less cheap.

Outside of this one-shotting issue, I did find the combat to be very enjoyable. Bosses are fast, unpredictable, and vicious. Meanwhile, your ability to fight the bosses is extremely varied due to the stance system. I like the idea of the stance system, where you have 3 different stances, each with its own attack speed and power. I mostly stuck to low-stance, as it's the fastest, but there were a few scenarios where I found switching to mid-stance to be more effective. I never once used high-stance. In a game where enemies move like cheetahs, slow attacks are pretty useless.

However, the weapons in this game have a core issue, which is the game's loot system. It's super excessive. Enemies toss out more weapons than you possibly have use for, especially if you focus on only one weapon type. After one mission you're flooded with dozens of weapons and armor pieces that you have no use for, and are immediately sold or melted down for parts. The game builds around this system by having weapons have a large variety of possible enchantments that can be on your weapon, but it's just needless grinding in my opinion. Inventory management is a needless chore that I wish was stripped from this game.

The level design in the game is also pretty mediocre. No area really stands out from another. It's either a forest, a Japanese village, or a cave. Enemy variety within the levels is also pretty poor. You're going to fight the same enemies that you see at the beginning of the game consistently to the end. If the areas are all the same, and the enemies within them are super similar, then why isn't the game 10-15 hours shorter with the bosses closer together? 

There's also a story that for the life of me I could not care less about. Average video game story. Especially after they killed off the only character I liked.

In conclusion, Nioh's unfair bosses, annoying loot system, and boring level design cannot make up for its great combat. Definitely avoid this souls-like.",1676806581,1676819211,False,1,1,0.5047340989112854,0,True,False,False

What can I say about it? Nioh is pretty much Japanese Dark Souls. I'd butcher the story as a whole if I tried to explain it, but to sum it up: You're playing as a man named William that's on a quest to hunt down English Quan Chi, who has captured a powerful spirit you're trying to reclaim (Everyone in this game essentially has some kind of animal/creature guardian spirit at their side.), and you're battling a constant flow of demons and corrupt humans along the way. 

If you've played a Souls-like game, you'll feel right at home with this due to its unforgiving nature of losing your Amrita ""souls"" when you die and having to run back to your grave to gather them back up. You'll have a guardian spirit at your side that boosts your abilities and you can summon them as a temporary ultimate to enhance your damage and be temporarily invincible. The setting of 1600 feudal Japan is very interesting, and you'll want to leave the dialog in Japanese because I'm sure it feels far more authentic than trying to listen to whatever the dubbed voice-acting is. 

Co-op multiplayer exists in two ways: First mode is what we originally tried and gave up on where you have to collect these cups throughout gameplay that allow you to summon a ""visitor"" for join your fight, and it only lasts for that one level. The cups are a pain to get and if you die, you start the whole process again with a new cup. The second mode is what we settled on where you enable your requirements of joining (password/friends list/etc) and your friend joins your match with a blue life bar dictating how many times you both can die in the level before it's a complete restart of it. Always make sure to revive your partner before time runs out. 

There is PvP, but the only way I've experienced it is red grave markings that summon the ghost of a fallen player that fights you, and you gain some of their gear if you're victorious. You gain XP for defeating them and can use currency you acquire later on to purchase certain items in mid-late game. That's the extent of my knowledge of PvP.

Bosses. Boy the bosses are downright mean in this game. Honestly, Dark Souls bosses are bigger, but Nioh bosses are far more aggressive in every way. They'll sniff your draining stamina and relentlessly thrash into you until you're a bloody meat pile on the ground, no questions asked. Defeating the boss will end the current mission, locking access to the rest of the level, and booting you and your co-op partner out of the mission. 

I got this for $12.49 back then, and I'd say it was worth every penny. Would I have paid $50 for it? Probably not, but that's only because I've become far more stingy with money than I was 15 years ago, and I'm okay with waiting on a game before jumping on it. Game's great, co-op's fun if you have a friend, and you will die often, but it is beatable.",1676273553,1676273553,True,11,2,0.585860610008239746,0,True,False,False

The combat is overall pretty solid even though it is pretty repetitive in terms of style. Once you know what to look out for you can stick with one tactic and it usually works on the enemies. For me the spear was the weapon of choice due to its range. Nioh offers the choice to switch between three fightings styles per weapon. However it feels kinda pointless. I used mostly the medium style and it worked pretty well the high and low style were a bit wonky in how to use them and it actually made me feel weaker in terms of the combat. 

Enemies can become dangerous depending on the situation. However if one plays with an approach of ""let them make their move and then I poke them after"" it works fine.

Something that really annoyed me was some of the bosses I encountered as they're leaving very little room for mistakes and quite often it comes down to pure luck compared to skill when one defeats a boss. I had situations where I saw an attack coming from a boss and knew how to counter it (because it worked several times) but then it suddenly doesn't work and you end dying because it's a one hit kill attack. This is also something I heavily dislike. The bosses quite often can kill you in 1-3 hits no matter how you level your stats or what armor you wear. So if you fail to dodge the wrong attack it's instant game over with having to walk back to the boss again (walk of shame). Usually it may take a few tries to learn boss mechanics. However you may quite often require more attempts as dodging is unreliable and parrying even more so from what I've seen.

The maps are very repetitive and you will visit them various times because once a main mission is defeated you can and should go back and do the sub-missions for more XP and so on. The problem is that the sub-missions are quite literally on the same map. Some parts usually are just blocked off. Then you additional twilight missions that are on the same maps again just with slightly more difficult enemies and more Yokai (demons),

I've basically finished two of the regions so far an I'm honestly bored with the game. It's challenging in terms of the boss fights, but the story the game presents is lackluster and the characters are not very interesting. So far there was only one scene that actually made me laugh (had something to do with a cat spirit early on). Outside of that the characters are not really memorable and I just can't invested in the main character who is a stereotypical broody and mostly quiet protagonist.

The inventory and item system is just clutter. The game throws a lot of items at you but most if is useless trash. Less loot but with more impactful upgrades would be way better in my opinion.

Story:
So far this is the least interesting thing about this game. It mixes Japanese culture with sometimes silly fantasy. I guess that's to be expected in a game like this. I really like story focused games, but this game is still keeping my attention even though the story is weak.

The game offers three fighting stances and I would suggest you get good at them as you will need to use each one for different scenarios. High for strong attacks, mid for a mix of attack and dodge ability, and low for quick evasion and low lying enemies. You also have a Ki bar that is essentially your stamina bar. With all of this the game keeps the combat fresh and challenging. 

Graphics:
This game came out in 2017 and it looks pretty good for that time. The graphics menu is bare with only res, anti-aliasing, motion, and a few others. Nothing to write home about but again the graphics are from 2017. Think Witcher 2 graphics and you'll have an idea.

Gameplay:
This game is not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to die a lot! Also, don't just run through each level. If you do you won't be sufficiently prepared for the tougher challenges ahead. While the bosses are difficult, I found them to be easier than Sekiro and they provide you save point within relative proximity to each encounter. I found that you can just run through areas when you need to face a boss multiple times in order to defeat them. 

Each enemy has different skills and forces you to think on your toes. In addition to enemies you have the option to summon fallen warriors (others like me that have died in an area) and fight them for a substantial reward. Each potential opponent has gear that might be worth taking and you will have the ability to see what rare items they have before you choose to face off with them.

I've also seen that you can summon other players to help. As I don't have many online friends, I have yet to use this ability. Yet, this might be what you need to beat a difficult boss (not judging anyone who does). 

Final Thoughts:
If you like games like Sekiro or Dark Souls you'll probably enjoy this game. Keep in mind that I have never beaten any Dark Souls games, have beat Sekiro three times, and Elden Ring once. That's my experience with these types of games. I hope my review has helped you make a decision on buying Nioh. I just purchased it on sale because I wasn't sure I would enjoy it, but I really will be playing more in the near future.",1675660134,1675660134,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Plot:

Compared to Nioh 2, Nioh has a much better pacing and events are given time to settle as you move between regions and plot points. As the game takes place over a much shorter time period (the brief period leading from the weeks and months prior to Sekigahara to the eventual siege of Osaka) you also have much more time to get to know and appreciate the various characters who show up within the Story. Paradoxically, Nobunaga is also better written in this game than in Nioh 2, despite him having much more of a presence in the sequel. It also helps that William is a character who can be written around far easier than a blank slate character who constantly gets told their special because of their blood curse, meaning interaction between the various cast members ends up feeling far more impactful than in the sequel.


Level Design:

While most levels are a lot less flashy than in Nioh 2, they're also far less linear, often incorporate more verticality to them and are much more densely packed compared to Nioh 2's one-two path racecourses. The best comparison for this is the re-used temple stages from both games; in this game, you will often see a densely-packed, multi-layered temple grounds laid out in a rectangular grid, which can be cleared extremely fast if you know what to do and where to go, however still gives multiple options for approach and exploration that can extend the play time of the level exponentially; it's a design philosophy that can appeal to both people who want to take things fast, and those who want to go slow, whereas in Nioh 2, this complex has been replaced by a meandering set of pathways around 3 arenas with only 2 different angles of approach, both of which only split halfway through the level, with the goal you are trying to reach always requiring you to cross the full length of the map one of these two ways each time, with the only differing factor being what enemy variety has been put in the arenas. Nioh realises that combat is not the be-all-end-all of what makes it great, and as such the level design reflects this, whereas Nioh 2 sacrifices the memorability of its levels in order to cram in a larger amount of content variety, and ends up falling flat as a result.


Combat:

Nioh is not only a flat out faster paced game than Nioh 2, but it is also far less forgiving. Subsequent patches to various systems in Nioh 2 brought on by certain members of the community crying that certain skills are too difficult to use and need to be slowed down so that their low IQ smoothbrains can process what's going on have only widened that gulf: William has a faster base dash speed; your carry weight doesn't effect the speed of your dodge in this game, only the amount of i-frames that you have when you dodge; your general attack speed is faster and there is far less of an emphasis on playing waiting games with enemies who are only designed to be countered with the yokai counter or abused with soul cores. To add to this, Onmyo and Ninjutsu have not been nerfed in Nioh the way that they were nerfed in Nioh 2, and are still viable combat options as raw damage builds compared to merely being the secondary or tertiary damage options to your Nioh 2 base weapon, or simply acting as vessels for buffing and debuffing options.  


tl;dr:

Nioh is a far more focused and polished experience than the sequel. Nioh 2 attempts to iron over it flaws by distracting the playerbase with more shiny toys to play with (even though despite Nioh 2's variety you'll probably just end up spamming kasha and gozuki like everyone else, myself included), whereas Nioh does a lot with a little.

- grind here is just unspeakable (you must grind to level up inbetween main missions, you must grind to find better equipment, you must even grind to increse renewable potion count, that, for god knows what reason, drops off to minimum every time you sail to a new location)
- diablo-esque equipment system and everything that comes with it (soulslikes need balance - this system on contrary means no balance)
- most of the bosses are just meat chunks with few attacks (giant snake in the end is especially poor)
- level design is mostly lazy and you can easily lost the track exploring some of them
- the game is unnecessarily long that evokes the feeling of tiresome repetitiveness (and mandatory grind through countless side missions makes it even longer)
- unfair implementation of the stamina mechanic - without it you are just a doll to beat, but enemies in the same conditions can use their attacks perfectly fine
- living weapons are unbalanced and allow you to simply spam some bosses to death
- the variety of enemies leaves much to be desired
- bad optimization - the graphics level does not meet the system requirements at all
Pros:
+ one of the most advanced battle systems I ever saw in soulslikes (diverse weapon classes with three stances and dozens of skills for each of them; weapon combos with built-in stance changing; cool stamina regen mechanics)
+ grimdark atmosphere of demon-ridden 17th century Japan
+ bows and firearms are actually a thing
+ despite their imbalance, living weapons are a cool feature
+ ninja skills/onmyo magic

It is being difficult for the sake of being difficult throwing everything at you missing ""tactic"" or ""fun"" part of Souls games. 
The game requires almost no skill, just sheer stupid luck or constant grind amrita to vastly outlevel the missions you are supposed to do at lower levels. 

You can hardly complete a sidemission boss labeled at level 25 while you have 50+ lvl because the boss one shots you.
The mechanics that apply to you (stamina or Ki as it is called) does not apply to your enemies - even if they run out of Ki, they can still outmanouver you while they should be completely vulnerable to grapple.

Later, the bosses have almost no tactic or reason whatsoever. Water boss is being vastly damaged by fire? Apparently - yes. A samurai that deals you 100% damage with one strike that cannot be parried. Yes, of course. Multiple enemies at once while being on a small space and have reduced Ki? Whatever.

Also, you can hardly cheese them in any way, because every defeat limits your items you used. With every defeat you are growing weaker to the enemy that constantly defeats you because you already used the items and you need to LEAVE THE MISSION TO FARM THE ITEMS IN SOME OTHER MISSION. This is beyond ridiculous, considering the droprates and luck for them to drop. 

The missions themselves are really repetitive and designed simply to be annoying - Fighting 1v1 with big enemy on two square meters platform. Going through a small wooden plank surrounded by water while being shot at by archers. F U N

It is deprived of any joy or fulfilment from a victory due to a questionable difficulty, even for a souls genre. From Software makes far interesting design choices in all areas.

In it´s core, Nioh is a solid game, most importantly for combat system and world (historical fiction). But there are some major flaws that cause the game to be very mediocre:

-repeating locations (that is if you want to do side missions)
-low enemy variety
-loot system (randomized loot)
-main missions are very repetitive too
-confusing story (main plot is simple, but other story parts are quite chaotic, mainly because of high numbers of japanese names and characters; japanese names are hard to remember)",1671454468,1671487200,False,5,0,0.491338223218917847,0,True,False,False

The armor and weapon upgrade system gives your build extra complexity and min-max potential, especially in end-game and ng+.

[b] [i][Short Section] [/i]

I seriously loved how they blend Sengoku period(16th) into a dark fantasy and some chars from Nioh. I had prior knowledge from other titles from KOEI, like the samurai warriors franchise(I admire Li Naomasa story xD), yet Nioh did a better job at showcasing other remarkables people in the building of Japanese history. 

Your protagonist is actually William Adams or Miura Anjin(dono); which was a super cool detail cause at first i thought it was pure fiction, then when i searched his name i came to learn his story due to a game! Also we had Yasuke the black samurai. And besides those we had a lot of key figures(Masamune being my fav) and the story itself is really good, when you finish dlc 2 you wouldn't have major holes, and my satisfaction after finishing it was the experience of one of best videogames stories which i was totally unaware of! Plus after finishing once... I did 100% of the achievements and went from Normal game to Way of Nioh NG+++; hack slash in this is superb by itself.

[i] [Full review] [/i]
 
Nioh for me was a unique experience, I won it on that steam corgi event sale when it gave out one of our wishlist games to the team you're part of. That said, I tried playing it on KB+Mouse, God this was a hellish decision back then, and suffered a lot... then I bought a controller!(2022)

After that the game was something else, like the graphics are dated, i would rate non cutscene scenarios around 2011 standards...art style of the cutscenes become my top 10 fav so i really love the panel explaining the characters backstory+with their guardian spirit. Yet the true key gem feature in this game is how it implemented loot shooter features with+souslike+a new mechanic of each stance you have a different variety of movesets, and each weapon had this. Like my favourite was Odachi BUT i mastered all the weapons, got all the perks for ALL WEAPONS damn, it's really something else what they have done in the core mechanic+you also have magic and ninjutsu to explore, and each weapon had a unique moveset with a guardian spirit, and each guardian spirit changed your playstyle + After DLC you get two guardian spirits which made the gameplay even more unique. P.S: We got some fashion in the game too, you can customize the armor to have the exact looks you want without altering the stats of your build(Superb Quality of life feature). 

The game itself had also some good puns, side chars and backstory to weapons, missions, regions, the diversity in some enemies and how you can engage and fight tons of enemies with a wide variety of approaches made me love this masterpiece, also makes the game easier, 'cause the key point here is diversity, each mission boss and map design, makes some approaches easier to do than others, and when you go to new game ""Way of Nioh"" You're supposed to have mastered all the keys stuff in the game, 'cause after the way of strong, if you try to simple smash buttons you gonna suffer a lot. 

To summarize the game had multiplayer elements and coop too, (Last i checked was still active) so besides all those features mentioned in the review, you can also enjoy it with your friend, the clan system was kind of good roleplay mechanic, i picked mine based on the clan story xD instead of stats bonus

P.S: In addition to the centuries of difference.... we humans never achieved a lasting dream for many people. (unfortunately, but it is what it is).

You're getting shafted no matter what you do sometimes and it gets tiring. I expect the game to be difficult but I also expect there to be something I can do to play against each attack but sometimes you're just done either way.

This game is also one of the most loving and enduring depictions of a homosexual relationship. The sexual tension between William Adams and hyper-handsome Hattori Hanzo made the grindier parts of the game so tolerable. It is ironic that William is on a mission to save his fish-waifu from an English rapist, but he effectively cucks her for a totally-not-gay bromance with Hattori Hanzo. 

History will know them as ""good friends"", but we know the truth. 

This game has more in common with Diablo and Ninja Gaiden, than it does the Soulsborne genre. This game tested the limits of my patience and soul. But the fantastic story and character writing, all strung along the strong historical basis of many of the events, made this game forever burned into my mind.

That being said, I was so traumatized by some of the boss fights that I had anxious reactions to seeing them appear again later. This game is as anti-casual as it becomes, but I will let you in on an Epic Tokugawa Secret: You can fuck this game back just as hard as it fucks you.

You will learn metas and adapt them into your strategy, like some esoteric shinobi art. You WILL become, by the end, a force that is incomprehensible, if you know what to do with your build.

If this game is *too* hard for you, you might be bad at video games. Darksydephil got through this game with a hobo spear heavy attack, unupgraded, through the entire game. Do you really want to be beaten and proven wrong by DSP? He single handedly proved the only skill you need in this game is preservation and patience.

The early environments are a little meh, but later environments are absolutely gorgeous.

The optimization is hilariously bad, but 100x better than the Ninja Gaiden trilogy. If Sekiro was too slow for you and Elden Ring was too easy, consider this game. Its honestly better than its contemporaries and I say that a someone who loved both. 

But most preferably, watch the cutscenes on Nioh 1 and get Nioh 2, unless you have superhuman patience. If you get mad at games, even a little bit, do not get this game. But for those who have a masochistic spirit as I do, this game is worthy of one playthrough.

Not a bad game, but not great either. The best thing this game offers is the combat. I really liked the style of the cutscenes as well, when other guardian spirits tell you the background of some characters.

The story was quite confusing and mediocre (previous knowledge of 16th century Japan highly recommended!). The main character Geralt - sorry, William - only was there to listen to other characters, since he himself had almost nothing to offer. Even his dialog is limited to a few sentences throughout the game.

Also, sadly, many things in this game is repeated over and over. Enemy varity is quite limited, for example.
Instead of one interconnected world like in Dark Souls, you get many small levels which you can visit as ""missions"" by selecting them on your map after each completed mission.
This works too, but sadly some missions (especially sub missions) just reuse the existing levels and just fill them with different kind of enemies.,


[b]Negative:[/b]

- No support for ultra wide screens. And by no support I don't mean your usual black bars you get on each side - you get a fullscreen game distorted to ultrawide dimensions, even though it is not. Fortunately, there is an 3rd party tool which fixes that.

- Extensive inventory management needed: You're constantely flooded with a huge amount of loot, which needs to be managed.

- Enemy varity is quite limited and repeats itself constantely


[b]Positive:[/b]

- The combat is a lot of fun, once you get used to it. While the game is quite cleary dark souls inspired, the combat itself is distinctively different - It's faster and you can be a lot more aggressive, the Ki (Stamina) managment system works and is fun

- The level design is good - to find all secrets you have to look closely for them. Unfortunately, you will visit the same levels more than once, if you want to complete each side mission, as those get simply reused for them with different enemies.

- Guardian spirits are a great addition to the game. Those spirits can enhance various of your skills and once charged, can be summoned as ""living weapon"" where you inherit the guardian spirit element and are invincible for the duration of your ""living weapon"" life bar - which will decrease with time and received damage.

These devs made this game for patient players. Grinding to level up states is so time consuming. You would be at it for an hour killing foes and just one death you have to start from 0. Like bro, i grind up states a few of them before each boss and it still took me 40 tries each one. You literally have to wait for the perfect timing to attack. When a boss does an attack that one second delay maybe 3 if you get an attack it doesn't really do. But you get 1 HIT per strike 3 or 4 if the boss does a rare attack that leaves a few seconds to get some hits. OH BTW the boss's have such a high health bar it will take a good 20-40 minutes to defeat. Such a pain but i love it. This game forces you to play really conservative.  Not knowing whats ahead you need to take you time or loose all your points from the foes that pop up around the corner.  Say you needed 40,000 points to level up ONE skill state. you are at 38,000 and you die. well that sucks you go back to 0 and need to collect 40,000 which takes up a lot of time. The fighting in this game is awesome. different weapons different forms of attacking. You have to consider weight and the states and perks of each weapon and armor that would suit your play style. Its freaking technical and needs a lot of thinking and planning. Sometimes you have to switch out everything for one mission.  Or need to change some gear up to make the mission easier. This is a time consuming game and does not have a pause button. once you are in you are committed so make sure you have plenty of time to sit before you start. lol.",1669843996,1669843996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some positive things to say about Nioh as it has a cool art style and the combat feels good with different stances but this just isn't for me.

Dark Souls is tough but i think this game went a bit overboard with enemies who can hit you mid combo and bosses who crush you in 2 hits with lightning fast attacks so it can be incredibly frustrating trying to learn their attack patterns. Levelling up doesn't really seem to make that much of a difference as i think enemies level with you.
The game also has a Diablo style loot system where you are constantly finding new gear and weapons. You will have 5 identical looking axes but one of them might do 1% more damage. It just means your inventory is constantly full of crap you don't need.

Primary genre is hack and slash with third person pov and action rpg. You play as William A.K.A Anjin, when your friend join in your lobby for mission he will be a William too. But thats alright, various equipment and weapons will make everyone look different and unique.

Trust me, this is definitely a game you will not want to miss, if you are onto Co-op action rpg genre. Very much Japanese action types, with your own guardian, more like your special power.

Unique levels and unique elements. It has fire, water, wind and earth style. Some levels are based on a certain element while some are mixture and balanced.

I wanted to review the game Nioh.
[b]Pros:[/b]
1) For fans of souls-like games, this game is very suitable.
2) Combat mechanics. With each weapon you can stand in 3 different stances and each one has its own special attacks making it very unique. The combat system is well developed and you feel your character, not a log. There is also Onmyodo magic and ninjutsu that will help you a lot.
3) Japanese mythology. Maybe not everyone knows, but they are all demons / Japanese commanders in history. You can learn a lot of interesting things.
4) NG +. In the new passage, the opponents at the location may already be in other places and instead of them they may already be stronger, which makes the game unpredictable
[b]Minuses:[/b]
1)Too difficult for beginners. Many people quit Nioh at the very beginning because it is too difficult. After William arrives in Japan and you pass level 1, a boss will be waiting for you at the end. For beginners, this boss is very strong and they don’t understand how to fight against such a just delete the game.
2)You definitely don’t expect a huge plot. Nioh is just a fighting game in which there are a lot of different interesting ways of pumping, but the plot here is crying

I am a huge fan of FromSoft games, so maybe this review will help certain souls-like fans.

I don't find this game fun for two reasons:

1) Enemies have an obnoxious amount of HP, and a variety of one-shot attacks, making the game feel like an absolute grind.  Boss fights end up being a fight against your own patience, as even your most powerful attacks do a very small amount of damage. 

2) The game attempts to make up for grind with a tremendous amount of loot, but it doesn't work well.  You'll find yourself in a constant state of maxing stats by tiny, minuscule increments.  Even boss fight loot is a let down.

While I do believe this is a solid game for a certain type of player, it's not for me.  I keep feeling a little pull to go back to it and give it one more try, but each time I do I feel even more let down.",1665959176,1666563147,False,6,1,0.492287516593933105,0,True,False,False

Nioh's basic gameplay is 3rd person ""souls-like"" combat, although anyone who thinks this is actually like Dark Souls is fooling themselves. Souls-like combat is a delicate dance of attacking and avoidance where health is a limited commodity and screw-ups are punished until the player learns every individual enemy's rhythm. Nioh's combat is attack > attack > press stamina refill button > repeat, and health refill items drop like candy. The souls-like dance isn't worse in Nioh; it's absent. Combat is brainless and boring, despite all the complexity layered on top of it.

And that complexity is immense. You have: player stats, guardian spirit stats, a bewildering array of weapon and equipment stats, item familiarity, item crafting, item deconstructing, item sacrificing, item trait transfer, item level transfer, unlisted item set bonuses, a huge number of unnecessary consumable items, many (mostly identical) skill trees, a prestige system, a hidden object/passive bonus system, a combat stance system, and a worthless combo system.

In a normal review I would outline how these systems work, but there is no point for Nioh. They're all way too complex for zero return. Not one of these systems adds to fun in any way, and on top of that they also aren't intellectually interesting. You'll end up powering the player stat that suits the weapon you like best, and then you'll simply either sell or deconstruct everything you find in the game. There's never a need to bother with a long, complex combo, since the game is fully beatable with a 1-2-rest pattern from start to finish.

Not that I finished. Along with uninspired gameplay, Nioh also boasts a story that is simultaneously utterly crazy and so completely boring I didn't care to play to the end. It is historical fiction set in the 1600s. England, Spain, and Japan (and presumably every other nation) seek out a substance called Amrita for its ability to resurrect the dead. The protagonist has a spirit that allows him to track Amrita, but it's stolen from him and taken to Japan. He follows it there and instantly becomes a world-class samurai, [i]somehow[/i]. Don't ask questions. And I hope you're ready to once more travel through the most overused period of Japanese history, because you start to meet all the names you're familiar with: Nobunaga, Tokugawa, Masamune, Hanzo; the same characters you've seen dozens of times.

From there you're sent from place to place, usually for no apparent reason. You'll kill some guys, meet another overused historical figure, then move on to the next area with no explanation or story connectivity. Everything is presented as individual missions, rather than an unbroken story, so there's no sense of world building. You're just checking boxes, and frequently revisiting the same area multiple times to repeat what you've already done. Only this time you check-off a different objective box on the mission screen. Thrilling.

Nioh is also clearly console based and, although you can use mouse and keyboard, intends for you to use a controller. If you choose not to, you can look forward to the usual problems with Japanese console ports: absolutely insane control schemes, terrible menuing, and icons not updating for your chosen inputs, leading to the always fun problem of forgetting which buttons you've bound to an action and having the game suggest you press a button on your controller. ""But I'm using a keyboard!"" you say to Nioh. Nioh doesn't care. Press the bumper; press the left stick; press the Y button. You want to bind an action to a mouse button? Nope, not allowed. Better use an autohotkey script because Nioh is having none of it.

Multiplayer is also deeply annoying. You can join a friend on a mission from the start, but the second you connect to them a timer is started to begin the mission. Need to craft new gear or sell something? You better hurry up! There's a meaningless timer counting down to auto-starting a mission. Quite often - after a large haul of equipment - I would break my connection from my friend in order to have time to sort, sell, and craft (before I learned to simply disassemble everything) before reconnecting in order to proceed. What a stupid system.

Multiplayer also disables the shrine (bonfire/checkpoint) system. This means that, if you and your friend both die, you have to do the [i]entire[/i] level again from the start. No checkpoints. This is presumably to ""balance"" the added ease that having a second player brings to the game, but usually was just frustrating. Why bother fully-clearing an entire level, checking all the corners for secrets, if a boss you've never seen before will kill both of you immediately and make you lose all your progress? I usually ended up just running past everything when I was with a friend, rushing the boss at the end of the level rather than engaging. Great design.

And, sadly, that's all there is to Nioh. A meaningless story, no characters to speak of, massive system complexity, no gameplay innovation whatsoever, boring combat, frustrating controls, and awful multiplayer. Every single person who refered to this as a souls-like should be ashamed.",1666420693,1666420693,False,7,5,0.444538593292236328,8,True,False,False

Nioh is by far one of the best (if not the best) samurai games and one of the best souls-like games I have ever played, when it comes to weaponry and swordplay this game succeeds with flying colors.

Pros:
- great visuals
- stunning atmosphere 
- detailed world(s)
- complex moveset for each weapon
- tough enemies (dont underestimate them in groups more than three, they will f*** you up if you aren't careful)
- deep  skilltrees for each weapon, magic and ninja tool
- interesting story
- Japanese and English dialogue; the protagnoist (William) speaks english and other characters speak both english and japanese
- creative bosses (most of them)
- twilight missions (special missions) are difficult but rewarding
- duel battles are epic and intense (and PVP)
- no invadors in PVE (thank god)
- 95% of the game can be played with a companion
- your companion can level up with you and can take precious loot that you find
- good cinematics
- you obtain special powers from different spirit animals (fire=fox , shark=water , etc)
- fashion and armor variety 
- 3 story expansions are good bonuses
- challenging game (like dark souls)
- good side quests
- nice community
- worth the $50 price tag, this game will take you up tp 80 hours (pvp, expansions and twilight missions excluded)
- and yes, you can also be a badass ninja

cons:
- there are some exploitable skills (that i will not share) but you can just ignore them (dont worry they won't work in pvp)
- the OST needs more work; can get repetitive

In addition, Nioh attempts to combine the Dark Souls genre with elements from Devil May Cry (combo attacks) and Diablo (loot system). While some of the new elements work, some of them don't.

Let's start with what works. This is Dark Souls type combat where you can block, dodge, run, parry, and attack. Everything costs stamina so you have to be careful in balancing being offensive and defensive (i.e. if you use too much stamina attacking, you won't have enough stamina to dodge/block). At the same time, pretty much every enemy can kill you in like 2-3 hits (sometimes 1 hit). All of this causes combat to be very methodical, as you have to find the best way to kill enemies while trying to make sure you take as little damage as possible. This causes the gameplay to feel very rewarding, as you can totally feel yourself mastering the enemies you face as you beat them without being hit once.

In regards to the bosses, they're all fairly well done and provide a great challenge. You have to block some attacks and dodge some attacks (e.g. grab attacks). For a lot of bosses, you have to find a strategy that allows you to beat them. I will say that because I've played all the Dark Souls games, similar to those game, blocking while circling around an enemy works against a lot of bosses. However, I have to give it to Team Ninja that the bosses that they made for the DLC were very challenging. If it took me like 1-3 tries to beat most of the bosses in the main game, it took me like 5-20 times to beat the bosses in the DLC. I will say that the DLC bosses were so difficult because most of them had an insanely quick grab move, and most of my deaths were due to these moves. While I did eventually master dodging these moves, I just wish the bosses had a larger variety of difficult moves to master rather than just 1 very difficult move to master.

As you defeat enemies, you'll gain Amrita (basically souls from the Dark Souls games) which is used to level up the various stats of your character. If you die, you'll lose all your Amrita and will have one chance to get it all back. Again, this highly encourages you to master the enemies in this game so that this won't happen. The developers do a good job of making increasing your stats a rewarding system. Not only do you gain various passive benefits from raising your stats, but you'll also likely set mini-goals for yourself. For example, certain equipment may need certain stats to use. Or you might want to use heavy armor, so you'll need your equipment load to be sufficiently high enough. Or you may want to use magic or ninjutsu, which requires you to invest in the associated stats in order to get the skill points to unlock those abilities. So this particular system was well done and was engaging throughout the experience.

An addition that works very well is the various moves you can learn similar to Devil May Cry. There are a total of 7 weapons in this game (not counting ranged weapons), and they all have very different movesets. You can augment the weapons further by learning various skills that grant you new moves. To be clear, this game doesn't have anything close to the combo potential of Devil May Cry. You're not chaining multiple moves together in order to create awesome looking combos. However, these moves do give you new ways to fight enemies that you normally wouldn't have in a typical Dark Souls game. After all, in Dark Souls you have a quick and strong attack…. That's pretty much it. The way you attacked enemies in the beginning of the game is probably the way you're going to be attacking enemies by the end of the game. However, with Nioh, you're going to constantly be evolving and thinking of new ways to fight enemies, which is great. By the end of the game, I was using like 7 different skills when fighting enemies, and I would probably think of ways to use even more skills if I decided to play another playthrough.

Lastly, a major improvement to the game is that enemies have a bar in addition to their HP bar called the ""Ki"" bar. Ki is basically stamina (you, the player, have it too) and if you deplete the Ki of enemies to 0, they'll immediately stop and do nothing for 2-3 seconds. This is your chance to get some major damage in, since a lot of moves have their highest damaging attack at the end of a combo. Not only do enemies follow this logic but so do bosses! By the end of the game, a viable strategy for me was to use attacks that did little HP damage, but a lot of Ki damage such that I could stagger the bosses 2-3 times in a fight and do most of my damage during these times. Again, this allows you to change how you approach fighting enemies. This combined with the multiple moves you have at your disposal make the combat a lot more engaging than you would typically find in a Dark Souls game.


There are some additions that aren't exactly negatives, but they're not exactly positives either:
	• Stances: You can switch between three stances: high, medium, and low stance. I mentioned in the beginning, that while the game tries to advertise the high stance as the ""offensive"" option, it has the best dodge roll out of all the stances. This meant that for 90% of the game, I was just using high stance because it's the best at offence and defense (in most situations). While I used the other stances at various points, the stances didn't add all that much to the gameplay in my opinion (they could've if they were better balanced).
	• Ki Pulse: You can't just keep attacking until your stamina runs out. I mean you can….. But there will be a large pause at the end of a ""combo"" which will leave you wide open to attack. In order to remove this long pause, you have to press a button after you finish a combo. If you use it correctly, you can recover a lot of the stamina you used when attacking. Again, this didn't change the core gameplay too much. This simply meant that after every attack, I had to press an additional button. There wasn't much strategy/depth to this mechanic.
	• Living Weapon: You have access to basically a ""rage mode"" where you will do a lot of damage and be immune to damage (sort of). This is recovered by receiving amrita, and it recover fairly quickly. However, since amrita is usually only gained by killing enemies, you will likely only be able to use it once in a boss fight. While this mode can theoretically last a long time, the duration is reduced by attacking and taking damage, so it's primarily only useful for taking out a boss whose already dead. This was an OK addition. On the one hand, it looks cool and gives you a tool for enemies that you have difficulty with. On the other hand, you can almost skip a bosses' 2nd/3rd phase using this, so there are pros and cons to introducing a rage mode to Dark Souls type game.
Facing multiple enemies: Sometimes, you'll be facing multiple enemies at once. Hell, sometimes you'll be facing multiple bosses at once. Since this is Dark Souls type combat, which is typically only designed for you to face 1 enemy tops, this can become frustrating. Thankfully, this pretty much only happens in ""sub"" missions which are optional. So if you ever find them frustrating, just remember that you don't have to do them.

Overall, Nioh 1 is fundamentally as faster paced Dark Souls with a some elements of Devil May Cry and Diablo thrown in, which is a pretty fun experience. Looking forward to playing Nioh 2 :)",1664743514,1664743741,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here's what sucks:
- You fight the same exact enemies over and over again. You get a different boss every 3-4 levels, big whoop. Then move onto the next area, which has the same exact enemies doing the same exact moves. Repeat.
- The combat is clunky because it tries to be cool with ""technical"" mechanics. Ki pulsing is a lame Gears of War reload mechanic to make the game feel technical. Does it add complexity? No. Does it make you feel good when you do it? Sure whatever for your ape brain. Does it get old after ki pulsing for the ten thousandth time? Yes, it absolutely does. Would this game be better without it? YES, it absolutely would.
- This game appears to be overly complicated with all the mechanics available to you, the truth is 99% of them don't matter. Your stats, don't matter until after you've ""finished the game"" then the ""real game starts"", people will tell you. The problem is, when is this game supposed to get good? Your dice rolls on equipment? Don't matter until after you complete the story. The blacksmith? Doesn't matter because missions item level drops will almost always be better than what can be forged in the main mission. Your weapon type? Doesn't matter because everything works.
- All of your interesting abilities are locked behind main missions. Absolutely amazing design being ahead in levels, and having no where to drop your skill points in. It also leads you to putting points into a bunch of useless abilities, and then realizing you need to reset your character to get your skill points back to put it into something more useful.
- This game doesn't reward you for deep exploration, being ahead on levels, or anything. Because every aspect of progression in this game is tied to item level, like a sad Activision-Blizzard cash grab. Item level only increases as you play a level that drops high item levels. Every item is almost exactly the same, with 4-5 random stats and none of them matter aside from the primary stat. Oh but, wait, they do matter! Only in the ""end-game"" after you finish it where you can cheese stats to make OP builds. Great, when does the game get good?

A very uneven, but glorious loot based RPG that rewards patience and timing with some of the most satisfying combat around.

The story is engaging, but lacks cohesion, so you'll have to scour all the menus to find out what's going on. But it's worth the journey and the ending is satisfying.

One of the best things, though, is how the game continuously opens up with new things to do, so it hardly ever feels stale.
And when you beat it, it opens up EVEN more  additional options and enhancements to your play-style. There's literally hundreds of hours (thousands even?) to look forward to in this game.

I would tell people who've been having trouble taking out the ship boss (you know who it is), that I was like you. But I researched up on it and then I discovered you can dodge through his attacks...and you can use living weapon...and you can summon a visitor. These were things the game did not really explain well at the beginning.

And I would very strongly suggest you push through that guy, because the game opens up immensely after that. It's so much fun and diverse in its content and replayability. 

But like I said, it can be very uneven and you will get frustrated. Most of your deaths will be your fault, but there are just some enemies, bosses, and levels that can go to Hell. The Siege of Osaka (Winter) has been especially aggravating for me (and a lot of other people). 

Don't be afraid to call for a visitor to help you out and know that you'll get better with practice and perseverance. You can always comeback to a level if it's troubling you to level up and probably discover something that'll make that level easier.

Interesting combat mechanics with the unique 'Ki Pulse' that allowed you to regain your Ki (Stamina) bar to continue performing combos or regain enough to make a dodge and escape, further into that you have the stances low, medium and high, the higher your stance the less damage you do but in term attack faster and use less Ki to perform attacks...essentially just light, medium and heavy attacks in layman terms, this allows you to take on different types of enemies on the fly with any chosen weapon of choice without feeling like you had to keep switching one of your primary or secondary weapons out with something quicker or slower to accommodate. For me I ran the entire game using nothing but primary Spear and secondary Odachi, personally I found spear to be great in light due to the dodge and wide swings that I could quickly recover from between attacks but mostly utilised medium for the majority of the game. There are also ranged weapons but are mostly limited to Bow, musket and hand cannon...i say mostly because of the skill trees that are not only almost exclusively per weapon but also have a 'Ninja' and 'Magic' tree if you want to spice up your build with some useful tools like throwing stars, kunai or most elemental based magic ranged attacks. These skill trees really opened up many paths for you to build your weapons of choice how you like, adding combo modifiers or skills that can me used while blocking for example so it went beyond that idea of most weapons doing the same thing and only giving unique weapons special attacks or combos...don't get me wrong it wasn't a game changer and i'm sure like most games this also encouraged people to find meta builds for maximum output rather than just enjoying the game with their weapons or gear of choice.

Gear was plentiful, many different unique sets that had set bonuses or just standard armours, all based on rarity, the rarer the gear the more stat enhancers they carried like attaching elemental attacks to weapons or upping certain defences, showing enemy locations on the mini-map, etc...just useful little things. Of course, the rudimentary weight system that most games of its ilk carry with the light to heavy armours based on your preferences.

Now personally, i'm a big fan of aesthetics, I feel a little more 'connected' to my character if I can make him look epic...i'm sure at least one person reading this gets whats i'm talking about...I just hate it when I have my guy wearing a mish mash of random shite with no theme or coordination or any kind, epic looking swear and some trashy looking Odachi. I just feel like I can perform better when I look good and amazingly Nioh has a refashion system that allows you to transmute the appearance of a previously obtained armour onto another regardless of whether you still own that item or not it doesn't matter, meaning you don't have to horde gear to keep its appearance, it just exists in its own separate appearance library so you can go crazy if you're into the fashion scene of souls or souls-like games. Personally i'm a massive Sanada simp so it took a while and i could only obtain my desired fashion near end-game but it was worth it.

The controls for the game, as someone who almost exclusively uses Keyboard and Mouse, well lets just say it was a bit of a mind fuck at first...like a fair few titles they lazily ported it without giving a thought to adding in KBnM prompts so figuring them out was half the battle, remembering them was the rest but like a few games I've battled where many have said ""you can only play this game properly with a controller"" it eventually began to flow like water, and really you could map everything to your preference so before long it started to feel like a game that was designed with KBnM in mind as well. I've always just believed that its a matter of time and patience but you can really play any game with any type of setup regardless of what it was designed for.

Now on the other hand...

The game suffers from some inconsistencies with difficulty, and a lot of the time it feels artificially lazy. Instead of something actually been challenging they just throw several enemies at you that regardless of how long you've spent grinding and getting top quality gear, will just two shot you, so all that time thinking you've prepared to take some hits you end up feeling instead like you've just wasted your time and might as well run around butt ass naked, because this gear isn't doing jack. Were talking about bog standard, lowest of the low mobs as well. This idea of thinking difficulty means ""it hits hard"" is just lazy design and there are better ways of going about it.

Base game was fine for the most part but bosses throughout base and DLC were either WAY too easy or WAY too hard, I started skipping sub missions post base game story because it went from 1 to 100 so fast that some fights were just borderline impossible for me personally, there was no sense of proper progression, it just felt like ""hey congrats you beat the base story, ready to get humiliated now and feel like you're dog shit?"" One boss fight that comes to mind is when you fight Hanzo and Okatsu at the same time and it just like ""WTF IS GOING ON AAAAHHH"" throwing stars, bombs, lightning fast attacks, all of which do 1 million megaflops of damage. I started to realise at this point that they were just been silly now.

Sometimes the TTK (Time To Kill) between even some basic mobs felt way too long and made it annoying as shit if you died and had to fight them again.

I wasn't a fan of the mission segmenting of the game, I'd have preferred if it was one big seamless world where all these events played out as you progressed...it just felt like it broke up the immersion of the game too much and opened up too much downtime where I was having to fanny about with all the gear that dropped between each mission.

The upgrading system, though different, wasn't fun to play with, I didn't end up forging much gear because the game just ended up dropping stuff that was better all the time, I used soul matching more and still don't even know if I was utilising it properly if i'm to be completely honest. Alright I guess if you aim to min-max or go for a meta build but it almost seems like you'd have to be lucky to re-roll stats to what you want and have a lot of money and resources to do it. I felt like I did fine without using it as much as I did though and just rolled through the game with whatever stats were giving me good damage.

By late to end-game and into DLC I just found myself getting utterly frustrated a lot of the time and angrier than I wanted to see myself be with a lot of the stuff that Nioh brought to the table...I had to start calling in help on one or two bosses because I started losing patience very quickly and just wanted to get to the end and have it done with, most of the time I couldn't tell if these people were hacking or laggy as shit, its like they took over my game and started making everything lag to a point that whatever I attacked took no damage and they were just doing everything for me, which is not what I wanted, I just wanted a partner to help, not kill the boss for me. Other times some guy would just delete a boss in seconds...at the time I didn't mind because it meant I could move on from the pain but in hindsight it like...man, I didn't get to fight that boss, I just watched some other guy do it through illegitimate means!

To wrap it up here...I'd still recommend it, despite the ups and down I don't see myself sitting on the fence with it, it had enough going for it honestly for a yes from me.",1663956119,1663956119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then the DLCs come and turn the difficulty from 10 to 100, and not in a good way.
Most enemies one-shot you, even if you grind equipment, so that's pointless, and almost any boss you encounter there is a gang squad. I guess that is Team Ninja's view of a ""hard game"".
The base game itself is not hard at all.
The story is meh at best.
The one thing I found enjoyable is the combat
BUT
if you play on PC with KB+M like I did, prepare for a really bad time:
1) No kb+m prompts, which means for the first couple of hours you'll be constantly going to settings to decipher what the fuck ""LB+Y"" is supposed to be.
2) For some fucked up reason, devs decided to map changing the locked-on target to the mouse movement, and you can't change it. When faced with multiple enemies (which happens all the time and remember, dlc bosses are all fucking gangers) your target will change constantly by even the slightest mouse movement and you will die A LOT because of that oversight.
I know Japanese companies don't give much shit about PC ports, but that is just insulting.

mediocre base game
mediocre (at best) story
shitty dlcs
good (not refined) combat
terrible (that's below ""shitty"") PC port

I actually enjoyed the combat a little more then the souls games (Apart of Sekrio) Its less clunky and your character moves a little bit more efficiently.  This also had a narrative and you had a purpose for most missions as this game followed a mission structure format rather then a vast open world. I both enjoyed this in some ways but ultimately it unearthed a couple of problems for me personally.

Having a mission based hub made a change from the usual open world this sort of game has but Missions can be very familiar in design and you are at times forced to do levels again (Or at best very very similar) in order to grind your character to a respectable level to progress
I was also not a fan of the small levels which could take you an age to finish and it felt the majority of the time that i wasn't making any progress.

With no enemies you could walk from one end of the map to the other in all of 3 minutes but this could take you over an hour to progress through due to the difficult enemies. Some might like this but i certainly didn't.

I racked up around 20 hours back on the PlayStation 4 and nearly 40 hours at this point on my PC, this begs a question of how can i not recommend a game I've spent well over 50 hours on.
Well to sum up there is a sequel out and its not on my wish-list.

This is by no means a bad game it just has too many flaws for me to personally recommend it. If this is something your definitely interested in then Proceed with caution and be prepared for a lot of grind and frustration along the way.",1663785870,1663789281,False,5,2,0.506586730480194092,0,True,False,False

Only really Ninja Gaiden can compete, which is `coincidentally` from the same developers.
First, the gameplay: If you do not want to die, you need to do the ki pulse, but the game does not tell you clearly how: after attacking, you need to wait for a bit, and THEN press R1. You can see the exact timing on your ki meter, when its charging back up. I almost gave up on the game when I did not understand that.
Also, there are skills you need to unlock, it will take a while to unlock but it will greatly change the gameplay, especially the ki flux skill. 
Second, the story/setting: This might be the first real Koei Tecmo game, the action part is clearly from Team Ninja(Tecmo), but the setting is very much like Koei. Its clearly based on real history, but the developers made it more interesting by mixing demons into the story. I am very happy with how they did that. I absolutely love how the demons look, and I love the lore.
Third, Ninja Gaiden references and similarities: I am not going to spoil anything, but I had a great time searching for those.

It's a diablo-type game with infinite grind as the endgame, which is also an evolution of the Ninja Gaiden games. Pretty fun, but also really f*cking annoying. 

I thought that the DLCs would be the meat of the game, but literally almost everything one-shots you there, so you can skip them, despite them adding more enemies and unique environments. It's just unfairly difficult and it's not player's fault that they're beaten emotionally and mentally into a pulp.

The Base Game is rather fine and not as broken, and once you get the gist on how to pivot around different abilities, status effects etc... it can feel rewarding (more like almost rewarding... lol). You will often abuse your Guardian Spirit's super power or magic abilities to slow bosses down, then stack multiple status effects and stunlock them to hell with constant attacks, which is just boring, but you have to do that, because you can't just outskill everything.

There's a lot of heavy reliance on gear although most of the stats don't matter except a handful, like in pretty much all Diablo-esque games. You have to spend a lot of time reforging for that single stat only to some levels later replace your gear and reforge it again, again and again.

Story is intriguing and based on real history events, only with an admixture of mystic Japanese folklore, however at times feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Characters can easily become likeable, but also really vague unless you read entire encyclopedias of their backstories (Absolutely unlike Dark Souls's way of getting lore)

Soundtrack is cool. A couple of catchy themes and that's it.

To sum up it's a pretty cancerous gameplay-wise game:
1. Some enemies and bosses cheat and kill you no matter what,
2. Gear doesn't matter much unless it has stats that you're looking for,
3. Grind. A lot of it and often with insanely difficult loops,

It will smear you all over the mud, sweat, blood and tears unless you abuse magic and some other abilities, but it has some silver lining of complex and unique combat stance mechanics, with different weapons and their respective skills.",1661291969,1662635832,True,31,5,0.749645531177520752,0,True,False,False

[b]Written Review:[/b]
It would be a mistake to immediately tack this game as ""Souls-like"" and leave it at that, despite the numerous similarities. While there are ""shrines"" (bonfires) and ""amrita"" (souls), the games differ in that Nioh has greater depth with each weapon type due to its usage of stances and weapon-unique skills. Nioh also has specific missions that you select rather than areas you walk into (the game is more arcade-style than rpg). For reference, I have not played any of the mainline Dark Souls games, but I have completed all bosses in both Sekiro and Elden Ring. I was not particularly good at either of those games, yet I still had a blast because I always felt I was progressing in a meaningful manner through either acquiring upgraded gear or (more importantly) better understanding of the boss fights. However, the only feeling I ever get when playing Nioh is a pervading sense of annoyance with the enemy and boss design. 

The combat system is fundamentally amazing with its diversity and depth (although item stats never really felt impactful), but the actual fights are a prime example of artificial difficulty. Bosses have large health bars with numerous one-shot mechanics (or at the very least attacks that knock out the majority of your health), and whenever I defeat one I always just feel glad that I can move on rather than proud of my skill progression. Non-boss enemies lack variety and are mostly dealt with different shades of ""wait for enemy to stop their wombo combo and then swing"" (which admittedly Elden Ring also fell victim to at times). Alternatively, you could be knocked off a cliff by a guy hiding around a corner that you only could know by experiencing the level before or wearing a certain item. Individually each of these annoyances are not super significant, yet they keep piling on and on until you start questioning why you're even playing the game if you're just going to be in a perpetual state of frustration. 

Now, I am almost sure that if I spend the time and effort I could continue practicing and learn the game mechanics at a greater depth to progress and complete the game (I only got 14 hours in), but I simply don't see any enjoyment in doing so. You might enjoy this if you thrive off that sort of niche challenge in painstakingly mastering a difficult yet oftentimes dissatisfying game, but I would otherwise spend your energy elsewhere.",1662072994,1662088506,False,44,7,0.546691656112670898,5,True,False,False

1) Has an unique combat system that while takes some time to get used to is pretty fun when you do.
2) Has a ton of depth in various combos of weapon attacks with depth almost like a fighting game.

Cons:
1) RNG based levelled loot system with enemies dropping hundreds of pieces of loot in each mission. This gets extremely tedious to manage (legit fell asleep one time while doing it) because for some reason the devs placed a limit of only 500 equipment pieces in the inventory so you have to do it every few missions.
2) Has unnecessarily complex weapon crafting systems.
3) Tons of recycled enemies, bosses and levels for missions.
4) Steep difficulty jumps after base game for dlcs for which you need to grind for better equipment from Ng+ and beyond.
5) A fairly forgettable story which introduces a ton of characters very quickly whom you won't recognize unless you already know a lot about the Edo era in japan.
6) Bland graphics.

Overall I would only recommend playing this if you already played all of Fromsoftware's souls games because they are way better imo. Even though the cons are more than the pros for me, I still had a bunch of fun playing this so I am still recommending it but I sincerely hope the devs improve their future games a lot more.

P.S. If you get this make sure to spec into Ninjutsu and Onmyo asap at the beginning and get skills for the weapon types you prefer because otherwise the game will feel even harder than it should.",1661448724,1661448915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am extremely disappointed with Nioh, the difficulty seems artificially inflated by increasing the damage, health and counterattack speed of enemies to an absurd degree.

However, Id say, get Nioh 2 over this one. I had some serious issues getting it to work...
and I freaking hate being William. Also, Nioh 2 you get to make your own character. 
It feels like a whole different story and looks better.

But the game is good, combat is smooth, difficulty high, some really annoying levels where I just fell off a path into water, which was annoying. But, as someone who enjoys Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Bloodborne, and has completed them... well the ""story"" of them at the least. Nioh is a Great companion for the Souls-Like player. 
Legit though, I give this game an 8/10. It had some issues, and some of the levels.. not a fan of.
Nioh 2 is better. But this is still nice. I mean, you basically play the first weeb, so, yea!",1660016942,1660016942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you've ever played Ninja Gaiden in your life then you know how brutally hard this game will be, because skill expression is king, hit and run tactics will be ineffective, and you will die A LOT. But that's just how Ninja Gaiden was, and that's exactly how Nioh will be for you.

While this game has some elements of Dark Souls, it has an entirely different (and arguably the best) combat system that  demands your full attention at all times.

The plot is heavily inspired by real life events of a English sailor making it to Japan and becoming one of the first western Samurais (except here he's Irish and demons are real), so without the otherwordly factors, this game is telling you a somewhat true story.

The music is great, but that's expected of Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo so no suprise there.

For some context, I enjoy action games where it feels like every move you and your opponents make feel deliberate, meaning that you can't just mash the attack button and expect to beat the entire game. On the other hand, I tend not to like games that force you to spend inordinate amounts of time navigating skill trees, equipment, and basically playing dress up to figure out what gear is best suited for each occasion.

This game did a marvelous job of deliberate combat, particularly when it came to fighting Yokai. Many enemies won't stagger with every hit, meaning that to succeed in this game, you need to pay attention to each enemy's attacks, find openings, and exploit their weaknesses. Team Ninja did a great job of making this a satisfying and rewarding process.

This game has a ton of variety to its combat too. There are three separate stances (high, medium, and low), each one providing different attacks and having different effects on how you will face your enemies. I was concerned that this would be overly complicated, but they do a good job of giving you an opportunity to ease into the mechanics and implement the different stances into the game as you feel more comfortable. I stuck mainly with mid stance for a while, until I could get a basic grasp on the combat. Then, as I felt better about the basics, I started implementing other stances.

The one thing that I would typically not enjoy is the skill trees and massive amounts of equipment stats, but even this wasn't too bad. Similar to the stances, the game was lenient enough that I could ignore a lot of this for long enough for me to figure out the basic gameplay, and then I could explore the necessary skill trees and equipment when it was absolutely necessary. I spent most of the game using almost exclusively the axe skill trees, but I ultimately started adding things from the magic and ninjutsu skill trees when I found skills that would supplement my brute strength build.

This game throws massive amounts of equipment at you, but I typically just equipped whatever had the highest attack and defense numbers at first, and then accidentally happened against other useful stats as I switched equipment throughout the game.

It should be noted that this game is difficult. I know some people have issues with leveling and whatnot, but I found that I was sufficiently leveled for the entire main game simply by completing every side mission as I went. My level slowly fell behind the levels shown for each mission, but this didn't end up hindering my enjoyment of the game because I enjoyed the challenge it presented.

I will say that I ended up being severely underleveled by the time I hit the final level of the third DLC. I think I was like 72 levels below what I was supposed to be, but by implementing several magic and ninjutsu buffs, I managed to hold my own against the much stronger enemies.

There are some side missions that have ridiculous spikes in difficulty compared to the surrounding missions, and those can seriously hinder enjoyment for a while. I ultimately stopped playing the game because I was left with nothing but these kinds of side missions, and the fatigue was starting to set in. I tried working my way through the way of the strong to get my level caught up to where it should be for those side missions, but I ultimately decided it wasn't worth it anymore because I had had my fun with the game.

I don't know if I will ever be back to play this game again, but I had a great time working my way through it. I ended up putting over 100 hours into this game, which I felt was time well spent. Although I got the game on sale for about 50% off, I think it is still worth its normal listed price if you can't wait to play this game (that is now roughly 5 years old).

Note: there is still tons of content I did nothing with including most multiplayer functionality, the abyss, all the different weapons and build types, and other such things.",1658455600,1658455600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- The game has a pretty nice combat mechanic. Even though it is not unique, it is nice to not get invested on only one weapon and changing the weapon whenever I get bored. (Even though I played most of the game with sword).
- The game has some cool mechanics like guardian spirits and stances that are unique.
- Mechanicly, the bosses were mostly cool (Tho I will get into bosses at the cons too)

Cons:
- Reused enemies. It is baffling that throughout the main game, I have seen like %80 of regular enemies in the first 4 -5  hours. After that in every mission I had to fight the same enemies. That got old pretty fast.
- Elixir system is terrible. You have to find 5 mushroom looking little green fairies in each region to get an additional elixir whenever you use a shrine and after changing the region elixir number gets reset to 3 again.
- Ridiculous leveling system. It is unbelievable. (I finished the main game at level 105ish, while the suggested level was 145) so gear matters more than level, but the second you get to dlc, main mission wants 170 - 180 levels. So you either have to do ridiculous amount of grinding for no appearant logical reason, or just have to tough it out.
- If you decide to tough it out like I did, the game becomes stupidly hard, not mechanicly but prepare to get one shotted by almost anything. In the second DLC, the bosses have ridiculous amount of health and most of their hits either kills you or hits you for like %75 of your health and again because of the ridiculous elixir system, you most likely will have 3 or 4 elixirs. You have to play almost flawlessly for like 8 or 9 minutes, and if you make a single mistake then you got to start all over again.
- Not every single boss has to have an unblockable-close-to-one-shot grab attack. 
- Reused bosses. Seeing the same boss that I killed more than once, or in some cases more than twice gets old pretty quickly. (Spoilers, I killed nue like 4 times, in the boss form, dojo fight, as a regular enemy, in the final act etc. Same goes for vampire lady as well)
- SUBMISSIONS ARE TERRIBLE. It is so obvious that most of the submissions are there just to make this game seem like there are more content. But %80 of them are just so silly, boring, doesn't even give good rewards and just sloppy. ""Oh there is a guy in the bridge William, can you kill him for us? Oh you need to find 5 mushroom fairies William."" It's just terrible.
- The story is uninteresting.

Overall, it is sad that potentially a pretty decent game became almost like a chore most of the time. If the game had better design choices, even little tweaks here and there, I could see this game like a good souls-like. 5.5/10",1657538272,1657908111,False,7,1,0.539118826389312744,2,True,False,False

I can confidently say that if you liked Souls you will like Nioh (for a while) but if you loved Souls, you definitely won't love Nioh. Not a chance. I know why you love Souls and Nioh has none of that.

The combat is fine but can get tedious since you'll pretty much be facing the same enemies over and over. There is some slight variation in their color and some of their attacks, but for the most part it's the exact same enemies with the exact same moves. As you progress they simply take more hits. Then as you level up and get a better weapon they take less hits. Then you move on and they take more hits again. You'll be bored killing them in 3 hits, then bored killing them in 5. Then bored killing them in 4 hits, then bored killing them in 5 again. Over and over. This also applies to large enemies that can easily take a dozen hits. It gets old fast. I ended up looking at the Wiki and I'm over 1/3 of the way through the game now and still killing the same things with more of the same in store. That really took the wind out of my sails.

The controls and interface are an extremely lazy port, with all of the prompts being for Xbox controller regardless of your choice. If you are mouse and keyboard, this game will infuriate you unnecessarily in that regard, but nowhere near as much as fighting multiple enemies; your target lock will be switching constantly if you move your mouse at all while attacking. There's no way to turn this off and with enemies constantly moving around and you positioning yourself as well as fighting, it makes picking enemies off one at a time nearly impossible at times. Instead you'll be spreading your hits between them, often leading to you getting ganked. Honestly, the hardest part of the game is trying to left and right click without moving your mouse. Yes, that's how poorly implemented the mouse support is. They basically just threw this port together. The controls would be pretty much perfect if you could disable this. Most of the time the game is fine, but as soon as you get into multiple enemies (even multiple bosses) good luck actually doing what you intend to do. You will have little control.

The environments are nice, but overall quite similar. The biggest difference between them is lighting... it's pretty much the same textures and assets in all of them. They are very small but that ends up being a good thing because you'll be revisiting most of them again in side missions and it gets old fast. Boss fights are fine, but cheap at times. Most of the time it felt like luck but a few bosses had good moves and good rhythm that actually made me feel competent. I learned them and beat them down and it felt good. Shrines (bonfires/checkpoints) are very close to the bosses so you can keep trying fairly quickly, but just know that after you beat that boss (often a boss you've already beaten. I'm not kidding) you're in for more sameness.

The leveling system is acceptable but item upgrading is needlessly convoluted. I didn't even bother with it, but from what I hear there isn't much point in crafting until NG+, which I won't be playing through. I wish I could craft some more enemies instead.

There just isn't enough to keep me completely interested. I lasted 60 hours before I completely checked out mentally. I'll finish it someday, but for now just want to play something else. I never felt that way once with any Souls game, and that's just because Souls kept my interest with the enemy variety, story, and unique environments. Every challenge I completed rewarded me with unique new environments and enemies. Not Nioh though... you're basically slogging through tedium to be rewarded with more tedium.

I finished it. It's not very good. Could have been absolutely amazing but they screwed up virtually every aspect of the game in one way or another.",1649568430,1657228564,False,6,1,0.495786994695663452,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is perfection, tons of different weapons/skills that are useful and fun to use. Depth of combat is extremely complex with an insanely high skill ceiling.

Mechanics are great. This is not only a perfect action game it is also an extremely complex RPG with an absolutely massive amount of different stats, gear, skill, etc

Graphics and art direction are also great, nothing to complain about here.

Negatives:

Level design is slightly lacking, but mostly pretty good. There are too many side missions that repeat the same maps.

Story/narrative is my only real big criticism of this game. The characters are all great, but the direction/intent of the narrative is pretty poor imo

These negatives are only small blemishes on an otherwise awesome game

The good part about it is that there are lot more rpgs aspects that can make the core gameplay more interesting, such as 7 melee weapon types, 3 ranged weapon types, and 2 level-dependent magic/ninjutsu types.

 Each melee weapon type feels pretty different from the others, save for maybe some tonfa/dual sword and odachi/axe similarities, and lets you choose the gameplay style you enjoy most. Plus, as far as I know, you arent restricted to leveling a corresponding stat to wield certain weapon types, though there is an attribute system not unlike the one founds in souls games. 

The 3 ranged weapon types arent too crazy, you got a bow, rifle, and hand cannon, each with their own benefits and detriments. Cant say there is much to these, just point at the head, shoot, and they die. Not really that deep or cool but it is satisfying to pick off mobs rather than fight each in melee range.

Cant say much for the ninjutsu or magic as i didnt level for it, but other people seem to like, plus its never bad to have options

Melee weapons and ninjutsu/magic also each have different skill trees to progress, with each having different skills to level that allow you to spice up your arsenal of abilities, such as parries, combo moves, and upgrading magic spells.

Every weapon and piece of armor you find in the game, which you will find A LOT of them, come with different perks are stats to allow for gameplay customization. There are three types of armor, light, medium, and heavy, each coming with their own benefits and deficits. Armor generally deals with defensive perks, such as toughness, scalling defense based on certain stats, or resistances to status ailments, with each piece of armor also having some specific perks, such as shoes sometimes having perks to allow you to move faster. Weapons generally have offensive skills, such as doing more damage with CRITICAL moves like parries, or doing more damage/stamina damage when using certain stances. An overarching feature to these perks is that certain pieces can have set bonuses. These sets follow the general format of the more of one set youre wearing, the more bonus perks you get, and generally each set has a certain gimmick, such as pure defense, or increased magic damage.

There are also a myriad of use items that can perform a variety of actions, such as explosives, elemental enhancements, and elemental damage.

Those are the main positives from not being a pure souls rip off

The biggest negatives, in my opinion, is that this game has some of the most bland, uninteresting designs for weapons and armor, and that the story is generally all over the place.

Every weapon and armor set look the exact same, save for cases of armor you unlock through quest. I can understand why it may be hard to make weapons looks different, especially when they are all just randomly generated drops from enemies, but my god man I am so bored of looking my character. The designs start out as interesting but very quickly get boring to look at as you unlock samurai set #97/255. Part of that is just due to being in Japan where there is only samurai armor, but they couldve atleast tried to spice it up.

Weapons dont get any better, the only weapon that feature a noticeable difference in appearance is the Axe, where the blade of most of the axes looks different, there are even hammers under the axe category! But when it comes to every other weapon type, the biggest difference is in whether your sheath is red or orange.

Plus, the story is a mess. The player, an Englishman named William, heads to Japan to recover his stolen guardian spirit from an evil magician that is obviously evil for the sake of being evil. Once he lands, he is almost IMMEDIATELY roped into a war between warring kingdoms, and works on behalf of one of the kingdoms, idk which one because they kinda never really say, while looking for this evil magician. so you are basically an english mercenary, but at the same time not really, but at the same you kind of are. Basically, the entire war is just a plot device to get William to go around to different parts of Japan, allowing for different levels, all the while killing a bunch of yokai that apparently only a few people can see. There is also some lore about the one-note characters you find, all of them kinda not really interesting at all.

Overall, I'm going to recommend this game, as i would personally rate it higher than a 5. However, if you are looking for a game to scratch a souls game itch, dont go here, or you will be severely disappointed. As I saw another review put it, this is basically Ninja Gaiden souls, so if you want something heavy on gameplay and/or RPG mechanics, this is a good choice for you.

Nioh feels very fast and you are much squishier than in the Souls games, in my opinion. The setting is feudal Japan where it interconnects actual historical events, places, and people with demons (Yokai). It is also loosely based off of a real englishman that sails to Japan to become one of the very few foreign samurai.

Lots of fun despite the game feeling repetitive after a while. This is due to you replaying missions or areas of missions over again for a different goal but also to grind up your level. Lots of loot collecting in this as well.

It was infuriating to keep up with the game's difficulty, and all those mobs placed especially at corners just to whack you, while also having to remember both keyboard and controller keys.
""Lock on target"" is another big issue with this game, because when you've engaged 2 or more mobs, the focus will automatically change from target to target, until you die. You will learn to cope and workaround this later on, but before that happens you will get quite pissed at the game.
Until you learn the base game mechanics you will not have much fun with Nioh, but afterwards the game is seriously addictive.

It's nothing like Elden Ring and yet it immerses you well all thanks to its insane gameplay look and combat mechanics.

Someone once referred to this as ""Annoying Dark Souls"" as opposed to ""Better Dark Souls"" and I'd have to say that's even saying it nicely. When I finished Dark Souls 1 a few years back, I felt genuinely accomplished and wanted to try more and more on harder difficulties. Eventually jumping into other similar titles. When I finished Nioh, I just felt numb at the end. Nioh has the foundation of Souslike games and starts pretty solid for the first few hours, but eventually turns into a slog of game mechanics that you have to constantly be aware of if you want to succeed.

The biggest difference between Nioh and other soulslike is that in order to becomes ""gud"" or successful in this game, you don't focus on your skills as a player as much as learning the inventory system with all of the buffs and benefits all of the randomly dropped loot provides.  You also always stay underpowered as the monsters grow in level with you, which means they continue to one/two shot you even as you gain 10s of new levels.

It all comes down to spending hours upon hours staring at your inventory screen and trying to forge/reforge a perfect item (you'll usually need at least 5 though) and spending more hours reading/watching videos to copy what others have done. Without these perfect builds (based on TONS of obtuse mechanics) it becomes so frustrating to play this game. Not dark souls frustrating where you learn with every fail, more ""so I have to go and grind for that perfect drop in some other level so I can reforge it for hours before I can proceed"" frustrating. And since forging isn't even fun or interesting it makes Nioh a very obtuse game.

To make things more difficult/worse, wiki for this game is very limited and there have been multiple nerfs over the years to make many builds useless, so all of this becomes a frustrating rather than enjoyable experience.
And without a strong build that can survive a few hits or decimate opponents quick, you end up constantly underleveled and frustrated as even the basic monsters with usually one shot you in higher difficulty levels. 

So even though the game starts as a soulslike and is quite enjoyable at first, once you reach the end of the first playthrough and start to replay some of the missions or do extra content, it just becomes plain tedious as you're forced to start looking up build guides and mix/match stats in your equipment, which in many cases may have already been nerfed. 

I'd probably only recommend this to someone who REALLY likes theorycrafting and min/maxing their character in games and enjoys staring at inventory screen for days, rather than actually playing the game. If you want to just go through the game with random drops and don't want to worry about the numbers, there's only so far you'll get before becoming way too underpowered to proceed.

And to make things even more difficult, after every missions you're showered with 100s of pieces of equipment that's often useless but MAY contain that one bonus you want so going through most equipment becomes a must too...so yeah....ugh...just frustrating, can I just play the game instead?

I really wanted to get Nioh 2 before playing this, but now that I've read it's basically Nioh 1 but with more mechanics to worry about, no. I think I'll just skip

I honestly think this game would be SO MUCH BETTER if they did the following:
-reduce the number of mechanics players have to worry about
-add an actual difficulty setting for people that don't want to worry about min/maxing
-make loot more meaningful or at least make a good inventory system where we don't have to scroll through 100s of items per mission in what seems to be a console era inventory screen
-maybe stop the nerf updates? what's the point? it's not a PVP game
-provide some other way of fun for people wanting to go through the game that don't care for min/maxing

It's a fun concept wrapped in poor game mechanics and even worse UI

Edit: finished NG+ and DLC to see if I would be missing some more fun and well...the game does become different in a sense that you mostly focus on perfecting your build and honestly there's only one major build everyone goes for - damage reduction using heavy armor. So the game becomes a bit too repetitive after and considering that all you get is more difficulties and a 999 floor dungeon, but no additional missions or endings, I just don't see the point of playing past NG+
It's ok overall, but the mechanics and the level design make it a bit less fun than other Soulslike and a lot more frustrating in the first playthrough

if you have more than 200 toughness you become inmoveable object, any lower than that and you are light as a feather. which means if you attack emeny with giant hammer they wont flinch coz of 200 toughness but if enemy pokes you with stick on 199 toughness youll get stagger EVERY HIT. insted of having flinch/stagger buildup this game has toughness system which feels incomplete specially infront of yokai enemies who dont stagger unless there ki is depleated which makes common yokai fights more of a chore and tedious than fun/balanced coz 1 mistake and normal enemies will 1hko very often in this game specially when using slow weps like odachi or axe, if you use katana, spear ,tsuregama this wont be much of a issue because its very easy to dodge with those and do almost similar damage. and on top of that this game isent high on enemy variety which dosent help. 

balanceing:
- small and fast wepons are favoured by this game specially katana or tsuregama with summer twilight which will destroy bosses never bothering to fight normally. odachi and axe feels too low on damage with too huge openings and attack time. and on top of that things do more damage mid attack, they do seem to deplete ki but thats dosent give some awesome attack opening attack just let you do 2 combos with stagger which is nothing compared to damage enemies do or there stab spounge hp.   

- low armor has no purpose , mid armor has better def and skills , game dosent give risk for reward, low armors reduce ki depletion but thats it. make one oopsie and get 1hkoed. low armors should allow more risk and reward game play but in my 200 house they are setting youself up for frustration and failure

-grind some op set in abyss and become 1hko god try to play normally and get 1hko by everything while doing low damage. there is no middle ground to play action game like a action game instead this game plays more like disgaea rpg.  

-tachibana mushugne
-date masamune
-MARIA (whoever designed her and date 1v1 should be fired. no joke )

Padding:
-game has 5 difficulties which makes no sense coz fist ng difficulty feels so hard without a decent set specially dlc which is way above normal difficulty lvl 
- money in this game is a joke in ng its comical how less this game gives money.
- soul matching costs are comical 

lack of honor :
-good luck fighting poeple like oda nobunaga and his wife at once 
-or doing a 3v1 against insane humanoid bosses with hyper armor 
-too many 1v2 / 1v3 fights without any care for balancing 

final verdict : this game is confusing because of amount of unnecessary and weird  bs it asks of player, and at endgame it dosent even feel like a action game and more like disagea, plus wierd balencing and 1hko pachinko mentality ruins it for me. 
i often start the game for fun grinding but end up being annoyed or bored. which is sad coz i love character and art design stuff of this game.",1597540246,1654860729,False,2,0,0.525773227214813232,0,True,False,False

Excellent souls-like (though I did not enjoy the story... not because it's deliberately opaque as in DS, but because it's just plain / no memorable character despite a wealth of NPCs...) . 
I'm a very prudent, careful player, and... went the magic way so that most bosses could be cheesed (sloth, etc.). So almost none (apart from first 3 or 4) was really memorable (most of them defeated in 1 run), especially at the end (100 eyes, Kelley... but not the 3 kelleys... these were a pain).
However, the DLC (both mobs and first boss) proved too much of a challenge... two much grinding (replaying same missions in NG+ is not an appealing proposal IMO) and farming (gear, gear, gear...) for me after 100 hours... So I've shelved it for now. Will likely come back to it later, in a year or so, after I forgot much of the main campaign missions.

Combat: 9/10
Everything Else: 5/10

Pros:
+ combat is incredibly fun
+ overcoming a challenging boss always feels very rewarding
+ memorable bosses and enemies
+ surprising combat depth
+ multiple ways to play your character

Cons: 
- dying likely means replaying huge sections of the level with all the enemies respawned
- many of your deaths will be pretty cheap, either one-shots from stuff you don't expect or your character not doing what you wanted
- 99% of the loot is just garbage, vendor fodder
- crafting is shallow and pretty much useless
- inventory management is a big time sink
- level design can be pretty painful
- Samurai from Sawayama stage
- Forgettable characters, no fcking clue what's happening in the game (something about the queen of England? War in Japan? Some Kelley dude and some magic rocks and demons)

Overall combat is in the ballpark of 9/10, everything else is a 5/10. I wish there was a ""mixed/neutral"" review option, because it's not a bad game, but I can't rightfully recommend it.",1653690921,1654170750,False,6,0,0.537714719772338867,0,True,False,False

Starting with 30 deaths in first location and ending with finishing ""The Grand Tournament"" with second try. This game punishes a lot, but the feeling of getting better brings much more joy than the avarage game. Controls, graphics and music are great.

I only got done with the second region of the game but man..... this is a really good game. I'm actually not really into stuff like dark souls, because you just basically wander off somewhere and pretty much get lost.

Not with this game! this game has more of a mission structure, so the levels themselves are big enough to still have alternative pathways and secrets but it still small enough that you will never get lost because there is literally a white arrow in the mini-map always pointing you to your main objective. 

The combat is defiantly something you get used to pretty quickly, and its pretty fun once you start unlocking a lot of abilities for new combos and attacks for certain weapons and that's where the combat starts to really shine. So the combat in the game is pretty enjoyable, you even have some magic and ninja tools to use also when you unlock those. Its defiantly a lot more action faster paced than dark souls extremely slow combat.... In dark souls the armor and weapons are weighted so you can pretty much feel like a freaking slug sometimes, here you have difference stances that are high stance which is more heavy hitting slower strikes, low stance which is really fast and doesn't use a lot of stamina and medium stance which is supposed to be a balance between the two and regardless of the armor and weapons you pick you can still move pretty quickly with your sprint further emphasizing the faster paced action of this game. 

I do imagine the game does get a lot harder as the game goes along.... and if you don't think the challenge is enough anyways there is also twilight missions which are much harder versions of the story missions you already done.... maximum level of 750 for this game apparently so it is also quite grindy. Also, not really a fan of these bosses that just feel harder because they have a LOT of heath to smack away compared to games like in dark souls where its more fair but the bosses are just more difficult to kill in dark souls but doesn't feel like it takes you over 10 minutes because their heath bar was too big. 

Don't be mistaken for the common enemies like the humans and demons, they can still pretty much kill you in like 3-4 hits if your not careful so make sure to use that parry or doge your way out of danger. Make sure to use amulets and accessories, they can be useful for certain bosses that are weak to certain elements and the same goes for certain enemies for example.... you can use a water amulet to quickly destroy those stone sentinels that come to life pretty quickly because they are really weak to water, if you just use your regular weapons without any special elemental attack it might take a couple more hits to actually destroy them. 

Oh yeah and there is a TON OF LOOT, that is a negative or a positive are you see but personalty I see it as a positive because the game does give you a lot of options for different builds. If you REALLY like one particular set of armor or weapon but the level of it is too low? don't worry you can soul match those weapons or armor with another higher level piece of weapon/armor that you picked up and like magic your current weapon/armor will be leveled up so to speak.... but if you do this particularly with weapons the familiarity will be reset back to 0, which isn't bad because you can get the familiarity of those weapons back to maximum pretty quickly. 

Also you can also pretty much customize your armor and weapon appearance with pretty much everything in the game, and there is a certain point when you can unlock the tea house which lets you completely transform into other characters from the game so that will be fun. 

The story is.... yeah.... confusing for those who don't know Japanese history considering that's what the game is based on real historical accuracy minus the demons and magic.... but lets be real your not really playing this game for the story, your playing it for the game play and the game play is super solid. 

So yeah, I would defiantly recommend this game regardless if its on sale or not.... I only bought it on sale because again, not a fan of dark souls type games in the first place but even I liked this game.",1654024163,1654024678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A very interesting game with a nice lore, good amount of Japanese mythology shaped with fun story.

For new players, who new to both mechanics and the game itself, this is a nightmare because key binding requires time to ponder on the game. Mid-game tutorials show XBox button symbols and this makes the learning very hard.
2) My biggest problem: swtiching locked-on enemy with mouse. I played with keyboard and mouse, which went pretty good actually, until I encountered multiple enemies. I experienced huge trouble while fighitng because a slight move of mouse changes your focus on the wrong enemy, that is a deadly problem in the fight which doesn't forgive the player for being hit since you can't afford a miscalculated attack and dodge.

While having really good boss fights, interesting areas and a ton of playstyles to choose from, it is extremely downgraded in the numbers department. You can literally have all heavy armor on, best defense stats on, and a more than decent dps, you will still be killed in 2-3 hits from 90% of the games enemies. IT IS ABSURD. 

Most of the enemies, especially in the end game, become literal sponges, take really long time to kill, while killing you in 2-3 hits. Like, I thought Sekiro was punishing, but miss one dodge here and you are dead on the spot. 

I finished the main game and wanted to go into DLC-s, but the numbers just keep getting worse. Now, EVERYTHING kills you in 2 direct hits, and bosses can easily one shot you, while you still need around two minutes to kill a basic DLC yokai. 

I really hated it and it ultimately made me quit. I REALLY wanted to keep going, cause I did really enjoy the bossfights, but this is not acceptable. If I level up, get stronger, and they still two shot me while acting like sponges, that is a no-go from me.

-Баланс урона крайне нестабилен, если качаться в хп и армор, будешь неубиваемой тумбочкой, если будешь играть через дамаг, готовься к тому, что боссы будут тебя шотать даже простыми атаками. В том же дс ты как правило мог пережить хотя-бы 3 атаки босса. Тут ты просто вата.
-Боссы почти не имеют паттернов т.е такое ощущение, что боссом управляет тот самый друг который не умеет играть в файтинги и долбит по всем кнопкам. Тебе надо будет действовать по ситуации
-Обилие выпадающего лута в котором придется порой ковыряться. Все равно ты это будешь делать в перерывах между миссиями, но если хочешь сохранять актуальность дамага и собственной выживаемости, нужно будет обновлять, зачаровывать и апать шмотки почаще.
-Три стойки для каждого вида оружия. Что для некоторых может быть сложно

Из плюсов.
-Живой геймплей. Нельзя стоять на месте, если конечно ты не под суппой.
-Приемы, дзюцу и магия прекрасно дополняет и расширяет ваш боевой стиль. Можно создать персонажа, который практически не будет вступать в ближний бой. Практически
-Хороший потенциал реиграбельности
-Практически полное отсутсвие Wiki где можно было бы заспойлерить себе что-то или скопировать имбовый giantdad билд.

I bothered to beat this game because I wanted to see the ending. I promise it isn't worth it. This game reminds me of Dark Souls 2 (the worst one) and DBZ Sagas in a bad way, especially with how it handles its enemy placement.

And no, my problem is not with the difficulty.

If you are a weeaboo who wants to roleplay a foreigner in Japan, who clearly knows nothing, but the Japanese still put up with you, this game is for you. This game is also for you if you enjoyed huffing the glue that is Dark Souls 2, and wanted more in a different flavor.

Otherwise avoid.

[h1]----Summary[/h1]
Nioh is a action RPG that allows you to make few mistakes. On paper this isn't the worst idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. You play as a white guy in Japan in the 1500s(?) learning to be a samurai. You go on a journey dubiously following Japanese history. You pick two weapons, and you level up stats that effect your character in order to enhance your playstyle.

[b]Note: I'm listing the negatives first because these really are bad enough to sour this game for me.[/b]

[h1]----Negatives[/h1]
[h3]~74 Gig Install[/h3]
This game looks really nice, but I'm not really seeing where my hard drive space is going. There are lots of reused assets throughout the levels and I'm wondering what's using all the space. The game stutters all the time too. This isn't acceptable. 

[h3]Too Many Items[/h3]
Enemies drop way too many items. You can have up to 500 pieces of equipment before you can't pick up any more, and it was often that I would have hundreds at the end of a level.

Oh and you have to pick up all this stuff manually too.

On the plus side, items are banked amrita, and you don't lose them when you die. However, rather than give me 200+ junk items with maybe 2 that are good, just give me the regular items that give me amrita.

[h3]Character Progression Feels Awful[/h3]
I'm not necessarily against having the same skeleton I fought a few levels ago hit me harder to still be a threat in a new level. I have a huge problem with that skeleton taking 2/3's of my health with the best armor available. Every enemy is like this. Getting good armor helps, but even when I do, a standard Yoki with an axe can hit me for 100% of my health if he uses the right attack. Why even have stats/armor if every enemy can 2 hit me?

[h3]Enemies Have Obnoxious Combos[/h3]
The later Dark Souls games do this too. Most enemies and bosses have combo attacks where they can add an additional swing to their combo that is designed to catch you when you go for their opening. On top of this, the bosses have some crazy tracking on their attacks.

Losing a fight you were winning because of an ""extra"" attack in a combo is trash design. It is very unfair to expect a player to know an extra swing is coming. And blocking usually isn't much better than getting hit. 

If you don't want me to exploit a combo the boss does, have the boss stop doing the combo. And I don't care that you can cheese the game with magic or whatever. Exploiting the game to ignore the garbage doesn't mean it's not there.

Anyone who defends this likes huffing glue.

[h3]Ambushes Around Every Corner[/h3]
Exploring in this game can be fun. Finding the kodamas and shortcuts are really good rewards. Unfortunately, Nioh's developers decided that the garbage enemy placement from Dark Souls 2 and DBZ Sagas was good game design.

Enemies are often hidden, so if it's your first time through a level, you need to stop moving every time you get to a corner, because there is often an enemy around one. This isn't ""being careful"". It's a tedious checklist of things you need to do at every corner. It's not fair, even if you can abuse the 3rd person camera.

Example: An archer and 1-2 enemies would be punishing on their own. So the best idea would be to get to the archer then deal with the others right? Well, on your way, there were enemies hidden in the grass. Now there are 4 enemies chasing you. There are also area traps on the way, so you need to watch out for those too, all on your first try. I am not exaggerating when I say it gets worse. I don't even want to talk about the ceiling enemies that have inconsistent agro conditions.

At some point, about 30% of the way into my playthrough, I stopped pretending it was fair and just started cheesing the enemy AI. It's not fun to have to do this several times in a level.

If you enjoy trying to take out the obnoxiously placed ranged unit, only to get one shot by an big axe enemy from behind a breakable wall as you get close to it, you enjoy chugging lead paint.

If your response is ""You should have been paying attention"": I was paying attention; to the archer, the 4 enemies I agroed, the floor trap that shoots fire arrows, and the narrow bridge leading up to the archer. I'm sorry if the wall that mostly looks like all the other walls didn't catch my eye within the 2 seconds I had to look it. On my second attempt, inspecting it showed it was clearly breakable. Too bad it had no indication there was an enemy behind it that could one shot me. Maybe the paint improves your attention when you drink it.

[h3]PVP is annoying[/h3]
There is no cooldown on when you can be invaded, so you will be constantly invaded over and over, usually in the same spot. 

Put a timer between invasions so I can actually progress the level, and stop wasting my time. Nobody playtested this.

[h1]----Positives[/h1]
[h3]Beautiful Graphics[/h3]
This game looks great. There is a lot of reuse in the game, but everything is consistent, and when it comes to the enemies I know what I'm getting into when I deal with a green guy instead of purple guy.

Still not ~74 gigs worth of graphics though.

[h3]Weapons are Distinct[/h3]
Each weapon in Nioh offers different strengths and weaknesses. You can pick two to mix and match your playstyle, and round out your offensive options.

I ended up using katanas and odachis to get range and speed, combined with a few spells for support, which worked out well enough.

[h3]Strategic Action Combat[/h3]
The stance system changes your attack animations and mastering switching between them is key to dominating your opponents. It's very satisfying to switch between Mid stance for dealing with groups, then moving to high stance when you can deal a decisive blow.

[h3]Authentic Outsider Experience[/h3]
This is going to sound weird, but I think the game does a really good job of getting that ""I feel so out of place"" feeling that the main character would likely going through. I guess that's technically immersion.

While I do know a little bit about Japanese culture, I was constantly going ""who tf is this? What is going on? What does that sign even say?"". That last one stuck with me. There is a level with secret doors, and the door you need to go through has a sign in Japanese over it. I have no idea what it says, but I took a guess that it was important and I was right. It's like I really am a white samurai guy in Japan. Especially when all the Asians look authentically Asian. You probably can't experience the game this way if you are ethnically Japanese.

Trust me, this is a positive.

[h1]----Conclusion[/h1]
While this game offers a very unique experience, the positives do not outweigh the negatives. One of the ways I judge games is ""would I play this again?"" and the answer is ""no"". I'm not interested in a New Game+ playthrough with a different weapon or maybe more magic, and I'm not interested in the sequel. The ending sure was something, but I'm unlikely to ever play this ever again.

If you like huffing glue (Read: playing Dark Souls 2) you would probably enjoy this game. Otherwise, I would avoid it. Don't pay full price at the very least.",1652538218,1652713267,False,2,2,0.418414473533630371,2,True,False,False

Don't bother with this game unless you are a controller user. This game came out in 2017 by the way. 6 years after Dark Souls, and PTTD had better MKB compat than this shit. I hope Nioh 2 is better because I really wanted to enjoy this game. Oh well.

As much as I want to continue, it's impossible to play such a reflex-based game with these control problems, lock-on being the primary issue. This is a well-known issue, by the way, first fifty results on google; no fix though in this ""complete"" edition. No UI options, controls are completely fucked inside and out. Navigating menus is frustrating and tedious, the default control scheme is so insane I couldn't even figure out a rebind that would work for it. ""K"" is dodge by default, for an example if this absolute madhouse of control. Mouse movement changes lock-on but the sensitivity is so high any input will switch your target, meaning you have to remain motionless in your right hand, the one holding a mouse, a tool designed to move. Even reflexive jerks send your lock-on to Jupiter and back.

Sure I could plug in a controller but I'd rather eat my own fingers. In short, fuck yourself if you use MKB this ain't the game for you.

My only complaint about the gameplay I could actually tolerate: Stamina drain will force your player into a stunlock animation a la MHW's ""dazed"" state.

i never had to farm a level more than 2 times and most of the time it was just dead players for gear, if ur just running through the levels to get to the boss as quick as u can like many souls players do, u deserve to cry a river and give a negative review..

this game is amazing, due to the fact its not just muscle memory and abusing boss or mobs skills patterns, boss encounters and mobs can mix things up completely with stances and some times completely change a boss fight, meaning u have to adapt on the fly and this makes repeatability great, i just completed the base story just on to divine gear at level 130 so i still have 3 expacs to do and all for £10 (on a steam sale ) fuck me the worth is insane... dont listen to any of the negative reviews that complain about game design.. honestly id even pay £40 for it, cant wait to 100% this game and buy the second one!

I'll explain what I disliked about the game below and you judge for yourself.

Hitboxes : Yea I don't know how to describe this there are times where the attacks would miss u by a cm but the game would still count it as you getting hit. The hitboxes also don't register from time to time so certain attacks that seem like it would hit you don't hit and certain attacks that are supposed to land just go straight through the enemy.

""Difficulty"" : The reason why I cannot say the game is difficult is because to kill every single normal mob you just need a big fuck all sword or a big fuck all axe and just go top stance make some distance between yourself and enemy and just heavy attack. There's 2 reasons as to why you do this, firstly if the enemy decides that they can take the damage and decide not to block you do a ton of damage, even if they decide to block that swing would take out a chunk of their stamina leaving them vulnerable to your next attack or a stab. 
The 2nd reason why I cannot say the game is difficult is because difficulty to the developers means putting an enemy behind a random wall or just hiding them around a corner so you don't expect it and get hit and die. Or making you fall from a great height due to some enemy or just pushing you off.
Except the bosses they just kill you in like 1 or 2 hits it's super unfair....

Enemies : There are 2 types of enemies in this game the monsters ( yokai ) or humans ( outlaws [ or something else idk ] ) in order to kill the outlaws it's super simple just strike before they do, or wait for them to attack and close the range with a long range melee. For most humans they get staggered when they get hit, thus just use that tool with the chain and u can combo about 8 attacks at 1 go which will shatter their block or just stun lock until they die.
The 2nd type of enemy are the yokai I don't even know where to start... Their attacks hurt like they just take a chunk out of your hp bar with 1 small attack. They don't get staggered unless you know what you are doing. [spoiler] Just high stance with an axe and aim for the horns on their head to immediately delete their stamina. For the one-eyed ones just shoot them in the eye with a bow and they'll stand around holding their eye for a bit. For skeletons you are usually able to get a hit in just press heavy attack near them before they wake up you can move slower by guarding if using a controller [/spoiler] For the bosses however you just can't block their attacks so you have to be able to dodge them and well if u dodge at the wrong time you are fucked so you have to dodge perfectly when they are attacking. 1s too fast you die to their combo of attacks 1s too slow you die from not dodging.

Level design : So during the tutorial you are asked what kind of weapon do you want to use to play the game then you get put into a dojo to practice or something after you completed the first mission. Now who in their right mind would put the tutorial after the first level... Honestly whatever right at least the tutorial is near the start. After the tutorial the first mission you embark on you find a certain weapon that is super op and just stick to it chances are it is ranged and you're probably thinking to yourself hey I kinda like this weapon maybe I should build stats towards this weapon. After you complete that level you get put into a level that fucks you if you use a ranged weapon so your only chance of hoping to not get sodomized is to use a close combat weapon so all your points are essentially spent for nothing.",1651959443,1651959443,False,2,2,0.487518638372421265,0,True,False,False

No.

It was a mistake. 

Its a typical ez boss, bs field cheap game. actually a lot of the bosses are also bs.

If you think of darksouls or sekiro buying this, dont buy it cuz its not like them. 

The devs/publishers are different too. 

I dont think they understand why darksouls and sekiro has such high reputations. 

Just dont, maybe my money isnt wasted that much, but my time was a waste with this game.



For people that needs elaboration, 

this game is nothing like Darksouls or Sekiro.

The reason those games are fun is because, its fair and challenging. 

There are specific mechanisms each boss does, or even some mob does in the game

that makes u think what to do and when to do it.

This game, every mob and boss just 2 hit kills you, as well as the fact that 

once you get hit first time, u get staggered so long that u are forced to get hit

all of the other combo attacks they do. 

This basically forces you to pretty much do a no hit run thru out the game,

unless you got lucky and got hit on the last combo atk or something.

This is not only the boss but even the field mobs.

Even Darksouls2 wasnt like this and I know for a fact that DS2 had debatable popularity

even among the DS fan community. 

I cleared all DS1,2,3 and Sekiro 100% achievement, minimum ng+5 

this game is nothing like them.

This game is a combination of the cheapest things you can do 

to increase the games ""difficulty"".

Basically this game feels like 

""Oh, idk how to increase the games difficulty, guess ill just 

boost the mob/boss hp, atk, defense insanely high""

lazy job. 

I'm not saying its impossible to clear. I dont die much each mission 

and I am still clearing the game.

I'm just saying is this fun? no.

Btw, i didnt even mention about how horrible the keys are set 

that makes you press the dodge key twice in order to ""roll dodge"".",1651638703,1651885322,False,5,3,0.42970961332321167,0,True,False,False

Early on this game can be very tough because of a sudden big spike in difficulty of mission and bosses (Hino Enma, Umi Bozu, Side mission Tachibana in particular). But after you level up, get proper gear it becomes manageable. 

Major problem with keyboard and mouse controls was fighting 2 or more enemies or waves of enemies at the same time. Camera lock on would keep changing between enemies with mouse movement and you can't do anything about it. Cannot be changed in settings  and there is no fix for that.

The gear system sounds good on paper, but is infinitely frustrating to deal with.

Felt kind of weird playing two soul type games back-to-back, but it did not disappoint. I originally played Nioh on the PS4 when it came out but sadly was unable to finish. Since I already knew the aspects of Nioh I gave it another shot. And this time I was more prepared. Not because I played the PS4 version. That did help somewhat. But because I spent so much time in Dark Souls 3. The game-play difference between the two is that one is fast pace while the other is not. Granted it took me a bit to get used to Nioh all over again. But once I completed the first region it just felt like second nature to me. Granted I did not play this game with Keyboard and Mouse. I found it better to play with an Xbox controller just like I did Dark Souls 3. I had no issue with the controls and the game play felt great. Yes there are things in the game that I call Bulls*** on that made no sense. Some mechanics didn't seem like they were clicking like they should. Others felt either under or overpowered depending on how you leveled your character. But I still enjoyed the hell out of this game. 

I know I'm late to the game on getting this review in, and since I haven't played Elden Ring yet that is next on my list. But anyone who has played a Souls game will definitely enjoy Nioh. I look forward to playing Nioh 2 and seeing what kind of mayhem I can cause. I read about the improvements that Nioh one lacked. But honestly I just straight up ignored them as I enjoyed both the game play and the story. Also the DLC was dope. Granted the second and third were a bit short. But the first sold it for me and I didn't let it bother me.

Combat is swift and responsive. Character customization is plentiful, cosmetically and otherwise. The difficulty is just right - starting out brutally difficult with a few crutches you can use to make progress when stuck (co-op, Living Weapon, Sloth and other powerful Onmyo Magic) - before easing into a never-too-easy, never-impossible state for the rest of the game. Even after completion, the game has four additional 'new game plus' playthroughs that are tougher, yet continue to introduce entire mechanics instead of just being a slightly increased challenge. You can refine your skills and character build immensely through the harder playthroughs, while breezing through them quickly if you don't want to 100% the game five separate times.

Bonus points to Nioh and its sequel for having the best co-op I've seen in any recent game, allowing two players to make progress through the story simultaneously, or drop in to help each other out as needed. The majority of the game is playable cooperatively, barring the prologue, and a few 1v1 duels and sidequests through the game. I've had a blast playing Nioh with friends, and dropping in to help random players as well.

It's worth noting that Nioh 2 is better still, balancing things out a little better and improving nearly all aspects of the game somewhat (though I miss the overwhelming power of Nioh's Living Weapon mechanic, going into the sequel). Both are absolute 10/10 games for fans of the Dark Souls series, and challenging action RPGs in general. I feel they stand at the top of their genre and it's a disservice that such unique, wonderfully made games live in the shadow of Dark Souls. Both are excellent franchises, but I often found myself enjoying Nioh a hell of a lot more, and feel that it deserves far more credit than it gets.

If Nioh or its sequel seem remotely enjoyable to you, I can't recommend strongly enough that you pick them up, even if you wait for a sale.

At the very least in Sekiro, you had to take more than 1 hit to die, and respawned once; not to mention healing was at least replenished after each death. I don't know what's in the mind of developers when they just insert insta-death and call it ""hard"". Hard are well thought bosses that are fun to fight against. 

Who did it right? Cuphead. Every death feels fair, and you know exactly how much damage you take from each hit: one hp chunk. Here you have to literally take ONE hit to either die, or be stunlocked to be hit by another attack and die anyway. Combos are not fun to play against in single-player games; it adds nothing to the game, has no counter mechanic other than ""don't get hit"", and feels unfair to be punished by death for literally ONE mistake.

Armour is at best, a stat-stick, and at worst, a fashion statement. Heavy and to an extent medium armour are USELESS, there's literally no reason for them to be in the game. You take 95% of your hp bar if you take one boss hit wearing nothing but your underoos, and 85% of your hp bar if you're wearing all of the iron there is in Japan on your person; the mitigation is so laughably pathetic, there's no reason to wear anything but light.

Game tries to do a lot, but in reality, only one game style is viable, and it's to be light and slowly chip away at the enemy's hp, 1-2 hits at a time, then kite until there's a safe opening again.

Well I played Nioh before trying the Souls series. I saw some people saying that this is harder than FromSoftware's games but it didn't convince me to stop buying it. I just wanted a rough challenge and after being harassed and bullied for about 10-15 hours by kreeps and dying on the first boss for 30 times, I just learned how to play Nioh. In my last review I said that its bosses are balanced. I swear to god I take it back. after playing 6 or 7 other souls-like games (DS1-3-Elden Ring included) I should say Nioh had the most unfair and unbalanced bosses and its incredibly difficult. However the difficulty is not the reason I'm giving it a thumbs down (I already knew its gonna be a hard game). I wrote my reason in the last paragraph.

What this game did to me:
Despite of not finishing this game, it made me a tough fighter for rest of my soulsborne experience! Just finished DS1 with 1st/2nd trying all the last 5 bosses of the game. Killed every single DS3 boss and 1st tried its hardest ranked boss (nameless king). And today I just killed Elden Ring's (and FS's) most unfair and unbalanced boss. I will never forget the Nioh as the (still) my hardest challenge in video games.


NOTE: This is my review before playing Dark Souls series. 

[spoiler] One of my favorite RPG games of all time. Maybe the top 3. Combat system is addictive AF and looting as well. Great boss fights that are balanced if you gear up for them. 
I agree that the keymap and keyboard HUD are TERRIBLE! But you just have to get used to it, or use a gamepad. No other ways. After about 4-5 hours you'll get used to play it with KB/M.
People claim that this game is harder than souls series. I cant tell if they're right because the only time I played souls games goes back to 2015 and I failed 100 time in first Dark Souls 2 boss, and uninstalled the game.
So in my opinion this game is hard, especially for souls players because they're trying to handle it like they do in souls games. You can't. Sure it looks like souls but it's way different. You have to play it in Nioh way not souls way. [/spoiler]

Update: Okay despite of terrible KB/M binding, I gave this game a thumbs up until I had to deal with two bosses at the same time and my locked target was switching with the smallest mouse movements that made it impossible to play trough it. So I was forced to summon a visitor for the first time to beat them. I guess it's better to avoid playing with KB/M if you are good at using controller.",1606394023,1647286852,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
485510,112145440,76561197970740888,0,38,4231,0,3051,1647716424,"It's Dark Souls on the surface, but the comparisons are pretty thin when you dive into it. Rather than a single gigantic sprawling maze, Nioh has a much more narrative driven approach, and is separated into individual levels/missions, where each has the classic 'opening more looping paths back to earlier areas' stuff that you would find in Dark Souls, which can take about 20-60 minutes to fully explore and complete a single mission, so think of each mission like an entire 'dungeon wing' of a Dark Souls game. It feels great. Each is tightly packed with intentionally designed encounters, booby traps, ambushes, mysteries, secrets and surprises.

As for the rest of the gameplay, Nioh has much more action-oriented/twitchy and deeper combat system as opposed to Dark Souls' more lumbering and methodical gameplay. Even the slowest weapons have a 'fast mode' (Low Stance), and each stance has a particular benefit like using High Stance to perform attacks on enemies with weak spots on their head, Mid Stance to deal large sweeping attacks to handle larger groups, Low Stance for quicker precision strikes. Combine a bunch of different weapon options with solid RPG statistics/mechanics along with a Diablo-style loot system and you've got a real winner. The sheer 'bullshit randomness' that you normally deal with in a Diablo-style system intersects incredibly well with the 'defeat the corpses left behind by other players and take their shit' mechanic, so you can essentially share in the great loot that your fellow players have discovered. It's fun to farm the corpses of your fellow players and upgrade your gear through the stuff you 'steal' (clone). 

You'll struggle at first, particularly the very first boss who can absolutely annihilate you in a couple of hits, but if you take the time to learn the game's mechanics (hint: stick with Low Stance for bosses to keep yourself agile and responsive, so until you learn their attacks - don't pick High Stance or you'll just be an easy kill), over time you'll gradually learn the weaknesses of your enemies, to the point that they start to become trivial, until they start throwing more and more curveballs at you to keep you on your toes. Meanwhile your character power grows with more techniques for your favorite weapon(s), and branching out to the Onmoyo Magic and Ninja skill trees to keep your own side of the equation fresh and interesting. Eventually you'll start wrecking everything on the way to the final boss of the story.

Once you're done with that, they *REALLY* dial up the difficulty, making sure you weren't just sleep-walking through the game, and at this point you can either stop, having concluded the narrative, or test your mettle against some really challenging fights.

TL;DR: Love it. Doesn't waste my time with aimless wandering, has plenty of secrets that are reasonably discoverable (i.e. none of this 'indistinguishable hidden walls' bullcrap that require you to hit EVERY wall just to make sure you didn't miss anything - Nioh's hidden walls have a little more ... personality to them), great combat, love the inventory system, not the best PC controls porting (it still shows X-box buttons, so you have to do a mental mapping to the actual keyboard key, but I found stance-switching with specific hotkeys a hell of a lot more fluid on KBM than a Controller), but once you get the hang of it, its just an absolute blast to play. Can't recommend this game enough to someone who wants a more casual-friendly Souls-like that won't hesitate to challenge you and give you opportunities to excel.",1647216693,1647216693,True,3,0,0.533608496189117432,0,True,False,False

A couple things could make it better.

Too much time wasted doing inventory management. There is no need to give the player so many junk items. Need more games that deal with inventory like the Batman Arkham series. The player has core items that they can upgrade, instead of just dumping 1000s of useless items on the player (which has become very popular for some reason).

Respec is too cumbersome. The only option is to undo everything and redistribute all of the points on your various skill trees and attributes. A better system would allow the player to redistribute their points as often as they like while in the ""start"" area, simply by subtracting points where they choose then adding those points someplace else.

I would prefer games like this had robust difficulty settings. I enjoy the difficulty, but games should be more approachable to various people. by robust settings I mean, more than just a easy/normal/hard (which this games not not have). This game could have had different settings for damage done, damage received, ki cost, jitsu slots available, etc.

---------- Pros ----------
1. Enemy Stamina system or Posture if reach 0 enemy temporary can't move and valuable for heavy attack even Boss react to your attack which more unique than Dark Soul
2. Best sword play or other weapons play of all Souls-Like game
3. Guardian Spirit which give you passive stats and Active to increase elemental damage to weapon + Extra Full HP Bar prevent death from boss fight if use at the right time
4. ""Magic"" or ""Item"" buff and Debuff are amazing you can even use them to Boss (Sloth magic is the best to kill all Bosses)
5. Healing potion can drop from common enemy
6. Item Craft is easy and effective but you don't even need to because drop item already good
7. Elemental Damage and Status effect on player weapon is Amazing
8. Bow or Rifle gun is effective 1 headshot kill common enemy and ""can stun Bosses""
9. AI change their attack on your move sometimes they continue attack if you are too close
10. Stamina ( Ki ) can immediately recovery during the fight if you press button in time
11. Most Bosses attack can just block because it only take you few stamina, you don't need to dodge like Dark Souls
---------- Cons ----------
1. Too many instant kill trap every corner of all maps
2. Unfair enemy spawn point,some even have 2 Elite enemy or more that strong like Boss (Raven Tengu for example) come with skeleton army or floating elemental skull monster
3. FPS fixed under 60
4. First 2 bosses after Onryoki is too strong because they have extremely high HP and
Elemental Damage + Status effect even harder than the late game bosses
5. Most player might stop playing Nioh at the second boss ""Hino-Enma"" because it's too hard for new player at early game, paralytic resist or antiparalytic needle requaired
6. ""Nue"" is the most annoying early game boss if you don't use easy win small house tactics which protect you 100% of the lightning

So yeah in first i want to review that Elden Ring brought some new improvements into the Souls-Like gameplay, now we got postures that allow you to play in different playstyles for each weapon, so now you can get oneshoted by a single slime in 3 different postures, pretty sick ngl. 

You know in the ER trailer you had somewhat of a horse or something, but yeah that was just kinda of a clickbait, in the actual game you just run thru enemies, also the trailer showed a pretty girl, but it's really different in the game, she kinda fights and oneshots you later in the game, still pretty hot ngl i like her a lot. I guess she's my maiden or something idk.

Would give dung balls to the dung eater again.

Seriously now. Picked it up 'cause I was craving a difficult / challenging game and it thoroughly delivered - without having large difficulty spikes or obnoxious enemy mechanics. My view is that Nioh rewards patience and a more tactical approach (since you can easily die in 2-3 hits). This is in contrast with Dark Souls in which you can sometimes just ignore the boss' patterns in order to tank the hits and heal. In terms of toughness, it's easier than Sekiro but harder than Hollow Knight. Fair warning though: the 3rd boss will be the hardest you'll face in Nioh for quite some time. I think it's there like Genichiro is in Sekiro: to be sure you have attained a certain degree of mastery before moving forward.

If you do decide to pick up the game, here are some suggestions / observations that might be useful:
- there is an extensive albeit optional tutorial; you may want to do it in order to know your options before engaging an enemy;
- the checkpoints (shrines) are relatively close to the area's boss; some are hidden by mimics, some need to be dropped down to or need a shortcut opened;
- health potions (elixirs) work like this: you start with a base amount in the region you are currently in; you can increase the base amount by finding little green spirits (kodamas) throughout the missions; elixirs can also drop from enemies;
- you will be bombarded by a lot of items; my personal take on this is don't worry about them; I changed my gear every 10 levels and disassembled the rest at the blacksmith; you'll need the materials for endgame crafting;
- there are a lot of ways to defeat your adversaries like different weapon stances, skills or active items; know that if you find these too tedious to learn you can simply use mid stance and the same type of weapon from the start of the game;

However, allow me to ease your pain a lot with 4 crucial tips:
Tip 1: Get a special stat called ""enemies sense"" to detect enemies near you. Stop and look up, left or right or sometimes near the edge of the cliff and prepare to dodge pass or use bow to shot them down. Some part of the missions may require you to snipe enemies from far to make your journey less annoying.

Tip 2: Spend 1 hour or so configuring the mapping of keys to your keyboard to your comfort and fight some mobs to get used to control.

Tip 3: Do not rush the mission at early game. You may find a checkpoint with a few yokais nearby, farm them and level up a bit more so you won't die too much.

Tip 4: Learn to use ninjitsu weapons like kurenai and shurikens. They are useful for clearing strong mobs that appear from the black fog.

Nioh is a game that rewards intelligent movement and precise execution. It shares similarities with the Dark Souls Series but ultimately stands on it's own two feet with great combat and challenge.
if you are looking for another Dark souls game with methodical slow paced combat and preset weapon stats you will not find that here, regardless this is an amazing experience for the person wishing for a new way to scratch that Souls itch.

[h1] Combat [/h1]

Nioh's combat is much more fast and frenetic then the Souls genre is used to, it features a stance system wherein you can switch to largely different movesets with very different playstyles.
[b] The first is Low, [/b] a stance that deals low damage but has fast attacks that is more lenient when is comes to forgiving overaggressive play, it has a low stamina cost but you have to put a lot more time and commitment if you want to deal with your opponent, and that comes with a big risk playing so aggressively.
[b] The second is Medium, [/b] a stance that strikes a middle ground between the first and third stance with middling speed and stamina cost, this is the most forgiving playstyle that one can use and is also the easiest, you do have to better place your attacks in order not to get punished, which is Low's strong suit.
[b] The final and third stance is High, [/b] a stance that has a very rewarding but very risky playstyle, that has great damage, but an equally great stamina cost, this is also the slowest of the stances so if you place your hit in a position that leaves you vulnerable to enemy attacks, you are very likely to be punished, you also need restraint to play with High stance, if you throw out attacks you will have no stamina and you are a sitting duck, don't even think about blocking, that leads me to.
[b] The Defence [/b]
There is your usual dodge with I-Frames but it also depends on stance, Low being a quick step, Medium similar to Low but a bit longer, and High with a full roll that if done wrong leaves you open. but there is also blocking, now it is not unreasonable to think of the block as another feature that isn't largely useful but if you can utilise it correctly it can save your skin, Defending via block takes a powerful amount of stamina to preform but it leaves little to no chip damage onto your character making it in the right situations an amazing last ditch effort, the problem lies in where to use it, if the attack blocked takes more stamina then you posses the next and most important element of combat arises.
[b] Stamina and Ripostes [/b]
Once your stamina is past the threshold you will be panting completely immobilised for around 3-4 seconds, during this time any attack that hits you deals increased damage, and if you fighting a humanoid opponent they can preform a riposte on you dealing huge damage, to avoid losing stamina you can use the Ki pulse mechanic. When stamina is lost part of the stamina bar is red where you lost said stamina, if preforming not attacks, dodges or actions that take stamina, your stamina will recover, however you can expedite this process by using the Ki pulse, a white bar will envelop the red one much faster than the green stamina and when the white has fully covered the red you can press a button to Ki pulse instantly recovering your stamina, now with the stamina meter, you will notice that the enemies you fight also posses a stamina meter, green like yours for humanoids and purple for Yokai/Demons, if you drain their stamina you can preform a riposte of you own on a humanoid, likely killing them with the attack, but Yokai posses the purple meter which can only be recovered by Yokai realm visualised by a translucent pool on the ground (this can be dispelled by using a Ki pulse in or close to the pool) if you drain their stamina, they will leave themselves vulnerable for a good while letting you deal great damage to them, this mostly covers the combat in Nioh besides the mention that this game features a skill tree that allows you to combo attacks together depending on your stance and gives you all new options like a parry on humanoid enemy that deals large stamina damage and so on. Next topic is where the game might struggle on certain aspects depending on your viewpoint.

[h1] Level Design [/h1]
On a shorter note, the levels in Nioh have tight corridors with very packed level design, it leaves little for believability, the areas can also be very confusing but otherwise I personally believe that this works in Nioh's favour and if you have played the areas before you can easily navigate through them again, level design does get increasingly confusing in the later stages of the game but it is still tolerable. The next and last topic will be the most controversial and largely depends if you will enjoy this game or not. 

[h1] Loot and Rewards [/h1]
Nioh has a random loot system, meaning that the quality of the items you get can vary largely from eachother, this is very similar to Diablo, where it has random stat increases like increased life, run speed and stamina when using select stance, you will still get different armors depending on how far you are in the game and what level you are, even select armors used by bosses or NPCs have set bonuses that are unique to them, this goes the same with weapons, now the compromise to using this type of loot system is you will have to filter through a lot of menus dumping and selling old items that just are useful anymore, you can hold 500 items on your character and that fills up in the span of 2 or 3 main missions so you do have a lot to go through, this can ruin a majority of player experiences because they don't want to filter through menus, it does become easier as time goes on and you don't have to do it as much in the new game plus because of loot quality, rarity goes from white to yellow to blue to purple and eventually to [spoiler] green [/spoiler] each rarity adds another slot for random stat boosts, and that is the loot system in Nioh as a whole.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Nioh will reward you with a satisfactory experience if you put in the time and effort but getting there can be challenging, there is 4 extra new game plus that change enemy spawns and there is also a boss rush mode that has a whopping 999 floors so there is plenty of road after the finish line and the base game is already very long so you will get your money's worth if you dedicate yourself to learning the game.

      The game is honestly poorly designed. This isn't to say it's not fun at times. The experimental 3 stance combat system with 7 extremely well developed weapon types (each with a skill tree that actually adds depth to each weapons original move set) can be really fun and satisfying. Especially when you fight humans who share the same movesets as you. The problem? You rarely fight humans. Instead, you're main enemies are going to be beefed up Yokai, who take forever to stagger and can 1 to 2 shot you. The later you get in the game, the more ""difficult"" the game becomes, only this game's interpretation of difficult is crank up the health and damage of every single enemy you fight to the point were if you make a single mistake you die.
      This can hardly be brushed of with a case of ""get gud"" either. I breeze through every major souls-like title that comes out. The catch is, a good souls-like game is challenging but doesn't insta-kill you the minute you mess up a single dodge timing or get stuck on a random object or get stun locked by an enemy or run out of stamina because you blocked ONE attack.

-- If you can grit your way through the game and take all of its bullshit, than maybe you'll find it entertaining if not a little repetitive. If you get frustrated at the challenge of a souls-like games that aren't brimming with artificial difficulty, than this is not the game for you.

I honestly can't recommend this game in good conscious",1644744584,1644744584,False,55,10,0.62978130578994751,0,True,False,False

There is some kind of bug where the wrong button will be pressed sometimes. I'm trying to pick up an item, but it's doing a backdash... that's an entirely separate button which I am not pressing. After 5+ seconds of trying, it might start pressing the correct button eventually.

Trying to set custom controls? You should, because the base controls make no sense and are opposite to the games they ripped off (dark souls). But if you do change them, well, now the prompts on the screen don't match up with your newly set buttons. Great.

Did you remap block to a different button? Congratulation, you can't navigate the menus easily anymore, because instead of menu navigating being tied to something like LT, it's actually tied to the block button or whatever button, so now you have to use square to navigate left and RT to navigate right. And none of the on-screen prompts reflect this. Jesus Christ.

Want to change which button is ""confirm""? Well I hope you didn't remap the X button (if that even matches your controller) because, on the remapping screen, you don't change it via the X button. You change it with whatever mystery button the X button was changed to.

And I really hope to god you don't try changing what the directional buttons do (quick bar) because then good luck navigating the controls menu at all.

Set in the 15th century of Japan, you're in control of the first caucasian samurai, William Addams - a fictional counterpart of the real one.

The story is confusing, early on, and some things are left without answers.

Why some characters acknowledge the invisible guardian spirits, and can even converse with them, while the majority of the individuals don't even know they exist? How everyone understands everyone without them even speaking the same language? Why William was locked away in prison, at the start of the game? To name a few examples, but, overall, it gets the job done and is delivered in a pretty straight-forward way. There's a minor cliffhanger in the final DLC, however.

Voice-acting is fine, for the most part, but pretty generic and forgettable, overall. Only two characters sound memorable enough. One is Mr. Nekomata. You will know him when you see him. And the other, which is a spoiler, is voiced by Kou Shibusawa himself (the Big Boss of Koei).

William, however, barely talks. 
He's that badass lone wolf who managed to find his tribe but still acts as if he's the only one left in the world to fend for himself. Secretly cares about those who care about him, yes, but keeps them at arms length. A man of action and of few words, focused on goals. He has much in common with the likes of Wolverine and John Wick. One of the supporting characters is awesome and he's the embodiment of what a true friend is supposed to be.

The soundtrack is available only in cut-scenes and boss battles - much like the games from the Souls series - and they're pretty dope. Especially the main track of the game. It will live, rent-free, inside your head for a long time.

Bear in mind that repetition is a motto. The game, from beggining to end, has more than 100 missions but most of them are just copies of one another. You will find yourself facing the same types of enemies - even bosses - LOTS of times. 

What sets it apart from Dark Souls, though? 

Nioh is fast paced, for starters, and unforgiving in every sense of the word. It relies entirely on player skill. If you can't learn how to manage your stamina, how to dodge and what spell to use before a boss battle you'll die in a matter of mere seconds. It has plenty of artificial difficulty built in just because. You can learn the patterns of Dark Souls' bosses just fine by getting killed over and over but Nioh wrecks you with a blink of an eye. It doesn't leave any room to learn by trying. You have to get it right sometimes by the first time.

Also, different from Dark Souls, in Nioh you will only lose one, of the three currencies available to you, upon death. Money is money. Experience is experience. Period. 

Unforgiving as it is, the game still provides all the means to win. You can summon a guardian spirit anytime your power gauge - the ""Amrita"" (a precious stone which happens to be the main core - and bane - of the entire story) bar - is full. It boosts your attacks and leave you with infinite health for a couple of seconds - the ""Living Weapon"" feature. And sometimes a couple of seconds is just all you need to beat a boss. 

The Borderlands part - most say it's close to Diablo - has it's roots on the items. Nioh has RPG elements, afterall. It will give tons upon tons of weapons, armours and accessories ALL the time, pretty damn often, which can be REALLY overwhelming, at first, but they, too, help you. Not exactly by equiping them, however. 

Since Nioh relies on player skill thanks to it's shitty one-hit kill mechanics (you can cheese, later on, though, fear not) your gear hardly matters for the majority of your playthrough, anyway. Equipment you don't want can be offered to shrines - checkpoints - for experience. You can also sell them or turn them into scrap to create other items but it ain't worth it.

Multiplayer is a bit different and the co-op feature is, to date, the best of all the games that I played. 

You can find ""blood pools"" i.e. revenants of dead players and summon them for a battle but you can't summon NPC's to help you. They're few and far between, fixed in some side-missions. 

Revenants drop the gear the dead player wore, after being banished and a currency called Glory, which helps your clan - a feature unlocked after the first area of the game.

There are more than 30 clans and they provide a set of passive bonuses such as increased damage, increased luck, etc. Joining a clan provides other rewards as well, such as the ability to buy rare items and even character skins. The clans act more like leaderboards than anything else, though. It's dog eat dog.

Co-op can deliver plenty of fun moments but, unfortunately, you will have a hard time finding people to play with.

You can summon players at shrines and, since nobody can drop gear, you won't have to worry about hackers fucking up your save file. Awesome.

The tiny number of players that I managed to find for co-op were very helpful, overall. The community, despite being low on numbers, has a sense of ""unity"" rarely found in other games.

PvP is worse, though, when it comes to both the number of available players and hackers. Fortunately it's all optional. You access PvP through an arena, separated from the main game. No point in trying.

To sum it up, Nioh is far from perfect. It has plenty of bullshit but it's a blast to play. If you can soldier through the first missions, which can be detrimental to your entire health - and in several ways - you'll find an experience unlike many.

I think the combat is satisfying, the customization is incredibly diverse, and that the enemy/boss design is inspired. That being said, this version does have issues. In order to get this game to properly function, I had to go into my graphics card settings to make it playable, so I gotta say that this isn't a very good port. But once the issue is resolved, this game is fun as hell to play.

This praise comes at a warning though to new players. This game's progression system is deep. It has more than any normal player can remember and consistently stay on top of. There were multiple times I stumbled upon a screen that gave in-game buffs with a ton of available points that were a bit out of the way to find. So I would recommend thoroughly exploring the menus both in and out of the playable areas.

However, even if you stay on top of everything the game has to offer, this is still a souls-like game. It's hard and requires learning the combat mechanics. But, I must say that the fact it's souls-like is very surface level. From my experience in the Dark Souls series, it's difficult, but the game provides a lot of avenues if you mess up and get hit. That's not the case with this game. Every enemy hits like a truck and some honestly have the capacity to one-hit kill you instantly. You don't upgrade your armor to be a tank. You upgrade it to reduce the number of enemies that can one-shot you, which is a number that has never gone to zero in my experience. While I feel this is a great way to convey to the player on the type of combat that is necessary to succeed, I can definitely see this being frustrating to people.

GAME OVER.”
~[i]Friday the 13th (NES game)[/i][/h1]

In [b]2009[/b], [b]Hidetaka Miyazaki[/b] and [b]FromSoftware[/b] released a game called [b]Demon's Souls[/b]. We all know what happened next. [b]Demon's Souls[/b] became worldwide phenomenon and spawned tons of clones and successors. And you know what? I totally don't understand why exactly did that happen. I mean, it's not like I don't understand why people enjoy [b]Souls[/b]-like games, it's just I don't understand what exactly happened in [b]2009[/b]. Because [b]FromSoftware[/b]? The guys were making such games since their very beginning. Their first game was [b]King's Field[/b], which was, like, the father of [b]Souls[/b] series, and not only [b]FromSoftware[/b] made four of those, they've also created spiritual successors [b]Shadow Tower[/b], [b]Shadow Tower: Abyss[/b] and [b]Eternal Ring[/b], which also contributed to what we've got in [b]Demon's Souls[/b].

And yet, nobody really cared about those. Not until [b]2009[/b]. So, seriously, why? Was it because [b]PS3[/b] didn't have enough exclusives at that point? Was it because press finally understood [b]FromSoftware[/b] and started to give it enough spotlight? Was it because players grew tired of our usual “Press [b]X[/b] to win” [b]AAA[/b] titles and started to look for some challenge? Honestly, I don't know. But one way or another, [b]Demon's Souls[/b] became a huge hit. And when there's a huge hit... let's just say that [b]Demon's Souls[/b] made me feel like we were back in [b]90s[/b], when every major success used to mean loads of copycats. And the funniest thing? It never stopped. [b]Souls[/b] craze is still going up to this day. Seriously, it's like every second new game that doesn't suck butt is [b]Souls[/b]-like something. So... surprise-surprise. Here comes another one of those.

This time it's a game from [b]Team NINJA[/b] ([b]Dead or Alive[/b], [b]Ninja Gaiden 2004[/b]+) and [b]Kou Shibusawa[/b] ([b]Nobunaga's Ambition[/b], [b]Romance of the Three Kingdoms[/b]). And since both are the divisions of [b]KOEI TECMO[/b], you can easily guess what kind of setting we've got here. Naturally, it's Feudal Japan. The last year of Azuchi–Momoyama jidai ([b]1600[/b]) to be precise, the final phase of Sengoku jidai ([b]1467[/b] – [b]1615[/b]), AKA Warring States period, which is, like, the most popular motif for historical games that take place in Japan. And you can clearly see the reason for that, since Sengoku jidai means a never-ending civil war, samurai, shinobi (ninja), ambitions, intrigues, honor and a lot of blood. It was all Sengoku jidai.

Sure, you may say that video game review is not a place for history lesson, but you know what? In this exact case it is. Just because, like with many other games from [b]KOEI TECMO[/b], knowing the basics of Japanese history helps [i]a lot[/i]. See, [b]Nioh[/b] won't bother introducing you to every single historical figure. And without knowing who's who and why in the name of sacred [b]Pikachu[/b] do they fight each other? You'll miss a lot of charm and maybe even end up being somewhat confused. It's not like playing [b]Nioh[/b] as just another [b]Souls[/b]-like game is a no-no, but still... you know what I mean. Part of the charm is how [b]KT[/b] treated the historical figures here. And you know what? Knowing Japanese folklore is a very important thing here too. Because that's exactly what we've got. Fictionalized Sengoku jidai  mixed with Japanese folklore (loads of yōkai here, make sure to bring [b]Book of Friends[/b] with you) and [b]William Adams[/b] as the main character. Yes, [i]the[/i] [b]William Adams[/b]. AKA [b]Miura Anjin[/b] (pilot of Miura), who was the first Englishman to reach Japan. Like I said, history. Part of the charm.

But enough about history. The setting, the atmosphere and all of those juicy details are cool, but those are not the main reason why we play games, right? What about gameplay? Well... No, stop. I know what you're thinking. When I say “well”, usually, it means something bad. But not this time. It's just... when you speak about pure [b]Souls[/b]-like games, there isn't much to say, really. I mean, sure, there are tons and tons of differences here, but actually learning about them will be interesting only for hardcore [b]Souls[/b] fans. And what's the point of that, since it's pretty obvious that [b]Souls[/b] fans would buy this game anyway without even reading much about it? And as for casual players... let's just say it's a [b]Souls[/b] game with samurai, OK? That's pretty much everything you [i]really[/i] need to know before making a decision. Feels good, though. I mean, mixing [b]Souls[/b] concept with samurai ended up being surprisingly satisfying experience. Even [b]FromSoftware[/b] themselves will do that a few years later in their [b]Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice[/b]. So, funny question – who did samurai thing first? [b]KT[/b]? Sure, but [b]FromSoftware[/b] already tried something like that in their [b]Yoshitsune Eiyūden: The Story of Hero Yoshitsune[/b]. [b]FromSoftware[/b]? But guess what? Their [b]Yoshitsune Eiyūden[/b] felt more like their take on [b]KT[/b]'s [b]Shin Sangokumusō[/b] ([b]Dynasty Warriors[/b])... So, let's just say that these two have a long history of copying each other and return to [b]Nioh[/b].

Now, here come two questions. First – how's it doing as a [b]Souls[/b]-like title and should people who suck at [b]Souls[/b] games pick it up? The second question is actually pretty easy to answer – no. Despite all the minor differences, in its core, [b]Nioh[/b] is still a [b]100% Souls[/b]-like title. You have no skill in such games – the very first enemy you'll meet will kill you with only a couple of hits. Yes, that poor-looking sucker who looks like our usual tutorial guy. And you'll be like “[i]say wha-a-a...[/i]”. That's just how [b]Souls[/b] games work. You either like it, or forget about such games entirely. There's no casual way to enjoy such stuff. You want to experience similar concept with more casual approach? Go for [b]Jedi: Fallen Order[/b]. Here? It's a pure hardcore. Everything you loved / hated in [b]Souls[/b] games is here. Shortcuts-oriented levels, the parts, in which enemies will make you fall to your death, poison, losing things, WTF-like bosses, etc. Keep that in mind.

As for the first question... well, the level design is way more dumb here. And it's hard not to notice, especially since the game is divided by missions now, which gives it slight [b]Monster Hunter[/b] aftertaste. Some people would like such an approach (it sure fits the setting with all its swordsmanship), but the others would miss complicated and confusing environment from the original [b]Souls[/b]. The combat offers us some rifles and no, those won't feel like [b]Bloodborne[/b] rip-off. Those will be as tricky as our usual secondary stuff in [b]Souls[/b] (up to this day, I can't master the freakin' shields), but unlike [b]Bloodborne[/b], you won't need those for parrying. You'll just need to learn how to aim fast in order to do miracles. For melee weapons there'll three different stances (which, again, fit the setting perfectly), while you'll also be able to summon so-called [b]Guardian Spirits[/b]. Which will provide you with buffs. You'll get more of those on the way (because you know, gotta catch 'em all and stuff like that), but yes, you'll lose them when you'll die. And yes, “when”. Not “if”.

So... that's it. That's [b]Nioh[/b] for you. A [b]KT[/b]'s take on [b]FromSoftware[/b]'s [b]Souls[/b] franchise. Incredibly charming, with tons of references to both history and folklore, very smart in many aspects, but ultimately, yet another game only [b]Souls[/b] fans would be able to enjoy. It's a game every [b]Souls[/b] fan should have, especially those who enjoy Japanese historical fiction, but for the rest of us it'll be very unfriendly without being able to offer enough motivation to keep going until the very end.

 There are only a few games in my catalog that i've had the displessure of dropping. Nioh is one of these games. I am a very big fan of souls and souls-like games, i've played and beat every Fromsoft title, played various souls clones like The Surge series, code vein, etc., and I heard that Nioh is one of the best souls-like games and that it could compete with Dark Souls. I thought I'd try it, and after 21 hours, I decided to drop it. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Nioh has the uniqueness of having 3 different stances for each weapon class: a fast low stance that does less damage but can dash fast and many times; a high stance with slow, powerful attacks, and slow ""fat rolls;"" a mid stance that does not have the hardest hitting attacks, but not the weakest, and not fast but not slow- a true in-between of high and low stance. Nioh also has combos for varying weapon classes that you unlock with level ups, some combos that you unlock are bound to the same combinations as previous ones youve unlocked, so you'll have to choose between whichever combo you like best. Oh and you have to farm your healing items.
If you're here for a souls-like game like I was, then turn away now. The only resemblance to a Souls game is a level up mechanic, and enemies respawn at checkpoints. That's it. 

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
I love the theme that Nioh goes for, as long as you can see the details around and you're not in a dark cave, or in a town at night, or if its raining at night. 

[h1] DIfficulty [/h1]
This is my major gripe about this game. When entering the tutorial, you'll notice that the very first enemy you encounter, a guard, will do 1/3 of your health. This is a common theme with this game. Every single enemy, no matter how high you level up or how strong you think your armor is, will do at least one third of your health, bigger enemies will just 1-hit KO you. If a smaller enemy does not kill you, then his follow up unreactionable combo will finish you off. [i] This is not fun. [/i] On top of having limited amounts of healing items, which you can only get as rare drops, you can only carry 8, increased to 11 with a level up that you have to go out of your way to unlock. The third boss you will fight has instant paralysis to most of her attacks that she spams, and the only way to get out of it is through anti paralysis items that dont drop from the enemies around the arena, you can only find 8 around the entire area, can only carry 3 or 4 at a time, and if you dont kill her and her enormous health pool, you'll be subject to dying over, and over, and over, and over again. Before any Nioh stans also try to argue, yes there are replenishable onmyo magic anti paralysis items, but again, youd have to know that that ability exists, unlock it, equip it, remember to put it on before the fight and pray that you beat her before the effect runs out. All for the third boss of the game.

[h1] Level Design [/h1] 
Apart from having to go back to the same map 3 or 4 times to finish all the missions, the level design is pretty bad. It's unfair ganks, traps, and enemy positions galore. In Dark Souls, you can find a rat hidden in a box that comes out and attacks you, does a miniscule amount of health, and dies after one shot. Nioh does this same thing, but instead puts a Wheelmonk Yokai in a box that explodes when you get near it, and kills you in one shot. If it doesnt kill you in one shot itll send you flying to the bottom of the area because you fight it on a 3 foot wide bridge. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Nioh came out around the time that people were craving more of what Fromsoft made, and Nioh was just the best of the worst. Nioh is not a good game. I thought I could power through it, but I gave up due to the unfairness, bad level design and repetitive maps. I dont recommend this game to anybody.",1641661778,1641661797,False,6,3,0.508899927139282227,0,True,False,False

It took a bit to get more familiar with it and I am still not great, but the game is really fun. Similar to the souls games you get to fully customize your equipment, magics and skills. The introduction to the high, mid and low stance is a neat and enjoyable feature of this game, that offers the player a bit of variety and strategic swordplay. The only thing that is still kind of wierd is the Ki pulse mechanic, that is really useful, but can become a burden if you forget or time it wrong. So far the gameplay has been really smooth and interesting, giving a souls fan a fresh feel for that syle of game.

Overall the game has ran just fine for me, but based on reviews was or remains very poorly optimized. I myself haven't had any issues at all, so it is highly recommended. I will update the review once I get further into the game, but I only expect my experience to be even more enjoyable after I unlock more combat options.

After beating the game and unlocking all achievements, I have to say that many of the new features for the game come in too late. Each new difficulty unlocks additional gear levels, rarity and abilities that will start to appear on equipmeent; however, by the time you start unlocking all of these things, you have finished almost all of the achievements. This wouldn't be all the big of deal, except that there is very few people playing this game, so multiplayer features feel completely dead. As far as the difficulty increase, the game becomes tedious and lame after way of the strong. Almost every enemy can kill you in one hit, and the bosses start using unblockable skills that kill you in one hit, so needless to say it starts to suck.

I will say there is one achievement that constantly gives people trouble, and it involves getting the Yata Mirror: I found mine in the twilight mission Crimson Fortress on way of the demon after farming in other areas for a while. All in all the game is really fun for the first playthrough, but gets so difficult that you can't even really do much but utilize range and thrown weapons in later difficulties without risking instant death. I do wish the multiplayer feature was still active, because the lack of it made the game feel less worth investing more time in and exploring some of the new features.

This game seems to have an interesting story and some battle mechanics like adding magic and ninjutsu. However the good things stop there.

When you get wrecked by the basic enemies 200 times in the first 2 hours, then either there is something wrong with the game or you dont play it right. However trying to give the game another chance again and again I came to the conclusion that this is the shittiest third person action rpg out there. The game does a very bad introductional phase from the start, not really explaining how things work. When you have to consider stance, skill, Ki (Stamina) but not Stamina, magic, healing, and then you end up keeping 40 things in mind during 1 normal battle then my boy you really designed this badly. 
The most basic enemies can go into Ultra Instint Goku and wreck the living shit out of you for no damn reason, and then you realised you didnt even see the boss yet. Your health is about the same as a Tofu in a zombie apocalips, getting killed from 1-2 attacks, or the enemy does an instant wombo-combo on you before you even realised its there. Bosses are as bad or even worse, getting you killed instantly with one hit. I mean at least fucking do a stagger or something, how do you expect to even gain an attack advantage?! 
The rest of the game isnt any better either. You get so much random useless loot that it makes no sense. What annoys me the most is if you want to interact with something you need to PRESS AND HOLD the button down. Why?! 

The map is divided into Missions, from which you cant even get out of once you started. Although it wont matter much, as the Blacksmith is as useless as it can be, as random lots will drop a slightly better weapon or armour anyway. 

Oh, and if I want to listen to Japanese, then I put the dub in Japanese, but if the game is in English, i dont always want to read some subtitles, especially in important scenes. I mean come on, basic logic...

I could see some potential in this game, but whoever decided that even the basic enemies can ruin your day not once, not twice, but every fucking time, then I must say, NO THANK YOU!

Some of the people who wrote a review say that you should not compare it to the Souls/Bloodborne/Sekiro franchise, but in all honesty, why not? It borrows way too much of this franchise to not be compared. Sure it adds some ""fresh"" features but that is only necessary because nobody needs a lame clone. I really like the Souls games and beat them with platin on PS4 and with its counterpart on PC. Only exception with the achievments was Sekiro. So its fair to say that I invested maybe up to 1k hours in all of those games combined. And sure those games frustrated me sometimes but not the extent Nioh is able to achieve.
That said I am going to list the most annyoing things and you can decide whether its a deal breaker for you or not.

I wont say something about the story, skipped every cutscene because I cant stand japanese :/ (wouldnt do that with every title involving japanese, but the story is really meh). So where to start? First weird thing is that almost every weapon has a stat connected to it which can be really fucked up. You used the katana and find a nice spear? Sorry dude but now you have to level a new stat or do shit damage. And dont forget about the weapon proficency which you have to level with every new weapon or when you soulmatch an already maxed weapon. The items can have a variety of attributes or perks which can be very overwhelming in the beginning. Also the game wont bother to explain crafting and defiling and whatnot in any way or from besides some useless dialoges with the blacksmith. And because the loot and the stats are very similar to diablo it never really feels good when you get a ""cool"" or good item because you will replace it within in minutes. In Diablo or similar ARPGs that works fine but not in a RPG like Nioh where you do not slaugther thousands and thousands of enemies in mere seconds. The way you acquire said items is irritating at best because almost all good items and upgrades I farmed from revenants (the corpses? of other dead players) which can drop the worn items of the dead player. Those fights are boring as fuck because you throw kunai at them until they guard and then break the guard with heavy attacks until you can grapple them (sounds funny but after 100+ of those moves you get bored). This leads to another problem which is that almost everything will two shot you. Now you say two shotting doesnt sound that bad and you could get one shotted. But listen up, the first hit will stagger you in 95% of the cases (regardless of the armor you wear) and while you are spamming the dodge button the second hit will connect and kill you. Sounds good? It feels good as well. And it gets even better. In Darks Souls or other Soulslike games you die and then you can retrieve your remains including your experience. When you die again you lose the remains but will create new remains with the experience you acquired until you died again. In Nioh that works a little bit different. When you die you create remains (in form of your guardian spirit which can be used for a very strong attack mode) but they disappear when you die a second time. After that you get your guardian spirit back but essentially you lose experience twice because on the second death wont any remains be created which could later be retrieved. That after a death the spirit is missing until you retrieve it or die again is also a questionable design choice. Like some people wrote already the enemies are damage sponges and will soak way too many hits. That paired with the fact that you fight the same models over and over again, you will never have the feeling that you grow stronger because you kill the same enemies with the same pace, even 50 hours later. The stamina aka ki system is quite interesting but the fact that your dude will get immobile (and I dont mean you cant dodge, you literally can not walk anymore until the bar has refilled to some extent) when you emptied your ki is just the icing on the cake. In Dark Souls and Bloodborne is a mechanic which is called hyper armor which means that at a certain point in the animation you can not get interrupted. This mechanic exists in Nioh as well, but only for the enemy. When you get hit during an attack you not only suffer health damage but ki damage as well. This will almost always result in an empty ki bar, an immobile character and certain death. Very entertaining, indeed. Most of the enemies, including bosses, have some absurd long and hard hitting combos which will almost always result in your death like pretty much everything in this game. Also I never sufferd so much gravity deahts in any game, but you will never see an enemy fall to death unless you push him over the edge. Now something very important: the game gets infinitly easier with the sloth talisman (which slows every movement of the enemy, including attacks). This does not mean that it will be easy but it trivializes some bosses and regular enemies (hi@raven tengu).
My last and point is directly connected to the ki system and all the certain death combos. The game does not feel fast paced but in my opion it wants to be fast paced. If you have played Sekiro, that game is fucking fast and really rewarding when it comes to the deflects and stuff. On the other hand you have Dark Souls 2 which is fucking slow. Nioh is both of those games at same time. Some of the enemies seem like they come straight out of Sekiro but the player character and his stupid ki seem to come from Dark Souls 2. This is not only a stupid but a really frustrating mix as well. This leads to the sad climax of my rant. I mentioned the recycling of enemies before and when you beat the almost final boss you will unlock an epilog. This epilog will contain one last main mission and a lot of side mission. In this side missions the game just throws two bosses on a tiny map at you. I dont mind farming but at this point its a crazy grind to beat this missions. At least you can play NG+ and still go back to NG which is the one really outstanding thing for me. So you can farm there and kick ass in NG. But this is not nearly enough to recommend this game to anybody.

I have to add one last thing which I forgot in my sleepy rage when I wrote the bulk of this. The game crashes sometimes when you start a mission. I couldnt figure out any pattern but it occured way to often to brush it off. And sometimes it had some really annoying frame drops which can be very dangerous in game where everything kills you in one hit.

If you like all the above mentioned then go ahead and buy this game. But I am done with it because it makes me angry and frustrates me to an extent which I thought would never be possible (I raided a lot in MMOs and have a lot of patience when it comes to dying and trying).",1585687822,1640106362,False,4,3,0.447220921516418457,2,True,False,False

It's the best of this genre",1572536560,1640029270,True,10,0,0.644869625568389893,0,True,False,False

As a devotee to the soulsborne universe (including DS 1,2,3, Bloodborne, Sekiro) I actually thought this would be a great souls-like at first. Im not comparing them (as if im gonna compare this garbage to a SOUL), even as a standalone game its just BAD. Idk why, this could've been a gold one it has so much potential but wasted upon those stupid, repetitive and reused trashy mechanics/maps, designs and poor writing.

Actually some of u will find it fun, heck it could be a good hack-and slash game xD. But again if u are an admirer of Soul Universe and picking this up expecting this would be a good substitute for them, Nioh wont m

Here are some reasons why it wont be worth it.
****************************************

Now for the few, maybe 6-10 hrs into the game you'll definitely appreciate it, you'll think there's gonna be some promising paths ahead. You'll finish the prologue, pick up ur gears and will come to this x country for x purpose. 

* But after few missions you'll see they've reused the same maps over and over again only changing sometimes the mission starting point or the time of the day or the weather.Also for the rest of the game u'll get tired of seeing and fighting the same enemy types (there's only a handful).

* Too many loots and practically they become useless after u got what u need. So you will, in fact have to sell/ dismantle or discard those loads of loads trash items till u stop playing Nioh.

* You'll be overwhelmed by those too many annoying options, too many confusions. Its doesn't need that much.

* Annoying mechanics.

* Nioh isn't hard, only you'll meet ur death in two shots from the enemies. There's not much to adapt since those enemy attacks are easy to read. Is that why you pick this up?

Saying this again. In many souls-like (we do say that cause they are some of the best in this genre, not to compare just to represent it) we wont get annoyed as they get harder and harder. We want to improvise, adapt, overcome. But in Nioh idk its just annoying af mid to end game, mainly 'cause of those repetitive things.",1639896287,1639925348,False,15,7,0.508641302585601807,0,True,False,False

I will put it straight: this game is a cluncky boring faceless copy of dark souls with different setup and some elements of slashers. Yes, I know you gonna say its not a copy of dark souls, its souls-like game. But lets be honest: there you have stamina (Ki), estus flask(some default medicine), souls (amita), bonfires(shrines), no jump mechanic, etc. Jesus, they even got same mobs like crystal lizard(Kappa) or Mimick (some demon who copies your character). And, I mean, its not bad to make a copy of a great game, but this is where real problems start.
If you make a copy then copy it properly.
1. Level design (probably, most important)
People really love Dark Souls not only because git gud, but also because of its level design where everything is interconnected, a lot of optional paths which can lead you to completely different places. The feeling when you have gone a long way, out of healing and dont know where s the nearest check point and... suddenly, you find a shortcut or a familiar place is just unspeakable. And thats not mentioning different location features(using torch to light up the place or flooded areas etc)
What do we have here: every single map is just a narrow corridor and whole level you just following a straight line in this corridor to the boss. There are some shortcuts to the shrines you find on your way but if there is any you know you will find it since there is always only one way through whole area and you cant miss anything. Yes, they tried adding some diversity by implementing poison in the mines or hidden walls in ninja mansion but in the end it all just ends up in a straight way from start to the area boss. There is basically nothing to explore.
2. Mob design
The number of enemy mobs in the game is utterly small. You have to fight default ""zombies"" and skeletons in every single locations. Same goes to the default yokai. They start varying a bit later and looking a bit different but they still have exactly the same attack patterns. But thats only half of the problem: it takes long time even to kill a small skeleton, much more - to kill a default yokai. And if you miss 1-2 of a basic mon attacks you are dead and have to fight your way through again and again. Every single area you are wasting crazy amout of time to fight exactly same mobs with exactly same attacks. This together with single-corridor level design makes the whole game absolutely disgusting in a sense of being just boring.
3. Bosses
Well if area mobs are garbage, maybe bosses cover for it? No. There are basically two types of bosses (same as mobs): human and yokai. Every single human boss is just a bad joke how easy it is to just block and hit him after it. You can die few times here and there missing a single  hit just cause all bosses (and some regular mobs) 1-2 shot you(that is basically the way devs were trying to make the game hard). Non-human bosses is worse part: main problem for all bosses is is completely buggy hitboxes and cluncky iframes. The game very often forces you to use blocks instead of dodges since there are tons of aoe attacks without any visible representation of area it affects. But that is not the worst part of it. Worst part is when you get hit by a boss's spear being 3 meters from it (Huge frog in ninja mansion),  or get hit by Ogress DRESS when she uses a homing jump attack or get hit by a huge skeleton foot being 5,10,20.. meters away from it  just because they decided to make a hitbox to cover the whole field (just being lazy programming or some other simplicity reason). 
Boss design, well, not going to blame, cause most bosses (if not all of them) are made acording to Japanese folklore, but Giant Centipide, Umi-bozu or giant skeleton, that is just silly...
4. Story and lore
The game tells us about 1600th Japan when battle of Sekigahara took place. Most of the characters represent real person of that time, however, all characters are extremely simple (even historical personalities): there are good guys, there are bad guys. We smash bad guys and help good guys. The only way we get to know somethig about any character is either we get a fluent impression about a person based on how his spirit looks like or some character is a boss and we get a short not-animated scenes followed by text telling us a little bit about this character's story. Thats it. The main protagonist is just a pirate, who came to Japan seeking his spirit which got stolen by another bad guy. His motivation to come to Japan could as well have been to become a pirate king or a hokage, that wouldnt affect the plot anyhow. There is nothing deep, nothing to uncover, everything just lies on a surface and at some point you can even stop care about what is happening.
5. Graphics and music
Most areas have same quiet music playing on the background. There are few different tracks for bosses but many bosses share same music and if it fits one it doesnt fit another. Overall impression lackluster.
Characters graphics is good, area graphics is mediocre. Even lacking for 2017, especially combined with monotonous level design.
To sum it up, this game is just a poorly copied Dark Souls 2 together with some poorly copied slasher game mechanics. It lacks slasher games fight colorfulness, lacks Dark Souls variety of builds, area/mob/boss/music design and storytelling.

At least all the major ones and lot's of indie ones as well but there so many indie ones probably even some i haven't heard yet so i cant say every indie one.

Here are my thoughts on Nioh.

I want to say this game is a huge souls-like wannabe. The problem is they misunderstood the whole souls-like concept (imo). Because a souls-like game (again imo) isn't only the difficulty or the bonfires (for this game it is). I love souls-like games cause they have this atmosphere. You go in and you say ok.. shit went down here. You explore further and as you discover npcs , items and bosses you start to understand the shit that went  down there and the map you saw  before starts to make more sense and this process is beautiful i love it. In Nioh things are based on some real historical events with some fictional twists from the book ""Shogun"". You dont have to explore anything. Npc's tells you everything.

This game tho..  they just cranked up the numbers so you get killed in 3 hits (tops). Missing the souls-like story telling and those gorgeous map desings. Enemies are hard because they deal sooo much damage not because they have variaty of moves hell, every enemy has 2-3 (max) moves bosses sometimes has 4.. When you think of a boss like Artorias (DS1) or Gael (DS3) this is just disappointing.

Game has a few weapon choices all has their own skill trees and 2 utility/elemental damage skill trees. Has some nice combos to weapons gonna give it that (but imo again) it doesn't matters you'll only use some basic hits if you want results because delivering a nice juicy combo takes like 2-4 seconds depending on your stance. 2-4 seconds are enough for you to die 2-4 times. You have no luxury of damage trading literally everything including the first bald human enemies which are holding potatoes are capable of killing you in 2 hits. 

For the good parts the game has amazingly fluid combat. You have 3 stances (high,med,low) which effects your damage and attack speed. Each stance has it's unique move set and you can costumize it as your liking.  You literally feel it when you hit someone. Nice effects. Very confusing but detailed builds if you're into that.

I didn't put much time to the game yet (around 70 hours) so my comments are based on early-mid game. Haven't still figured out much about builds yet. Maybe it gets better once you equip some late game stuff.

 
Still i don't recommend. The difficulty is only about numbers everything 2-3 shots you with pretty casual movesets , not some cool looking combo mixing detailed bosses only 3-4 moveset bosses. They are only bosses because they have more hp.. not saying damage because there are enemies that deals same the damage as the bosses. Level designs .. meh. 

Oh and forgot to add the worst part. It's not like any souls-like which you have the choice to explore as you like no no no... You have missions that you can select and go in. Missions have bonfires in it. You unlock regions by finishing missions but even at another region you can find exact same maps from a region before. They haven't put much effort into it. 

EDIT AFTER 147.9 HOURS:

I've putten more time to understand this game. Well after you understand the stats sets and etc. the game gets easier. After all those hours i've spent i can tell this games level design is very repetitive. It's like they have designed a map and used that map 40 times over the game with different enemies in it. Instead of new bosses and stuff they just made a level with you fighting 5 of the same bosses you killed before over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. No i've not exaggerated the ""overs"".  

Actually, there....... over and over and over and over and over and  HEARTING AGAIN! 

After more hours i still wont recommend this game.",1638172084,1639399714,False,2,0,0.489150285720825195,3,True,False,False

Player achievement for completing final mission is 21.5%, meaning only 1 out of 5 people buying this game able to see it through. 

My take-out of this game:
- boss fight is the core of this game
- it's not designed to entertain you
- makes you think hard about fight strategy & equipment
- got killed = learn something, if you don't get this equation then you will stuck
- combat mechanic is really good but not perfect, 1 or 2 bosses has annoying point of view (bosses with disappearing ability)

This game is pretty lacking in enemy variety and level design, it feels like every level is basically a bunch of mobs with skeleton warriors and yoki (whose movesets you already memorized 8 missions ago and and are just going through the motions at this point). Even though there are more than two enemy types, the game is really hesitant to use them. The boss fights are neat and always have attack patterns that leave you on your toes; stamina management is essential. Unfortunately the boss design can be a bit of a mixed bag too, and it's obvious towards the end of the game, they got really lazy. One nice thing is the ways you can customize your character feel nearly endless without being too overwhelming or even mandatory to learn.

The other complaint I would say hindered my enjoyment of the game is, even though the DLC unlocks when you beat the game, you can't really play it comfortably. Why? Because everything one-shots you since you're likely to be severely underleveled. Apparently you're supposed to go fool around in NG+ and farm enough levels until you can tackle the DLC. Well you know what? No thanks. I played a few minutes of the DLC and I see the same frigging enemies as in the base game anyways, so who cares. I seriously don't understand who would waste their time with the NG+, I mean the base game gets REALLY repetitive even during your first playthrough, so who would honestly go for more? I mean this is some kind of mental illness here. Why didn't they just instead create NG+ versions of the DLC too in case someone is overleveled? It just boggles my mind how dumb and inaccessible it is. You should just be able to go from the base game to DLC with no problem--that's how 90% of people would have played it.

 So whatever. I give it a 7.5/10, it's probably the best Souls-inspired game on the market.",1614706970,1639217640,True,0,0,0.12619464099407196,0,True,False,False

This game gets called a soulslike game for very good reason! It has a checkpoint system with ever respawning enemies just like the bonfire mechanic. It's got elixirs that get used similar to the Estus flasks. The combat is similar, the levels let you open up shortcuts and bosses will leave you banging your head against a wall from time to time.

That being said, I don't think Nioh nails what I personally like about games in general. The levels aren't worth exploring for a couple reasons. 1) I didn't pick up on much story telling through level design, and 2) loot comes from killing enemies, not so much treasure pick ups. There's still valuable loot from looting specific spots in the map but it seemed to matter considerably less that what I would have liked. Regarding the assets of each environment, it seems like the used the same handful of walls/floors/rocks for basically the whole game. Since everything is broken up into individual levels with no connected word, locations very often felt more like a 'new level' instead of a 'new part of the world to explore.'

I also thought the bosses were challenging but for pretty boring reasons? Most of my deaths during these fights came from getting 1-shotted by a combat that left me in hitstun or just straight up a single move. I like to keep my health at 75-100% when possible and I ran a tanky build too -- prioritizing body upgrades since they synergized with my Axe build. I totally understand that if I mess up I get punished but this felt excessive. Maybe I could have used my defensive options more? Maybe I didn't play aggro enough? Idk but I stopped having fun with the bosses shortly after entering the 5th environment so I quit during one of those missions.

Despite my gripes, I still had a ton of fun figuring out how to play more optimally against all the enemies! I used mostly the axe but dabbled with tonfas. I wish more enemy types were introduced but considering the weapons never have varying movesets and so do most of the 10-15 enemies you'll be fighting across the whole game, it seems like the designers are trying to emphasize optimization through repetition instead of putting players in situations where they'll need to adapt. Once again, this was a TON of fun for awhile but got stale for me personally about 30hrs in.

Still, I recommend any Souls fan or Ninja Gaiden fan try this one out! It's definitely a refreshing experience as someone who's got 500+ hours across the FromSoft games.",1639186154,1639186154,True,0,0,0.487987995147705078,0,True,False,False

So if it’s right about dlc then you have to play again all the main missions and some sub missions just for dlc .as a result if you played all ninja gaiden games and enjoyed their difficulties then you will enjoy it and if you think you want play it just feel like dark souls games no it feels not like souls-born series.,1638965547,1638965547,False,0,0,0.480698108673095703,0,True,False,False

Combat includes omni-directional quick step dodges to position and avoid attacks, blocks and parries. Also ultimate attacks after defeating enough enemies. All of the weapon types are satisfying and the magic you can unlock range from utility to hard counters to certain enemies. It's satisfying!

- Nice Ancient Japan Scenery and Outfits
- partially nice designs for enemies and characters (just the graphics, there are hardly any personalities within the entire game. Also there aren't that many different enemy designs and they mostly repeat after some time with just slight variations)

The Bad:
- Story? What Story?
- The fighting mechanics just suck! Combat is 1) run away and wait for the enemy to finish their attack 2) run in and hit a few times -> repeat. Hardly any timing required, hardly any learning curve, hardly any recognition of enemy patterns required ... just lame. Parrying is useless, drains your stamina in max two hits unless against the most basic opponents and the its just 1) hold down block button and wait for them to attack 2) hit back ... even more boring and just dump
- New Game + ... I absolutely hate that crap. Btw ethereal equipment is available earliest on NG+3 ... wow, playing through the game 3 times over just to get there ... yea, no thanks. Trying to make you play the game longer without adding any content...
- grave mechanic is just the most BS EVER! so, this game is hard alright and that's fine. It means basically (unless your some kind of superpro) you're probably gonna die a lot especially against bosses. if you die against a boss your grave will be in the boss room and you cannot retrieve it and your spirit and amrita (the stuff you use to level up) outside of the bossfight. so if you lose to the boss and wanna level up before challenging him again you simply cant without losing all the amrita you had in the bank. and if you die to some other enemy before getting to your grave you also lose all amrita you've gathered. Also, in fear of losing all amrita if you've gathered up a lot, you often rush into the boss room and directly to your grave to get it asap, you often get hit, waste some elixirs and if you die before you get to your grave its also gone. GREAT JOB!! How the F was this ever considered a good mechanic and survived any kind of playtesting? 
- if you go to the menu you can't move your character (since you're navigating the menu), but the game is still ongoing so enemies can still hit you. There is a function to pause the game, but you need to open the menu and the hit another button after it opened up. This takes about 1,5 seconds, which is A LOT in any boss fight and you might just get killed. You simply cannot quickly pause game e.g. to answer the door or the phone. Why? WTF?

-Not as much enemy variety as Dark Souls. Though there's a steady enough flow of new enemies and different versions of previous ones.

 Nioh is kind of a half-disfigured monster that has no idea of what it is, what it wants to be or what i ended up being
thanks to having very interesting system clashing into eachother on top of subpar budget assets

[b] the good: [/b]

-What the combat system tries to do is pretty good on paper; you have a bunch of different weapon types with its own attacks
combos and skills plus 3 different postures with different damage values, attack speed and movesets
and a very limiting stamina(ki) system that requires to press a button with a certain timing after every combo or attack to
get some of that sweet sweet stamina back (ki pulse)
all of this ends up making a very grounded slow and mechanical combat that requires your inputs to carry much more
intention than mere r1 spamming.

-Purification: big bad yokai leave a stinky aura that slows downs your stamina regen unless you perform a ki pulse
once inside them

-Living weapons: animal spirits you unlock which have active and passive bonuses to complement your build and can
be activated for a powered up state


[b] the neutral: [/b]

-Revenenant: it's nice to be able to fight other people's character and is a good way to farm gear fast although kind of
breaks the balance or progression, although not too much

-ARPGS: all those classic elemnts from diablo and the likes make an appearance on nioh, lot's of lvls, equipment tiers with
shiny colours, upgrades and set bonuses for such gear, etc. all those classic skinner boxes still manage to make you 
release some dopamine everytime you get something new or fancy and still clutter the rest of the game with trash gear
made to be sold or dissasemble. What's their point in a game like this? which supposedly values skill more than numbers?

[b] le bad: [/b]

-level design: ranges from decent to what the fuck is this? pretty wildly, it has no sense of flow and everything feels 
extremely square, you go from corridors to boxy rooms where you can expect to be ganked and ambushed at every turn.
levels are convoluted by design and Shortcuts seem to be there because dark souls has em although are never 
really necessary thanks to it's mission system.
This is made worse by the fact that the game repeats textures like it's going out of style which it's criminal
considering this is a 60gb game with graphics that look like a generation prior it's release if not worse.
it feels like exploring some old-school dungeon crawler in the worst of ways possible but i guess that's another
thing they took from ARPGs uh?

[u] [b] the fuck you: [/b] [/u]

-enemies: You've got  variety of enemies sprinkled in every level, some of the yokais are cool but most of them
are le generic skelly samurai, le generic spider, etc.
their worst offender and the most offending thing of nioh which robs it of it's potential is how combat with enemies works.
their animations are stiff as fuck and lack start up frames, so you tend to eat damage instantly and every hit destroys you.
ARPGs have build variety right? where if you wannt to be a tank too bad, you are barely more resistant, you regen stamina more slowly
move slowly but lose a little less stamina when blocking... great!.
they never force you to adapt and learn the combat system and all it's depth like something like sekiro might, so for instance instead
of managing range and using kusarigama's moveset to it's favor you can just dish way more damage spamming attacks with the nodachi.

all in all i would give nioh a maybe review if i could, it works for some people and filters others, if you have any kind of tolerance to 
frustration, patience and skill consider giving it a try and forging your own opinion about it. Everything i just wrote is after a first 
43 hour glance and is subject to change. The game is made to be played into several ng+cycles,who knows? i may come back and discover a hidden gem 
after all the bullshit

If you just want to kill some challenge mobs with your fearsome moves, Yes!
Anyway they should have fired all their level designers and numerical planners!

To levels, the first few levels are okay, but soon you will get bored. It's just following a pattern like circle around to open shortcuts - but you can't use the shortcut next time! Also they like to put heavy monsters in a very tiny road, once you dodge, you fall and die.

To numerical planning, it's terrible... The difficulty is completely related to the weapon you have in the main game. However in the DLC, it's like the designer wants you to die - the boss fight are non-sense, most of the boss moves can kill you 10 times in one shot and the whole move can neither be interrupted nor blocked. Also the boss are starting to have crazy moves like swing his blade and having massive element blades throwing to you. you block you die, you dodge, you die too (unless you are on the correct frame)

I don't doubt Nioh 2 will be the same.

The plot of Nioh revolves around the western samurai William Adams, a real-life historical figure is known in Japanese as Anjin who arrived on Japanese shores in 1600. It’s a fantasy setting where you will kill giant yokai and giant tough bosses. Through the excellent gameplay and well-made cutscenes, you will experience the very personal reimagining story of William, about his quest and his rise as a skilled Yokai slaying samurai. Where along with your journey to reclaim William’s (in this case your) guardian spirit, you will meet, fight against and besides many other real-life historical figures of Japan. 

[b]Graphics [/b] 
Nioh is beautiful. While playing, it will give you a feeling that, you are really in Sengoku era Japan. You will be able to feel the environment, sometimes through the steams coming out from the hot spring or sometimes from the ripples created by the raindrops on a puddle. This little touches with its excellent use of lighting make Nioh a beautiful game.  

[b]Control[/b]
I am a PC gamer and for most of my games (except arcade fighting and BulletHell), I use keyboard and mouse. But for Nioh, I have used a gamepad. It was uncomfortable at first. But, soon I had managed to adapt to it and I am glad that I had played it with a gamepad. Playing Nioh with a gamepad is far more comfortable than playing it with Keyboard and mouse.
Nioh’s control is solid. It is similar to any other Action RPG game’s. Four action buttons are for attack, heavy attack, dash/dodge and interact with various objects and actions throughout the gameplay. You will control the camera with the right analog stick and move with the left one. When you lock on an enemy, the camera always stays on your enemy and it lets you concentrate your mind on action rather than controlling the camera.
 
[b]Gameplay [/b]
Nioh is a mission-based game. From a world map, you will choose your mission and every main mission will end with cutscenes and Boss fight. Along the way, you will collect experience points and will be able to spend it on shrines or checkpoints. Every time you check a shrine, it will replenish your health. But, will also respawn almost all the enemies. 
Nioh is not an easy game. You will die a lot. But, the thing is. It is a part of the game. If you die on Nioh, you will lose your spirit guardian and also lose all of your experience points and will respawn at the last shrine you have checked. You will also get one chance to recover your experience points. But, if you die along the way to recover them, those experience points will be gone forever.
 
[b]Combat [/b]
Combat is the bread and butter of Nioh. Here, along with five classes of male weapons, you will also be able to use range weapons along with magic and ninjutsu attacks to support yourself. 
This game shines the brightest at the one-on-one duels. It will make you feel like a real samurai who is fighting with a real human player. Every single one-on-one duel is engaging, exciting, existing and sometimes rage inducing. But, never frustrating. Maybe it’s because of the excellent AI or because of the equal playing ground for both you and your opponents.
Stamina in Nioh is known as Ki and your Ki will deplete when you will run, attack an enemy or get hit by the enemy. Managing Ki is absolute to survive the battle.  Your equipment weight affects the Ki recovery speed. the higher the weight, the slower the Ki recovery speed. Most importantly if you lose all your Ki and enemy hit you at that situation, you will temporarily immobile from stamina-depleted exhaustion for a couple of seconds. And those couple of seconds are enough for some enemies to finish you off. Some enemies will also create “Yokai Realm” or Ki dead zone, where you will not be able to replenish Ki. But there is a catch. If you can trigger a Ki pulse by pressing the shoulder button at the right moment after a combo. That will not only purify the Ki dead zones but also speed up your Ki recovery speed. I know it sounds like, this game is not fair. But, here is the catch, your enemies’ abilities are also limited by the same restrains. They have limited Ki and you can exploit this weakness as the same way your enemies do.
There is also a stance system. There are three stances and you can change them even while in combat. High stance will let you attack your enemy with high damage for the expanse of the high amount of Ki. Low stance will produce low damage attacks but excellent for defense and medium stance is for all situations.

[b]Verdict [/b]
Nioh is challenging and requires intense focus. But, it will make you feel like a real samurai or sometimes a master ninja. Occasionally it will even make you throw away your gamepad. But, the satisfaction you will get after killing that hard boss at the end of the equally hard level, is enough to make you push through the game.

Game is great, atmospheric etc, the only thing that I dont like are bosses difficulty. I'm not true darksouls player and I rather get them all in less than 100 attempts.
Might add more to that after finishing game but so far I liked it!

EDIT 2: After finishing enitre campaign I'm pretty much amazed with the game, combat, environments, enemies and even bosses. Thing is I learned too late some of the core mechanics which makes game bit easier and the first bosses I struggled the most were Nue and Yuki-Onma (hardest boss imo, spent so much hours on this one), but after I just learned how to behave in combat and how to overcome challenges, game wasn't as brutal and I might do Nue and other early bosses in max few attempts. Some late bosses I was able to make 1st try even and damn that was so satisfying!

I gave up at first boss of first DLC though, didn't expect those DLCs were designed for veterans and ppl who spent some time doing hardest submissions (double boss fights etc) and not for ppl fresh out after campaign. However later I  decided to just push forward, gear a bit in the DLCs and cheese some of harder encounters. Eventually I finished all dlcs and all submissions except last 3 of 3rd DLC that were too brutal for me. All of DLCs were great!
I can say I've spent over 100 hours in the game and pretty much it's one of best games for me.

It was amazing journey through samurai stories and myths, now Im definitely grabing Nioh 2 one day!",1608938678,1637653649,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

485510,103239460,76561198018513147,736,61,3554,0,3503,1637543421,"Nioh is a great game that has quite a few issues and doesnt come close to the dark souls trilogy or sekiro. But its still worth playing. I will say a few things about the game in general and then go into details about the gameplay.

First the story is bascily an alternative history story, its mediocre at best and requires you to have previous knowledge of japanese history events to enjoy i guess. Because let me tell you it throws names and years and you have no idea whats the significance of them. Also instead of showing you through cutscenes what is going on in more detail the game decides to bombard you with text about every character, armor and demon. The issue with this is that it tires you out really fast, early on i was reading everything but when you have a huge paragraph and multiple additions for everything in the game it gets tiresome. Even tho what its writen is actually good. 

Secondly the characters are mostly bad and i get the feeling that they count on you knowing who that is. Almost all of the characters have limited screen time except William and Hanzo, and hanzo is the best character no because a particular reason just because he is around more. William on the other hand (the protagonist) might as well be mute, because he doesnt talk often and when he does its meaningless. The guy has no character other than the fact that he wants to find his spirit. No wonder they got rid of him in the second game.

Now to get to the point, the gameplay is nice and can feel good but its nothing like darksouls. There are about 5-6 weapons you can use and unlock moves for them through a tree, also there is magic and an ninja item tree that you are completly for supporting your self. So dont expect to go for magic builds. Weapons have 3 stances low,mid,high with low having the lowest dmg and highest attack speed and high being the opposite. Compared to dark souls nioh attacks are multiple hits and leave you exposed forcing you to use both block and dodge. Early on in the game it feels pretty bad but as you progress and use the supporting spells and items as well it feels quite well. And at the end you are basicly steam rolling everything by constanly attacking. The game also has a special mode that allows you for a bit to do extreme dmg whithout the risk of dying. That mode basicly allows you destroy boses quite easily. I suggest you check some videos to see how the late game combat feels.

Finaly the dificulty of the game, most expect it to be hard since its associated with dark souls and because the early game is quite hard it makes you feel that the game will go like that until the end. Let me tell you that i beat every boss first try or second and with ease. With the only exception being 1-2 bosses during the start of the game.

TLDR: Good game, mediocre story and characters, interesting gameplay that is nothing compared to dark souls, decent difficuly during the start quite easy during the end.",1637533397,1637533397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a lot more forgiving with things like timing and and stamina. It's also easier than the dark souls games and Sekiro. 

Some differences from dark souls, it doesn't have shields and instead uses your weapon to block like in Sekiro. There's also 3 stances that modify attacks for your current weapon. I used mid nearly the whole way through though. Dodging is a mix of bloodborne and souls, you get an initial dodge, then a roll if you click it again. You also have tons of stamina and can spam dodges or attacks quite freely.

You can smith any armor/weapon to look like any other armor/weapon, which is a very nice feature.

Story and such is pretty solid but the bad guy is a pushover.

The visuals are honestly pretty weak for a game that came out after as DS3. More comparable to DS1 in that regard.

None of the Soulsbourne/ Sekiro games come close. With that said I love this game and I can't believe how long I kept this in my backlog. After playing this game everything Fromsoft ever made is like a joke. The 2nd boss is a huge brick wall so be mindful of that. I don't want to spoil too much but I wanna say weapon choice seems very important. I chose very fast dual katanas and really like how I was to get in do some damage and roll out if necessary. I think any of the heavier weapons would leave me open to attack just because they are too slow.

It's a feudal Souls-like so you should already know what to expect as far as gameplay goes. The story is....okay? It's not bad but it just doesn't come close to the lore of Dark Souls and it's really hard to not make any comparisons as you're playing just cause the games are so similar.

The most hardcore dungeon crawler I've played to date, it's brutal, punishing and the enemies give you no quarter. The combat is fast and meaty (you can almost *feel* the axe crushing the enemy's skull in). This game is a little old now but still very enjoyable in 2021. I found myself inching through levels looking for secret paths / items a lot which I rarely do in games of this type anymore, that's how fun it was.

Strong points:
- Combat system is awesome: huge weapon skill diversity, stances, combos, etc. Ninjutsu and Magic can be used alongside weapon skill trees, lots of strategic depth from this. The skill ceiling is very high.
- Brutal enemies and atmosphere. 1600 AD Japan is a sweet supernatural setting.
- Diablo style loot system
- Some of the characters / events were loosely based on actual history
- Several memorable bosses

Weak points:
- Inventory management in end game gets annoying
- Some mechanics like blacksmith seemed useless first playthrough as you found better gear every 1-2 levels anyway
- Some side missions seemed overly frustrating for little payoff, Twilight missions' level ranges seemed weird.
- Kelly was a cliche/lame main villain, the characters / plot overall seemed fairly forgettable.

In conclusion: stupidly hard but awesome dungeon crawler with deep, satisfying combat if you put the time in, memorable bosses and somewhat forgettable characters / plot outside the historical stuff.

First, what this game does well is samurai combat. Combat is tactical, engaging, tough, and requires skill. There are plenty of weapons to shake things up so you never get bored. It's just a really well-polished, fun system. It's a lot of fun to explore the levels and fight samurai.

OK, now here is where things fall apart. It's a Ninja Theory game, so you can expect some arbitrary difficulty spikes throughout the game. In Nioh, this takes the form of bosses. Compared to souls games, these bosses are not much fun. They have way too much HP, dragging out the fights to well past the 5 minute mark in some cases. In Souls games, if a boss was too tough you could explore a side area. Not here, because it's level based so you'll be stuck in a level until you beat it's boss. 

In my opinion, the bosses aren't mechanically fun to fight. Because of the HP problem, you have to be perfect while they can get one or two lucky hits in and kill you. They feel designed to take dozens of tried to get that one perfect run in. Many gamers love this; I do not. I don't have the time or patience for that any more. Back in college, I could afford to waste an afternoon on a single boss in Ninja Gaiden: Black, but not anymore.

Next up is the itemization. It's a looter game, so you'll get a lot of weapons with various stats. The stats are really confusing at first, and require constant use of the help menu to understand. The UI uses scrolling text for a lot of stats, so you have to be patient and wait for the text to wrap around. Even with the help menu, it's unclear what benefit many stats bring. You will be going through your inventory constantly. Some people love this in games; I'm kind of on the fence about it. It's okay I guess because it can be exciting getting a good drop, but it does feel tedious.

Finally the levels are pretty bland. The color palette in the first two levels is very drab. You'll spend a fair amount of time in the second level, and if you choose so you'll wind up playing a reverse version of the second level for your third level, so visually it just feels really bleh after a while. Reusing levels feels cheap. In my experience, the reverse level does not feel as well designed the second time through, feeling very linear and without really any secrets at all.

I don't know if I'll continue with this game, but I'm sure that I'm done with the series. Souls games just nail this formula so much better. The samurai combat is awesome and it's fun for that, but the overall game has enough annoyances that I feel my time is better spent elsewhere. I'll give it some more before I decide if it stays or if it goes.",1634490226,1634490226,False,11,2,0.572501838207244873,0,True,False,False

I'm very mixed, its not terrible but also not great.
it has the same game play feel as dark souls.

But I have never been this frustrated while playing any dark souls, it feels like your playing a fighting game against someone with no stamina bar. going against a boss that is similar to you but can just spam attacks and immediately hold up a defense you can't break through is just frustrating.
its even worse when the enemy ignores your defense and just deals a ton of damage over a large area.
I went with the Nodachi but I regret it, dealing almost 10x more damage than the dual katana or the chains was just not worth it, its slow so the fast bosses dodge the attacks or counter it and your attack gets cancelled.

If you can do dark souls/blood born/sekiro without blocking and minimal damage its probably not as frustrating but I wouldnt recommend it for people that tend to block and observe more.",1634220918,1634220918,False,42,8,0.579712629318237305,5,True,False,False

However the game offers a decent story, based on a real life events and characters, a challenging gameplay, great combat system, deep and meaningfull gear mechanics and loot grind. And I guess here lies most of the conflict about the game between players. Many people might not like the heavy emphasis Nioh places on acquiring strong gear in order to progress, especially in the late game.

	Combat feels faster than what we experienced in Dark Souls, there is less variety in the zones players will visit. The same is true for the enemies they will encounter, but overall its a worthy experience. The Complete Edition offers a lot of content for its price, some of it feels cheap, like fights with multiple bosses at the same time, but they are optional. Content offered by the base game's story and 3 dlcs, as well as nice progression offered by multiple NG+ is definetly worth it.

There's plenty of weapons, gear, and skill tree options to allow you to play how ever you want. The amount of different areas and monsters you fight could be better but it does let you feel more comfortable with what is thrown at you. The only real issue I had with the game was how cheap the game can get. Unlike Souls games, Nioh isnt a game where you can rely on blocking. Aside from the really basic enemies; you wont have enough stamina to attack after a block so its pretty much just dodging and knowing when to attack. Which sounds fine however most of the formidable enemies dont get staggered and can easily kill you through your attacks. Especially the bosses. Now I will say the boss fights are fun and have great music to them but it takes awhile before you'll know how to handle them. Otherwise, theres plenty of content and achievements to go after and co-op options can allow for all sorts of replayability.

The graphics are garbage with unnecessary details, gameplay is bullshit, souls-like my ass. The boss fights are fast paced and normal enemies are harder than the boss itself, they spam the shit out of you and above all of that there are  skill trees for multiple weapons where you can unlock PARRY for each of them. At start I found the boss fights to be harder and then later I got to know you can increase your attack power and decrease the bosses defense with spells and kill them in a matter of seconds by SPAMMING, its almost like cheesing, you can unlock those spells like after 4-5  main missions. 
Upgrading your armor is useless because two simple heavy attacks from any enemy will kill you. The sub missions are repeated levels with different enemy spawns. The enemies are repetitive in every main and sub missions, every level you progress you face the same enemies with different weapons. DLC is more boring than the original, there's this one stage before you face the final boss where you will have to face 4 mini bosses with few normal enemies they spawn one after other, it's not hard but it's fucking annoying, the unfair amount of damage dealt is annoying, getting killed by one hit at third or fourth boss is annoying, I got stuck there for so long that I collected enough ""Amrita"" to level up my character from 100 to 150+.
 
In short: This game is not souls-like and it is hard just for the sake of hard.

UPDATE 3: THIS GAME IS STUPID. PLAY IT IF YOU LIKE GETTING KILLED IN ONE HIT BY A MOVE THAT ONLY TAKES 1/4 SECOND TO DO. DON'T WANT TO BE UNDERLEVELED? OKAY, THEN GRIND SIDE MISSIONS AND REPLAY ALREADY COMPLETED MISSIONS FOR HOURS. NIOH HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL. I HOPE NIOH 2 ISN'T THIS STUPID.

Update 2: Most of the difficulty in Nioh stems from the fact that almost everything will one-hit you. All of the bosses have stupid amounts of health and if you make one mistake you die. If this stuff was toned down a bit it would be perfectly balanced.

Update 1: I feel like this game is too long. It doesn't introduce enough (or really any) new ideas in the late game so you're just fighting all of the same enemies in slightly  different areas and it gets really old. I got bored of it and I still have a bunch left to do. I'll come back to beat it eventually.

After 10 hours/Original review:

I'm really surprised by how good this game is. I didn't expect it to be this fun. So far the combat has been extremely fun, even with the lack of unique enemies in each area. I have enjoyed 4 of the 6 bosses so far (the two I didn't enjoy weren't exactly bad, just kinda dumb). I expected to be annoyed about the fact that you're stuck playing this dude William, but he's actually cool. He's basically Geralt of Rivia if he was an Irish pirate in the 1600's. Nioh also has one of my favorite mechanics of any game I've ever played: the stances

The stances are high, mid, and low (also sheathed if you count that). High is slower but does more damage, low does less damage but is stupid fast, and mid is medium speed and medium damage. Different stances work better against different enemies. You could be fighting a dude and absolutely shred him with low stance but then this other dude shows up and you switch to high stance which works better against him. Each weapon type has a unique moveset for each stance so combat stays fresh.

Nioh obviously takes a ton of inspiration/ideas from Dark Souls, but it has so many of its own ideas that it feels like a new experience. There is so much depth to this game that might seem daunting at first, but it doesn't take long to catch on. This is what Souls-likes should strive to be.",1620410290,1633120986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The difficulty seems insurmountable at first, but Nioh demands you to play better and because Nioh is uncompromising in it's demands, you the player are forced to get better and get creative to win. There's an assortment of weapons and spells at your disposal. There combos as well. This variety creates a mechanical depth which is very rewarding.

Nioh takes the Japanese setting and story from Sekiro and mixes it with the weapon variety of Dark Souls franchise. While at the same time adding its own flavor or abilities and moves. Nioh is not a ripoff or copy cat. Instead it's a breed of it's own. 

Nioh has incredible level design. The levels are not huge but they are so well made they are full of nooks and crannies and places to explore that despite their small size, you will find them fun to explore. The levels are masterfully made.

- The game has beatutiful cinematics and art with varying settings, e.g. one mission is in winter, another in a bath house, another in a cave, and another in a castle - but all keep this dark and serious atmosphere.
- Combat ontrols are very fluid and it was fun to mess around and see what I could do with the combat system.
- There are lot of weapons and therefore combat approaches to choose from. I only played though the game once but technically I have 7 more playthoughs ahead of me to fully exhaust the game's content.
- For such a big game there are very few bugs. I only got stuck in a wall once by messing around too much, but during regular gameplay there were basically none.
- It has online content but it can be played offline without missing anything important.
- There are A LOT of settings for customization.
- There is no minimap, only a radar for your various senses which means navigation skills and good memory are required.

Neutral:
- The game is frustrating at the beginning, very fun in the middle, and falls off towards the end into grinding. Most of this comes down to how fast the enemies level up vs you.
- Bosses are very punishing (BUT NOT UNFAIR!). Most have some way to stun-lock, deal heavy damage though the guard or just one-shot with an unexpected attack. One miss-step or miss-timed attack often meant death if I couldn't run away and drink a potion fast enough. Sometimes I even let the boss kill me just to save potions and try again.
- Regular combat was rather boring once I could predict the enemy AI. I played axe and most combat was: approach enemy, roll back, hi-stance heavy attack, roll back, hi-stance heavy attack, and so on. For most bosses it was rolling past them when they attack and then hi-stance heavy attack. Running past enemies sometimes was the correct choice a lot of the time after respawning.
- The story is still fiction, but every major character was a real person in japanese history.
- Living weapons can work as a sort of safety net. If I could see that an enemy was close to killing me, I pressed the button and obliterated everyone with my living weapon.
- There are two incredibly clever secret features in the game, but I couldn't have known about them without the wiki.

Negatives:
- About 3 hours of my game time is running from the last save point to the boss door. They should have placed a shrine right next to it just to eliminate this frustration.
- Later on in the game it becomes difficult to progress just because the game throws 2 or 3 enemies at you to fight at the same time. Each of them would not be that difficult on their own, but when thrown together it just feels cheap.
- There are way way way too many things in the game. It could be less confusing (maybe even more fun?) if it eliminated like half of the consumable items, the majority of its skill tree, the titles, some blacksmith features, the dojo, equipment set bonuses and one more (the next point). These things are all thrown at you from the start so it makes the game way too overwhelming until you eventually understand everthing.
- The worst offender in the category of unnecessary content are the weapon attributes. It's fine if I have to compare my 75 attack weapon to a new 81 attack weapon and switch to the new one because it's stronger. But I don't want to compare two weapons with 75 attack with 3-5 miniscule percentage stat increases each, some of which are so cryptic I had no idea what they even do, like ""Change to Attack (Spirit) B+"", ""Parry (Critical) +8.1%"", ""Low Attack Break +4.7%"", or ""Vs Water +5"".

[strike]Nioh is what Dark Souls 3 could've been if it wasn't Somersault Simulator 2016.

Nioh combines all of the best elements of the entirety of the Souls series; mixes it together with the loot generation and badass systems of Borderlands; seasons it easy-to-understand level, skill, and crafting systems; then serves it all in the incredibly beautifully designed world that is 1600s Sengoku Japan.

This game seems to be designed with the player in mind. More than a couple times, I've found myself thinking ""Wow, I really wish I could do ______"", and not 10 minutes later, I'll accidently stumble upon something or another that lets me do exactly that. One such example is the item shortcuts. After a couple missions (oh yeah, this game isn't open-world like the Souls series, per se; each level is separated into a mission with an end-goal, typically some sort of boss), I found myself wanting for more than 8 quick-slots for items to be used. Once I finished the mission and went to level up and upgrade my gear, I discovered you could get up to 16 item shortcuts by talking to a blacksmith and being a patron of her shop.

All in all, the game is incredible. It seems like they've considered just about everything that someone playing their game could want, and implemented it in a way that just works.[/strike]",1511401858,1632003759,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It’s different enough to warrant it’s existence with the Japanese art style, culture and setting, the speed of the combat and the gameplay mechanics themselves. I don’t think it’s nowhere near as good as the souls games mainly because it’s missing that amazing atmosphere, world building, level design and enemy variety with great designs. Combat in the souls games feel more weighty and impactful but the combat in this game is decent and it’s what keeps you playing but it did start to get really repetitive and boring after a while. The boss fights were ok, they weren’t too interesting or memorable and I couldn’t have cared less about the story. The story loves to throw a lot names and characters at you and I was following it all in the first third of the game up until I felt like the story wasn’t going anywhere nor did it feel like it was worth paying attention to. I didn’t really like doing the side missions either as most of them take place in the main mission location you just completed and that can get tiring because of the repetition of visiting the same area over and over again mixed with the combat that also feels tiring after a while especially with the lack of enemy variety too, fighting the same enemies over and over again. It all comes together feeling very monotonous in general. This game was a disappointment for me personally but I can see why others would really like it and I was really liking it in the first dozen hours but then the fatigue started kicking in. I wasn’t able to recommend Lords of the Fallen or The Surge but I do recommend this game but only if you’re a fan of the souls games.

Genre: Action RPG

THE GOOD:
+ Dark fantasy Japanese setting with plenty of gameplay/graphical options

+ Multiple weapon types, armor, stats, equipment and perks for any character creation type.  Any character build is viable at least in the first difficulty. Every weapon has its own skill tree and you can customize what skills are activated depending on the combo. 

+ Combat is typical ‘souls-like’. You have a stamina bar that you have to manage, rushing into battle and swinging wildly will get you killed. Combat does feel more fluid and faster paced often rewarding you with plenty of loot. You can use axes, spears, swords, dual swords, kusarigama, odachi, tonfas, bows and rifles.  Each weapon has three stances, low, mid and high. Each stance confers its own pros, cons and skills depending on your playstyle and enemy. Although I am not the biggest fan of combat systems with multiple stances, it works surprisingly well in this game. You can easily play the entire game in mid stance if you prefer.

+ The game is more accessible than your typical ‘souls’ game. The game is broken down into main/sub missions and gives you clear indication of the difficulty level giving you a good idea of what mission you should play next. Unlike other ‘souls’ games you don’t have to worry about getting lost or being under leveled in the wrong area. Main missions have more intricate level design having you unlock new shortcuts in case you die and then facing a challenging boss battle at the end. Each main mission has a different atmosphere and constantly rewards those who are willing to explore. Sub missions are a 
mix of fighting multiple enemies or searching for an item in a previously completed area.  

+ You are rewarded with a ton of loot, luckily you are also given plenty of inventory options to manage/sell and organize the loot. It makes things very fast and efficient so you don’t have to spend a lot of time in the inventory screen.  I wish more games had these types of options. 

+ After completing the game the first time you unlock the next difficulty mode, up to 5 different difficulties. Each one introduces new challenges and harder enemies but also better loot giving you plenty of incentive to try it out. 

+ This game is packed with high quality content, even a single playthrough with all the dlc’s will easily give you 50+ hours of gameplay.  There is also a gauntlet type mode, fighting progressively harder bosses, twilight missions which are main missions but with harder enemies but greater rewards.  

THE AVERAGE: 
+/- The story and characters are decent but I never got invested into it. It feels like the story was an afterthought. 

+/- The interface to purchase new skills could have been much better. Scrolling through a long list of skills across multiple weapon tiers with no sub headings or organization was poorly thought out. 

+/- Controller highly recommended 

Conclusion:
I was not expecting to like this game as much as I did and certainly wasn’t expecting to put these many hours into it either. A fantastic rpg all around.

But [i]Nioh[/i] is its own thing, accelerating the pace quickly: with mission-based maps, each one allowing different routes and exploration, it is easy to notice the increased variety of enemies, complexity in their positioning, ambushes and even natural traps (gravity, mostly...). The gameplay progresses, for example, when the player realizes that different weapon stances are better for different situations (high for damage, medium for blocking, low for dodging) and you can use them all in a single combat; also that the basic actions of the character can be modified, thus acquiring new abilities and combinations of moves for each type of weapon you can use. In addition, the equipment is acquired as a [i]looter[/i] game, [i]Diablo[/i] style, in droves and with randomized attributes, granting a lot of replayability for hardcore min-max players because of the huge item management system. These characteristics, combined with the fact that the story is surprisingly well-crafted —  
 unfortunately not so well told — around Japan's real historic events, ignoring the supernatural of course, [i]Nioh[/i] can please new players and ""[i]Souls[/i] veterans"" alike by being something new, actually accessible and fun, but also as brutal and merciless as Japanese feudal history itself.

I only have a few minor complaints about the game so far. One, they practically throw loot at you and you're constantly checking to see if anything is better then what you have. Two, exploration isn't as rewarding as you'll rarely find loot that's better than just killing random enemies/mini bosses. Yes, you can find shortcuts, but more often then not it's just more loot. And three, combat feels a bit hack 'n slash. You're still rewarded for timing your attacks correctly, but you can usually overwhelm a mob by simply attacking it enough to break its stamina bar.

I don't love it as much as Dark Souls, but it's a fun game that's rewards good play and learning from your mistakes. Enemies that you used to struggle with become second nature.

I breezed through to the boss. I continued to get pumped by the boss a couple dozen more times....

This is when the game did match my Souls experience ( other than almost refunding my first Dark Souls game too lol )... finally defeating that first boss - the game suddenly became clear. Beginning to understand what I was doing wrong the whole time. I played the next mission, didn't die once ( except for jumping in the water to see if I'd die... can't swim apparently D: ).

I've done plenty of them, but off the top of my head I can't remember a single one I see as more than a road-block on my progress highway. I might put up with them if the stuff in between appeals to me, but I don't think I'll ever understand some people's obsession with road-blocks. But the setting of Nioh seemed quite intriguing, Japan's Sengoku period heavily embellished with monsters out of japanese folklore and some esoteric gobbledygook as glue, so I decided to give it a try although I'm neither a fan of boss fights nor the Dark Souls formula of punishing the player's every move.

The similarites to Dark Souls are certainly there in the form of bonfires (shrines), graves and losing resources if you die a second time before reaching your grave. Nioh's combat system, however, is not only much faster but also much more complex than Dark Souls'. For starters, it adds 3 stances balancing offense/defense you have to switch frequently. Stamina is also there in the form of Ki, but there's a whole new mechanic called Ki pulses which'll help you make better use of your Ki. There are many different weapon classes and a huge number of combos and special moves you can learn for each of them provided you earned enough skill points. In addition, there are two special skills Ninjutsu and Magic which are mostly about buffs and debuffs and are better not ignored unless you want an even more brutal world of pain than the one you're about to enter anyway. Topping it off, there's the Living Weapon, a special mode of your Guardian Spirit you can activate for a short time to gain invulnerability and increased attack, with its own kinks and caveats. All of this is much more complex and satisfying than Dark Soul's poke-and-roll gameplay and really deserves a wider audience, but unfortunately Team Ninja decided to skill-wall it behind some of the most sadistically unfair game design I've ever come across.

The prologue in the Tower of London is still relatively mild, but the first mission in Japan is pretty much giving new players the finger. Long stretches without a shrine, battles in extremely cramped surroundings, highly unpredictable enemies and of course one-shots. The game loves one-shots. Nothing like crawling through hostile environments for half an hour, only to face a Yokai who starts an attack, you start dodge-rolling away, but it just delays out of the blue and instead hits you for insane damage just as you finish your roll; if you're somehow not dead after this, it'll immediately start a spinning rampage and finish the job. While enemies have the usual telegraphed moves you can learn and exploit, most also have random attacks and delays that come completely out of left field and give you a couple of frames at best to ""react"". And don't think you're safe from scrawny skeletons either, they'll easily take half your health in a single hit, and that never really changes either. When the game throws environmental hazards into the mix, it doesn't play around either: if you don't know from a previous death there are bats, they'll push you right off the cliff, no chance to react. By far the worst of this nonsense comes in ""The Ocean roars again"", a mission consisting almost entirely of narrow walkways over instant-death water. A level designer with a shred of humanity would leave it at that, but the sadistic a-holes at Team Ninja made sure that additionally all floors are a pretty unform blue-grey so it's literally impossible to tell apart floor from water with peripheral vision, and primary vision is usually busy with huge Yokai bearing down on you. And those bosses... let's just say I seriously doubt even From Software would dare put the likes of Onryoki, Hi no Enma and Nue this early in a game.

The game has a loot system that seems highly at odds with this genre. A game emphasizing skill and a very high pain threshold leaving it entirely to RNG what kind of equipment the player gets? Luckily you can modify attributes at the blacksmith via reforging -- for a price, of course, but at least the loot RNG isn't entirely set in stone that way. The loot system is getting really bad around the start of the DLCs, however, when all equipment is level-capped at 150, but the mission levels (and thus equipment requirements) keep going up. At the end of the main game, you'll start getting extremely rare Divine equipment drops, which get more powerful via a +N attribute, and thereby become the only viable type of equipment. Due to the rarity, getting the right equipment and upgrading it at this point is pretty much impossible without a lot of grinding and I seriously doubt I'd have gotten anywhere if it hadn't been for the Divines-pinata mission ""Ganryu"" at the end of DLC #2.

The DLCs go the usual route of ramping up difficulty even more, everything hits really hard, but by far the worst of the lot is the completely unpredictable Namahage. And while some DLC bosses like Sarutobi Sasuke are suprisingly easy, many of them are completely over the top with their long, devastating combos, lightning-fast dashes and almost non-existing openings, the worst offenders being Living Weapon spammers Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura. Leveling also loses its last shreds of balance, the final main mission being level 244, which I had to do around level 184. Worse, the more important levels of equipment drops don't even remotely keep up either, the last mission should drop up to level 248 gear, corresponding to Divine+9, but the highest drop I ever got was +5 (and even those are extremely rare). Why the charade?

On the technical side, the PC port seems good at first glance, but comes with some serious caveats. Regarding mouse and keyboard controls, you have the standard JRPG behaviour of strange default buttons and controller prompts only, which is irritating but you'll get used to it. Binding more than the base 3 mouse buttons requires external tools like ""X-Mouse Button Control"". Serious issue #1 is completely broken lock-on with multiple targets. The game is hard-coded to switch targets as soon as you move the mouse even the tiniest bit while locked on, and often to enemies behind you or at the far end of the room; the camera will literally do somersaults. Yes, it really is that bad, and no, it can't be deactivated, the only way to avoid it is to not lock-on when multiple targets are around. Which would be fine if the game handled well without locking on, but unfortunately Nioh handles very very badly without the lock. Thankfully, this situation doesn't arise often during the main missions, but when it does it's rage-inducing and you can completely forget about things like double boss fights. Serious issue #2 is the 60Hz mode, which looks nice and smooth, but unfortunately things like the parrying window or some special moves were apparently hard-coded to frames rather than time, so they play much faster than intended; be wary of that and better stick to 30Hz. As far as stability goes, it's actually great, the game only ever crashed on me during one specific mission and only when I used Tonfa.

Nioh had its moments and I enjoyed parts of it and hated others. I initially intended to end it after the first DLC, but something drew me back and I finished the remaining 2 DLC as well. Masochism? Stupidity? The fun in between? Probably a bit of each, and that makes it extremely hard to make a verdict. On the one hand, a game with this much contempt for its players doesn't deserve a recommendation, on the other hand, looking at my playtime there was definitely something there appealing to me. So I'll make it an extremely tentative recommendation, but be wary that the game is like a beautiful woman with the most odious character imaginable -- let's say a spanish ninja-alchemist who, through the power of Amrita, turned blonde; you might be tempted to put up with it for her looks, but be prepared to get kicked in the teeth... a lot.

Since this is Nioh: Complete Edition that has all the DLCs, I will review this with my experience as a whole. 

Nioh is by no means a shitty game. To be honest, I had fun doing the main campaign but my experience with the DLC was so bad that I just started to hate the whole game. I noticed that with the DLC, ends of missions just turned into ultra gank sessions that dragged out too long. 

As for the main mission bosses of the DLC, they felt boring as fuck. The only fun bosses in the DLC were the centipede guy, Maria, and the last two bosses of the final DLC. Everything else I could remember was that giant flying asshole and a bunch of humans that just spammed living weapon every 3 seconds. To be honest, I finished all the DLCs out of spite. Not once did I feel excited about fighting the bosses because I just did the same thing again and again for 3-5 minutes (this was especially true for that Sasuke fucker). At least Maria was kinda fun. I also don't get why people like Yukimura. That guy was boring as hell.

If they put in a normal difficulty and allowed people to pass through the game once and experience it and then ramped up the difficulty to what it is currently so that people who enjoy that level of difficulty have that then more people would experience the game and word would get out about this game.

The story, which freely borrows from history of feudal Japan, follows a really boring dude named William who wants to find his guardian spirit which was stolen from him. 

What can one say? If you like Diablo, you'll likely like this one. It's not a souls-like although it takes the ""lose your experience on death unless you recover it"" from Souls but otherwise it's more a loot-grind. The game is actually pretty easy when you get the right gear but otherwise enemies will one shot you quite often. The first half of the game was more difficult when I didn't have the correct gear but then the second half was a breeze.

There are some problems I ran into: The camera sometimes goes under the floor when using skills or activating your living weapon and that can really mess you up. Also the bosses are really uninspired. They are all really simple but do a ton of damage so the first few bosses will be ""dead on the first hit until you find their pattern""; you rarely can take two hits from any boss. But this becomes less so when you, again, find the right equipment. I didn't have to grind at all during the game, so that's good, but I also didn't have any real excitement during it either. 

I really didn't feel interested in any of the stages or characters or exploration in this game, got lost a few times though. The best thing is when you find new suitable equipment but after a while you've found everything you need and will just be upgrading the old stuff to higher levels. 

I don't like loot-grinders so don't let this review stop you if you do. It's fine for that, just don't expect much from the story or the exploration or ""wonderful and interesting enemies"" aspect of it.

One of the better soulslikes/soulsclones. Not worth the full price, but If you like this kind of game grab it in a sale.

Now to go into a bit more depth:

If you are like me you have played dark souls and now are searching for a game to fill the deep emptiness left  by it and to feed your addiction.
If you haven’t played dark souls, do it! It’s by far the better game(s)!

Comparing two games might not always be fair, but in this case there really is no way around it, as Nioh copied so many DS elements, while only adding little new ideas to the concept.
You’ve got a dark atmosphere, “souls” you lose on death and can reclaim by touching your “bloodstain” and  work as exp to level/ as currency.
There are many shortcuts and a shit ton of doors that can only be opened from the other side (no, seriously, those are everywhere). There are traps, there are bosses and there are savepoints you can rest at with the trade off of all the enemies respawning…

The basic combat is pretty much the same as in DS,.
There are minute differences but it feels very alike.
The 3 stances are mostly a gimmick as you will probably just stick to the one with the best moveset after playing around for a bit, and the weapon skills are mostly worse than your normal attack or overpowered against certain enemies.

Still there are quite a few things the game does pretty well.
- the animation and combat feel quite fluid
- there are a few really cool weapons like Kusarigama (chain and sickle)
- you have a lot of tools at your disposal, many of them are recharged when resting (so you actually use them instead of hording them), but still are limited enough to think twice when using them, at least in the early and late game.
Arrows and ammunition fall under this category, ranged weapons can be really useful but you run out of ammo really quickly at first.
- with ninjutsu and Omyo magic you can choose what kind of playstyle you prefer and they add more tools of the category above. 
- The overall style and atmosphere of the game is well done, some levels feel and look really cool.
- there are a loot of hidden secrets and searching for them feels rewarding at times.
- There is a kind of hidden wall in this game, its really easy to overlook, but if you pay attention you actually have a chance to find it (in contrast to the illusory walls in the souls games, this is the only point where I really think Nioh did it better.)
- there is a lot of content. Doing all the side missions and exploring all the levels I took a little under 100 hours to finish the game, you can be a lot faster though. And if you like end game grinding you can spend much more time.

Then there are some things that are just okay. Not bad, but not great either:
-The Story and it’s presentation are… okay. 
-The overall level design is okay, there’ exceptions in both directions but its decent on average. 
-The item system has it’s pros and cons, I’m not a fan but I bet others are.


Sadly a lot of things don’t feel great in Nioh. Instead of just a list I will go a bit more into detail here.

- Enemies and bosses are way to punishing.
I’m not using the word “hard” here for a reason. The game is not that hard at all. The two first bosses are, as you do not have the right tools at your disposal yet but afterwards there is not much of a challenge. Still your foes are very punishing, one small mistake will cost you your life and the windows you can safely attack in are really short and rare.

- the game is way to repetitive!
Where to start? It does not take long until you notice you are always fighting the same enemies, over and over and over, even bosses get recycled. The levels are well designed in theory, but they always follow the exact same concept (with maybe 2 or 3 exceptions), so they get boring fast. Exploration does not feel fun if you are always “exploring” the same kind of level with the same hiding spots and the same feel to them. And if that wasn’t enough, side missions always reuse parts of levels you already know. It gets boring really fast.

- the game is annoying! 
Having to fight the same enemies over and over again, you know their movesets inside and out. Still you have to wait for those tiny attack windows and if RNG is not on your side you will have to wait a long time. And if you don’t or you make one tiny mistake you are dead.
One thing Dark Souls does, it allows you to stagger enemies. Not always, not every one of them but if you know when, you can stagger them, and you get rewarded for an offensive playstyle. 
In Nioh you can stagger all the big enemies exactly once. Afterwards no matter what you do they will just start attacking while you keep bashing their heads in. And as the same guys have different amounts of hp every time, you can not even rely on staggering them once with that attack that just staggered the last one...
Another Thing Dark Souls does it allows you to dodge incoming attacks by just moving, without rolling or blocking. This is where the biggest difference between new and experienced players lies. The better you are the less you roll and the more offensive you can play. This is impossible in Nioh as most attacks have INSANE tracking. 
In other words you are punished for playing aggressive. You need to wait for that one attack where you can go in and hit the guy. And after having killed 500 of them before you really do not want to wait for him, you just wanna smash him and move on.
Add your lock on just randomly swapping targets mid swing from time to time and the annoyance is perfect.

- the bosses are not balanced well at all.
Now theres two ways you can fight them. Toe to toe or with your arsenal of bombs, shuriken and Magic spells.
The thing is, if you just fight them “normally” they are waaaaay to punishing. Every boss starts to feel like a spongy final boss. Their attacks come with little warning, are borderline impossible to evade at times, blocking will just leave you staggered which is a death sentence and your windows of opportunity to get in some damage are minuscule.
The other way to beat them is just running in circles throwing bombs or hell, for most human bosses just pressing that 1 button with your Kunai. Killing them without them getting a single ability of.
The hardest bosses are the first 2 thanks to that, as your tools are still very limited here….
Neither way feels great. If you like super punishing bossfights and don’t mind taking a few hours for every one of them this game might be for you.

Now the most important question: Did I have fun?
Well kinda. The first few hours were great, and some of the endgame challenges were enjoyable as well. The most dominant feeling for most of the game though was annoyance. Not frustration or rage or anything, just straight up annoyance.
This probably sounds pretty bad, but after all is said and done I still stuck to the game and finished it. So something must have captivated me.",1628726880,1628726880,False,33,3,0.57123875617980957,1,True,False,False

However there are many things that I found too overwhelming to the point of absurdity in Nioh. The fact that there are 3 stances that the game expects you to switch between and the Ki Pulse stamina regen ""time your pulse while you are busy fighting"" system which I thankfully avoided by taking the skills that performed a pulse when ever you dodge / dash... So I ignored it altogether and that was much less of a burden than before. Also I played the entire game in mid-stance and ignored the other stances entirely. There are so many button combo skills for attacks that the game literally has you chose which one to equip because many attacks use the same buttons which leads to the problem of wasted skill points because you forgot what button combos you already have unlocked... if you do not use them often. For those who like fighting and Arkham style games this is probably a dream come true... But I found it annoying and I focused on passive skills and the combos that where the simplest and that I was likely to perform without even thinking about it (like X+X+Y or the ones where you press X or Y while guarding). There were so many options in this game that I did not use because I just didn't care to complicate things anymore... Like the magic and the throwing weapons from ninjutsu. The only magic I ever used was healing and elemental weapon buffing... But there was so much of this game that just felt superfluous to me. I never, not once, forged a weapon... I think I used Soul Matching twice... and it wasn't even necessary... and when it would actually make a big difference... the cost is so high... its just not worth it. Maybe these things are more designed for New Game+... But it feels like a waste of Development resources considering the small percentage that will actually buy the game only because there is a new game+. Anyways... Just by picking up loot, dismantling and reforging stats on the weapons and armor I picked up, using almost no magic and absolutely no Ninjustu, staying in mid-stance and not giving a crap about Ki Pulses... I finished the game at level 104(about 30 levels bellow mission level and I absolutely wrecked the last 2 bosses. By the way, I played a light armor build with Dual Swords / Spear as my weapons with most of my points in Heart / Skill attributes. So if you want to play this game like Dark Souls and ignore most of the complexity of the mechanics and systems... You absolutely can... and that is the only reason I am recommending this game.

The level design is okay. However the game is SEVERELY lacking in variety, way too many same-y levels, not enough music, and my god there's barely any enemy variations. 

Nioh is a 10 hours game stretched to 80 hours by recycling itself.

There are like ten enemies and said enemies are recycled through the entire game, to the point where all the enemies you fought on the first level are the same ones you're going to fight on the last one.
Every main story level is reused up to four times: as a main story level, as a secondary mission level (the same level but cut in half), as a secondary mission level (the same level but in reverse), as a secondary mission level (the same level but in reverse and you only have to play half of it) and as a twilight level (the same as the main story one but the sky looks red and there are slightly different enemy mobs). If you don't play those secondary levels you'll be very weak to advance through the story. But they're all much shorter than the main missions, and your starting location and destination are both altered heavily, as well as all enemy locations. It gets a bit grating sometimes but they do at least try to mix things up

The variety is mainly found in the combat system and mechanics, the huge amount of depth and options each weapon provides and the amount you can learn when wielding them, along with how variable enemy encounters can be due to said mechanics. It's gimped somewhat heavily by poor damage balancing but it's still there.

Another positive is the amount of different builds you can make in the late game. There is genuinely almost no end to Nioh autism for builds. It is a well that goes deeper and deeper and you think you find the bottom but it turns out there’s more below that. The game is probably the best structured of any with this type of combat because there’s so many difficulties and options to make it harder that when combined with the sheer depth of choice in how to play means that literally anyone can at the very least beat it once, or at the most succumb to total autism and lose their sanity.

The gameplay is still great and makes up for the lack of enemy variety and level environment. I'd take Nioh over most AAA movie games.",1628599096,1628644931,True,2,0,0.458333313465118408,0,True,False,False

- A lot of customisation in how you play the game (weapons/skills etc.)
- Beautiful environments with secrets to find (even though most of the secret items feel a bit pointless)
- A good variety of bosses.
- First playthrough has a good difficulty curve (can be very easy if you call people to help you)
- Even though many missions use the same maps, there are a lot of missions to choose between. 

Bad points to prepare yourself for:

- As most of the items dropped are useless, a lot of time is needed to manage your inventory especially in late game. This game could sorely benefit from better item management.
- The jump in difficultly between the difficulty levels is more annoying than anything else. Everything just seems to stun-lock you to death or simply one hit kill you on the third playthrough +
- Missions where you have to fight 2 bosses at the same time.... Just no thank you....
- Crashing to desktop at the end of missions seems to happen, too. This is rare, but can mean you will have to re-fight bosses.

Overall:

I like the game and have enjoyed playing it. However the late game feels more frustrating than anything else (One hit kill for most enemies is not what I really consider fun). If you have never played a Nioh game, I would recommend the sequel as it irons out a lot of the flaws in this game, although item management is still a nightmare.

Dealbreakers in no particular order for me:
-99% of loot that drops is pointless and the UI to manage it is no way up to this task
-Areas are re-used to a laughable degree for side missions
-Once again a Souls-like game where heavy armor is pointless (everything including the basic fodder mobs kills you in 2 hits, regardless of what you wear) and only serves to waste your stamina
-For some reason there is an instant ""I win"" button in Living Weapon with a huge charging requirement that doesn't reset between deaths
-The enemy movesets are sorely based around memorization, their moves are faily easy to dodge  but if you aren't already in the right spot before they even start attacking you, you are dead; games like this need a balance between reaction/skill necessary and memory of the move itself to survive and this game fails pretty noticably on that front
-In my review for Souls games I like to complain about things that are in no way difficult(basilisks that are trivial to kill but have an instant kill breath that debuffs through death), but only serve to piss people off; in my few hours here I have already found more things like this in the game than in all 3 Dark Souls games combined (e.g. hello bat swarms)
-The story and voice acting is as generic and cringe-worthy as it can possibly get and failed to grab me at all until the point I quit the game (the game even wastes my time during the voiceover cutscenes, I have never heard a narrator talk so slowly)
-Most tutorials and armor/skill tooltips only cover the very basics of what they are about (if at all) and once again you have to resort to googling how your skills actually work or what your armor bonus skills even do; it was annoying but excusable in Dark Souls because that game is a lot less complex in its skill/item progression and actively sapped my will the even look at new gear/skills because having to ask google wether the shiny new armor I found is useful since I don't understand half of its mods is beyond stupid

Rather, it adds onto what Dark Souls does mechanically and comes well into it's own. Between each weapon giving you 3 stances which is insane and allows there to be variety in move set as well as genuine versatility in your approaches to combat, with the skill system giving it that depth Dark Souls didn't have. It stands on it's own and improves on it's inspiration, like using a candle to retrieve lost Amrita (this games souls) on the fly rather than in DS where you risk wearing a ring to give yourself insurance when you don't know if that said moment is worth it. You'll see some Ninja Gaiden aspects in this (which I was scared hearing who this is made by as I personally beat some NG games and god damn did I hate how the enemy AI was in those frustrating excuses for difficulty) like those critical attacks when draining an opponents Ki (this games posture if you're thinking sekiro) reminds me of those critical attacks from NG 2. Speaking of Sekiro (which came out 2 years after Nioh) you'll see just how better this game handles ""dueling"" where draining an opponents ki/posture is more of a benefit/reward to land a critical where as Sekiro made you feel pushed into doing so, I know these games are different mechanically to some extent but I like the Ki draining as more of an option to approach things. Is this perfect? Hell no, nothing is in most games. But it hit a sweet spot when not only do long range weapons (hand cannon, rifle, bow) help you in combat to take out pesky archers/bomb throwing jerks and subduing the yokai, but it's assigned to a button rather than switching your melee weapon out completely to MAYBE do some damage in Dark Souls.

the answer is a solid YES! 

Yes, a lot of this game owe Souls games, but for me this is better than souls. (hope i don't trigger souls fanatics, but i have some reasons behind this.) I just competed the story so let me breakdown why this game (I think) is still good to play even it's about to be half a decade old, and why its better than souls.

WHY I LIKE IT

1. Gameplay - yes its a souls clone, there is a shrine (bonfire) as checkpoint, amrita(souls) as a leveling currency, and tough bosses that is similar to souls. but I think that what Nioh stands out is the variety of weapons and its move sets. I can compare the nuances of the weapons to that of monster hunter, another favorite of mine. There is a level of mastery of a single weapon in order to conquer the entire game, or at least until the credits roll. I just mastered the single katana, and almost always using the mid stance, and there is still low stance that I use on crawling enemies, and the rarely used high stance. I can see other players use all stances, but i survived the final boss fight using the stance of my choice. And there is still i think 6 other melee weapon to choose from, and 3 long range weapons. So there is still more to do. This makes the game a little bit easier as you can create your preferred play-style. 

2. Level Design - what I like about the souls series is their intricate, intertwined level design. And you can see this also in Nioh. What I don't like in souls games are the bonfire placement. Once you die in a boss in souls, you get back in the bonfire and retrace again your steps all the way to the boss, and a single miss step along the way will lead you to lost souls, an a broken controller. While in Nioh, if you explore the map good enough, you will see a shortcut from a shrine to the boss without a single encounter. They made it sure that you can get back to that boss that you hate so much, but I like it. Yes Nioh is difficult, but not a frustrating one because of this, and thus makes it better than souls (for me).

3. Rpg Stuff - Its all here! The stat building, skills trees, melee, ranged, the likes. You can forge your own weapon, tweak the weapon skills depending on what you want etc.  I like the intricacy of monster hunter, and i feel the same way to Nioh. I love the feeling of building a character to conquer difficult bosses using a lot of stuff that Nioh gives you.

3 . Enemy types - though some say there is a small amount of enemy types Nioh has to offer, but it really gives you the opportunity to learn their moves and how to counter them. This gives you confidence to fight them and making the game less frustrating.

4. Bosses - The main attraction. The First one (not the executioner) is a pain, also the second one. But as you learn the complexities of its gameplay, you will find a skill, or weapon, weapon/armor skill or armor weight to suit your play-style, use it to counter the bosses that the game will give to you. One boss killed me 17 times before I defeated it, but in our next encounter, i manage to survive and defeat it in one try (Yey!). There are meh bosses and there are controller breakers but all in all a good experience.

5. Replayability - theres online coop, there is more after you beat the game, you can master other weapons, the many things you can do after you beat the story.

SOME THINGS MISSING? 

1. Story - Its an RPG so i want a good story. Well the story is well thought of, a mix of history and fantasy but it is not the main reason why you play. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but for me its not that engaging nor ""keeps you in the edge of your seat waiting for what's coming next"" type of story. 

2. linearity vs openness - i think it lies between the two. there is exploration involved in the multiple levels, makes you see different paths, different ways to tackle enemies, but that's just it, it doesn't apply to the story. the levels aren't interconnected either. it really leans on being an action game rather than a role playing game. So those who were looking for branching narratives, look somewhere else.

3. Immersion - the game makes you focus a lot, i mean a lot that can make you deaf on outside forces, like ""your wife telling you to do something and you didn't hear her because you're so focused in the game so then she'll get angry"" type of things that will end up you being dead both in game and in real life. Maybe not negative to the game, but well, I love my wife. I don't want to lose a lot of amrita again and bed space so lets put this here. 

All in all, this is a great game and is well worth of your hard earned money. Bought it on sale, still worth it if you buy it full price. Bought the 2nd Nioh because of this. Thank you Developers for a great job.",1627213660,1627217488,True,6,0,0.592860043048858643,0,True,False,False

Went to the community for help and tips and after around 4 hrs of trial and error i finally beat the boss, the satisfaction was immense i litreally jumped off my chair. 
The learning curve gradually increases, and the bosses are quite annoying, (mainly the human bosses). once you get used to their move set, you can beat the boss you just need a lot of patience. if your stuck anywhere summon visitor at a shrine, you might have to wait some time for the help to arrive, but well worth the wait, if your stuck. also the community is super helpful. you can ping the dissucions chat anytime you want, people will help you.

My issues with the game are numerous, and I've barely started playing. Nearly everything that this game does differently from Dark Souls is to its detriment. Big ass wall of text inc.

My biggest gripe first, there are no menu signs for PC controls. Everything is just for the PS controller. This was also somewhat of an issue in the DS games, however, the menuing is far less intuitive, instead of being able to cycle through the menu with your mouse, you are completely limited to button presses and the default settings are awful. Do you want to switch from the ""weapons"" section to the ""armors"" section in your inventory? Better open up the menu and check your keyboard shortcuts, cause no way in hell could you have guessed that the way to cycle between tabs was with ""1"" and ""2"".  This is especially awful, since there are menus between missions, where you can't open the keyboard binding menu and thus have to trial and error your way through things that could've been solved with mouse clicks. At one point I had to check out what a button is on the forums here cause I've tried literally everything, guess what, the button I should've pressed to do some basic selection was the Mouse Wheel Button, incredibly intuitive.

Another issue is that with a few exceptions, the names of the items make zero sense. Did you just pick up a firebomb? Well, actually it was a Horoku Dama and you have to go into your inventory and read the description to know what it is. The number of items is so large (and I am only on the second mission) that it's a complete chore to read through it all. Worst of all, the people making the game already had a solution for this, as your main healing item reads ""Restores health when used"" at the beginning of its description. If they told you what each item does before the flavor text, this problem could've been avoided. Some items such as arrows are called just that, but for most items you will be clueless about their function because their name is some japanese mumbo jumbo (once again, this is a problem because of how many items there are, in dark souls you maybe have like five usable items with unintuitive effects in the first couple areas, it really is no issue, but here I'm looking at twenty plus)

The  list goes on and on, another notable thing is the level up screen. What the hell is a Ki Pulse? What does increasing it by 30 mean? What are samurai skill points? What does increasing my guardian spirit bond do? What does it mean that I have 21 resistance VS Yokai Realm? None of it makes sense and I really shouldn't have to use external sources to find out what this stuff means.

Another huge issue is that whereas in Dark Souls, gear drops from enemies were rare and unique and usually gear was found in specific pre-set locations only, here they drop very often from regular enemies like in some MMO. I've only been playing for a couple hours (most of my playtime is AFK) and I have pages uppon pages of obsolete weapons and armors that I have to scroll through. I thought the obvious solution to this problem would be to have some mass-sell option, but no. You have to sell every single item individually by double pressing a button, you also have to be careful not to accidentally sell something you dont want to. In addition, you get practically nothing for selling the items.

The cherry on top is that the items are just the same couple of pre-set weapon types, so if you are using a sword, when you pick up a new sword, it will just deal slightly more or slightly less than the one you already have. If it deals less? Gotta go and sell it for zero money to get rid of it. If it deals more? Gotta go into your inventory and equip it to deal 117 damage instead of 115. 

All in all, this game has no regard for its most basic aspects. Despite coming out many years after, the game repeats almost every mistake Dark Souls had and usually does them worse, while introducing glaring new problems. I could say some nice things about it, because the game definietly has a lot of soul, and some innovative elements that are not terrible, but I already wrote the script of a feature length movie here so I think that's be unnecessary. I'm still gonna finish the game but I doubt I'll change my opinion.

That's before you get into the Abyss thing, which is like an endless dungeon.  Overall, this was a winner for the sale price.

Updated Review: This game's okay and I'd recommend it.  It's still painful at times, but I started to enjoy the experience much more when I figured out the magic system.  Definitely do the dojo tutorials!

Original Review: I was beat up and bullied as a child on a regular basis.  Gangs of 3-4 kids would regularly pummel me, knocking me to the ground and kick me in the face.  I would rather relive that experience daily than play this game ever again.

People say it's like Dark Souls but harder, or more like Ninja Gaiden.  This game has some beautiful parts to it, but falls flat on a number of things.  #1) It is really, really easy to fall into holes/water and die while in close combat with big ass demons.  2) The stamina system is a joke.  The challenge of spamming R1 in between combo attacks instead of just focusing on the challenge a monster or boss brings is stupid.  3) Some boss fights can simply be gimicked (fall attack the scorpion over and over again).  4) The item system is dumb - I don't need  a random looter while leveling in a Souls like game.  5) The story is bad.  I could make Witcher comments, Last Samurai jokes, etc. 

I could go on and on about what I don't like.  Let me talk about what I do like.  The level with the rain and lightning looked amazing.  That's it.  That's the one thing.

Some people say the game is fair, which I can understand because overall the game itself doesn't do much completely out of line, but it definitely does have many small unfair moments that are just plain stupid.

Despite these minor issues I do think the overall game is pretty fun, it's likely you'll get your moneys worth if you don't mind dying a lot. The early NG cycles are fine, but the full game definitely caters towards hardcore players and people who don't mind running the same content all the time. That being said, gear is everything in this game so keep upgrading and you won't have that hard of a time.

I won't recommend the game because of the state of the PC port. If you buy it because it's cheaper at least be aware what you're going to struggle with as a mouse&kb player. Frankly, after having played like 2 hours of Nioh 2, I can already tell it's fixed a lot of the port issues and would recommended that over this game.

----

[b]TECHNICAL ISSUES[/b]:

The main reason I cannot recommend this game is because this port kinda sucks. It's a lot better than any of the souls ports though. If you have a controller then it's fine, but I don't and don't plan to buy one just for one game. Also, you REALLY need to remap the controls. FYI, all issues mentioned in this section are fixed in Nioh 2.

First of all, the command prompts are in controller buttons only. This isn't that bad because after a while you learn which controller button is which keyboard button. Unfortunately, certain functionality is locked behind a controller. If you play online mode and then get disconnected you cannot exit the menu that tells you you have disconnected without a controller. All you can do at this point is Alt+F4 and pray you saved recently.

Because the PC port is so shit certain features in the game can switch from being really useful to making you wish you refunded the game before you had more than 2 hours. The auto-target system, which is useful in 1v1 fights, instantly cripples you the moment a second enemy enters the auto-target range. The developers for some godforsaken reason decided to make moving the mouse sideways switch targets, this means that any normal m+kb user will constantly switch between all the enemies several times while trying to fight (and no, this option cannot be changed in the menu). Coupled with Nioh's hard on for putting enemies behind literally every corner, a simple 1v1 encounter can turn into a 3v1 where your camera has a spasm and you die without knowing what really happened.

You need a virtual controller to play the game because the devs assumed everybody would be using a controller and if you don't have one it will constantly freeze the game trying to find one. I used vJoy for this and it solved most of my freezing issues. I also play the game on Windows 7 Compatibility mode as admin. I still have a couple issues like stuck at white screen in cutscenes and random freezes, but they are rare.

[b]DESIGN ISSUES:[/b]

Enemies track you 100% of the time, even when you die. This means that when you are using the revive scroll ninjutsu to revive yourself, enemies may occasionally time a combo so that you die before you can do anything about it while mid-air. This seems like lazy coding but they left it in because it made the game harder. The chance of this happening is low, but it still happens and doesn't feel fair. My tip is to just do nothing and fall normally, this should have proper timing and leave you enough time to block, but I'm not sure when the i-frames end as I have definitely died mid air before.

Enemy stamina is deceptive. Unlike you who cannot attack when you run out of stamina (ki), enemies can still use their attacks with zero ki. Honestly this isn't that big a deal at all and human enemies in particular are susceptible to grapples/finishing, but it does go against the players expectation and just feels like another bullshit moment the first few times you have it happen.

The game sort of expects you to learn everything on your own. So many complex subsystems that are never really explained and very poor demonstrations on how to use skills. Dojos don't really teach anything either, they're just boss fights which expect you to figure it out, but they are good because they purely rely on the skills they're trying to teach. Expect to google a lot of things. On the bright side the game does give you items that it thinks would help in boss fights within the missions.

NPC companions are kinda stupid most of the time. Okatsu/Hanzo keep getting stuck on the ladder in The Demon King Revealed and having a second (or third) person in a fight makes it a lot more unpredictable.

[b]PERSONAL ISSUES[/b]:

Lots of grinding for gear reforging and soul matching. Tons of gold is needed. I don't really like the RNG in reforging but tempering (hidden in reforge menu) is a good system, and when you have enough umbracite it replaces reforging.

This game in particular likes one shots, I'm not sure what to think about it. It annoyed me at first since I would get one shot pretty often by a decent amount of enemies, but I got used to it I guess. Most boss one-shots are well telegraphed and should be easily avoidable unless you fight too high beyond your level or gear level. In later difficulties, just expect most hits to one/two-shot you. There is a reason most players use the revive scrolls.

The amount of traps and surprise encounters in this game makes gameplay a drag at first.

Game feels cheap a lot, a lot of people say artificial difficulty or some stuff like that, but it's just the fact the game likes to pile up lots of unexpected things that you don't really know how any encounters will end up. It's just intentionally irritating and you aren't going to get that many breathers. 

Lots of additions are cheap because they just make the game more annoying without feeling rewarding. Like adding archers to areas that didn't have them instead of making the enemies/bosses more interesting, just wastes my time killing the archers so they don't annoy me. A select few enemies/bosses do gain new moves, but adding archers/cannons to boss fights just feels lazy.

Main story isn't great.

----

[b]WHAT I ENJOYED[/b]:

The combat is top tier, it reminds me of Dragons Dogma in both how fun it is to use different weapon types and how easy it is to switch between different builds. Nioh is superior though because you can respec your stats, can't do this in Dragon's Dogma. Once you get the combat down defeating bosses become very satisfying, especially once you master their movesets.

The NG system is really good. You start with the first 3 regions fully unlocked with all missions and sub-missions available to you. A lot of new stuff such as equip tiers and items are unlocked in different NG cycles. Some bosses and enemies gain new movesets and stronger enemies replace basic enemies in certain areas. Occasionally the addition of too many strong enemies feels lazy, especially since the basic enemies they replaced have new movesets.

Completing all of the main story is not mandatory to beat NG+, instead you only need to beat a set amount of missions (around 18) to unlock the final main story mission. Once you complete the final main story mission, the next difficulty unlocks. 

The DLC is a great addition to the main game. You could tell that they had a lot more time to improve their level design and a lot of bosses were outright badass. More impactful than the main story honestly. Really loved the mysterious samurai boss.

Ninjutsu/Onmyoji can be very useful unlike other games with similar systems. There is so much potential to make your build stronger by incorporating them but you do run the risk of trivializing many encounters.",1621990931,1626701381,False,8,2,0.573740601539611816,0,True,False,False

Nioh is a gear-based souls-like ARPG set in Japanese historic and mythological backgrounds. As a souls-like game, Nioh is quite a unique experience, not only because of its setting (we got Sekiro now), but also its gear-based mechanic that opens so many possibilities for more strategic gameplay. I find the main game immensely fun and satisfying, but DLC 1 and some post-main-game missions are bad because of poor balance.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story is a mixture of actual history and Japanese lore and mythology. It sets at the end of Japanese Sengoku period. The protagonist William is a British pirate (born in Ireland) whose guardian spirit was taken to Japan, so he travelled across the entire planet to save his guardian spirit, during when he learned Japanese martial art and becomes a foreign samurai who can defeat demons. The plot itself is nothing more than a “guy gotta save his waifu” cliché, it is not even a well narrated one, but it reimagines some famous events and many Japanese historic figures make appearances in the story. Even the protagonist Anjin (William’s Japanese name) is an actual person in history. In this aspect, the story is a great treatment for Japanese history lovers. On top of that, it offers its interpretation of the value and behaviors of some historic figures and sheds light on how 義 (means justice and more) meant to them. I am very appreciative of the game showing this cultural aspect to us.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
Nioh has most elements a game in this genre has and offers some unique mechanics: skills, the special attacks that hit hard if you can time it right; stance, three attack methods that maximize benefits of different weapons in different situations; guardian spirits that give different buffs, benefits and living weapons (the Devil Trigger in Nioh); ninjutsu, onmyo magic and general gadgets that give more edges in combat, etc. Most noticeably, the game has lots of armors and weapons with different grades, stats, buffs and special effects. It is like Borderlands but as a souls-like game. More specific about gears, you got the generic three armor types according to weight, and seven weapon types that all play very differently. These elements make combat much more diversified and strategic than the generic “dodge-attack-dodge” souls-like combat formula. Along with perks to be put in different stats, you can make some very sophisticated and featured builds. But because it is level bounded, the game can get grindy. I will talk more in a bit.

[h1]Map Design[/h1]
Map design is a big part of this genre. Nioh is more linear than games like Dark Souls. Not that it doesn’t have Metroidvania-like map design requiring travel back and forth to unlock areas, it is much more straight-line and less complicated to navigate. Its maps are also smaller and separated in different levels, unlike the much larger maps in Dark Souls that blur the concept of “one level”. In fact, I more prefer Nioh’s map design but I guess each has its own fun and features.

I really like Nioh’s map being very organized. For main missions, most maps are divided into two distinct parts, according to savepoints (usually three in each map). This design is mostly consistent so navigation is a lot easier and you have a clear sense of progression to strategize your gameplay (e.g., arrange your healing use). A noticeable outlier is the Sawayama map. Because the map has high environmental similarity and requires lots of backtracking, it is very confusing and disorienting. I regard it as the worst map of all.

There are two other things I like about Nioh’s map. One is that it always has a savepoint near boss room, unlike Dark Souls you have to travel two minutes each time you die. The second thing is each map is designed very differently feature-wise. Such as, some encourage you to explore optional areas, some have multi-layers design, some have environmental hazards, some need backtracking, etc. DLC 1 maps are pretty bad though, as they just pile up powerful enemies.

[h1]Balance[/h1]
The combat is not as hard as Dark Souls, especially with the gadgets. However, two things spice up the difficulty. First is the environment. The game likes giving you very dangerous terrains to walk and fight, or putting enemies in small spaces where you have no room to evade. Second and most importantly is character level. This game is level bounded. High-level enemies can easily overwhelm you, vice versa, but good gears can aid you a lot. If you don’t have them or high enough level, you do dismal damage and cannot sustain one hit or two, which is why submissions are not that “skippable” as they prepared you with enough level for the main missions. 

The real grinding begins after the main game. As the main game prepares you with submissions, the DLCs just jump far beyond the level you can keep up with. It is pretty much a guarantee to take on missions that far above your level, meaning you have to grind at least a bit, or just do a new game + (I think DLCs are meant for after NG+). The minimum you need to do is to grind for DLC 1. DLC 1 is worst in terms of map design (piling up enemies) and balance (enemy and boss design), causing a significant difficulty spike compared to the main game, which is why you need to either grind up your level or find some good weapons. The latter is much faster though. I got some very high damage weapons early in the DLCs, saving me a lot of time. Otherwise, the game kind of becomes a grindfest. 

DLC 1 really sours the experience for deliberately increasing replayability with grinding. It is a turn-off and very exhausting considering it is already a long game. Also, even you can go through the main game with a balanced build, you have to do a build specific for one weapon type to maximize your attack due to the difficulty spike. Fortunately, DLC 2 and 3 are much better and balanced. With good weapons you get before, you can get away with all the grinding.

As long as your level is not too low, the game is balanced well, except DLC 1. As mentioned, it piles up enemies who are powerful, unpredictable and have ridiculously long attack range. It is not I have a problem with tough enemies, they are just too many. Additionally, bosses in DLC 1 are the hardest in an unbalanced way. They just keep coming and coming, leaving you like two seconds to slip in an attack, which feels unfair. As they are too fast and powerful to take advantage of any strategy (debuff lasts like ten seconds), all you can do is just to overwhelm them with immense forces. It is not fun to fight in this way.

All the double boss fight missions have little sense of balance either. In these missions, you fight two beefed-up version bosses at once, who are designed to be fight solo. Those fights are really just clusterfu*ck.

[h1]Misc.[/h1]
The camera freaks out a lot in small and narrow areas. The worst is when fight [spoiler]Nine-Tails[/spoiler]. Her tails just take up the entire screen.

Lock-on is a bit janky. It is hard to see. It automatically cancels when enemy gets a bit far, or boss suddenly jumps or disappears. I get that the latter is to make it more challenging, I just feel it is not the proper way of doing it.

Shooting feels very bad as the sensitivity is weirdly high and non-adjustable.

Sometimes actions like heal or block don’t kick in, even you hear the in-game sound. 

The game uses transliteration for most nouns, so it loses a lot of literal beauty if plays in English. I can’t blame it though, translation is hard.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I am not someone who likes a grindfest, despite how fun it might be. For me, most of this game is fun, but I dislike the unbalanced double boss fights, DLC 1 and the grinding for that. From what I heard, the more playthroughs you do, the more unbalanced and grindy it gets. If this genre is your cup of tea, I say give Nioh a shot, but only do the first playthrough for the optimal experience, then go for Nioh 2.",1625297714,1626618816,True,11,1,0.641119480133056641,0,True,False,False

The game gradually makes me feel so frustrated due to the unfair difficulty.  Many creeps spawned in cluster, mini bosses spawned in cluster, even in some mission you have to deal with 2 bosses at the same time. Most of the boss fights take place in such a narrow area, it's very common to stuck in some decorations when dodging and got hit in the face. Bosses are also been overused, old bosses will be used as mini bosses in the next map not just once but multiple times. The creeps are the same, it just have a few typical enemies for some maps, the game just mix them together to make new level. I don't know if the devs are lazy or something. The last thing will be the key bindings, it's true that the key bindings is the real boss of this game. I play this game with mouse and keyboard but it just display controller key icon when interact with something. I wonder if anyone can play this game with the default key bindings, I've tried and it is a true nightmare.

Was quite excited to try this one BUT I kind of want to use this review as an opportunity to warn anyone else interested in this as Nioh 1 is also quite flawed, which is why you probably should only pick this up at a steep discount.

The port is quite shoddy: it has known reproducible crash bugs on top of random crashes and the game can heavily stutter in given transition areas (can be anywhere in the field or right when entering boss rooms) regardless of hardware. There are plenty of bugs unrelated to the port as well such as custom controller bindings breaking for no apparent reason or the camera going out-of-bounds for anywhere from a full second to save reload. (which can rob you of your progress)

Besides technical issues, the game can be quite repetitive due to endless content re-use which becomes all too apparent about 10-15 hours in: same monotonous enemies from start to end (bosses are not spared), same mundane music for most areas/bosses, same dull environments, same flood of RNG loot, you get the point. DLC fixes none of these issues and might force you to farm utterly soulless side missions if you can't deal with the enormous jump in enemy HP/damage.
Story-wise, it peaks with the pocket cat-clock then it's all downhill from there, it won't really hold your attention even if you're interested in Sengoku Japan.

I'm still giving this a thumbs up as it is decent enough and has its moments but it's more of a ""yeah, maybe on sale"" than anything else. Check out the games Nioh is very obviously inspired by before delving into it.",1626514973,1626535790,True,3,0,0.539923965930938721,0,True,False,False

I bought this game a while ago when it was on sale and never touched it for a long time thinking it was simply Dark Souls in Feudal Japan. But then I saw XLHGladiator and other Youtubers do combo vids for this game and the veil of limitation was lifted.

Dark Souls was merely an inspiration. This game's combat is vastly different to Dark Souls.

You see all the hours I spent in this game? It's not because I was tinkering in some character build, or min/maxing equipments, or grinding bosses for legendary gear. No, most of those hours were spent trying to master the beastly combat system.

Sure, you can simply play it like Dark Souls all the way through but I implore all of you to instead approach this game like an action game.

So, what makes the combat so much fun? Without complicating and making this review any longer than it should be I will simply say combining the two main mechanics: stance switching while ki pulsing. Like Dark Souls your hero has a stamina bar - this time called ki. If you use up all your ki you cannot perform any action and are left in a vulnerable state. That's where ki pulsing comes into play. If you pulse with the right timing you recover lost ki without waiting for it to recharge on it's own. Oh, and ki pulsing can also cancel moves so you can actually link combos together to form combo strings.
 
Stance switching allows you to switch to low, mid, and high stance. Each stance has their disadvantages and advantages. The main point however is to combine the two main mechanics so you can get this game’s equivalent to DMC’s JUMP CANCEL: FLUX and FLUX II.

Once you master those two techniques you can create very long combo strings without running out of ki too quickly or even better – a possible infinite loop.
  
Oh and this game also has 7 different types of weapons for you to master. Each one has their own combo tree to unlock. Plus you can switch weapons on the fly just like DMC. And certain weapons even allow you to parry (only limited to human enemies).
 
Another interesting layer on top of the mechanics: you know how you rely on ki? Well, your enemies run on ki too. So it would be in your best interest to deplete their ki to zero opening even more combo options and in the case of yokai-type enemies: hit-stun.
 
And on top of that if you’re REALLY creative: you can implement elemental magic, guardian summons, status effects, and other RPG staples into your repertoire (It is actually possible to juggle human-type enemies in the air – like TEKKEN!).

This game is just too much fun.

Arguably the best combat system I have seen in a game in a while. It was fluid, satisfying and just well done! Then I got to the first actual boss, and was absolutely disappointed. I realized that this game was the type of game to just give a boss ridiculous health and able to basically one shot you no problem. The armor also kinda didnt seem to make much of a difference when I played, and I get that I was still early game so there isnt going to be a massive difference, but going from heavy to light armor should mean something right? I honestly didnt know what any of the items really were in the time i played. I wanted this game to he perfect, but it just isn't honestly the only good thing I have to say is that the combat system is phenominal! I have high hopes for Nioh 2, please just take the combat system from this game and touch it as little as possible for Nioh 2.

*Edited after giving the game another chance

I changed from not recommending, because I gave the game another chance. While I still feel some of what I said is still valid I do feel my statement about the armor might not be true. I enjoy heavy armor builds and I feel like this game does make that fairly satisfying. The game is a little older at this point but I do not feel like it shows. The combat in this game is still very fun but I do feel like this game can suffer at points from health sponges.

But, this doesn't feel like a challenge.. more like an unforgiving death simulator. I played around with different weapons, tried the stances, practiced and repeatedly died solely because stamina consumption is so high you can barely get a combo started before an enemy miraculously gains stamina and blocks you, then retaliates.

I tried really hard for see the enjoyment, but it just isn't there. Enemies will all the sudden just turn on anti-flinch and ignore your hard hitting attacks. I don't understand why any enemy can do this.. but it's grossly unfair.. even in the beginning. The game doesn't tell you much in terms of why the enemies just don't care about attacks all the sudden. If I use an Axe, in high stance and connect with plenty of time.. it should do the same stagger or flinch that ANY weapon does to me regardless of stance. Giving them unfair advantages based on the mechanics of the game is not how difficulty works. 

Love the asthetics, hate the gameplay. The controls feel nice and crisp until you realize all the weird and unfair bullshit enemies that ignore anything you do and get free hits. That combined with the shitty stamina, you feel like a fat kid in steel plate armor. The main character has stances in fighting, trained previously and still can't swing more then two or three times or dodge more than once before gasping for air.

First of all, I bought this game when it was on sale and it was totally worth the price and I strongly recommend it, especially if you catch it on sale. 
Pros:
- Not the best story, but a good one.
- Good world building, I really like the Yokai designs
- Again I can't compare it to Dark Souls, I liked the mechanics: You can use different types of weapons, you can use some type of magic and ninja stuff during the battle, you also have a guardian spirit animal which gives you different advantages. Armor types and the bonus they give is also quite rich.
- It is a mixture of actual story and a fictitious world. You will meet actual historical figures from Japan during the gameplay. They are not very accurate of course but a very cool touch.

Cons:
- I agree with a lot of the comments, enemy variety is pretty limited. Even boss fights can get quite repetitive.
- DLCs are stupidly difficult for a not-so-interesting story content. (You also hit a level cap, so you can't just grind to get stronger unlike the main story)
- Some bosses have artificial difficulty instead of being challenging in a fun way.

Anyway, it still provides a lot of content and you won't regret if you buy it from a sale. For the full price, I would think twice though.

485510,94554295,76561198076277797,0,110,1705,0,1509,1624872608,"I thought it would be interesting to take notes on what Nioh 1 does differently from its sequel, Nioh 2, since I started with Nioh 2 and enjoyed it greatly and wanted to play Nioh 1 for the plot (and to try out the Living Weapon system and see how it compared to the Yokai Shift one from 2).

Consider this less a review of the game and more of a point of reference for others who have, like me, started with the sequel for its appeal and are now considering getting into the first to extend their playtime in this alternate-history fantasy universe.

Also it goes without saying my review is totally going to spoil aspects of both games as far as features go. I don't think there's anything in here that would ruin either game for anyone, but I feel like it's worth mentioning that this list, while not necessarily comprehensive (I'm sure I've missed some things or forgotten to write them down), is a bit long. About 40 notes long barring inevitable formatting changes when I finish typing this out. (Expect a large portion of this list to be in comment form. Review size is limited and I'm not messing with the stupid guide feature of Steam. I hate it.)

I'll put a + or - before each number to state whether I think it's overall a positive or negative. Feel free to disagree. If there's an =, just assume it's neutral or has pros and cons to it. Usually in the case of something being replaced, even if it might be lesser in some way. I'm less harsh on this because it was the first entry in the Nioh series and it can't be held responsible for all the things the developers got right the second time around that improved the series.

Alright, so without further ado, Nioh 2 fans, here is a pros and cons list (from my own personal perspective) of Nioh 1's features:

= 1. ""Living Weapon"" (Nioh 1) replaces ""Yokai Shift"" (Nioh 2). ""Living Weapon"" essentially channels your equipped Guardian Spirit into your weapon, giving you the same period of immunity that Yokai Shift did but the only visual change to your character is the distinct elemental glow of your weapon. Whatever element your Guardian Spirit is, your weapon will be.

- 2. No ""Burst Counter"" or ""Burst Attacks"" from enemies. Understandably it's not in this game and some people may be happy about that, but I liked the addition so it's a con for me.

- 3. No ""Benevolent Graves"". In my opinion perhaps the most essential mechanic in Nioh 2 for me to enjoy it. Summoning players isn't reliable, let's be honest. Sometimes players feel like being jerks and sometimes they overperform because they're way too high of a level and way too knowledgeable about the areas they're traversing. Benevolent Graves summon AI versions of players, not players themselves (and on PS4 where I play Nioh 2 that's great since you can use them without paying for online). They're great distractions for enemies but don't overdo it to the point that you can't enjoy the difficulty of the boss fight.

- 4. No ""Kodama Bazaar"". A shame. It was great for stocking on ochoko cups, ammo, and semi-randomized utility items to prepare for bosses or tough enemies.

- 5. No character creation. You can, however, customize William's hairstyle and beard from four basic options. No change in hair color or anything else. Transformations still exist.

- 6. The ""Refashion"" system doesn't display William. Instead you see Senji Tome sitting in her chair. Not very helpful for deciding on your new look. You kinda have to just guess or exit after every change and check your equipment to see William's new look.

+ 7. The ""Spirit"" stat. I don't recall if Nioh 2 had this stat, but I'm 99% sure it didn't. There are other ways to get similar effects, but not as straight-forward as this. Basically, Spirit is a stat you can level that makes it easier to get into the Living Weapon state and reduces the cooldown between uses.

= 8. Mixed languages. I'm sure the Japanese options in Nioh 2 probably does this the same way, but since nearly everyone in Nioh 2 is Japanese, it's pretty irrelevant. You have to turn on subtitles in the game to understand non-English-speaking characters. It's fine. I think it's nice to have the mix of languages, it feels more authentic. Though subtitles are not fun to read when trying to fight off a giant, quick and deadly Yokai.

- 9. No ""Soul Cores"" or Yokai abilities. Yokai abilities added a lot to the game and were really fun ways to customize your character in Nioh 2. Nioh 1 doesn't have them. Soul Cores can also heal you in 2 (I think you need to invest in the skills in the skill tree in order to get any of that, though) and replenish your ability gauge, so it was extra handy to have them in-game to save for a tough spot. They're like a free elixir and ability use on-the-spot.

+ 10. Can ""Soul Match"" items with lower rarities to upgrade their level. Nioh 2 won't raise the level if the rarity is below the item you're trying to improve. It's a waste of money and time. Nioh 1 is more forgiving.

- 11. Skill trees are way more confusing. I mean when you sit down and look at them, they're easy enough to figure out, and Nioh 2's wasn't perfect either, but at a glance you can figure out where things are a bit better (upper stuff is high stance, lower is low stance, yada yada). Nioh 1's is just bad. It works, but they fixed it up to be something much more palatable for 2.

- 12. No ""auto-use"" option for skill-point-giving items. Whatever. I didn't even know the option existed in 2 until the game was over, but it's still a con to not have it.

- 13. Can't disable the ""[excess item] sent to storage"" messages. Donate a bunch of stuff to the Kodama shrines and you'll see what I mean. It's not a big deal, just extra clicking, but still annoying.

+ 14. Armor often has (L)(M)(H) in the item's name to denote Light, Medium and Heavy armor respectively. Probably unnecessary and maybe I'd prefer it not to have this, but it has its uses so it's a pro.

- 15. Menu is a bit less clean and straight-forward. Also, I think it doesn't default to moving your cursor back to the top when you close the equipment screen the way 2 does? Not sure. It felt off, that's all I know.

- 16. ""Samurai"" skill tree isn't in Nioh 1.
+ 16a. All skill points besides ""Ninjutsu"" and ""Onmyo"" are called ""Samurai"" skill points and can be invested in ANY weapon. Many of the Samurai skill tree's passives are in these other weapon trees, thankfully.

- 17. ""Ki Pulse"" must be perfect (get back all of your Ki with a Ki Pulse) to purify Yokai Realm pools. Annoying, but eh, what can you do?

= 18. ""Purify"" and ""Corruption"" weapon effects/elements are replaced with ""Wind"" and ""Earth"" in this game. No complaints. Different elements, different styles. I think it's a nice change of pace. (This also means Yokai weapons are *not* in this game. Sadly.)

- 19. Oni-bi (floating elemental heads) can stagger you just from getting close. Annoying.

- 20. Can't understand/translate Yokai. Can still hear their last thoughts in Japanese after beating them.

- 21. No ""Dark Realm"" areas. I liked them. Clearing them got rid of them for good and made traversal easier for certain spots. Good addition for Nioh 2.

+ 22. Multiple unique bosses that Nioh 2 doesn't have. (Most are Yokai!)

- 23. ""Odachi"" weapons are in the ""Sword"" category. You can refashion normal swords into them, but... it's confusing and messes with proper sorting. No thanks. Separate them.

+ 24. Nearly all Guardian Spirits are unique from Nioh 2. At least in design if not concept. Only like two so far I've seen that were in 2.

- 25. You can get character information out of order depending on what you unlock first and it's kinda dumb how you unlock some of them. Beating humans 3 times to get info? You'll never want to do that, human bosses blow. Nioh 2 kept it simple.

- 26. Intentionally inconvenient shrine placement and convoluted map design. Some are alright, but many, particularly later ones, are kinda... ehh.

Nioh is a brutally tough game, but if you stick with it, it does become quite a joy to play. 

Now I get it, after 140 hours of thoroughly enjoying Nioh.

Without giving spoilers to the game, you basically play as a foreigner in Japan, chasing a mad scientist that stole something from you.

Throughout the story, you will encounter a vast variety of characters that you will assist and even face in battle. The game is structured in a mission style, each story or battle is a separate entity and you can play them in any order once you've beaten them once. There are main missions that follow the story and then side missions that either add lore, weapons, characters, monsters etc.

One of the best parts of this game is the gear, there is just so much cool loot. You can have two melee weapons, two ranged weapons, body armour and accessories equipped. And just like all good games, it comes in a variety of flavors. From starting out with normal ""White"" gear, you eventually start earning Blue/Yellow/Purple items that all scale as you get them. But for those who progress further, there's the Divine & Ethereal class of items that have ridiculous stats and effects. But to note that Ethereal can only be obtained on like the max difficulty level.

There is also a Blacksmith that you can buy/forge/dismantle items at and her forge can be upgraded by completing some select missions later in the game. You even get to add a Legendary figure to the blacksmith staff that most people will recognise by name.

Combat in the game is very diverse. You have a variety of weapons to use (Swords, Dual Swords, Tonfa, Spear, Axe etc), as well as Ninjutsu and Magic. Each one can be customised based on what skills you want from its tree, and it makes combat extremely satisfying. Then there is also The Guardian spirits, in essence its a familiar based on lore. There are a lot of Guardians, most of which you unlock as you progress through the story, and there are some that can only be obtained from side missions. They add certain stats or effects based on which one you choose, and also allows you to use Living Weapon mode (think of it like when Aang goes Avatar mode)

There is a huge variety of enemies, everything from canon fodder to some insane boss designs. Yet again, all based on lore regarding these creatures. The game also has a ""Pokedex"" of sort, where it lists all the enemies you have fought, their stats like weaknesses etc and also how many you've killed or been killed by.

The game also has an online component, where you can join a clan to gain buffs and gear. As well as the option to play the game co-op by having a partner join you in missions. I didn't personally use this so I don't know how this affects the difficulty of the missions. There is a system to find people online, but in my experience trying it, I couldn't find anyone. The Steam community hub only had around 500 players online at any given time.

Although the game is now considered ""old"", the graphics still look great and its a ton of fun to play once you get the hang of it. Add to that, that when you buy the Complete Edition, you get access to the 3 DLC's which adds like another 30 hours of content at least and builds on from where the story ends. 

I never thought I'd say this, but I highly recommend picking this game up.",1624787084,1624787084,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

The story is really interesting to me, but it cant make up for the lackluster and infuriating experience of actually playing the game.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that the enemies dont always stick to the rules imposed on us by the game. There is a stat called Ki (stamina/poise joint stat) which is consumed by running, dodging, attacking, taking damage or by being hit while guarding. Upon hitting zero, you are unable to attack, run or dodge. If you are hit while guarding at zero ki, you go into an immobile state and are vulnerable to finisher combos... except, enemies in the game will, at random times, forget that this rule exists and will continue on with their combos, running and dodging despite running out of ki. This leads to many instances of the player going in to attack an enemy after whittling away at their ki until it hit zero and expecting them to be stunned, only to have the enemy tank it for no reason and one shot you while you are vulnerable during the end-lag of your attack.",1624578595,1624580209,False,10,6,0.506975769996643066,0,True,False,False

Where it copies Dark Souls it is merely derivative. Where it differs, it stumbles. It has too much stuff, like an overabundance of weapons. It has too many unnecessary, complex, and unexplained systems, like Ki Pulse or weapon specials. It is too repetitive, with a limited number of enemies, and a limited number of tricks to deploy against the player. It is too easy, compared to the depth of Dark Souls. And the story is too disconnected from the gameplay mechanics, rendering it uninteresting and cliched. Nioh thinks more is better, but it would be better if it lost a limb or two.

I like Dark Souls - it has a magic to it.  Nioh has some cool concepts that make it unique, but sadly, the game is ruined by it's AMAZINGLY TERRIBAD story and broken monster/boss mechanics.

At first, enemies have to be studied - that's good. The game was punishing like we expected. You have to learn how to defeat them, but by mid game every boss and monster can one shot you - they are insanely fast and SPAMMY (Hope you can dodge that insta kill move 4 times in quick succession).  You have to cheese them to win - at least I did TIPS *** Sloth and Weakness are your friends ***. There is a lot of frustrating parts of the game - it is grindy af, there is a looter shooter equipment but like dark souls style for item drops, level designs have parts that just insta gib you (until you learn what to look out for **** floors that look different, spiders on the ceiling, monsters in the corners, ninjas on the roofs, dwellers on the side rails, mines on the narrow ledges, bats in the caves ***). It was like that game wanted you to just die at points. I spent a lot of time studying corners and looking behind walls - I did like the levels and traversing them was the most enjoyment I could find in the game play followed by fighting the trash mobs and enemy revenants (copies of players who had died at a specific spot), but I HATED every boss after it become about, ""How do I abuse a game mechanic to win here?"" Instead of being good with game play. I can use MARIA as an example, you zone into the room and she insta charge impales you, and you die.  I assume if you're the games ""RECOMMENDED"" 170 lvl to do the level.. you might survive, but doing every side mission and never not being able to retrieve my Amirta/Souls I was only around 112 lvl when I reached that point. Compare this to Black Dragon Kalameet in Dark Souls a punishing ass boss but FUN to fight. I didn't have fun fighting bosses here.  There is be boss battles where you have to fight multiple enemies and the targeting goes BONKERS in you'll be targeting one with a combo and suddenly switch to another mid attack - swinging aimlessly.  In single combat the targeting is great, but if you  add in another enemy good luck keeping where you need/want it to be as the game will just switch for you. 

While I did play the entire game to completion I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The stance based combat is a cool idea. The game is faster than Dark Souls. I enjoyed building and min/maxing William, but overall I couldn't care less about the story or the characters.. They had all these cool ideas but just dropped the ball at every turn. There is a good game located somewhere in here, but the NIOH you get isn't it.

As a Souls veteran,  Nioh's main story feels kinda dragged out. This might be forgiven or even overlooked if the game did not utilize the over world map/hub as opposed to a free-ranging open world build. I got so extremely frustrated and fatigued by the mid-point that I nearly gave up.

The stamina mechanic, while solid, has a major learning curve and can be overly harsh at times - small attacks, from smaller trash enemies, can leave you open to single hit kills from a variety of foes which can be maddening.

There is a boss about 2/3 of the way through whose AOE attack is honestly some of the worst game balance since the Bed of Chaos.  No way to block, dodging can be iffy, and if you roll unluckily, it can hit you twice and be a insta-death.

Additionally, the level designers felt very trigger happy with so many insta-death environmental hazards (specifically ledges on narrow passages).

My last point may or may not be on me but it also felt like the game chugged along worse than it should have on specific levels - levels where it was raining or had mist just ran super slowly despite me turning the settings I could down in those instances.",1623816119,1623816119,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay and fighting is genius and super satisfying, especially as an old ninja gaiden fan.
I can recommend the game if you play trough Normal mode NG+ and NG++, if you go to Ng+++ and++++ way of the wise and way of the nioh, which are the true endgame and are required to unlock the ""real"" gear it falls apart and the cracks in the core game become so obnoxious its jaw dropping.

Let me explain the problems so you have an idea if its worth your time and money.
I play Rpgs/Arpgs a lot and check builds metas a lot and copy them/give them my own spin. Nioh also has metas and builds, quite a lot even. If you want to nowadays find good builds its really hard, many forum posts and youtube videos are strong builds that got nerfed, furthermore i found out the hard way that many content creators make videos of hitting insane high damage numbers. What they dont tell you is that over 90% of those videos where taken in a lower difficulty. Which means the damage scaling was extremely multiplied and not close to the damage they deal if they hit enemies on their own level. 
And here is the biggest problem in Nioh, ITS SCALING. OMFG i never seen scaling in a game so terrible, for example you are level 50 and do a level 70 mission, an enemy hits you with 3000 damage, then you are level 120 and you use the same gear and only put skill points into damage, so your resistence, armor, health is all the same, the enemy will only hit you of a fraction the damage, like 300-500. So the problem soon becomes either you are unterleveled and have an terrible experience because everything one shots you and you cant learn movement sets, or you are overleveled and enemies become so trivial its boring. And this is the core problem, and with each NG+ it magnifies. 
I continued playing and change builds , try many different tactics in the hope it gets better, but in way of the wise and way of the nioh the game has gotten so obnoxious its terrible.

In the standard game the enemy AI has problems already and it gets much worse later. For example range enemies have literally aimbot. Melee enemies can start an attack and while you move out the way they can change their attack direction mid flight/mid animation, just as they have an aimbot. Both range and melee hits stagger you nonestop, which causes stun spirals where you can do nothing once it started. Boss arenas, you go inside and before you can even move, the boss is already literally flying onto your position one shotting you, or hitting you with a slow spell or stun spell, which get more frequent in NG+++ and ++++. Thats also the worst thing in +++ and ++++ , its that some strong(red glowing) enemies have buffs on them and cause debuffs on you, and bosses do the same, so you dont only have to avoid every hit but some of those debuffs are casts that are unblockable, so you have to perma stun/abuse living weapon/meta/do crazy damage or it becomes just unplayable. 

So tank builds which are possible for lower difficulties are later on completely useless, you pretty much have to cheese the bosses or game so hard and abuse mechanics like living weapon or stun bosses/enemies or you chances drop to 0.001. Thats why most of the meta is living weapon and abuse of it, because the core game is so flawed later on that abuse is necessary . And thats a terrible sign design wise.

Also the amount of research you have to do to really understand all the mechanics is overwhelming, upgrading, leveling, farming, stats, best stats, skills, unlocks, its really frustrating , the game has tutorials and informations, but its not at all clear enough to get a good build going and into higher levels.

Also the insane amount of money and Amrita(exp) you have to grind later on is insane, it gets so crazy its in the billions...
And everything , from reforging to soul match has unpayable requirements. So if you wanted to upgrade your earlier gear you farmed from level 150 to 200 its so expensive its not worth it, so you have to forge/farm new items and reforge stats until your set is back on the same level as before. Its just retarded, they could just have made the leveling up of your gear reasonable priced so you slowly progress your build. But forging and reforging your items is much cheaper, just much more time intensive and annoying.
I recommend going into the endless Abyss, using droplets that drop from bosses and corrupting your gear at the shrine, its the same as leveling them up but much cheaper. But also harder to fight depending on your gear and level.

I love the weapon variety, you CAN make all weapons work in a build, but sooner or later you find out that some weapons and their Skills are so superior that you would be disabling yourself if you dont use it.

You can thank god reskill in nioh, but its also dumb, you reset everything, instead of taking points out of one thing and putting it into another you have to completely rebuild everything, thousands of skill points later on into your skill tree. Its obnoxious.

Now i give you some game advices: 

If you want faster progression in Amrita and money you should try unlocking the next difficulty as soon as possible, the rewards are insanely higher and you can level so fast there, so after beating the game the last mission in the main game is always The Queens Eyes, beat it and go on the main map into higher difficulty, then you dont have to play the main missions anymore, you can choose which main and side missions you wanna play in the next difficulty and you have to progress until you unlock the region with the mission The Queens Eyes again. Repeat until reaching way of the Nioh, the last one. So you can make your life so much easier by doing that, and level up much faster and get better gear. And because of scaling you can farm lower stuff later on super fast and easy.

The first region called Kyushu Region has an quest called A Request from Ginchiyo, you can use it to level up in much higher diffculties, you have an AI partner which pulls aggro and does good damage so you get exp by her killing foes, and you can beat the mission without killing anyone, you have to check 3 spawn locations for a chest and open it.

Another old farm for Amrita(exp) is in the omi region called The demon king revealed, run trough killing all Yokai enemies, if you use sake your amrita multiplies even more. And you can use an Himorogi Branch to leave the mission any time without loosing Amrita or have to fight the end bosses.

The endless abyss is really important to upgrade your gear and make it from devine into ethereal rarity, the abyss has 999 floors but you can only go to floor 30 until you have beaten the queens eyes on way of the nioh. Which i find again super dumb, because you cant overlevel your gear to do better damage with the weapon and gear you like, you have to play in a certain way/meta until you unlock the true endgame. Then you can make your gear level 320+120 , that is the max upgrade.

In the Tokai region , play the mission The trail of the master, its very important because it will unlock the upgrade for the smith.

No matter the build always put 20-40 points into ninjutsu and onmyo magic , the support it gives you(buffs, debuffs, tools) are essential to beat the game and especially higher difficulties. 
In Ninjutsu learn , medusa powder, paralytic groundfire for stuns, quick change scroll(its a second live), cat walking and Supa for being invisible and sneaking by if you are stuck or want to avoid fights.
In magic learn most important Sloth talisman max it out is best, its the best skill in the game. Weakness talisman is good so is Carnage talisman, Pleiades and extraction talisman(they are pretty much required for every living weapon build)

If you reforge stats, u can switch materials into divine fragments, it will increase the chance of rare stats by a lot.

1 - You don't become invincible while opening doors or performing killing strikes.
2 - Everything is binded to its level, and the more you proceed through the story, the bigger level locations have. 
No matter what level you are or armor you carry - mobs can do one hit kill on any stage of game. A big scary youkai oneshots you on the first mission - the same one oneshots you on the tenth mission - you simply do not feel any progress, which is tbh pretty frustrating. 
3 - Lots of mobs and bosses has screwed up hitboxes, thus, your weapon can miss the target when it's not supposed to, but those bastards can hit you either.
4 - Byakko boss battle.
5 - Locations are not interesting to explore. I liked the first few though.

Reasons why I recommend this game:
1 - The combat is nice if you ignore this hitbox problem. I also liked the idea that you cannot move and have to catch a breath when your ki is depleted by enemies strike.

+ Wonderful challenging experience that escalates slowly
+ Unique and pleasing artstyle especially the stylized cutscenes
+ Memorable music and effects that makes specific locales memorable
+ Immense number of locations and settings each hand crafted and distinct
+ Vast variety of items & equipment to match the numerous foes & bosses to knock out
+ Multiple difficulties Diablo-style with each offering additional upgrades as the challenge escalates
+ Nice UI and interface sans the shitty limited shortcuts not well ported
+ Difficulty much easier than Sekiro/about the same as DS games until endgame where enemies can one hit KO

- Story is a mess; annoying girl in DLC makes your ears bleed from listening to stupidity
- Some bosses frustrating - not helped by the engine having many shortcomings in hit detection/warping
- Some stages (water temple) have very poor out of bounds logic killing you quite frequently
- Endgame grows tiresome; variety missing after the first two/three/four/five difficulties
- Number of items limit upgrade options as 99% of loot becomes useless and starts the cleaning inventory minigame
- Camera logic leaves a lot to be desired and can crash the game/kill you - do disable the action camera option

It looks wonderful and it runs like a charm in 2K at 60 fps on my Windows 10 / 1080Ti PC. I feel like Koei Tecmo can be pretty hit and miss as a company, but their partnership with developer Team Ninja here has paid off. 

While comparisons to Dark Souls abound, Nioh is more like the spiritual successor to Ninja Gaiden (which, as it happens, Dark Souls owes quite a bit to itself). It builds on Team Ninja's always exceptionally fluid-feeling combat (cf. Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive) and offers a robust plethora of combat techniques, weapons, stances, buffs, debuffs, magic, ninjitsu, charms and accessories -- all of which fall squarely into that sweet spot of ""easy to learn/hard to master"" addictiveness. There isn't a weapon in the game that isn't tremendous fun to use, or any that feel broken or OP. The combat in this game is so good that I find myself continually replaying completed levels/missions, just for the pleasure of practicing with new weapons and techniques, or grinding for more loot and XP (""Amrita"" in this game). 

After an interesting and challenging prologue that gives you a general feel for the game's combat and style of difficulty -- which emphasizes thinking fast, dodging, and actually paying attention to your attacks and what they do -- you're asked to choose two weapons to specialize in and a ""spirit animal"" to guide you and grant you special powers. Don't sweat this much -- what you choose here mainly just determines the stats you get a single extra point in, and which two weapons you'll find first when you begin the first actual mission. You will find all the weapon types well before the end of the first mission, and have ample chance to take your time and experiment with all of them -- and you'll be rewarded with various types of skill points for doing so. Your spirit animal isn't hugely important in the beginning, and you'll eventually have the chance to change that out later too. 

Levelling up happens at what I found to be a very satisfying pace -- you level up frequently, but do have to work a bit for each new level (at least after the first 10 or so). Each new level allows you to assign a skill point to a stat of your choice. This is also something you shouldn't sweat too much. Before long you'll have access to a shop where you can buy a ""Book of Reincarnation"" that will allow you to completely respec, if something isn't to your liking. The game also lets all the stats kind of overlap -- it's not as specific as ""this increases HP, this increases weight carry, this increases speed,"" etc. Instead, each stat buffs a somewhat nebulous arrangement of things. Generally speaking, you'll want to focus mainly on the stats that are tied to the weapons you think you're going to prioritize, and the levelling menu shows you very clearly which stat is tied to which weapons. But know that all weapons remain viable options at all times irregardless of this -- those you prioritize will just do a little extra damage and, eventually, benefit from more specialized moves. 

The game is very loot-friendly, to an almost Diablo-esque degree, so another thing not to sweat is which weapons and armor you equip. You'll be getting new drops constantly, but weapons become stronger as you increase your ""familiarity"" with them by using them consistently -- so once you have one you like, stick with it for a bit, then see if you have something worth swapping it out for every now and then. When there's one you particularly like, ""lock"" it in your menu, but get used to sacrificing the rest at shrines for extra Amrita (xp), ""disassembling"" them for extra crafting parts at the Blacksmith you'll have access to after the first mission, or hanging on to the better ones for ""soul matching,"" a process you'll use to strengthen the weapons and armor you are actually using.  

Organizing and navigating all the loot is relatively intuitive and functions well -- a simple click of the thumbstick will sort the items in various ways (by level, type, rarity, etc.), and RB/LB take you through various grouped listings. Between all the equipment, skills, special abilities, and other odds and ends, however, there is a fairly in-depth character menu to navigate. It's well-designed and easy to use, and the tutorials at the Dojo you'll have access to will clarify the purpose of the various sub-tabs and minor skill/perk assignments as you go. 

While I'm far from finished with the game despite the 70+ hrs I've logged at the time of this review, the level design is generally very satisfying to me. Nioh doesn't boast the single large, interconnected world of Dark Souls, instead breaking things into individual missions and sub-missions, but the inclusion of an overworld map, ability to replay missions any time, and specialized, extra-difficult ""twilight"" missions that can be optionally tackled for access to superior loot, all contribute to making Nioh feel like just as much of a living, breathing universe as Dark Souls. In a way, the overworld map and ability to choose from multiple missions give it even more of an epic RPG feel, instead of feeling like just one gigantic single level with different areas, a la Dark Souls. And while the missions vary a bit in terms of their degree of linearity, generally speaking, they have an at least semi-""open"" design, where there are multiple ways to go, and paths that sort of loop back around on themselves as various shortcuts are unlocked. I like open world games, and while Nioh is not that, it breathes and gives you numerous options for the how/when/where of most things. 

As far as difficulty goes, it is a difficult game. I have a mixed relationship with highly difficult games -- I appreciate that more is expected of me than mindless button mashing, but I also play games for fun, not stress/frustration. For me, Nioh's difficulty works. You have a lot of freedom to grind and take your time to feel ""ready"" for the next challenge around the bend, but you can't grind your way into game-breaking overpoweredness, either. So to progress you will have to both grind (which is generally a pleasure because the combat is excellent), as well as consciously observe/practice/improve your combat technique. And while the difficulty gets expectedly frustrating at times, I can't honestly say I often -- if ever -- felt that the game was just being cheap/unfair with its difficulty. Most obstacles and enemies felt immediately surmountable, but each new enemy takes a little getting to know and some practice to master, and often times, you can't survive more than a few hits. This actually feels realistic in a way, taking me back to fond memories of Bushido Blade on the PS1, where one swift move with a katana would simply end the life of the opponent in front of you. 

The game does have a multiplayer component -- however, this is not of much interest to me, and I haven't explored it much, so I cannot comment on that. From what I've seen, I imagine it's fine. You will find the ""graves"" of other players littered quite liberally through the solo campaign, and you can optionally battle them at the sites of their death for extra experience or a chance at getting some of the loot they had on them when they died. 

CONCLUSION: 

All in all, if you like games like Dark Souls, God of War, Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, etc. -- and/or if you've liked other games by Team Ninja -- you should absolutely love Nioh. For my money, it is easily as good as any of those games, and may well be my favorite of them all. While it has a reasonably good reputation, I am surprised its popularity isn't more dominant than it is. It really is a fantastic game, and while some aspects of its execution may appeal to you more or less depending on your subjective preferences, I'd be very hard-pressed to find anything negative to say about it. (I recently had a chance to try the sequel, and prefer this).",1593758848,1621328282,True,4,0,0.514455795288085938,0,True,False,False

----

I think there is a great game here but if you're a mouse & keyboard guy, like me, don't bother with this title.

I just don't get how a gaming studio can put in years of work and make a (probably) fantastic game, but when they bring it over to another platform they fuck it up beyond belief.  I guess it's a classic money grab, spit on the whole PC community and say 'screw em, let them suffer if they don't use a controller'.

A PC game has a pretty standard way of doing input controls these days.  Menus have their own keybindings along side with actions so if you want to go to your inventory you press 'I' or for the talent menu you press 'n' or 'p' by default, and all these keys are configurable.  In addition you expect to use the mouse to point and click and interact intelligently with the UI.   In Nioh there is none of that; they just mapped the controller inputs to keys and mouse buttons so you get the same awkward navigation system of select something, select sub something, select sub sub something, etc.   It's pathetic.  

Even worse is the gameplay actions, for example for stance changes you're forced to use [modifier]+key. so for example ctrl+1, ctrl+2, why the fuck would I want that?  I would much rather press 1,2 or 3 or F1,F2,F3.  Same crap with weapon swapping ctrl + mouse down to change melee weapon and ctrl + mouse up to switch ranged weapon, try using all this fluidly along with wsad to move, shift to block and space to dodge.  Oh and btw there are for some insane reason 3 key bindings for dodge, you have to guess which one works.. I found around level 20 that I had actually played the game without proper dodge, yay...

It's too bad really, I would have liked to play more to figure out if I really like the game, now I am just unable to play more due to the terrible implementation of input controls for PC users.  After 10-14 hours all I can say is that I liked the grind aspect, basic combat mechanisms, the world etc.  I am unsure if I like the stat system, don't think I got far enough to be able to determine if the game allows me to actually modify my character.  In early game play using low weight gear seemed to be the only viable play style, heavy armor would make the character unable to move out of harms way but damage taken was still pretty huge.  Not sure if that will ever change.

The normal game itself wasn't really very hard, with all the items  and options you have at your disposal it's just a matter of playing smart, use a few bombs and your ranged weapons when needed, on big demons just pop living weapon and they insta-die.  Bosses however is a different matter, they are super hard.  Actually a bit too hard for my taste.   I got to Hino-enma and have put her to 50%, but feels like I am fighting the input controls a lot more than anything else.. I press space to dodge, my guy just stands there, gets stunned then is dead.   Good stuff.",1620850651,1621246204,True,0,0,0.494575619697570801,0,True,False,False

It would take a lot of writing to go into full detail so to summarise my thoughts.
It's a soulslike in that, it's on the same ""tree"" as the Dark Souls trilogy.
It shares some base mechanics, but then either changes those mechanics or adds new ones.
It's more complex, methodical and less forgiving. On the other hand, it gives the players much more options in terms of weapons, items and abilities.
It also deepens the gameplay, taking lessons from Souls but expanding on them. 
My only real complaint with the game is the heavy amount of RNG, best thing is just to get used to it.

Probably the good thing about this game is the combat which is the reason why i still playing it, and i like that they decide to makes everyone speaks their own language instead have to choose English or Japanese and the have Kira Yoshikage & Kishibe Rohan VA in this game so... good job Koei.
Overall it still a fun game with great combat system but with shitty level and enemy design and the only time you feel stronger is when you have a better gear (only in DPS, you probably still gonna die in a couple hit), not when leveling up.

I recommend this to Gamers:
Nioh has a great blend of JRPG and souls-like gameplay with a looting system that can be compared to Diablo. 

I recommend this to History Buffs:
*Inserts Leonardo DiCaprio Pointing meme*

I recommend this to sweaty weebs:
Waifus are eloquent.

I recommend this to you:
Since your reading this review.

For those who come and play Nioh expecting Dark souls:
Nioh should be seen as Nioh not another Dark souls.

Some difference I found after some research between them are as follows:
1. You will spend more time in menu's. Forging, refashioning, soul matching, level up, and managing loot especially since the loot system in Nioh is comparable to Diablo.
2. The Combat system is much more advanced and in depth than Dark Souls.
3. You have to learn backstab through skills.
4. Yes. There is a grind, but depends really if you wanna level through the story or grind to prepare going through the story.

I'll rate this game a solid 9/10 with 9.5 moments and 9.8 peaks of euphoria after defeating that one boss that has been a roadblock for a while.

Things that could have been improved, but are so minor you barely notice at all:
1. The story is seemingly all over the place but its serviceable, only for those who aren't reading descriptions or history buffs.
2. Sometimes characters abruptly come and go.
3. In a DLC mission, there was a bit of overuse of a certain enemy type that felt a bit odd.

Things that need improvement:
1. For PC users, the ""lock on"" system, on the keyboard and mouse control scheme, is very erratic when your're facing multiple enemies. A slight shift of the mouse to left or right will cause you to change target then to another target, another one, and another one erratically, which can screw you over. The problem is that the change target right and left is in the same keybind as look right and left. You can't even change the mouse keybind either or have a separate change target key since that's the only one which is bound to the mouse left and right.
2. The default PC control schemes are very awkward, just use the ones from a steam guide instead. 
3. Nioh made it an essential skill to traverse it's menus meant for consoles in PC.

Things to note:
1. There are ""No. That's b*llsh*t"" moments that feel unfair at first, but after some thought were kinda well thought out.
2. There are times where you wonder, "" Where were you guys when I was beating the *(@$ out of this level?"".",1620571748,1620571748,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: Now that I've played a lot more, it's growing on me even more. It's honestly a great game. I will say that, after playing through the whole game, it's a lot less like Dark Souls than I say in this review. The combat is faster and more complex, the magic is more accessible, and there's EXCELLENT end game content.

The similarities:
The combat is driven by dodging and/or blocking. There are tons of weapons, all with different play styles to suit your fancy. There are tons of armour with a weight system, where you have to choose the balance between speed and defence. The AI movements really make each little fight feel like a duel, which I always loved about Dark Souls. When you die, you leave behind a grave with all your ""amrita"" (this game's souls), and you need to get back to it to reclaim it. You have ""elixir"" (this game's estus) which is essentially the same thing (with a minor mechanic difference where you have a stockpile to allow a little extra). The levelling system is basically the exact same as well. There are also ""shrines"" (this game's bonfires) that act as waypoints that refill your health, respawn enemies, and where you can level up. You're probably thinking, ""this sounds exactly like Dark Souls!"". Yes. Yes it is. And that's a good thing, because more Dark Souls is always better.

The differences:
This is actually where I'm very pleasantly surprised. I would normally think that, if a game is trying to be like Dark Souls, then any way it's different is going to make it worse (just because Dark Souls was soooooo good). However, what we have here is some very interesting differences, that make combat even MORE enjoyable! For example, each weapon has three stances (high/mid/low), and you can switch stances very fluidly, not only mid combat, but mid combo. There's also a technique where you can regain some stamina by proper timing and execution, which adds a new element of proficiency to your combat abilities. There's also a familiarity system where you get used to weapons, allowing you to be better with them somehow (still unsure how this works).
An additional change that I love is that weapons do NOT increase your weight value. This means you can have two melee and two ranged weapons equipped, all at the same time, and switch between them seamlessly in battle, without a massive weight penalty. In Dark Souls, I basically never had other weapons equipped, because it seemed stupid to have a higher weight, just on the off-chance I wanted to use another weapon mid-combat. Now, I can have that freedom, without the penalty.
The aesthetic is quite Japanese for this game, which creates a whole new type of mood for it, and which I'm enjoying quite a lot (considering how much of an anime nerd I am). That said, you don't need to like the Japanese scene to like this game. This is not a Japanese fighting game; this is a Dark Souls game, with a slight Japanese style.
EDIT: Now that I've played this a good bit more, another difference which is great is how magic works. In DS you needed to really focus on magic to make it anywhere close to worthwhile, and even then, it kinda stunk. Nioh does a REALLY good job having tons of abilities available to you, all being used fluidly in combat, doing really interesting things with status and what not. Basically, the magic and abilities are much better in Nioh.

Overall, I would say that if you liked the Dark Souls games, this is a must have. I imagine it's not going to be as good as DS1, but even so, it's incredibly enjoyable so far.",1604990005,1620494679,True,15,2,0.599424481391906738,0,True,False,False

Two things to take note of before buying.  The game is faster paced than most Souls type games, so be ready for that.  In many cases, strategic planning (instead of blindly charging in) can buy you a substantial advantage.  Boss battles may not allow this, however, so some sharp reflexes are still highly recommended.  Finally, there seems to be a bug in the PC version that will cause the game to freeze and crash at random.  It's infrequent, but if it happens, it also forces you to manually exit the game.

Debo admitir que compre el juego en una rebaja sustancial y por lo tanto no sufro tanto de no haberlo terminado. Pero la verdad que a mitad de la campaña el juego se torna tremendamente repetitivo. Y sin una buena historia o progresion de personajes el juego hizo que pierda el interes rapidamente.
Graficamente esta bien, a pesar de que el titulo tiene algunos años. Tuve algunos problemas de cuelgues pero nada que reiniciar el juego no haya solucionado. 
En cuanto al gameplay aca hay mucha tela que cortar, principalmente carece de puntos realmente fuertes, mas alla del genero souls. Trata de innovar con algunos aspectos, como por ejemplo tener un arbol de habilidades, que los enemigos suelten constantemente items, oro y amerita (lo que seria un sinonimo de almas si fuera un DS). Primeramente, el oro literalemte no sirve para nada solo acumularlo, no se si en el endgame tendra relevancia, pero en un principio (y hasta la mitad, no sirve para absolutamente nada). Por otro lado, que los enemigos suelten objetos constantemente lo vuelve un mix con los ARPG como sea Diablo, PoE u otros. Esto es curioso, al principio me parecio bien, pero a medida que avanzas, te das cuenta que solo hay algunas variantes de armas y armaduras, 40 items de los cuales usas 10 con suerte, asi que todo lo q te caiga va a parar a la basura (no literal, se puede cambiar por almas o item de crafteo).
Tiene un sistema de crafteo completamente irrelevante, si los enemigos son una piñata de objectos, para que querrias perder tiempo en craftear?
El arbol de habilidades no esta desbloqueado desde un principio, sino q a medida q avanzas en la historia se va desbloqueando, por lo que te sobran los puntos, tampoco es que sea muy util, las habilidades son muy escuetas y realmente poco utiles.
Por ultimo la dificultad, q es bastante desbalanceada, la campaña se presenta en misiones las cuales suelen tener algun boss o mini boss final, estos son o tremendamente faciles o muy complicados, si bien siendo del genero souls, uno espera un desafio, pero se nota la falta de una buena IA que se compensa con bosses overpower.

Summary
- Don't get this if you don't like to constantly die in a game
- Get this if you're a fan  of the souls genre.
- There are now a lot of games out there of this genre, this one is not really the best.
- Immersion is destroyed by glitchy movement, items, and sometimes just lack of registering the keys/buttons properly.
- Ability tree is awesome - it's one of the things that kept me playing

Summary: Buy it if it's on sale and you're curious. Avoid at full cost if possible.

You don't get that old feeling, that excitement, that ""I'm thinking about this game everytime I'm not playing it"" anymore. And that's cool, it's cool, y'know. There are other ways to enjoy games. 

Eventually you read some reviews, the critical consensus is something like ""it's fine, but not mind-blowing or anything"", and you just kind of move on. Don't have the time and the video card or the console. But not really, and you keep thinking, ""man, this one looks really good"".

A few years later, the game is more affordable. You see it in a sale, you got a second-hand video card a while back that's nothing special, far from it, but can handle it (even if it's 30fps 720p). And you tell yourself ""fuck it, I'm gonna make some time for this bad boy.""

Then you finally get to play it. And when you do yo feel like ""Fuck, this game is as cool as I thought it would be actually.""

The smaller variety of weapon types is tripled by the stances you can switch between, even in the middle of a combo. Stamina can be restored faster if you press a button at the right time, and that adds a lot of depth to the combat as well. It's a great set of systems, and it is a shame that I cannot recommend this game.

First things first, the port is horrid. I don't know how, but they managed to make this dated looking game perform like crap on PC. Thankfully I own a controller, and these games generally don't work that well with keyboard and mouse, so I can't tell you much about keyboard+mouse controls.

Level design and enemies remind me a lot of Dark Souls 2. Levels are long, some with a lot of shortcuts, but the amounts of enemies can be very annoying. Ambushes galore, and it would work in a game that does not tend to stun lock you to death. Sadly, Nioh does. So getting hit by an enemy that has enough stamina for more than one hit usually means death. This makes Nioh extremely tedious.

Levels themselves are disconnected areas that can host multiple different missions. Exploration doesn't make much sense since most of the time you get just another piece of gear.

Speaking of gear, gearing system is bad. It's like Diablo, but with (thankfully) unlimited inventory. So practically every enemy you defeat drops a weapon or an armour piece. You can upgrade, reroll stats, sell them, dismantle them, but after a few minutes this system feels very cumbersome and tedious. At least DS2 had upgradable gear I didn't have to replace every 15 minutes.

Levels seem to affect way too much. Being underleveled and/or undergeared means death in a hit or two. Good luck grinding.

In conclusion, Nioh has some fantastic ideas in terms of combat, it controls great, but the flaws are just too many and too huge to ignore. It's worth checking out at a discount.",1619379932,1619379932,False,2,0,0.479394465684890747,0,True,False,False

That being said, this game has a lot going for it too, and Ive definitely had a lot of moments where Im absolutely loving every second of this game.",1619319304,1619319304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are a dark souls fan and you are looking for more dark souls-esque games then you should give Nioh a try. The best part of Nioh is the combat. Nioh has 7 melee weapon types and 3 ranged types. There are 3 stances for each weapon, low, medium, and high. Each stance changes how the weapon is handled: changing the timing, amount of damage dealt, move set, and combos. By dancing through stances and swapping weapons mid combo you get a lot more variety than DS's sword and shield approach. This is where Nioh shines the brightest.

The rest of the game is between ""fine"" and ""bad."" It has a Diablo like loot system where it throws hundreds of garbage items at you for you to disassemble and use the materials to craft new gear. Some people like systems like these, I am not one of them. It's tedious. Honestly, anything that pulls me away from the best part of the game, the combat, is unneeded imo. 

Levels aren't as polished as something like DS or Sekiro. Quality of levels varies from excellent to garbage. The worst part is the side missions. The side missions have you revisiting sections of old levels with changes in enemy placement. You are expected to do A LOT of these and if you don't you will be chronically under-leveled as you approach the endgame. Revisiting old areas is boring, and this the biggest drag on the game.

Despite my complaining and thumbs down score Nioh is still a game worth playing. Unfortunately, the port sucks. The game keeps crashing on me and I have to keep replaying the same sections because of it. I went and bought the ps4 version for 15 bucks and played that instead.

Did you ever:
- Wonder why a little fairy-woman-thing stalks your very head?
- Get imprisoned in The Tower of London?
- Talk to a floating cat ninja?
- Get into conflict with a skinny edgelord alchemist?
- Get you rectum penetrated by a turtle-frog-monkey demonic entity's fingers?

If your answer to any of those questions is ""yes"", you should probably contact a licensed psychiatrist. BUT after that I encourage you to play NIOH.

On a more serious note: 
I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It has one of the most interesting battle system I've ever encounter during my ""souls-like adventures"". You are not only limited to a certain weapon type and special skills assigned to them. You can also choose one of three stances which are specialised for different situations. Additionally, some enemies are blessed with weak spots (often shiny horns), which can be abused but require you to hit certain spots on their body. This makes combat varied and fun for far longer than I have ever thought.
Nioh also lets you experiment with various, often specialised builds, which add a lot of variety.
That said I have a few ""buts"". The levels are needlessly complicated and full of terrain hazards. Some of the bosses (mostly the dlc ones) seems to rely on a simple gimmick: they have a metric ton of health and are able to shower you with a barrage of attacks, which can take from 10 seconds to 14 work days. Additionally most of them have some kind of a one-hit K.O technique. That makes those fights needlessly tedious in comparison to other battles.  Lastly, the mechanics I praised before aren't really all that great when it comes to group battles. Pair that with the fact that a lot of late-game missions make you fight against more than one boss or a boss with some heavy hitting mobs and you have a recipe for frustration.

Overall I would say that NIOH is a really good game which is worth playing, but NOT WORTH completing achievement-wise. Smack some dudes, get your share of fun and end it at that.",1618638506,1618638506,True,42,33,0.727072834968566895,0,True,False,False

- Variety in combat style and combos
- Character customization
- Music and art are not bad but could be better

What I hate about it:
- Enemy variety! It's most frustrating thing about this game fighting same bosses and enemies over and over again.
- Bad Level design and lack of environment storytelling (compare to souls) usually ruin the experience
- Some enemies or play styles unbalance the game, either too easy or too hard and not in the fun way!
- boring missions and side quests.

485510,89167475,76561198046715700,0,5,977,0,977,1616829595,"I bought this game a couple of years ago before I had really played a souls-like game and couldn't really get into it back then. At the time, I just believed I needed to ""git-gud"" and decided to work my way through a few other games of this type first. So, after having recently unlocked every achievement in Sekiro, I thought I should finally be ready. Unfortunately, I think Sekiro might have ruined Nioh for me. If Sekiro is a truly streamlined souls-like, where all of the weapon-build and rpg elements have been stripped away to create a tight, single-player experience where the only thing between you and death is your own raw skill, then Nioh is the complete opposite: a grindy nightmare with no variety that wastes your time with heaps of pointless equipment, worthless skill trees, unnecessary mechanics (ki pulse, stance changes, etc.), and overused, boring areas/enemies. 

First of all, Nioh is too easy if you're an expert at these kinds of games. The way learning to beat a boss in Sekiro worked was, you bash your ahead against them until you've lost around 50 times, then you look up a guide on how to beat it, and then bash your head against it another 10 or 20 twenty times until you finally win. The way it works in Nioh is: 1. accidentally kill the first boss while trying to figure out the game mechanics, 2. Beat the second boss in one try because his AI is stupid, 3. Lose to the third boss once or twice because she has an unblockable instant-kill long range attack that doesn't have a clear hit box, look up online how to dodge it, then beat her easily because once you know how to dodge/trick the AI into never using it, the rest of her kit is so stupid that you won't even take damage, 4. Lose to the 4th boss once or twice because the game doesn't inform you that you can't block ""elemental"" damage, then kill him easily, 5. Beat the 5th boss in one try even tho it takes you almost 30 minutes because his model keeps clipping through the floor and himself (???). No sense of accomplishment, no sense that you're mastering the game, no interesting world-building/storytelling, and, worst of all, no fun.

Maybe the other bosses in the game are better, but the moment I started a mission that was just normal enemies spawning into a small area over and over, I had to put the game down. Any sense that a level could be fun or interesting is completely undercut by the fact that anything that might actually kill/hurt you is either a 1. an invisible trap that causes you to fall through the floor/crushes you, 2. comes from an enemy that is purposefully placed to be hiding in the camera's blind-spot, or 3. a long range attack from an enemy that has perfect aim with a flaming arrow even from around a corner. 

Let me be clear, the only challenge in the game exists either from being underleveled or not having the proper gear. No enemy at your level can beat you one-on-one. In Sekiro, any enemy had the potential to kill you if you weren't being careful/didn't know their attack patterns. In Nioh, the AI is literally stupid, and presents no challenge. The game simply throws waves and waves of enemies at you while you stand around waiting for your ki to recharge just so you can easily kill the next mob. Is this fun for you people? This is like an MMO with a coat of ""souls-like"" paint slathered all over it, with no polish, no sense of accomplishment, and no real challenge outside of the time spent grinding. 

I can imagine that the game picks up at level 100 when you have cool gear and can reasonably fight other players, but the path to getting there simply doesn't seem worth it to me. Maybe actual fromsoftware souls games have ruined it for me, but Nioh seems like a cheap imitation with no charm. That being said, other people seem to like it, and if this is your first game of this type, you might find yourself enjoying it.

It is very hard compared to other soulslikes, since most enemies can kill you in two to three hits and are capable of doing very fast combos without much of a telegraph, leading to you having to play very cautiously when learning the game.

Its mission and loot-based systems set it apart from other games like Dark Souls by allowing for greatly increased playability. Gear level scales as you progress into Nioh’s 5 new-game+ difficulty levels, and allows for the making of builds similar to many other looter-type games.

I highly recommend this game to those who want a challenging experience with lots of replayability and  like creating different types of loot builds.

Pros
- Lots of weapon variety, and the stance system adds even more depth.
- Challenging but rewarding difficulty. Combat and bosses are fun for the most part.
- The Living Weapon is a fun feature. Very flash and cool.


Cons
- Enemy variety is quite low. You'll find the same enemies in almost all of the regions, with some exceptions. 
- Some gimmicky boss fights. I despise the artificial difficulty of extremely fast one-shot kill attacks, and one boss in particular was a pain in the ass with this. It's the kind of bosses that makes you go 'ugh... finally' when you beat them, rather than a sense of accomplishment and mastery.
- I really had no use for the Blacksmith whatsover. I feel like if I invested a bunch of resources upgrading my weapons, I'd find better ones on the floor in the very next level. Didn't see a point to it, but maybe it's more of an NG type of deal.
- I wish the weapon skill UI tree was a little more thought out. With the amount of unlockable skills, its a lot of reading to do. It would have been better if they were categorized somehow instead of all just thrown on the page like a wall of text.
- I didn't like the idea of my Kodama blessings getting erased every new region. 
- Exilirs are in limited supply. It's not like Dark Souls where you refresh your stock for free at the Bonfire. This forces you to kind of stockpile them so you're not in the unfortunate situation where you're stuck on a boss and run out of elixirs and have to mindlessly grind elsewhere to find more. I get where they were going with this, and I never personally ran out of elixirs, but I would have been really annoyed if I had to stop fighting a boss just to go on a scavenger hunt.  

I've listed a lot of cons, but they didn't take away too much from my overall enjoyment. They are rather points of improvement from my eyes.

The enemies are... boring and can be counted so far to the fingers of your hands. Also it is a looting game. You know like diablo, boarderlands etc.... 

The combat could be more interesting since they include three different stances, but you will end up using the low stance like 95% of the time only since it has the best trade off damage/ki(ki is like stamina in dark souls). 

So far the scenario is... weird. I don't get it. You go there kill some other stuff for some people that you don't really know in the hope that someone will help you go after a guy who has something yours. The rest is just blah blah blah. 

The bosses are also one dimensional. They are difficult due to their stupid damage output. Most of them one shot you or almost one shot you.

First and foremost, the combat system is very good. The 3 stance system gives a lot of versatility to each weapon as well as offers diverse play styles. The weapons are also meaningfully different due to the unlockable moves (and you are not stuck only using one weapon since resetting skill points is very cheap). Even weapons that seem similar occupy different roles: for example, even though they are all fast weapons with short reach, the straight sword focuses on parry and draw attacks; dual swords focuses on high DPS; Tonfa focuses on stamina damage and defence.

The balance is good when it comes to weapons, all of them are viable in nearly all circumstances and none of them can be considered best or worst, but not when it comes to spells. There are some spells that deal less damage than your melee weapon (some of which have the same range) but require a cast time and have limited number of uses, and using those are giant wastes of time.

However, the enemy designs are not so good. First off there isn't a huge variety of enemies and they get reused throughout the game. None of the mobs with weapons are very interesting (except yoki whose horn can be broken off to stagger them), there are several ""Dark Souls dog"" type enemy (meaning they like to run around a lot but when they attack they stunlock you, so they test your patience), and the level designs frequently spawn multiple enemies simultaneously to swarm you. 

The boss designs overall are only average, the yokai bosses are mostly decent (a few have the tendency to attack through their own body which look very strange) but some human bosses are infuriatingly difficult: they have the same moveset as you do, but they have massive health and kill you in 1 to 3 hits, and they usually have some broken ability like hyper armor on attacks or infinite living weapons. They are almost like puzzles because unless you are godlike you can't fight them head on, instead often the way to win is to kite them and hit once once in a while for 20 minutes, or cheese them with certain moves or abilities that doesn't allow them to fight back. Bloodborne does this far better with its hunter bosses: instead of having the exact same moves as the player with stats pumped up to ridiculous proportions, they have increased stats and an enhanced moveset. When I beat a boss in Bloodborne I want to use the bow gesture; when I beat a boss in Nioh I do use the point down gesture.

Edit: I'm reviewing this from the perspective of a Dark Souls player and comparing Nioh to it, I know that Ninja Gaiden has some insanely challenging bosses and Nioh is probably followung that tradition.

The story isn't very good nor is it told well. For the first 70% of the story every mission is ""another settlement needs your help"". William is a very boring MC, who isn't mute but if he were it would make no difference, who meets most of the important characters in this part of japanese history and whose reaction is always ""I can't wait till this is over"". Most of the NPCs don't do anything besides talk in cutscenes: the game introduces them, forgets about them and later gives an exposition of their story and that's it. The only saving grace is that it is based on actual Japanese history.",1614722950,1615046480,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Please note that I have not done the abyss, many twilight missions, nor have I done any NG+ content. Just for reference, I played through pretty much the entire game with Warrior of the West armor and Taro Tachis (which is a big sword akin to like a Zweihander in Dark Souls), and I also completed all of the side missions and never used living weapon nor co-op. Without further ado, here are my thoughts on the game. 

[h1]The Good[/h1]

[b]I really liked the combat[/b] and how much variety there was with different stances and all the different martial arts you could perform. I just wish that the martial arts gave more of a combat advantage or something because there’s not really a reason to use them 95% of the time when basic slashing does the trick just fine. Playing with the odachi and being able to switch stances mid-combo was really cool though, and when I go back to the soulsborne games I’m going to miss it dearly.

[b]New combat flow[/b]. needing to learn how to play a new souls game was pretty cool as I achieved mastery of the new systems. Ki pulsing is a really neat mechanic, and it was interesting to learn how to fight in this game. It felt like it revolved a lot more on spacing and blocking versus how I typically play a souls game of just rolling diagonally into an enemy. It was like when I first played Sekiro and needed to learn everything all over again.

[b]Enemy design[/b] for the most part enemies felt pretty fair, which if done incorrectly can really screw with your experience. I just don’t like some of the slow-down status effects some enemies can give to you, and if certain bosses give it to you it’s basically a death sentence. Something worth mentioning is that some big enemies have DS2 style “turn by sliding until I hit you,” which is kind of annoying but it works better in Nioh, and it’s more understandable because otherwise, you could just circle around them into oblivion without the big guys even having a chance.

[b]Level design[/b]. Nioh shines brightly above other souls like here. The shortcuts in the levels were very well implemented and hidden traps and enemies will keep you on your toes and force you to be observant, honestly surpassing the original souls games in many instances in my opinion.

[b]Revenant System.[/b] I absolutely love the revenant system in Nioh, it’s a super cool innovation and I honestly wish to see it in more games. For those who are unaware, there are also ‘bloodstains’ in Nioh to mark where other players have died. Nioh takes a spin on this though and lets you fight an AI-controlled copy of that player and their gear, and if you get to keep some of the other player’s gear. It’s a 10/10 system for me and I hope to see other games get inspired by it.

[b]Item stats are actually useful/important.[/b] Nioh takes some more RPG elements into its design, namely item stats. It’s a breath of fresh air to see my gear actually matter a bit compared to just going for looks.
[b]Weapon Familiarity[/b] This is a small system but it was nice to have. For the unaware, weapon familiarity in Nioh basically makes your weapon get stronger the more you use to (to a point) so you can keep using an old item for longer than you would normally be able to without the system. 

[b]Changing the appearance of things[/b]. Being able to change the appearance of my gear, weapons and even character was really cool, and I hope something like this shows up in future games like Elden ring. 

[b]Yokai Weak Points[/b]. Giving each Yokai a special weak spot was just a good design choice in my opinion, but there’s nothing really to elaborate on.
[b]The final story mission[/b]. This was only one part of the game, but I fricking loved it to pieces (but I don’t want to spoil anything so I’ll leave it at that).

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

[b]World Design[/b]. To people who have played Nioh this shouldn’t come as a surprise, but instead of a big open world you could freely traverse like DS1, or even having the levels connected to each other like DS3, Nioh has all of its levels separated and you choose which one you want to play through a map system. There’s nothing wrong with it or anything, but having an actual world is a lot more immersive. I believe Nioh was designed to have levels be farmed over and over but that's just not my cup of tea, and I much prefer full worlds.

[b]Occasionally questionable telegraphing. [/b] 99.9% of the time, this isn't an issue, and enemies have decently fair telegraphs. But for a game with only like twenty enemies there are like two moves from enemies that instantly come out without telegraphing, be it visual or audio. Again it's barely an issue but I still think it's worth pointing out for a fast-paced soulslike.

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]

[b]Constant Reusing enemies[/b]. You know how in a souls game you’ll generally get a new set of enemies for every area or so? In Nioh that applies to like the first three missions and then that’s it. The entire game feels like it had about twenty or so different enemies that were just reused throughout the whole game, and the worst part is 90% of the time they didn’t even get a fresh coat of paint or anything, it just felt lazy to me. On the bright side, however, this allows the developers to make the enemies more intricate in their moveset, and it allows you to get a better mastery over fighting them since you know them so well. 

[b]Post-story content[/b]. The absolute worst offender on the list, it legit made me quit the game. Please note that when I say post-story content, I do not mean the DLC or the NG+ system, I mean the missions that appear in NG after you beat the final story mission. For those who don’t know what these missions are, it is quite possible the laziest level design I have ever seen. The entirety of these new missions are just throwing you and two random old bosses (THAT WERE COMPLETELY NOT DESIGNED TO BE TOGETHER I MAY ADD) into an old arena. I absolutely hated it, I did the missions “A Meeting on the Other Shore” and “Restless Spirits” and they were both terrible. To give the game the benefit of the doubt, I was fairly under-leveled, and I would like to believe that these missions are just designed to come back later and probably shred them or something, but regardless I hate them. I started a third endgame mission, realized it was the same gank boss deal, and quit the game.

[b]In conclusion[/b], I had a pretty good time (except for that endgame nonsense). I will probably pick it back up someday to do the actual endgame content of like DLC and NG+, but for now, I’m giving it a break. I bought the game for like $15 on sale and got just over 50 hours from it which seems like a good deal. I think Nioh is a great example of what a souls-like should be. If you like the genre, then I think you should give Nioh a shot, it was a really good experience, and it’s surprising more people don’t play it.",1614439398,1614439660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a love-hate relationship with a really well done combat system, enemy encounters and boss designs, then it will hand you your ass with borderline unfair enemy placement and fight scenarios pitting you against multiple bosses at once that likely wasn't well thought out to begin with other than to artificially increase the difficulty (the latter I'm willing to let slide as the game offering these as some sort of high-tier challenge that isn't meant for everyone, though it still seems lazy).
Halfway through the game you will start to see repeat boss fights and even a few boss rushes in some missions that just seem to pad the game out longer than it should be.  What you'll also see repeated are the same levels, even seeing levels from an earlier region appear again as a new side mission in a completely different region.  It seems lazy and the difference is just the enemy roster and/or their placement.
As flawed as I feel this game is... it's the combat that holds up for me.  I just wish it didn't recycle itself so much.

Addendum: The term ""masocore"" comes to mind and I'm sure a lot of what comes across as extremely difficult and unfair is down to being done on purpose.  Hiding a spider in an alcove that you can't peek till it drops down and insta-killing, placing a charging enemy in a tight hall that spawns once you get close, those I don't think I can excuse.  Some of the tougher enemy combinations do work well and emphasize a particular tactic to counter them, others I don't think work or could've had some tweaking done (especially some of the boss combos).",1613886522,1613888010,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Wow, you guys really like killing the player!"" exclaims one Team Ninja member to the booth attendant. ""That's so weird! WE really like killing the player, too!"" As this exchange goes on, the player trying Dark Souls dies three or four times more, eliciting bouts of merry laughter from both Dark Souls and Team Ninja sides. Later, we got Nioh.

Yeah, it also has a massive amount of loot drops to sift through, but some handy tools to quickly sort it, sell it, offer it up for experience souls or scrap echoes or whatever we're calling the stuff these days... amrita, you say? Sure, why not.

You play some Irish dude. He's pretty cool. You'll meet an awful lot of famous people from the Sengoku period of Japan's history, and duel most of them. There's also a slew of Japanese monsters to fight and Japanese weapon types to master, as well as a flood of Japanese armor sets to coordinate as you see fit (including appearance swapping... nice.)

Some people say there's no Dark Souls here, but the level layouts feel very Soulsy to me. Explore, find your way up, down and around, sometimes there's a fair bit of sprawl and you check various dead ends for goodies before moving on along the central path... and of course, the bonfire - I mean shrine, next to a door that only opens from the other side... frequently providing a handy shortcut to the next large thing that wants you dead. Repeatedly. There is a good mix of challenge, exploration and streamlining here which I suspect many will take for granted, but which is just about good enough to study. 

Even Dark Souls itself is often guilty of the old ""Oops, two and a half minutes' convoluted trek to get back to the boss arena"" trope. Maybe it's deliberate, meant to give you time to consider your mistakes and alter your tactical plans, but I always found it flow-breaking and Nioh, by and large, seems to have less of it - assuming you take the time to look around and get those doors unbarred, granted.

It is worth mentioning the difficulty. It's high; you will die, a lot. If that bothers you, this may not be a game for you... or if Japanese stuff is not your deal, this is definitely not a game for you. But if you are a Souls fan and also a Japanese mythology fan, or fan of samurai and ninja weaponry, related martial arts, et cetera... this may very well be a game for you. There is a lot of content for those who take the time to explore... most of it, even, and though some area maps are re-used - some more than others - there are still a lot of them, and the story missions almost always seem to have their own large, unique, sprawling maps.

It can get overly brutal in places, and the struggle to grow strong enough by gear upgrades and level-ups can be tiring, especially toward the end of the latter couple of DLCs' content... but it's all doable, and there is some satisfaction in conquering a mountain of a game like Nioh. A certain amount of zen is recommended to avoid morale loss during repeated deaths. As ever in the Soulsy genre, try to focus on what each death teaches you, rather than growing disheartened.

Also, a controller is recommended. I use a PS4 one on my PC, with the mouse close by for fine-tuning the aim of projectile weapons like the bow and matchlock firearms; this works very well, for the most part.

In summary: A fine game, very content-rich, with vividly animated and skillful combat. High degree of difficulty, could be quite unpleasant to the uninitiated. Recommended overall, but if you have doubts, don't dismiss them too casually; this game asks a lot of the player, more than some can reasonably be expected to put in.",1613776301,1613776301,True,21,2,0.712644875049591064,0,True,False,False

The game follows William Addams as he travels from Europe to Japan to save a kidnapped friend from an evil alchemist and gets caught up in the civil war happening during the end of Japan's Sengoku era. Most of the cast including William himself are fictionalized versions of real historical figures thrown into a version of real history spiced with magic, spirits and ancient Japanese demons called Yokai. The story isn't amazing but I had a good time with it. The Sengoku era is a well worn setting but I enjoyed seeing William interacting (and doing battle) with famous generals of the time period like Hattori Hanzo and Sakon Shima. I have heard that people less familiar with this period of history have had trouble keeping everything straight and keeping track of the different characters but there is a handy glossary in game along with a character bio and cutscene viewer that should help clear up any confusion. The story does its job about as well as you'd ask for a game like this and I don't really have any complaints in that department.

Even if I hated the story, I'd still happily recommend this one because Nioh is home to one of my favorite combat systems in all of gaming and boasts a massive amount of content and replayability if you do decide to dig into what it has to offer. On the surface, Nioh takes heavy cues from FromSoft's excellent Dark Souls series. It is true you have the hard hitting enemies, stamina bar and corpserunning checkpoint n' shortcut level design found there. Team Ninja uses these concepts along with a Diablo esc loot system to create a game that while punishing, allows for much more freedom in how you approach encounters than any of From's games.

The difference of course, is in the details. Ki, Nioh's stamina equivalent exists to do much more than limit how many times a player can attack or roll. Unlike in something like Dark Souls, enemy ki can not only be seen, but also interacted with. When either the player or enemies are exhausted of ki, they are left wide open for a devastating attack so active ki management becomes the name of the game. A ki pulse can be performed with a well timed bumper press to refill ki and stay on the offensive after expending it. Mastering this along with each weapon type's three stances makes each enemy encounter engaging. Shifting to low stance for a more effective dodge or mid stance to block and then high to perform a powerful overhead strike and then ki pulsing so you're ready as the next guy runs in to try his luck can be so addictive. You get into this zen-like rhythm as you create and exploit openings in your enemies' defense. Taking down multiple dudes or bigger threats can really make you feel like an unstoppable samurai. The game is incredibly punishing but mastery is rewarded in a way I've seen few games achieve.

Each of Nioh's 7 weapon types have unlockable skills that expand your moveset. Things like parries, kicks to throw the enemy off balance, powerful chargeable iai slashes or flashier moves like using your spear to vault into the air for a jump attack, make each weapon useful and fun. After literally hundreds of hours playing this one, I still couldn't pick a favorite if you asked me. If the melee options weren't enough, Nioh also has magic and ninja skill trees to play around in. A more magic focused character will find themselves summoning water geysers and lightning bolts, throwing fireballs and enchanting their weapons for that extra edge. Meanwhile a ninja may use scrolls to silence footsteps for backstabs, drop caltrops to slow enemy movement, throw poison kunai or just chuck massive bombs around.

Between the different choices in weapons, skills, guardian spirits and gear with different attributes and set bonuses, the build variety on offer is actually kind of insane. Grinding for and upgrading loot to make your build that much more effective is addicting and the real meat of Nioh's post game content. Because of this, early game and end/post game characters are almost playing a completely different game but Nioh remains satisfying every step of the way. If you don't care about all that RPG stuff though, you can get through that 1st playthrough just fine by picking a weapon you like with a big number on it, occasionally upgrading as you pick up better ones and selling the rest. You do not have to be some kind of min-maxing brainlord to get through Nioh if you just want to play it once and move on, but that depth is absolutely there for players who want it and respeccing is an option as well if you ever want to change up your build.

Nioh is also structured quite differently from your average action RPG. Rather than a large interconnected world, Nioh offers a map screen that allows you to play (and replay) through missions at your own pace. Sub missions also open up as you play which can be reruns of levels with different enemy placements or changes to the level layout with different objectives. The sub missions are not required but do provide some extra looting and leveling opportunities for interested players. I know some people find this less immersive than the big open world but I love how you always have access to replay any of the content at any time. Once you beat the game, you can even go back and forth freely between new game cycles, and some of the sub missions are just boss fight rematches, which is something I've personally wanted from Souls games for a long time and I'm happy to see it here. At its core this is reusing content and I know some players really hate that but I feel it's smartly done and means even more of that sweet sweet combat. The levels also have these cute little collectible buddies to find called Kodama and unlockable (and harder) Twilight Missions so there's quite a lot to do for completionists.

The levels themselves are quite nice and varied. You're in feudal Japan so there's obviously going to be a lot of Japanese castles, but there's other locales like a ninja manor, a snowy battle ground and grassy fields. Really the kind of settings you'd want to see in a samurai epic and the art direction is on point. The monster design is also excellent and while it is true the game more or less runs out of new enemies to show you by about 60-70% of the way in, they along with the varied human opponents, were always fun to fight so I never minded much. The bosses (aside from like 2 that suck) are highlights. Most are very fun battles and cap off their levels really well. There's also an in game bestiary with a model viewer that lets you look at the enemies closer and gives some lore on them. I always love when games do that.

While I (obviously) really enjoy this game, I do want to point out a few things I think can be a little better. The overall number of menus can absolutely be overwhelming and turn some players off. There's so many systems and Nioh just kinda dumps them all on you at once. This can make it pretty easy to overlook something like the skill menu or how to ready your magic without just looking it up or having someone tell you. There's tutorials available but Nioh is pretty bad at explaining a lot of its systems and as a result, why it's fun. This is a huge shame because I've heard of many people finding the game a little impenetrable and dropping it when they might have a had a great time if it just eased them in a little better.

While the game did get good critical reception, I feel the public's comparisons to Dark Souls largely lose sight of what Nioh is and where it fits in the larger gaming landscape. Nioh isn't any of the games it's compared to because despite its obvious influences, Nioh is very much doing its own thing. This is not another wannabe Souls game. This is Nioh. And Nioh is excellent.

Every weapon has 3 stances which change how you use it and special moves switch you through stances more fluidly than manually doing it. This means you have flow, something Samurai martial arts (or theatrical arts idk the correct term) really try and emphasize. You start the game doing your basic Dark Souls style combat (landing a few attacks then waiting for an opening) and end it being a Master Samurai or Ninja (landing long combos that stagger foes or move you around them so you can attack for a lot longer). Dark Souls is all about learning the enemy's patterns while Nioh is just as much about you as it is your enemies. 

One thing I love and wish every RPG had is the ability to have vanity items or the ability to change the look of your equipment. Nioh lets you do the latter. You can change any armor to look like any other armor that you've found. You can also do this with weapons! This way you can look EXACTLY the way you want your character to look without sacrificing stats.

I also really like the magic and item systems in this game. It's better than EVERY RPG I've ever played. Items are everywhere and the game expects you to use them, so do that! Don't hoard items there's no point, you WILL find more. Then there's also special abilities that give you items for free! There's a magic slot you can use to do things like cast a fireball, or raise resistance, etc. but you can also use a talisman (same a resin from DS) to augment your weapon with elemental damage. You get three of these items for free with this skill. 

There's 3 magic stats you can invest in: Magic Skills, Ninja Skills, and your Spirit Weapon. Spirit Weapon is my favorite, it's your ultimate move. Your weapon gets possessed by your guardian spirit and basically becomes Tessaiga from InuYasha. Your stamina and health get replaced with spirit energy which depletes rapidly but refills with kills. Your attack can go through the roof with certain spirits. This is ability is a life saver and is super fun to use. 

I often see so many people playing this game like it's Dark Souls. They don't use items, spirit weapons, or hardly any magic. Listen, play how you want but if you aren't using all the tools that this game is giving you I think you'll really miss out. Playing this game without these tools is like using only 10% of your brain, while with them it's like you've taken a Limitless smart pill.",1613426459,1613426459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is a souls-like however is different in some ways. Actually reminds me more of Sekiro than Dark Souls but is a little different to both. Is faster paced than Dark Souls, and you can also sprint & navigate the world quite quickly although theres no ninja grapple hook shenanigans like Sekiro. Totally an option in places to just sprint past things.
Lots of loot & crafting. Almost too much lol. Think typical RPG stuff, rarity, level, some unique ones, some elemental ones etc. You'll be getting THOUSANDS of items (weapons, armour, charms, consumables). Weapons are divided into classes which all play consistently (not much crazy 'boss-soul weapons' stuff in this game).
You have interchangable spirits which alter stats & are essentially an 'ultimate' ability (although have their duration significantly cut down if you take damage, so are not always a mindless easy-win-button although they can be quite devastating).
You can see where players have died & summon them to duel them (AI controlled, pretty easy) & get some loot. This allows you to get higher-level items than you could otherwise get at your your stage of the game if they're higher level than you. Pretty broken in the early game if you're lvl12 & get a lvl35 sword but becomes less ridiculous as your get higher in level I've found.
Has skill trees & has both ninjitsu & onmyo magic. I like onmyo, it is a little weak but more general-purpose than magic in Dark Souls & has a spell for everything (buffs, debuffs, healing, attack, resistances). Allows some preparation & adaptation if you're stuck on a boss.
There is a weapon familiarity system which is basically XP in that weapon. Weapons get a little stronger by using them up to a point. There are other mechanics that can consume this familiarity.

Instead of being one large world, Nioh is smaller stages connected by a world map. You'll often have a few stages to choose from including optional ones. Generally compulsory ones are bigger & with exploration & a boss whereas optional ones either revisit others or can be a single duel or a gauntlet of enemies. Stages have a difficulty level which scales enemy health & damage so you might want to do them in order, or just try & do them all like I do (some are ridiculously high level so I don't know if you can revisit them later, haven't finished the game yet).",1613046045,1613047356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It makes sure that you can recognise what part of the story is fiction and which is history. I found the stroy hard to follow, when unfamiliar with the Japanese history and only following the cut-scenes. When reading a bit in the in-game glossar, I started to get a grasp of it all.

The story plays in multiple parts of Japan with several side-quests. However many of the side-quests from diffirent regions of Japan use the same maps, which I found a bit sad. Especially when you run across the same map for the tenth time.

The weapon combat feels good and offers something for everyone. However the Living Weapon is straight up OP and takes all the challange from half of the bosses. Without the LW some bosses feel neigh impossible. There are spells that dump many bosses further down. 

The adaptation for keyboard and mouse is straight up horrible. In my opinion it should have not been released like that and that it is still this way, after all this time is unbelievable. Out of the first 10h I easily spend 1h rebinding and checking the bindings. One button, which will appear when you disconnect (regardless of whether you were online or not) and blocks you contolling your PC, seems to be unbound and can't be bound. This is probably the most frustrating part about the game. 

The only thing that comes close is the focus mechanic, which is garbage as soon as you fight more than one enemy.

Also, this is not an open world game as the game splits into different main missions and sub missions, with a boss at the end of every main mission.

However, Nioh is absolute trash compared to the From Software games, and I quickly realized why i stopped playing upon starting again.. Most of this game is artificial difficulty (one shot deaths no matter your level/gear; broken stamina management system; bosses that rely on being damage sponges for difficulty instead of Team Ninja taking the time to program a good AI; and a terrible loot-fest weapons and armor system). 

The fun of the soulbourne games lies in their fluid controls, easy to understand yet deep leveling and class building system, the world buidling (Nioh's world is forgettable at best and cringey at worst); and their excellent boss design (with some exceptions like Shadows of Yarhnam or the Crystal Sage of course). Nioh has 2 boss types: easy as hell and unfair as can be. There are no fun bosses or combat encounters. Also, the dev was too lazy to even model a world for the game. You will be fighting the same enemies form level 1 in level 60. The only difference i that they add more health to them, and the levels will be the same as well. Some stages are just earlier levels played in reverse. 

The combat is by far the worst thing of all. Because Team Ninja is such a lazy dev, they didnt actually design a combat system for this game.

Don't let the Diablo2 loot system or skill trees fool you, it's very difficult and temporary to gimp your character and you'll quickly learn inventory management just by reading the input tips. Nearly all items can be re-obtained and nearly all equipment can be extensively modified at the forge.

There are many character builds possible and that only expands into NG+ cycles. The NG+ system doesn't require full story completion, only a set amount of missions to open progression.

Don't listen to people complaining about the loot system, the filters and selection shortcuts make for very quick sorting, reading, locking and cleaning your inventory. Nioh's options menu is very extensive as well, make sure to use it to deeply customize your experience with the menus and controls. I take 0-2 minutes to sift through hundreds of items easily.

COOP multiplayer is 2 player and allows most of the story to be progressed without leaving the session, or if desired you can summon a volunteer for your current mission. You can also become that volunteer and queue for summoning to any mission, or to specific ones. There is also an endgame arena mode where 2 players can be summoned allowing for 3 player combat through increasingly difficult areas for special loot. Summoning assistance is never required, though greatly recommended to keep the community alive.

PVP is NOT forced and there is no drawback to avoiding it. It is in its own mode and its rewards are entirely cosmetic titles that appear on your graves when you die. When players die, at the location of their grave other players can summon an AI controlled copy (""Revenant"") of that player and fight them for items similar to what they were wearing, as well as special currency and items required to summon assistance. Fighting Revenants often is great practice and loot.",1603603185,1612397214,True,200,3,0.910468339920043945,1,True,False,False

Nioh 1 Complete edition takes the sub genre that Dark Souls(or rather Demon's Souls) inspired and adds its own unique flair to it. Takes a while to learn and master, but very rewarding.
The game has a more linear approach than the Souls series with its mission based progression, but in no way does it mean that exploration and fun encounters are any less prevalent than in other games of that genre. 
Yes a lot was inspired by the Souls series, but also by games like Onimusha and Ninja Gaiden. And while it takes heavy inspiration from those games, Nioh still stands on its own and manages to stand above the crowd in many ways.

Being a lover of Souls-likes, this is a fantastic game, not only due to the fluidity of the combat, numerous possible combinations of equipment and stats, level design, but above all, the difficulty and the challenge of the levels. 

Boss's are much easier than those of Dark Souls, however the game does not have an adequate balance, because the difficulty increases faster than our ability to increase the level of the character and the equipment. 

This situation results in some frustration and the crucial need to grind, which makes it different from Dark Souls, because the game is not fair and sometimes overwhelms us in an impressive way. 
Dark Souls could be brutal, but it's fair, Nioh is not, in Nioh the constant experience is... PAIN, but that's what makes it addictive and challenging. 

To sum up, and paraphrasing a friend of mine, who played with me all these hours and platinum this game: ""You´re either very good or you love to self-harm. I'm the latter in case you're wondering.""

It took about 60 hours to complete all of the side missions and the main story, and if you want more there are some additional post-game missions and New Game+ if you want to do it all again with a higher difficulty and new loot.

One feature I really love that sets it apart from others games in the genre is the title levels. It functions identically to Borderlands 2's Badass Rank, where completing certain objectives unlocks points to give small permanent buffs. It promotes trying out different weapons and replaying previous missions, and it's very satisfying. Although I did end up using Taro Tachi Odachis for the majority of the game because it's an absolute beast of a weapon and my favorite in the game by far.

i admit that i don't know my way around a controller so it is painstaking to play with it. which seems the only thing to do since there are too many prompts. even after all of that i am just gonna die to a mob after 3 basic hits (i am stun locked for 2 of them) playing this game will just be a test of will rather than accomplishment.

nothing i saw was new and the game; while not seeming to be insurmountable is unenjoyable. i basically need to work my a** off just to do it. at the point that i am in the game:

game has no lore that looks even slightly interesting. and yes, i know there is an american samurai in history. it has no visual or audio design that fascinates me. it has no easy progression if i don't ""git gud"".

Later in the DLC you partake in some war or whatever, but ultimately your goal is to get hold of moth waifu from a super famous Japanese samurai, obviously.

Levels feature numerous shortcuts and often reward you for exploration (there's at least 3 bosses that can be weakened through proper exploration). The game's combat system is definitely its strongest part, it has it all: spears, tonfas, odachis and even a cannon if that's your thing, on top of that all melee weapons have 3 different combo paths due to the stance system.

This game isn't really a souls like (only on a superficial level at best) and actually has some mechanics that will outright punish you if you try to play it like one.
Ninja Gaiden, Onimusha and (surprisingly) Diablo are much closer to this game.

Also, in terms of story this game is stuctured like a movie (show, don't tell), so I recommend you to read up on some japanese history, since Nioh features a lot of real life historical figures. You will get needed context and appreciate the story much more. 

+Combat system. 
It has much more in common with fighting games, since you can perform different combos or use different skills (which also require either a combination or a sequience of button presses). Variety is pretty big - there are parries, backstabs (in ninjutsu tree), grapple attacks (spear and sword have alternative, flashier versions), finishing blows and all kinds of utility moves (give Flying Monkey from the spear tree a go). You consume KI each time you swing your weapon, which you can also replenish by using Flux or even better - Stance Switch. Flux only restores the amount spent, while stance switching restores more than that. Mastering that will not only give you more KI, so you can continue being on the offense, but also open up the combat system to you. You also have 3 stances - High, Middle and Low. Both have different moves and properties. High stance - deals the most damage but is fairly slow, Middle - balanced between speed and damage and also the best for blocking. Low stance - fast, but the least damaging, also reduces KI cost of dodging by a lot. Also, I don't think the game ever explains it, but there is a rear damage bonus. Even if the enemy is aware of you, hitting him from behind will deal more damage. It's different from sneak attack, which can be performed on any unalerted enemy.

+Itemisation.
All items have stats. There are a lot sets as well, so you can build your character in many different ways. You have 2 slots for melee and ranged weapons, so you can combine your preferred weapons. Each weapon scales well with 1 stat and a bit less so with 2 more stats, so try to combine the weapons that scale with 2 stats. For example, Sword and Dual Swords both scale with Heart, Strength and Skill. These two weapons types have 3 stats in common which is ideal. They have different movesets though, so you can switch between them right in the middle of combo to start it with a sword and end with duals.
There are different armour types as well - Light, Medium and Heavy. Regardless of your choice, try to stay at B Agility (can check on your Status screen). If you go to C or D agility, your KI will disappear in a couple of weapon swings. Some armour sets provide different bonuses, like bonus damage from behind, bonus damage when dealing finishing blow, close combat damage, etc. Later in the game you will unlock the ability to get grace sets, which can be put on any armour type you want. Also, all items have different bonus traits that you can reforge / temper. Most commonly used on weapon are Change to attack (stat) - A, Close Combat Damage and Familiarity Bonus A. The rest usually depends on your weapon type. I like Parry Disabled (vs Guarding Enemy) - this stat is mistranslated, it actually allows you to perform combos against blocking enemies, preventing your weapon from bouncing back.

+Builds.
Aside from ability to pick your weapon, armour, set bonuses, you can also choose from different guardian spirits and clans (provide small bonuses). Which helps to create your own style. Want to be a ninja with kusarigama, throwing kunai and shuriken at enemies? Easy. Want to be a samurai in heavy armour with huge odachi that shows everyone you really mean buisness? Can do that too. Want to build a one dimensional cookie cutter build that uses nearly infinite living weapon and kills everyone in 1 hit? I mean you would miss on the beauty of Nioh's combat system, but sure, that is possible as well.

+Bosses.
They are a lot of fun. Especially once you understand the mechanics or how to approach them. But if you're getting frustrated, you can always help yourself with some onmyo, ninjitsu or other consumables. And the game even encourages that from time to time. For example, there is a boss that uses paralysis to kill you. But on the same level you can pick up some anti-paralytic needles.

+Replayability. 
There is co-op, several difficulties diablo-style and abyss which is basically a boss rush with 999 levels and different modificators. And you can also respec / create new character and try out different builds.

+Tutorials.
Yes, there are tutorials and you really should give them a go. Also, you can always watch a small clip of a move before getting it when customising your skill loadout.



-Customisation.
You play as a fixed character. No character customisation, no face sculptor or anything like that. You can refashion your armour to look differently though. Also, you can get some polymorphs in the Hidden Teahouse if you want to play as existing character. Oh, you can change the hairstyle and beard. =\

-Repetitiveness.
A lot of side missions reuse existing levels. Same with enemies. Not a lot of variety there, sadly.

-Abyss. 
It is pretty meh and poorly balanced. Everything one shots you and defense doesn't matter.

-Port quality.
You know how it always happens with japanese games that come to PC, right?

-Minor gripes.
Some weapons feel a bit underdeveloped. Axe suffers from some damage issues while Odachi is plain boring with its limited moveset. Both are viable though, don't get me wrong. There are no useless stats or weapon types in this game.

Also, as it often happens with japanese games, translation is pretty bad.",1543741864,1611086089,True,5,0,0.577464818954467773,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Combat system (stances) and weapon variety
+ Actually useful ranged weapons
+ Guardian Spirits
+ Easy to reset your build so you can't be gimped unless you try to
+ Makes you git gud all over again if you only played Dark Souls before
+ RNG and rarity-based gear so you can grind to your heart's content
+ NG is done right and you don't have to play everything all over again
+ All DLC is included in this version by default
+ Stats have a soft cap of 99 and hard cap of 200
+ Somewhat historically accurate story
+ Soundtrack is great
+ Loveable characters

Cons:
- Atrocious level design in almost all maps (shortcut placement and a metric ton of roundabouts)
- Appearantly, it sucks without a controller (I played with a controller)
- You will be oneshotted at higher NG difficulties regardless of gear
- Some hitboxes are shady as hell
- Loot takes some time to go through if you aren't very familliar with the system
- Camera is the ultimate boss

        [td][h1]The Review[/h1][/td]
        [td]The first of the Dark Souls with a Japanese twist. Nioh is a strange game for me while it does some thing better than Dark Souls but it also does some things worst. Let's start with the good. Nioh has more types of weapons than Dark Souls which also means combat is more diverse. Their are optional training areas so this game is more newbie friendly than Dark Souls. Best of all this game actually have a plot unlike Dark Souls. Now for the Bad. This game is not open world like Dark Souls, instead you select areas from a world map. They reuse area layouts constantly. The monster designs are not as good as Dark Souls. All in All I would recommend Nioh if you are trying to get into a Dark Souls type game but I would suggest getting this on a sale.[/td]

I personally really liked the entanglement of a semi Souls-like game and making it a more repetitive looter; however, I honestly have no idea how I would play without exploiting/using the living weapon as much as possible near the end or without the specific build I have. In general, the game isn't really afraid of putting you at a disadvantage such as making enemies capable of one-shoting you or having to deal with multiple enemies/bosses at once (side missions be crazy). Plus, enemies can be really tanky if you don't have the right stuff.

However, the game does give you the resources to get through most of it if you are slightly a jack of all trades (even from just the skill points from hair) and if you have backup gear. From Ninjustsu, Onmyo magic, different elements, different weapon styles, Guardian Spirits, and different armor sets, you might either find something that is OP like the Sloth talismans that slow ANY enemy for 10+ seconds like I did. I kind of just wish that it wasn't so necessary to use since it's so noticeable.

It's really odd to not really have a single build for the entire base game, but you'd be putting yourself at a great disadvantage if you ignore what the game could give to you even if it's just something simple like the Sense Enemies trait (which I couldn't part with at all). Are you as careless as I and just love taking damage? Good, reforge a weapon with weaken weapon, use wind for bluster, or use devigorate talisman to lower damage. Don't like using Elixers because you are a masochist like I as well, reforge a chest gear to net you health when you receive amrita and then use a Guardian Spirit that gives you amrita on attack, extraction magic, and that almost-useless flying swords magic spell to proc cheap melee hits.

It can be a fun game if you experiment a lot and grind a lot, but it can be an aggravating game to deal with since the difficulty can be very cheap—especially if you don't understand that it's not your typical souls-like game.

PS: I'd also recommend turning the game online btw. I don't know what I'd do without the revenant armor system even if you only find one set worn almost 99% of the time.",1610400927,1610400927,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, grinding to be the appropriate level or beyond is always a must to avoid one-hit/combo-hit deaths. Then there's the bosses, in my opinion there isn't really anything to learn to make you a better player. Bosses will hit you once and it will usually mean death from an unavoidable combo, and trading is always a bad idea since more often than not you'll be the one interrupted even if you are to hit first which encourages a loop of hitting once and rolling out that can last a while.

This feels like Dark Souls if half the enemies were all Black Knights, instead of an end-game enemy with a few others scattered around the whole world. They deal more than half your health in a single hit. I don't FEEL like I'm in bad gear but how should I know? I'm just putting on whatever gives me higher numbers mostly, and taking into account any defensive % modifiers. 

The idea of stances is a genuinely good one. It allows you to change your weapon's moveset based on the enemy you are fighting. You're given a level of flexibility without needing any extra investment into stats or finding items. But then the game has these systems anyway... too many systems. It's likely for the sake of being unique to souls but the UI is clunky enough to make it more of a hassle than a boon. 

But the loot system is probably what I feel like is wasting my time the most. Even when you got an item drop in a Souls game, it was neat but otherwise not much worth unless it's a good new weapon (like from Black Knights.) Here... you just get a loot shower. So much loot that it makes it hard to even sort through it all. I've sold upgrades to my gear because I was just mashing through it before realizing ""oh wait, I never sorted my stuff."" 

Even Borderlands 1 and 2 weren't this bad. Well, 2 was a bad game in general but that's besides the point. There's just too much loot. But hey, they brought over the Badass ranks of Borderlands too! Like i said, too many systems.

The base system there is neat with multiple stances, I like the aesthetic... but that's it. Everything else feels wrong. Overly punishing even for a Souls game, and generally just making me regret my purchase entirely",1610061586,1610061586,False,7,1,0.493779152631759644,0,True,False,False

The premise? Take the brutal design of Ninja Gaiden's combat system and merge it with Souls-Like design, including combat, level design, equipment and stats. IMO, you have the best Souls-Like game ever made. Immensely complex and more rewarding then it's counterparts. If you're looking for a traditional Dark Souls experience here, look elsewhere. As previously mentioned, this game is markedly more complex and difficult, in particular with it's combat and enemy design.
---

PROS;

- Fantastic art-direction/style.
- Solid graphical design. Looks pretty good on a modern gaming rig. Isn't transformative but looks markedly better then it's console counterpart, in both visual fidelity and framerate.
- Interesting storyline. Blends high-fantasy/fiction with historical accounts from Japan's feudal-era.
- Optimized very well for PC in it's current state. I can't recall a single crash in my 170+ hours of playtime. 
- Takes the best parts of Ninja Gaiden's combat ideas and melds it with a slower Souls-Like pace while making it unique in it's own right with the weapon-stance system. 
- Multiple weapon types allowing for multiple playstyles, including Ninjitsu and ""Onmyo Magic""
- Deep skill tree system for each weapon with sub-branches for the aforementioned further allowing for a customized playstyle.
- Responsive movement/dodge system. ""Ki-Pulse"" system allows for aggressive playstyles and rewards skillful play.
- ""Guardian Spirit"" burst system adds another system-style layer for the player to use when they're desperate to survive or want to dish out massive amounts of damage quickly. Extremely useful during boss fights. Many different types that modify your stats/builds.
- Expansive equipment system, including item sets that give the game a Diablo/ARPG-esque feel. Will really get fans of that particular sub-genre hooked if you can wrap your head around the combat system and become proficient.
- Very long primary campaign with multiple new-game+ options, including the introduction of brand new, powerful gear types the further you progress. DLC content is also solid and features some truly difficult boss fights.
- Challenging! This game isn't for the faint of heart; it's substantially more difficult then your typical ""Dark Souls"" style game and will punish you far more until you can understand the movement and combat options at your disposal in an efficient manner.

CONS;

- Audio design isn't particularly incredible. More of an indifferent for me. Both music and audio in general is forgettable.
- Some of the level/mission design can become a bit repetitive.

In closing, this is a near perfect game for me at a 9.5/10. The only thing keeping it perfect in my eyes is the level/mission design gets a bit repetitive at times. I've put more time into this game then any other ""Souls-Like"" game by a fair amount. It's engaging, fast-paced combat and ARPG loot-style systems keep me coming back. One of my favorite games ever.

I haven't played the game long enough to post a full review, so I will edit it later when I will have finished it. For now, I'll say only that I have been enjoying the game so far.

I posted this ""review"" because I was refraining from buying it for all the negative reviews saying it crashes or doesn't run well. Then I remembered steam has a refund policy so I said f*** it and I bought it anyway. The game ran great out of the box with 0 tweaking required. 60fps locked at 1440p highest settings on a 1660ti and ryzen 3600.


[h1]EDIT, FULL REVIEW[/h1]

Yes i am gonna compare this game to dark souls and i will assume you have at least played one game in the series. This is my background and i have not played the other games people compare this game to.

Same bonfire and death mechanics (you leave the bloodstain and have to recover, shrines serve the same function as bonfires), roughly same combat system based on stamina management, similar two phase game loop (level clearing/exploration and boss fighting), similar stat system, similar dodge speed/animation based on equip load percentage.

[b]What are the differences?[/b]

1. World building
Nioh is based on standalone levels that you access through a map screen in a mostly predetermined fashion. You can only choose if and in which order to do secondary missions. Some of the secondary missions have original levels, but are mostly variations of levels you have already played in previous main or secondary missions.

2. Loot system and crafting
Nioh is based on a template + level based + random stats for its loot, in a fashion similar to borderlands. There are no significant item finds, it's just pressing circle to blindly add to inventory and then check if you got anything good between missions. Equipment becomes obsolete really fast and for this reason a main feature of the game (crafting) is locked out until you reach the end of the game. The gear i would be using for the rest of the game was practically decided in the first 5 hours and i ended up just replacing the same items with some levels higher whenever i got them. For the entirety of the main game it looks like the only matching set you are gonna get is warrior of the west. Your options open up when this pace of gear obsolescence slows down once you complete the main game. You can finally really choose what armor suits best your build and your playstyle and keep improving it at a reasonable rate without it becoming obsolete in half an hour.
I don't like this loot system because it makes finding items worthless and there is no real intentionality in the gear you choose since you are forced to slap on whatever gives the best numbers.

3. Weapon class and skill system
The movesets for weapons in Nioh are entirely category dependent and can be greatly expanded by investing in the dedicated skill trees. Each weapon creates a way more differentiated playstyle than in souls games. Once you have decided that you want to play with some weapon class, you have no real alternatives meaning that you will soon or later acquire all skills in that tree. Skills are never permanently inaccessible, they are locked only temporarily.

4. Combat
Combat in Nioh is more proactive, aggressive and fast. You have much more options and are not forced to play the dark souls game of in and out. This is shows especially in boss fights, which are much more dynamic. You can both die very fast or kill the boss very fast. Stamina regen (IMO) is king, and the Kato guardian spirit has no equal because of this if your build is mainly melee. Guardian spirits act as passive buffs and can be used to go in a sort of rage mode once their gauge is filled. The most interesting mechanic is how stamina gets depleted also when you get hit and how it puts you in a stagger state where you are vulnerable to a finisher when an attack totally depletes it (also works for enemies). Probably this is the foundation of what became posture in Sekiro.

[b]What do i think about the game?[/b]

The combat is nice, i don't like the loot/crafting system and the repetitivity of the secondary missions. The game feels somewhat grindy and would probably be if you intend to experience the post end game content or get the best possible gear. Difficulty is probably on the harder side but mostly dependent on your level and build in relation to the enemies. I got bored at around region 3 and 4 and thought of dropping the game because i felt i had seen all its core elements (the story is uninteresting), but managed to power through and enjoyed the dlc content. The controls are tight AF and the game is really polished in all its details and feels like it's the product of genuine love and care. What pisses me off the most is that it doesn't have any anti-aliasing. Having the option to go above 60fps would be nice but the game plays absolutely fine nevertheless. I didn't play multiplayer at all.

I recommend you get this on sale if you enjoy souls games/challenging games/action rpg's and i will be buying nioh 2 once it is on sale too.

[*]Overview
Nice, atmospheric setting of feudal Japan, mixed with it’s mythology? Soulslike gameplay with (finally!!!) cool and complex combat system, as well as tons of loot and diverse progression? Surprisingly decent story with interesting characters? Adequate multiplayer system, allowing for proper coop walkthrough or balanced PvP duels, without the need for some idiotic signs/phantoms/invasions???
All of the above - YES. 100%.
[*]Story
Set in 1600, Nioh tells the story of William - an Irishman who learns of a plot made by Britain's higher ups. Seeking to obtain the power of Amrita - the soul stones - they send their sorcerer to Japan, which is caught in a civil war. At this point it’s worth mentioning that most of the global events happening to Japan in Nioh are based on historical facts, with lots of characters that you meet being people who actually lived. In other words, Nioh tells an engaging, epic story, cleverly mixing actual historical events and mysticism, much like the first Assassin's Creed games that didn’t suck.
Our character gets to learn the ways of samurai, shinobi and Onmyo mages, in order to become a great Oni (demon) hunter and save Japan from the upcoming conflict, while also pursuing his own quest for revenge.
[*]Gameplay
Standard soulslike formula, but with most of standard elements that it, apparently, entails gotten rid of. Aside from a decent story that most soulslikes lack, Nioh can boast easily the most interesting combat system that I’ve seen in this genre so far.
You want ranged combat? - You’ve got rifles and handcannons, along with a plethora of different grenades. All of them can act as either powerful secondaries or even your main weapon choice, if you choose the right build.
You want a quiet approach? - Then you’ve got bows, smoke bombs, traps and shurikens/kunais of all kinds, not to mention weapons and armor best suited for stealth and mobility.
You want to feel like a mage or professional demon hunter/exorcist? - Then you have offensive spells, bunch of buffs and debuffs, several types of elemental damage, etc. In other words, a full set that’ll allow you to approach every fight best prepared against any type of enemy.
And, of course, if you wish to feel like a true samurai, then Nioh has a complex and diverse melee combat system, that easily puts most of its competitors to shame. 7 weapon classes, each with expansive, customizable moveset, allowing you to choose the one best suited for your playstyle. Reliable katanas, rapid dual swords, hard hitting axes/hammers, lighting-fast tonfas, polearms boasting long range and the multi-purposed odachis - whatever is your pick, each type of weapon possesses beautifully animated and diverse attacks. 
Two key aspects of the melee combat that I must mention are the stances and stamina management. Each weapon has three stances - High (low speed, powerful blows, usually single-target), Mid (average speed and damage, usually crowd-control) and Low (fast-paced, low damage and range). As you level up, you unlock the ability to combo attacks from different stances, switching between them on the fly. You also unlock powerful new attacks and passive buffs, with the ability to assign them to different stances however you like. Stamina management and switching between different attacks are tied into one system that rewards you for precise timing and ability to quickly adapt to the situation. Overall, the best part about combat in Nioh is that it actually requires you to use both your spinal cord AND your brain, unlike most games of the genre, that require you to use only the former.
And, of course, you have multiple Guardian Spirit to choose from; each giving you permanent buffs, as well as the ability to channel their elemental power for a huge damage boost, best suited for dealing with the toughest enemies.
In terms of progression, you have your standard RPG “attributes'' to level up, and a diabloid-inspired loot system. You farm new weapons and gear of different rarities and levels, with some of them granting you unique set bonuses. Greatest part about it is that you can apply any skin of a found item on the other ones, so if visuals mean to you as much as the stats do - you’re in luck.
Finally, the multiplayer. First things first - you can just start any mission in co-op from the get-go and complete it with a friend, with both of you getting the rewards and marking mission as “completed.” It’s also worth mentioning that it’s pretty well balanced: there are two of you, but the enemies are tougher and greater in numbers; you can revive each other, but there are no checkpoints and if both of you die - you start all over.

Basically, there are only two drawbacks that I can think of: 1) the complete absence of UI adaptation for PC, forcing you to spend the first few hours constantly peeking into Options menu in order to learn the M&K controls, unless you're playing on gamepad. The M&K controls themselves are... passable, once you figure them out, but overall they're still rather disappointing 2) the repetitiveness - 80% of side mission have you visit many locations over and over again with minor alterations made to them. 
[*]Graphics
The level design, the character and gear design, the design of all enemies (both human and demon) - all of it just “screams” of quality. Add the neat visual effects of magic, shooting and explosions, top notch blood and gore (there is actually some great dismemberment to see here, as well as bloodstains covering both your gear and the environment procedurally), and you get… almost perfect graphics. With emphasis on “almost” due to the PC port being HARD LOCKED ON 60 FUCKING FPS!!! IN A GAME RELEASED IN 2017!!! Luckily, that is the only drawback that I can think of when it comes to graphics.
[*]Sound
Again, the sound quality should leave none unsatisfied. The soundtrack fits the setting, the SFX of combat are amazingly well done, and the voice acting is done exceptionally. It’s worth mentioning that the characters speak in the languages they are supposed to, so most of the lines are going to be in Japanese; with only our MC and a handful of others speaking in English.
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
8/10, with points taken away for the lack of UI adaptation for M&K controls, and just overall standard, cheap “PC port” treatment. Aaand certain levels of repetitiveness and occasional grindiness.

===============

Edit: Turns out if you watch a Youtube tutorial on the crafting system, and use the options available to you ( Ninjustu + Onmyo magic ) the game gets a whole lot more interesting! 

This game wants you to play ITS way, not YOUR way. Once you accept that, life gets easier. Changed to up-vote.

===============

Edit 3: I have now completed the game and can write a full review.  Review changed back to a downvote  It's not a bad game, I pushed to the end, it made it interesting, but it's too much of a pain to play for my taste. 

The combat system is engaging and fun! Combing between stance changes, between weapon changes, feels really cool. There are some games where you get a high combo by mashing one button, but in Nioh you actually WORK to do your combat and this feels really amazing. When you get outplayed, you feel it! When you die to stupid things, you can only blame yourself. You got back in and dodge it, and suddenly it's not stupid. Play more patiently or do the fight a few times to learn the moves, and you will fight with ease!

There are SO MANY BOSSES! All so rich with Japanese themes and history. You die enough on each boss fight to appreciate all of them. Consequently, the game is REALLY long. There is enough content to keep you playing for a LONG time. 

Since I'm generally unhappy with this game I'd like to spend more time talking about what I didn't like and why I don't recommend.

Simply. The game is too hard. Everything I'm about to go into, all contributes to the fact the game is too hard. Such pity that this amazing game caused me so much frustration and sadness, preventing me from singing it's praises.

Items. 
You find consumable items in the game as you progress. These items can give health, XP, buffs e.c.t.
If you use an item you help you beat a boss, and then die afterwards, you have to redo the boss from full HP, but you don't have the item anymore. You might has well have thrown it away. 
Some with through levels, use an item to fight this hard group of enemies, but then dying anytime before the next shrine, means you now need to do that hard fight AGAIN, with no item. 
This leads to a MASSIVE hoarder mentality. Collecting everything but never using it. I'm dying so much, that I'm scared of using this item because there is no point if I die afterwards.
I feel like this is good example of video gave teaching players the wrong lessons.

Dropping your spirit on death. 
The most frustrating thing about the game is that your spirit is tied to your XP. 
If you die you drop your spirit and you drop your XP with it ( Inter-level XP, only XP that counts toward your next level ) 
If you can make it back to your spirit before dying again, everything is fine and you keep your XP. If you die again, all your XP is lost.
A few games have a similar mechanic but, I hate this so much. 
As soon as you drop your spirit you avoid every fight so you don't die getting it back. 
If you drop it in the boss arena, you need to to run through enemies before getting it back.
I first quit the game on the 3rd stage, where you need to run through broken docks, with holes in the floor.
Run to boss. Die, Run to boss, get spirit, die, run to boss, run to boss, get spirit, die x24
run to boss, slip into water,  lose spirit, an hour+ of time wasted and you're still the same level. 
It hurts so much, there are so many ways they could have done this to make it easier. 

Save points are WAY too far apart.
By the time you finish the game, you're mostly used to this, so I nearly forgot to include this. 
However this is something that made the first experience so much worse.
It's a hard game and you die so often, so to make it so far and through so many enemies to still not make it to a save point also really hurts. 
This leads to another bad lesson this game teaches. Just run past everything. Yes this is a fighting game, but if you don't want to die before reaching your spirit, and if you don't want to kill everything AGAIN, just run past them, get your spirit. Then see new enemies you haven't killed, run past those too, otherwise you might die again before finding the save point.

Your level VS Mission Level
In most games with a similar mission system like Nioh:
If you ONLY did the main missions you would be somewhat under-leveled.
If you did the main missions and some sub-missions, your level would be about even with the upcoming mission level
If you did the main missions and ALL the sub-missions, you would be somewhat over-leveled. 
In the final region of the game, I had not only done all main and sub-missions, but gone back a few of the shorter sub-missions and did them again and again and again for XP, I was still 20 levels under-leveled.
Again, unnecessarily difficult. 
I beat the final boss(es), The Demon King Revealed (135) and The Queen's Eyes (145) at about level 120. 
I was happy to be done, I told myself I'd push myself to finish this game. 
Turns out since I have ""complete"" edition .... I have 3 more regions to go through. 
""Oh hell no""  and I exited the game. 

Then it clicked, imagine spending WEEKS on a game, everyday after work just making bits of small progress. 
Finally finishing it, and then being UPSET at even MORE content? Because that means more dying, more grinding just to not be so far under-leveled, more frustration.
Just for more of the same combos and strategies? I enjoyed the final stage, seeing my build in it's final form. 
But now I have no interest in playing any more. 

Then I really struggled about how I'm going to write this review. Thumbs up or down?
I concluded that if you spent so long on a game invested so much into getting decent at it, and then being upset at extra content, you truly didn't like it.
If I could go back to before I played, and getting sucked into this cycle of 
determination -> doubt -> stress -> frustration -> stress -> relief -> euphoria
I would actually chose to rather not play this game. 
Again, pity. The concept, the combat, the visuals, amazing.

Pros:
- Combat system is one of the bests out there, just great
- Tons of posibilities to build your character (A lot of different weapons, nunjutsu, magic, spirit magic, etc)
- Awesome graphics
- Astonishing art
- Difficulty level is just perfect, begins hard, once you get the hang of it it becomes easy, then it becomes hard again
- Cinematics/cutscenes and dialogues are really nice and immersive
- Cool story
- Very addictive
- Hundreds of hours of gameplay
- Very rewarding game
- Lots of japanese mythology and history combined, which is great
- Boss design is incredible


Cons:
- Highly recommended to get a controller, controls on PC are just weird and not very intuitive.


Overall a MUST PLAY game if you like ARPGs like Dark Souls, an amazing game and truly a masterpiece.

Nioh gets a lot very right -- with an excellent combat system, an equally robust skill/talent system, and relatively competent level design -- but unfortunately lets these qualities go to waste by having too many obtuse mechanics, extremely poor enemy & boss design, and bland, repetitive environments.

If you wished Dark Souls would let you ninja-run around bashing up a disappointingly small cast of enemies while chasing ever higher soul and gear levels, Nioh is a good choice. If you're more interested in learning every step and nuance of each enemy in order to bash its face in properly on the next stage, the next chapter, the next difficulty level, armed with seven very different weapon types that you'll learn the ins and outs of in crispy-smooth combat, you'll enjoy Nioh. If you like learning a LOT of different systems to make your character stronger and all the interplay they have, Nioh's a good pick. Don't expect incredible atmosphere or storytelling- they're passable, but that's it.

The 'git gud' in the game has a very definite gear axis, and while it's mostly pointlessly complicated beyond 'get the higher level one' for the first playthrough, you'll learn what makes good duds in the, uh, FIVE tiers of NG+ the game has. You won't go beating your way through the game with a soup ladle in this one.

Games still looks really nice- blood splatters go everywhere neatly, heads get lopped off with wild abandon, character faces are well animated and convey a lot of emotion, animations are smooth and sensible. Environments, eh, they're just sort of there. Caves are caves, burnt-out Japanese castles and shrines are dark and decrepit. Design is generally good, but there's no Anor Londos. Again, they're all instanced, so no need to worry about which zones interconnect to other zones, for better or worse.

Criticisms- You'll be seeing a few zones a few times over in side-missions, and I'm not kidding when I say the cast of enemies is small, but when you're chasing power and learning how to play better, it's easy to overlook. Some of the enemies' attacks feel cheap, but plenty of times you'll just have to reconsider how many attacks you can dedicate into a counterattack, or which direction you're supposed to dodge. For as snappy as combat is, you'll have to learn a little patience.

If it sounds like the sort of thing you're interested in, full recommendation. I can't necessarily recommend waiting on a sale, since that seems to happen surprisingly rarely, but if it is, nab it.",1608694932,1608694932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is based on japan folklore, and follows a pirat trying to save the world from war. For me it's a kinda thin story and you don't get to know much about any of the characters, besides most sidequests are just small stories not related to the mainstory, which is just saying how little they cared for the games story.

Gameplaywise you will meet around 20 different monsters which isn't alot. They implemented ai pvp much akin to summoning signs in DS (which are ai's that can have the same items as regular players, but usually aren't a challenge). 
The maps and dungeons you roam are reused regularly, so don't expect a big adventure game. All in all it gets tedious if you aren't te player that seeks to down bosses on harder difficulties (ng+).

Numerous problems with how it's layed out with parrying or blocking and stamina, but much of the combat is made to be both slow paced, yet also high risk with easy one or two hit deaths on the player against many enemies. The player doesn't have high skill attacks or counter, or rewarding moments like firing a high powered spell or good hits with a heavy weapon, it's just lots of week attacks it feels like from the player, ok against weak enemies but any medium or high threat one and you always just feel like you're scraping away the enemies health bar playing the long term waiting game.

Design wise, they love mixing enemies in areas that are just not well paired. Like locking the player in an enclosed location, with two enemies that are both highly mobile and have ranged and mellee AOE attacks. The camera can't maintain lock across the room, and the player has to stop and turn before moving again when turning so if the camera breaks lock you'll just stop as your camera jerks about forcing a turn. You'll easily have one enemy off scree as both can fly up and one of them has a long ranged one shot kill attack he launched from in the air with no audio warning. So you MUST look at him to avoid it, but then you can't see the other one on the ground possibly behind you or anywhere else that also has its own attacks, ranged and close, without clear audio warnings.  Both have attacks that can fro a distance shoot them to and past the player, so you can't reliably kite both enemies on one side... you get the idea. All this in a game where you die from one or two hits often enough, and your consumables can't be used to really help through these tough areas much as the'yre often pretty weak, take too much time to use, and ranged weapons lose ammo and you can't reliably get any more during a mission, so if you use it up once on an enemy, it's gone. If you have a hard time and need to come back you can easily fight enemies no longer with ranged attacks or extra healing beyond just 4 units left.

Beyond fundamentally flawed game and enemy designs, like a unit that with no warning or tell can instantly just deal damage to the player if near them, it's also just more than a bit buggy.
Input queues for attacks stack, dodge inputs or other things will not break a queued attack, you'll go through with your attack no matter what... sometimes. The games inputs half the time get dropped for no apparent reason. One of the most common being while standing still, or walking, having use item inputs get ignored. Nothing like spamming the health button while walking away from an enemy only for the third input to finally register (and it's not my controller, verrified that with other games and other testing). They also love combos for doing anything. want to change your weapon, press this button and then this one. Want to swap items, press this and that. Swap weapon stance, this button, wait a moment, then that one. Tons of these combos that make it frankly take ages to get muscle memory for all these combos and what works how when different thigns are done, but the timings also. They really could have streamlined your inputs better and cut back on some of the extra clutter.

In the end, not as buggy as Mortal Shell but easily enough to be frusterating, bad game design and balance. That fine line of challenging but satisfactory and just broken and unfair and frusterating was definitely crossed during many parts of this game. Overall I've felt it's a slog trying to play through this one and super frusterating, and quite often after beating enemies not satisfying.
I've beaten fully Code Vein, All Dark Souls games, Mortal Shell, Hollow Knight, Little Witch Nobetta, and plenty of other games in the Souls Like vein. And this is probably second worst only to Mortal Shell. But way more of a time wasting feeling than Mortal Shell since it's super padded and drawn out while at least Mortal Shell, while worse, was quick enough to beat and be done with.",1608162450,1608162450,False,5,6,0.436067730188369751,0,True,False,False

It has an interesting story and usually sports fun and beautiful levels, although occasionally they are difficult to navigate and while it can get frustrating at times it can also be a fun puzzle, and unlike darksouls things are broken down into levels rather than a semi open world, so even the toughest maps to navigate are only a single visit. 

Loads of character customization between different weapon types with each weapon having at least three movesets with the stance mechanic, as well as unlockable swappable attacks, as well as optional magic type abilities which can be quite strong. Loot is fun and interesting and constantly floods in, adding tons of depth and ways to tweak the character finely between stats and even set bonuses. The gear mechanics are unnecessarily complicated and take some getting used to, while a bit of a headache it is also easy enough to just ignore the complicated parts and just take the best statted items as they come and worry about the fancy parts if and when you feel up to the task. 

It is extremely challenging, and even basic enemies can easily kill you, which while it can be frustrating at times is mostly a pro as that is the kind of difficulty we sign up for with this genre. But the controls are responsive and fun, hitboxes feel extremely accurate, and you can even map the controls to your taste, unfortunately things do not relabel what they are supposed to be when you remap so it can be a bit confusing, but at least you have the option for remapping. 

Altogether a great experience that will be worth replaying, be it just for fun and mastery, or because you want to try out a new build, and thankfully there is an easy to acquire method of respecing to.

The levels were all variations of dark-souls-esque winding passages around that just seemed to be there to take time as you hack your way through the slight variation of enemy.

With 1300 hours into Dark Souls 3, trust me, I have looked for the next thing to play afterwards.
So, if you have been unsatisfied by the many suggestions only to find them all terribly lacking, well, this is it. Your quest for what to play until Elden Ring is released is over.
Do not be put off ( like I was) by reviews saying it's a very poor port and the tutorial just shows you the controller. 
DSIII tutorial was the same way and that didn't stop you did it?
This is an excellent port. It's runs great. Controls are quick and responsive, graphics are excellent, combat is hard, maybe even harder than DS3. 
This isn't a DS3 killer and it's not better but it's damn good. On top of being very similar in controls and combat to DS3, you also have weather, armor with tons of different bonuses, stances, and a plot line that doesn't take a doctorate in weeb-ology to understand.
5 out of 5.
And now an edit after about 50 hours of play.

Nioh is hard. And in a ""not souls"" way.  I've now come up against 3 missions that have a ""We're just going to keep throwing mobs at you, in a locked room, until you run out of healing potions.' Long after that, the mobs end. Or one warlord mission he says he wants to duel you. That's the entire mission. And that one guy is harder than anything I've faced except the vampire boss who is just impossible. I watched a pro streamer take him on 15 times (and get very salty doing it) before beating him. I used a branch to recall myself out of the mission and don't plan on going back. I will never beat that guy.
And when I'm about to log into Nioh I have to take a deep breath and prepare myself like it's a job. I felt that way about Dark Souls before I beat Gundyr, the first boss, but never again since then. I feel that way every time I log into Nioh.
Update #3 At the 70 hour mark I uninstalled the game. The reuse of maps and mobs just got to me. Also, don't listen to what anyone tells you about armor. It's the same as dark souls in that, it doesn't matter. What does light or heavy armor matters when mobs either one shot you or stunlock you and kill you when you can't respond? 
This is a good shell of a game that they have designed a few mobs and a few areas and just use them over and over and over. It's boring and cheap. The loot system is very complex for very little gain. If you drop me 40 different tonfas and each one is identical except one is .1% better than the last, who really cares? The loot progression is all like this. Each time you get to a new area, the loot is 1% better. Its just not exciting. 
I'm leaving this with a thumbs up review because it gave me 70 hours of entertainment. Well, about half entertainment and half rage but still worth it.",1605463733,1607530914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself is very well made on the actions, learning skills and movesets for your weapons. What I do get upset at some points is the parts where the difficulty simply jump very high at some part of the game (like getting an easy area and boom, hard boss or completely the opposite: Hard area but easy boss).

As for the story, it isn't much, except that you run all around in Japan during the Sengoku period (pretty much the time for many feudal japanese games) to rescue your Guardian Spirit from a not-so-devil-looking british man. As that guy also wants to put Japan into Chaos for his own purpose.

As you are diversified with many weapons, you can bring out 2 melee and 2 range weapons on you at the same time. It is quite funny to see yourself bringing all of them on your back and on your waist together.

The leveling system is similar to Dark Souls: You gain Amrita and if you die, you lose them all, until you go to your dead location to retrieve them. As your level up, the amount of Amrita is required, like in DS. So on that point, it is quite normal.

In overall, good Similar to Dark Souls and a change if your are searching a similar game in its genre. Nioh didn't deceive on those points. I really enjoyed from the beginning to the end.",1607461825,1607461825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Cool combat mechanics (low, mid, high stance to use with different weapons)
- Fun and challenging boss fights. I never felt like there was an unfair boss.
- Interesting skill trees and character builds
- Living weapon mechanic for some much needed power ups during tough boss fights

Cons:
- Heavily loot based game. You will need to do side missions and fight revenants (resurrected players) in order to keep your gear up to date. This could be a pro or a con depending on the player, but towards the end of the game, this started to get annoying for me when I just wanted to play the main story.
- Side missions are uninteresting, and you will fight recycled bosses
- The gear drops from enemies are useless. You will spend a lot of time at the blacksmith selling these weapons just to clear your inventory.
- Confusing, hard to follow story

People say it has unique combat mechanics, no, it has timed stamina refill as opposed to timed blocking like in dark souls and sekiro. Your gear literally has no bearing on your survival, its pathetic, you see a dude wearing the same armor as you, wielding the same weapon as you, but it takes 8 hits to kill him, yet he can kill you in 2 hits.
I have never seen a more USELESS skill tree, I literally restarted after spending my first few points when one of my skills kept changing my stance at the end of a combo, I am literally going to play this new game without any skills (unless they get better at some point....i doubt it).
EXACTLY the same way you could lose all your souls when you died in DS, you can lose your Amrita in nioh, EXCEPT, you don't drop a collection point every time in nioh. Your spirit guardian has to leave your body to create the drop point, if you die before you collect the drop point, you not only lose what was dropped YOU ALSO lose whatever you have gathered to that point AS WELL, your spirit guardian returns (or you ask it to return at the shrine, losing it all anyway) and then you can make another drop point.
I'm SURE most people would quit this game before they even got access to the blacksmith, mainly because you use up the 4 arrows you've collected to clear all the archers in an area, die, respawn, and whats that? i have no arrows. I mean you can kill archers if you run up to them, but that just adds to the absolute waste of time grind the game is. 
To level up you need to go to a shrine, this resets the level and, you guessed it, you've got to do it all again, by the 5th time you have to clear the same boring shit, you just charge in there, hoping to do it as quick as possible, and are punished for it. BUT WAIT. HAVEN'T I JUST LEVELED UP FIVE TIMES???? WHY AREN'T THESE PRICKS GOING DOWN FASTER???
Next the koei-Tecmo PLAGUE. The way they refuse to add key definitions for mouse and keyboard, I've literally bought a pleb-box controller just for koei-tecmo. I mean a basic keyboard has 112 keys, WHY THE FUCK DO I NEED TO HOLD ONE BUTTON TO BRING UP A WHEEL/GROUP (whatever you want to call it) WHEN I COULD EASILY JUST ASSIGN KEYS TO EVERYTHING, PLEB-BOX CONTROLLERS HAVE 14 BUTTONS WHY STICK ME IN THAT BOX???
Dark Souls and Sekiro are difficult but challenging, Nioh is just plain PAINFUL. If you've already finished the aforementioned i'd recommend Monster Hunter if you want a new hack and slash.

The combat is extremely fast and has enough depth to rival games like Devil May Cry and Team Ninja's own Ninja Gaiden games, with very deep RPG mechanics and ARPG-style loot and character building.
It is also actually difficult by being extremely punishing, ONE mistake will kill you when fighting the bosses, you will often get 1 or 2-shot by enemies in the higher difficulties. When you get used to the game and things start getting easy, there's another difficulty to open up on the next NG+ cycle, changing the game in ways far beyond the NG+ in other games, including different enemy placement, more aggressive enemies, new attacks added to existing bosses, enemies with unique buffs, and entirely unique loot.

What's bad about it:
Level design is very weak, often devolving to similarly looking mazes. 
Living Weapon and its related builds can make the bosses a joke, as well as a debuff called Sloth. Avoid using these if you want to experience the fights properly.
All the ARPG loot systems in the game are entirely irrelevant and unneeded on your first difficulty playthrough. While in NG+ and beyond they DO start to matter a lot and are very engaging and fun to farm for, in the first difficulty/playthrough they add up to nothing but busywork that you don't care about doing. The game only really starts to get really good after you unlock the first NG+, as all systems start to become engaging and vital to your progression.

It's got a lot of great game design, but I'll warn you it has a small amount of awful design added on which sours the experience sometimes. But I'll start with the good stuff first. This game has excellent combat. There's about a half-dozen weapon types and each weapon type can be used in three different stances, which change your moveset. You can also get a fourth moveset with each weapon when you activate your living weapon, using the power of a guardian spirit. Not only that, there's also unlockable skills that give you combo finishers, attacks used while guarding, charged attacks, jumping attacks, parries, and more. Then there's the ki pulse which lets you regain stamina for timing a button press just right after an attack, which can also be extended to change stances or dodge while recovering stamina. And that's not even mentioning the Onmyo magic or Ninja techniques you can unlock. The combat alone makes this entire game a blast to play and well worth buying. Also, the visual style is great. You can see the traditional japanese art style lovingly recreated in a video game with 3d models. And it's got beautiful, historically accurate and practical weapons and armour. Except for the great halberd of Hihiragi. And a few of the swords. And every european design they attempt to include. And the entire axe weapon category. But other than that, it's historically accurate.

And here's that awful design I mentioned. It's most common in the very late game, but sometimes they just add one one or two BS things that ruin the entire encounter. For example, In one side mission you fight multiple revenants in about three different groups going one group after the other. Then you fight two boss characters at the same time. Sounds like an intense, yet engaging challenge right? Wrong. Because the revenants make up most of the fighting and once you figure them out they're mind-numbingly boring to fight. They always block the second hit you make on them, so the only good strategy is to to hit them, then back up. Hit, back up, hit, back up, and you repeat that for about 10-15 minutes. It's so boring that it actually made me play worse. I started the game on that level, I almost beat the two bosses but I died. So I tried a few more times and in that entire game session I never had an attempt as good as the first one because instead of thinking about all my options at once, my brain was just repeating hit, back up, hit, back up.

And the story and characters are completely forgettable, but at least it has a good world to immerse yourself in. And in general, this game has great gameplay and great visual design.

And this game got labyrinth in their map and for god's sake it's frustrating yet so fun, while kee grinding on the same stage you'll gettin known better about how's the map works, so.. grinding hard to get better.

Now let's look for the Pros and Cons.

+Pros
	+Graphics; The first thing you gonna notice in the game will be graphics. In my opinion, for a game from 2017, textures and models are made pretty good. (Especially the level where is rain and water.  You can see water droplets bounces off your armor. I wish if there would be an RTX option for this game. It would make the even greater experience of feeling being in that timeline of the game.
	+Sound; Sound and Audio are also amazing in this game. It sometimes helps you to notice that you've been attacked or the fight is over you can rest now. The level BGM and audio also are incredibly good it brings the feel to all of the things that happen. p.s. Sometimes I also got jump scared of sounds. :D
	+Story; The storyline isn't bad. I kinda liked it. Except for a little turn at the end ""No spoilers"". Nioh also has a lot of historical things added into the game mixed with fictional which creates a perfect balance. I loved it.
	+Gameplay; If you're a fan of versatility, likes many different skill trees, builds, fight types. Then you will love this game! A lot of weapons, each weapon has four weapon stances, multiple enchantments, stats, and so on. Which you can also change at the blacksmith, and even there are blacksmith upgrades and skills. So it goes even further. :D Levels are pretty big, bigger than some of Dark Soul's levels. Each Main Campaign Missions has many collectibles that you have to find. Tons of side missions. Guardian Spirits that give your character different traits/ powers. I was playing using a Steam controller, and all of the key mappings were great, easy to learn and remember. Also, there are encounters that you can get through without fighting, just by taunting. Co-op play works perfectly fine with no bugs at all. At least I didn't step on any of them. Once you finish the game. It unlocks New game+. Which has also new side missions! Does any other game do that? I don't think so.  

-Cons

Versatility. For some players that could be an amazing experience, but for others it overcomplicates things.

[h1] [b]COMBAT[/b] [/h1]

The first thing I noticed is that this game is unforgiving (Souls-like in that sense), every misstep, every unnecessary attack is immediately punished, and, depending on your tenacity, you can either give up in the first 30 minutes of gameplay, or learn how to play by trial and error until you get a firm grip of the mechanics. All enemies (and I mean ALL of them) will take about half your health (or more, in few cases) with one hit, regardless of your level or equipment, which can be considered a little too harsh. The most important thing you have to know about combat in this game is that you can't face more than 1 or 2 enemies at once, [b]YOU WILL DIE[/b] if you try. 
Combat controls are basic souls-type: Dodge, Block, Heavy attack, Light attack, with the added particularity of ""combat stances"". Every weapon can be used in 3 different stances: Low, Medium and High, each one with a different set of moves and stamina consumption, and also different advantages/disadvantages each (e.g High stance can't block attacks, but it usually has more range and damage). Paired with all this, there's also a special ability called ""Living Weapon"". This special ability temporarily transforms you into a killing machine that can't receive damage and isn't limited by a stamina bar, the downside being that the more damage you receive, the faster the power drains. This stance-type of combat also affects dodging, which is one of the low points in the game. Dodging has different speeds and animation depending on the stance you are, but it's unclear when is it that the game registers a hit and when not. Sometimes, you think you timed the dodge perfectly, but it still registers damage taken, even when the animation isn't interrupted. Overall, combat is fun most of the times. 
There are 7 melee weapon types (Sword/Katana, Dual swords, Spear, Odachi/Greatsword, Kusarigama/short scythe with chain, Tonfa/Batons and Axes), and 3 ranged weapon types (Bows, Rifles and Hand cannons). All weapons have their own set of combos with each different stance, and different stamina consumption and damage. Most weapons are balanced, but there are some useless weapons for PvE (Tonfas will get you killed against most enemies).
You are also introduced to Ninjutsus (basically spells). There's a fairly good range of spells you can learn, most of them boosts Stamina or imbues your weapon with a certain element. As said before, most won't be of much use against most enemies, being useful only in PvP.

[h1] [b]LOOT[/b] [/h1]

If you are a fan of RNG loot, like me, you will certainly enjoy looting enemies in this game. Most enemies drop some type of equipment, mostly depending on the difficulty of the enemy, varying from normal rarity to legendary. Your inventory, while spacious, is limited and if you pick up every single piece of equipment, you'll find yourself overloaded in no time. Fortunately, you have the choice to either sell that equipment for money, or ""offering"" it in a shrine for experience and random consumables. Besides equipment, most enemies have a chance to drop materials, used for forging equipment. Most materials are dropped by all enemies, but some special ones, are dropped by certain types of enemies.
There's also an added type of loot, which comes from other player's ""phantoms"". When you are playing in online mode, you'll see graves left by players on death, and when interacted with, you'll have the chance to face a phantom of that player controlled by an AI, which will move, act and attack based on the player's preferred game-play. If you manage to kill one of these phantoms, you'll get some of said player equipment as a reward, which is selected at random from their head, torso, arm, leg or foot armor and their ranged or melee weapon. This mechanic may prove to be a little unbalanced, since you can get a powerful weapon drop early on in the game, making the game exponentially easier.
The main problem you'll face while learning to play, is the lack of healing items. Similar to Dark Souls, you'll have an assured amount of ""Elixirs"" (which heals around 60%) when entering praying on a shrine (Similar to bonfires in Dark Souls). Shrines will refill a maximum of 3-4 carriable Elixirs anytime you visit one, forcing you to be very cautious when fighting. Fortunately, you have the chance of finding more Elixirs, either by chance when killing an enemy, or by offering equipment in shrines to maximum of 8 carriable Elixirs and 50 in your storage box, but if you exhaust all of these, you'll go down to 3 Elixirs again.

[h1] [b]CURRENCY, XP AND ABILITIES[/b] [/h1]

The main difference with Dark Souls, is that money and experience are 2 different things. Enemy kills give you a random amount of money and experience and they have different uses.
Money is used in The Forge, for 4 different things: forging new equipment, upgrading your current one, buying consumables and ammo for you ranged weapon, and buying equipment sold by the Blacksmith. For either forging or upgrading equipment, you'll have to provide the blacksmith with materials, in addition to said money.
Experience, on the other hand, is used for leveling stats, of which are many and affect different characteristics of your character (Damage, HP, Stamina, Living Weapon duration, etc). If you die, you'll have to gather your experience where you died, and if you die without doing so, you'll lose all your experience. Money is not affected by this mechanic. You can also gain experience by offering equipment in a shrine or praying at newly found ones.
By leveling up you gain something called ""samurai points"", which are used to unlock different move sets and abilities for the different types of weapons. The downside is that all abilities are limited by the progress you made in the game, meaning that you will only be able to unlock them after completing a certain mission. Ninjutsus are unlocked using ""ninja points"". Both of these types of points are either gained by leveling up or by using certain consumables.

[h1] [b]BOSSES[/b] [/h1]

Probably the point where you'll notice difficulty spikes is when facing bosses. Most bosses are very difficult to beat, mostly because of their particular move set, abilities and their amount of HP. If you have a weak spirit, you'll probably give up on this game while fighting the second boss, where (in my opinion) the game presents its most violent spike. 
All bosses have a weak spot, usually pointed out by bright orange area, which will drain the boss stamina at an accelerated rate if hit repeatedly, and when is completely drained, you'll stagger them with each hit.

[h1] [b]GRAPHICS AND CINEMATICS[/b] [/h1]

On the graphics side, there's not much to complain about. Most areas are gorgeous, and most enemies have superb designs and animations. The only problem to point out here is that, for whatever reason, cinematics are locked in 30 FPS, while the rest of the game is locked at 60. Couldn't find an answer for that.

[h1] [b]STORY[/b] [/h1]

The story of this game isn't a high point, or even a medium point. It can be pretty confusing, and since it's heavily influenced by Japanese folklore, you'll feel lost most of the time if you are not versed in their culture.

Started playing this game on Christmas 2019.
It took me about 150 hours to get everything done.
Main Story, DLC Area, Abyss Level 20.

This game is pretty good...

...is what I would say, but its so fucking grindy in the later stages of the game that its just a bother most of the time.

I'd only recommend this game if you've  got a lot of patience and time.
If you're a masochist you will enjoy NIOH.

Personal Updates:

UPDATE 01/16/20:
I've finished Way of the Strong and I'm just exhausted playing this game.
There is still a lot to do. I still haven't played the DLC.
I'm level 180 and just grinding gear and levels.

UPDATE 01/18/20:
My save-file got corrupted... gotta restart from zero.
uuuuuuhh...

UPDATE 01/20/20: 
I'm at Way of the Strong again...

UPDATE 01/24/20:
Beat Maria...

UPDATE 01/30/20:
Way of the Wise... monkaS

UPDATE 02/02/20:
Beat the DLC... pretty dank stuff

UPDATE 02/06/20:
Beat Way of the Wise... still not all achievements.

SUPA LATE UPDATE:
I've got all achievements since the 17th of february of 2020.
The later hours weren't all the difficult once you got some good weapon drops. 
Overall I enjoyed the game, but wouldn't recommend going up the Way of the Nioh, as that takes roughly 120hours of ingame time to get to. (depends on your weapon drops and gameplay skills)

In terms of survivability, it feels like playing Twink Souls (1 to 2 hits and you're dead). I didn't bother/care for the loot system, so I'm sure I missed out on good loot b/c I didn't repeat a single level with that intention. I played every fresh new level that presented itself, and I think that's what made my path particularly more difficult. Anyway, I really enjoyed fighting the humanoids, but some of the larger enemies were a pain b/c of their erratic moves and some hitbox complaints (but that typically comes with this type of game anyway). A particular gripe goes toward large enemies who summon projectiles, but whose character model is so large they can often obfuscate the actual projectiles, sometimes then even go through them to get you if you are in the flank. In the end, I'm glad I picked this up. When you're playing successfully, the combat feels awesome. I never did do much of parrying, again since 1 hit would pretty much be enough to put me at death's door.

I even had enemies slide after they executed their attack to cut the distance so that they would still land a otherwise missing attack (e.g. like snapping into a position for a sneak attack or opening a chest)

+ fighting has real depth to it
+ that sprint is actually a fast one

Some points:

People often say something like:
git gud, Nioh is a niche game, learn the mechanics, its meant to be hard.
But I have to say, how can you call this good game design? The same ""trick"" every time. Every time.

Nearly every corner, every chest an enemy will ""surprise"" you. You were fooled by it once, maybe twice, but its used so often to the point that you're shocked when you open something and nothing tries to kill you. It gets incredibly repetitive and boring.

Also at the beginning I was like: ""wow so many different armors"", till I discovered that there are like 2 sets that are actual usable stat-wise. The other stuff is simply not worth picking up. Thank god there is a refashion possibility, because its in dire need if you don't want to look at the same shit the whole game.

And why the long recovery time after your Ki runs out, its nearly 3 sec. You fucked up and are now exhausted. No problem with that, but the time is excruciating long, especially when enemies times are much shorter.

At last: Edges.
How many times it happened that I walked backwards a little or used a dodge and grazed a pit only to fall straight down because you can't cancel the animation or try to catch yourself with counter movement.

I know this all sounds like a rant, but for me it just feels so raw and simply not thought through. So many great ideas but just thrown together without heart or mind.",1605791939,1606245486,False,3,0,0.488777786493301392,0,True,False,False
485510,79763879,76561198111980418,459,99,2704,0,2072,1698463918,"[b]To be fair, this game shouldn't be compared to the likes of Dark Souls and such. I feel like, though the basic concept is pretty much the same (shrines mimic the bonfires and you need to fight through the bosses) this game is pretty much it's own entity. It is good, what it advertises, it does great. There are some elements which I wish could have been better, but that is something that I'll address at the base of this review. [/b]

1.) One of the greatest strengths of this game is that it is very accessible. There are a number of tutorials to guide you through all the mechanics that this game offers. The UI isn't the best but it does what it should. I recommend taking 10-15 minutes and getting acquainted with the menus and the skill tree progression etc. In short, it does not feel overwhelming at all, considering it has so many moving parts.

2.) The beauty of this game lies in it's fast-paced gameplay and how it merges this core concept with a style which urges you to be patient with every step you take. ""Guardian Spirits"" and ""Living Weapons"" turn up the action to 11. To some, it maybe a turnoff because people out there coming to this game expect a challenging gameplay, but keep in mind, that it is every bit as challenging and a little more even with all these fancy aids. 

2.) The combat is sick. It is brutal, it is fast paced, and most importantly it has a few decent layers of depth. You can easily switch between different stances on the go as advertised. The variety of weapons that you get to play around with isn't that big but there are some really good ones which are satisfactory. Each weapon type has it's own advantages and disadvantages which I think is pretty obvious to have in a game like this.

3.) The essence of the whole Japanese mythology is something of a thing itself. Though, huge chunks of the game has fictional characters and creatures, I still find it amusing because it is something that isn't done very often in the video games (Japanese mythology).  

4.) Though, the game revolves big time around the mythology and fiction, to my surprise I found that there are a few moments where it disconnects from these elements and makes you feel like an actual samurai dueling against another. The boss fights aren't always against a mythical or a fiction creature. Sometimes, these ""creatures"" are humans and other samurais and it feels really cool. It breaks you away from mythical world and I didn't knew it was something that I needed till I experienced it.

5.) I particularly like the approach they took with this game, having missions instead of a big inter-connected world. This keeps the things short and tidy. 

[b]There are some things which could have been better, more robust and I am going to take some time out to list some of those things down below.[/b]

1.) The loot system seems dull. Call it a lack of variety in weapons and armor type or something else but it feels like it could have been something much more than it already is. During my time with this game, I found that the only decent gear that I managed to procure was either by killing the revenants (AI Controlled ghosts of other players) or by completing some exotic side-quest. Most of the drops that I got were of the items that had already dropped before but with better stats. It is nothing game breaking but it gets noticeable once in a while.

2.) The enemy variety is alright at best. It is varied but it is not for a game that is supposed to take 60-70 hours to beat. The enemies are recycled alot. The enemies that you encounter in the very first region, you will encounter them again and again throughout the course of the game. 

3.) Is it just me or are the missions pretty short in general ? The campaign is long, yes but individual missions feel really short. On average, it takes me 15 minutes to reach the boss fight. I feel like the missions could have been a little longer than they actually are, that'd have been more fun but I enjoy it regardless.

4.) The story is all over the place. There are multiple moving plots inside 1 basic plot and it is a mess. It is hard to keep a track of what's happening. But hey, it has some cool cutscenes!

5.) I assume you already know about this but I am going to state it anyways, the keyboard layout is absolutely horrible. If you do not own a gamepad, I urge you to skip this game at all costs since it is absolutely shit with a keyboard and a mouse.

[b]To sum it up, I am still grinding through the campaign and I am enjoying it. I had to backtrack to some regions and grind away some levels but it was all part of the fun. There are some elements which could have been better, sure, but so far, I haven't had any annoyances which forced me to stop playing. I'm looking forward to the second game.[/b]",1606238289,1606238381,True,1,0,0.511655926704406738,0,True,False,False

1. Nioh is definitely not an easy game, and it's not for casual gamers (which is a very very good thing, in my opinion). It can be just as difficult, frustrating and punishing as Dark Souls (1-3) but one major difference between the two franchises is that Nioh actually gives you a great big bag of tools and options you can use to overcome any challenge you might face throughout your playthrough. You get a ton of different weapons and armor, every item is upgradeable,  reforgeable, even visually customizable to some extent. You can hand-pick your equipment to find that perfect balance between a lightning-fast, nimble warrior and an 8 ton bulldozer.  All this  would already make a solid arpg, but where Nioh really stands head and shoulders above Dark Souls is the combat system itself. 
Each weapon has 3 modes, or stances; low (fast) mid (medium) and high (heavy) 
You can chain together combos within all 3 stances, or start a combo in one stance, and finish it in the other, which can grant you special bonuses. 
On top of this, there is a list of unlockable special moves for EVERY weapon type in the game. These special moves can be ""equipped"" in a specific menu. This basically lets you customize your fighting style even further. 
Of course, you can dash and roll to avoid incoming attacks as well, and there's also a special stamina mechanic that let's you recharge your stamina faster if your timing is tight.
Now, compare all you've just read to any Dark Souls game, where you have a
light attack
a heavy attack
and you can roll. 

2. Nioh has an actual, coherent story that is basically  a fantasy re-imagining of the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate. Most characters are based on actual historical figures, including the protagonist, which can make the game extra fun and endearing for any Japanese history buffs (or Japanese people?)  but it's perfectly fine if you're not aware of Japanese history at all, since the game is wildly inaccurate (on purpose, of course) so it can be enjoyed by anyone. 
On the other hand, I have played Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3, and I still have absolutely no fucking clue whatsoever what each one was about. I know people say there's a story hidden somewhere in each one, but honestly, I don't really care. If I have to scour the internet for clues as to what the fuck is even going on around me in the game world, I'm just not interested. A cryptic, hidden story, that doesn't unfold within the game, isn't much of a story at all. 

3. There is no invasion mechanic in Nioh. Do I have to say more? I literally stopped playing Dark Souls 3 because of the constant invasions from other players. There is none of that bullshit here, and I can't tell you how grateful I am for that. There is a PVP mode, if that's what you're into, but it's not forced on you. On the other hand, you can easily progress through pretty much the entire game in co-op with a friend. All in all, multiplayer is just simply better thought out and better put together than in DS. 


Off the top of my head,  these are the 3 main reasons why I think that Nioh is just an overall better game than Dark Souls 1-3. I'm honestly not trying to shit on DS, it's a great franchise, but in my opinion Nioh just does everything better, and it's just more fun and more likeable, and I honestly don't understand why it's not more popular, and why it has such a low rating. People say that Nioh's level design is garbage, and there is some truth to that, but honestly, is it really worse than DS 3's with it's fucking swamp sections and bullshit enemy placement?  I really don't think so. 
Another big complaint is that it's hard to play with a keyboard and mouse. Okay... well, buy a fucking controller. Every game that has controller support is much better to play with a controller, so what's the problem here?",1606177244,1606177267,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Simply if you are undergeared you will be onehit all the time and if you are overgeared bosses blow up before they get a chance to do anything, this is further amplified by the ""sloth"" spell which pretty much breaks the base game.

Nioh has a lot of complexity in combat and character building, often feeling like every little menu item will uncover some sort of skill tree where you can slot points. Combat has many different layers, strong attack/fast attack, 3 stances, many different skills and living item modes and so on. Often this all felt like simply too much for me.

All in all I had a good time playing Nioh but it has flaws and definitely had me scratching my head in different ways, both in confusion and in why encounters were so easy/hard.

Of course, I won´t consider myself an experienced DS gamer, I just played them once and never went for NG+. These titles were quite challenging for me (especially because I´m using mouse and keyboard), but never unfair. I beat most of them in 20 - 30 hours and did not summon players very often, so overall it still was a fun experience. Sekiro was not my cup of tea, it simply was too hard for me. I quit this one after 25% of the game (after about 10 hours) and never went back. Now, starting with Nioh, the game felt really good at start, combat is responsive, the controls are fluent (even with mouse and keyboard) and the presentation of the story deviates severely from the aforementioned titles. However, I really have to say that at some point, it just wasn´t fun anymore. I stopped playing after beating Great Centipede since it took me about 30 tries to beat him (because of getting poisoned all the time). I got one hit so many times in this game. I mean, if I get this frustrated even in the first half of the game, I think it´s not worth going on.  It´s somehow odd, while the levels in this game are really doable, the boss fights are INSANE, much harder from what I have played so far. The problem is that this boss fights felt somehow “cheap” since they came up with stun attacks (Hino-Enma), unpredictable attacks (Nue) or hostile surroundings (Great Centipede). Do games really have to be this hard? I don´t think so. I really like a challenge (like DS gave me), but I don´t like being punished over and over again.

Well at least that's the case for me. Yet another game I am late to play but absolutely happy I did.

Similar to other souls like games while influenced by, Nioh stands out on its own with its own unique style, game play, presentation and experience.

The game is visually beautiful and well detailed, heavily based on Feudal Japanese history, folklore & mythology. At the same time the game offers an eery horror aesthetic that keeps you on your toes.

Is it hard? No! but challenging....most definitely! The combat is very fast paced in line with that of a samurai. Strategy, precision, perfect timing and the ability to learn, adapt and become more skilled is paramount.Bosses and enemies can be unforgiving to the blind player while rewarding those patient and persevering. 
Exploration is rewarding and the game has a great loot and equipment progression system. Make use of this!

Fun tips: Master the Kusarigama and unleash hell! Learn to switch into the different combat stances, master different weapons and find the right balance. Carefully manage your inventory to have the right gear at disposal when needed.Use the right tactic, weapon and style in the right situation. Be vigilant on your stamina and most importantly perfect the execution of the Ki pulse as this feature if properly used is a life saver!

I am 17 HRS into the game and seems there is a lot more to go. So expect many hours of game play with a lot of side missions and the main story all with challenges and trials in abundance.

The only issues I came across was a few glitches and a very slight latency of control responsiveness. ( The  latter could just be my experience )

It's certainly a difficult game, but the combat is a little easier than say a Sekiro, as from what I can tell, it's very forgiving with dodge timing, and block doesn't seem to have any timing (other than having the block held before being attacked). That said, Sekiro combat gets the nod, as it is gives you more of a sense of accomplishment to perfectly time parries, etc.  That element of being a parrying bad ass is missing in this game, but I do like that I didn't go through an initial phase of being terrible at combat like I do with most Souls-likes. 

The concept of combat stances was foreign to me. At first, I had a tough time taking to it, but now I see how that really plays into your strategies. 

Loot seems to be a big beef with reviewers for some reason, perhaps due to their background with Dark Souls games (which I played/beat/loved as well). The loot system works perfectly fine for me. I do like that there are different weapon classes that open the door for different tactics.

The RPG elements bare similarities to Dark Souls, but there's some added things here that I won't go into (and allow you explore on your own, spoiler free). The ""Mission"" based approach is different too, and seems to work. 

Visuals, from the in game graphics to cut scenes are quite appealing, and the audio is quite good too. Not much to say here.. on par with most games of this type. 

As I said, I've barely played this game (12 hours), but it looks like it's going to give me a LOT of game play. I've only beaten two bosses so far (not including the intro boss). You can search up yourself how many there are, but I'll just say there are a lot more than 2. 

Not sure why the reviews aren't even higher if people know the genre. I'm enjoying this one so far as much as any other Souls-like. Perhaps I'll find out as I play more, however. Will update the review as needed! As it stands though, I definitely recommend this for the Souls-like fans.",1605891459,1605891459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a soulslike that takes place in feudal Japan, has a dark, grimy atmosphere and it's possibly harder than the games that gave the name to its genre. 
Controls are responsive and, provided you unlocked the right moves, you can combo into different stances to keep the combos going, for extra damage and stagger. Enemies will make short work of you if you aren't aware of your surroundings or underestimate them too much.
Excellent music and progression. 
If there's something I might put here as a con, that would be the excessive loot that the monsters might drop. You end up ditching most of it everytime, and that management can be a bit of a time waste.

[i]Inb4: Don't take any comment here below as hate against Souls-like games, etc. In fact, I'm enjoying Nioh far more than I ever enjoyed Dark Souls 1 and 2 for example, but I gotta be honest.[/i]

The only and biggest [b]CONS[/b] I must highlight are in the combat system itself. And as Nioh is almost purely based on combat, the system leaks some drastic flexibility and balance at its core.

Yeah, there's 3 stances you can use in battle and switch whenever you like. Every stance allows you to fight in a different way focusing on a single aspect like low stance letting you deploy quick attacks to spam dodge easier, mid stance allowing a balanced combat which also allows you to parry easier, and high stance for those who love dealing devastating strikes.
Still with all weapon differences and build possibilities the game throws at us, some weapons are still unmatched (in terms of effectiveness) and make the game combat feel broken versus weapons and armor that would/should be a lot stronger (considering stats of course). Spears + low stance are the best example, since you aren't so close to enemies, you can spam attacks more quickly, more often per stamina bar and end up doing more effective damage than [b]any[/b] other weapon in the open. Just unmatched, try it yourself.
When in low stance you deal less damage but you spend less stamina on each attack, and may spam dodge or use your stamina for something else more than in any other stance for this single reason. Run a stamina build using a spear as your primary and you just turn Nioh into Dinasty Warriors, going 1v10 every mission without a sweat.

Speaking of destroying the whole map at once with your spear, since Nioh [b]counts with the shittiest stamina system ever built by humankind[/b], beware not to take a single strong hit as they may stagger hard and stronger mobs/revenants can take you down by throwing up a 4-6 hit combo e.g in the middle of a healing or dodge animation - because yeah, like I said, the combat is a bit broken and somehow spears break the sound of barrier, math and alghoritms. Axes also do in some ways but c'mon, at least they're realistic.

To me, that said stamina system I found here in Nioh was the worst thing I have ever seen in execution on a sheer combat-oriented game because it forces you to a combat that is more like slow and boring than strategic over time, becoming uninteresting and heavily tedious when the game progresses as you will only find fighting Revenants and bosses challenging later on.
One of the biggest issues here (yet I kind of agree that may be fair) is that when your character is hit on very low stamina he [b]pauses to rest for at least 3 seconds in the middle of a fight like he's having a stroke[/b], leaving you completely exposed to everything that may follow. Not to mention some heavy attacks [b]instantly draining all of your stamina[/b] as they deal massive Ki damage. Not so ninja after all eh?
In case you find this completely shit, well it's not [b]completely[/b] shit, as Nioh also gives you a peculiar way of recovering used Ki by timing the stance button with the glowing stuff around you/glowing bar in your stamina display after an attack. At the same time this mechanic is interesting, it may be confusing but ya know what they say: [b]git gud[/b].

About the rest, I guess its fine. Music is fine, graphics are very cool, areas are fine (sometimes recycled and small but fine anyway)... When you save at shrines, everything thats not a special event (like big yokais and revenants) resets as in Souls series... The game gives you all freedom you might want to build your character the way you imagine in terms of stats and skills (there's no character customization here in case you're in doubt)... That's it. There's nothing [b]awesomely great[/b] here, you're just playing a Ninja Gaiden adaptation mixed with Dark Souls, or Sekiro but with a cardiac ""ninja"" relying on the poorest stamina system that could be designed.

[b]Conclusions are:[/b] I bought the complete edition on sale, so I guess its very fine for the price I paid. I'm enjoying the game so far more than I thought I would but I can only recommend buying [b]when on sale as well[/b]. Throwing up a negative review would be really unfair given the conditions and given the game is very good even with the many combat system flaws presented, which in due time may be outplayed. It's a nice title for both Souls-like fans and japanese culture lovers.

[b]Note:[/b] Keep in mind that if you have enough money to spend on this genre, get Sekiro instead. But if you own Sekiro already and want something the same style, go ahead and buy Nioh.
[b]Note 2:[/b] I know there's worse stamina systems out there but at first glimpse the one featured here may be a huge pain at first sight. It doesn't gets better, you only get used to it. Adapt, overcome.",1605608918,1605730074,True,4,0,0.499104857444763184,0,True,False,False

- The combat system is a good exemple of large but not very deep. You get quite a lot of commands but they don't make a lot of difference and you can do without them. In the end, combats are pretty simple in term of options.

- The game is level and gear heavy. I guess it's a matter of personnal preference but I prefer a consitent experience with a relatively small impact of levels and gears like in Sekiro or Dark Souls rather than a game where your level and the gear you have makes a very large difference, encouraging you to grind.

- The game has random loot and it drowns you in it. Again, it's a matter of personnal preference but fixed equipement  makes for a much more consitent and enjoyable experience and sorting though the mountain of loots this game throws at you is pretty horrible.

- The game feels extremely repetitive with a lot of re-used content. Levels, enemies and bosses comes back again and again and again. They could have cut 80% of this game and made it a much better paced experience without losing anything of value. This game is very long but it's mostly artificial.

- In the DLCs, the game throws a lot of 2 vs 1 (or more) bosses. They can be very challenging which is fine but they are not very interesting designwise and to fight them safely drags these fights to ridiculous lenght.

Maybe if you run out of good game in that category but otherwise, there are much better options, in 3 D (e.g Sekiro, Dark Souls) or 2 D (Blasphemous, Hollow Knights)

I've got hundreds of hours across all the DkS games, (I've beaten Demon's, DS1, DS2, DS2 Sins, DS3+all DLC and done extensive PvP in the multiplayer aspects of each) and I can safely say Nioh has a much deeper and more intricate combat system. 

7 weapons (not counting bare handed, which can be viable via gear + skills) and 3 stances for each weapon = 21 available attack positions, each of which has 6-7 attacks and  8-9 of it's own combo moves assignable to each end-of-combo input. Combine this with Ninjitsu (Ninja skills), Onmoyo (magic) and ranged weaponry and you have a very robust and unique combat system. 

Everything here will be familiar to a Dark Souls veteran, except the amazing multiplayer... Yokai Realm w/ Companion is the way to experience this game! If you can, play it with a friend on this mode exclusively to experience the best the game has to offer. There's a shared ""multiplayer"" bar that depletes whenever one of the two players in the mode goes down, and you lose life from your ""multiplayer"" bar every second your ally is down - so it is in your best interests to play as a team and help each other up as soon as you go down. It creates a very teamwork based experience that never feels forced, a friend called it ""Turtles in Time""-like... 

I bought a copy for a friend and my brother picked up a copy as well, we've been playing solo and together and it's been a blast. Refreshing change from the ""signs + summoning"" nonsense of DkS. 

NOTE: The multiplayer unlocks after you reach the mission map and defeat the 2nd ""Boss"" [spoiler](Not the executioner, the Yokai with ball+chains in the pirate ship cargo hold)[/spoiler].

If you didn't have enough reasons to NOT want to play this game, being stuck on the first main boss who can just teleport you onto his weapons (his balls, if you will) should be a good enough deterrent to make you give up entirely.

Controls? Well, I've heard M+KB is as bad as any ported console souls game. I'll leave it there, but not before mentioning that the prompts don't change when you change the keybinds, so now my mind is programmed as A to B and B to A, and all because I wanted to dodge with B. Controller is fine otherwise.

If polished, this game could be a masterpiece. But something tells me this game was rushed out and lazily ported to PC to get that cash dollar dollar. I like the combat most of the time, I won't lie. Bloodborne is looking ever more appealing if it ever comes to PC.

1. This is not at all for a Keyboard and Mouse type players, entire Tutorial and Key Assistance is only in terms of Gamepad.

3. No map to open up to check  the current location | Once you complete the mission only then the map comes up and you can teleport or select a different mission
4. No way-markers or path finders | Been playing for 2 hrs but one you get lost, its hard to find where the location is

Also, its my personal opinion that the game is a bit dark and people who are loking for enjoyment or time pass, - wouldnt like it that much

Look Good features:
1. The way of sword is properly depicted and sword slashes and its animations are really good
2. If map function was a bit better built, it would have been a much better game

I do not recommend Nioh unless you’re a big fan of Souls-like experiences and have a high tolerance for frustration. 

Fortunately, I got this during the 70% off sale, although in hindsight even that feels like a bad deal based on the effort-to-fun ratio here. Put simply, Nioh does not respect your time. It's incredibly grindy and forces you to constantly fight through the same handful of enemy types over and over again on your way to each level's boss ... who's probably going to kill you in a few hits anyway. You’ll need to repeat this particular loop until you’ve learned the attack patterns and are able to exploit them with near-perfection during high-stakes boss fights. For me, that meant attempting the tougher encounters dozens of times when (at best) only the first few attempts were actually enjoyable for me. This combined with a lack of more granular difficulty options quickly sapped my desire to play at all. 

If that sounds like your jam, then no judgment. I hope you have a blast. But Nioh was definitely not for me, and unfortunately it took me several hours to recognize how punishing and shallow its core gameplay loop is. By this point, I probably won't be able to get a refund. [Edit: yep, too many hours for me. No refund.] I went into this thinking it would be like Dark Souls, but more accessible and with way more loot; instead, it’s still too tough for me to really enjoy with any regularity since most of my time is spent getting killed and having to redo the trash mob fights again and again en route to the thing that killed me (and likely will again). Plus, most of the story is nonsensical, so there’s no burning desire to know what happens next or any connection/interest in the recurring characters whose names and roles I forgot within moments of their introductions.

With all that in mind, I still wanted to explore more of the game, since the combat has a nice rhythm to it and I was curious about seeing more of the bosses. The art direction there is really great, everything looks decent for a 2017 game, and the sound effects and ambiance were solid. The rhythm of combat feels pretty good once you start to get a handle on the different weapons, stances, defensive movements, and how those square against the regular enemy types and mini-bosses, but for me that wasn’t nearly enough to justify anymore time with Nioh. This game clearly needed me to “git gud” to experience it properly, but the glass ceiling of my own skill is just too low for that to happen.",1605382558,1605393321,False,67,40,0.537311315536499023,0,True,False,False

The keymapping is an absolute nightmare with multiple keys acting as multiple different buttons.  I can understand that game console controllers have less buttons and need to squeeze things down, but on the computer there is no reason to make it so convoluted.  Even worse is that the default keymapping just does not work as the game states.

So the entire time the game is telling you things like ""Press RB+Y to do ..."" on screen, but I really have to press the spacebar + right click.  This is not intuitive and makes the game basically impossible to play with keyboard and mouse.

A bit repetitive at times, and honestly there's a ton of BS enemies with BS moves that do BS damage, but all in all it's a solid souls-like with its own unique style.

I will say, there are a decent amount of undeserved deaths in this game. Example: a trap that you have no warning about that instantly kills you when you're and hour into a level.
Being under-leveled is super common and so lots of things one shot you. In order to maintain at a SOMEWHAT reasonable level, you have to do almost every sub-mission. But unless you're some god, you're likely to not finish every single one. This is because some submissions you will be severely under-leveled for, and fighting 2-3 bosses as the same time.
There's also a lack in variety. You fight the same enemies throughout the whole game and there's some blatant filler in the form of sub-missions.

I [i] personally [/i] would not go in completely blind. Learn how combat works, learn what to level up and by how much, and look for videos to give a general beginner's guide.

[h1] Tips [b](POTENTIAL SPOILERS)[/b] [/h1]
Based off the reviews, seems a lot of people get frustrated with this game so I'll explain some simple tips for new players to make the learning curve smoother.
[spoiler]
[list]
[*]LEARN TO KI PULSE. (Ki = stamina in most games).
[*]LEARN TO CHANGE STANCES.
[*]Fight the Revenants (the red swords on the ground) that have your desired weapon types and around (or above) your level. This will often yield you stronger weapons. I found that on my first play through this was more than enough to get me through the game. No need to forge or soul-match. Can't speak for NG+.
[*]Put 15-25 points into Body, Heart, and Stamina. Stamina = carry weight capacity (for heavier armor), Body = Life (HP), Heart = Ki (stamina in most games).
[*]Put around 60 points into Strength or Skill depending on your weapon.
[*]Maybe some points into Spirit or Magic depending on your build
[*]Most passives in skill trees other than that of your weapon, still apply even if you're not using that weapon. (Example: Axe skill tree has passive that gives +100 Life (aka HP). This will still apply if you're NOT using an axe).
[*]""Kodama blessings"" give you little buffs if you find the Kodamas in a certain area of the map. Using one for more Amrita (aka Souls) will help keep you from falling behind and being under-leveled towards the end.
[*]Try to do all sub-missions to prevent becoming under-leveled towards the end.

One of the reason I choose to game on a computer is the freedom of choice when choosing a method of control (my preference being keyboard and mouse).  The Dev's have made little or no effort to adapt their game to pc to accommodate those of us who want to use K&M instead of a console controller.  I've played plenty of other ports from consoles that made the effort (which is minimal) to work out a logical control layout for K&M and those games are a pleasure to play.  

Monster Hunter World, Dragonball Xenoverse, Dungeons & Dragons COM, Soulcalibur, Bayonetta, and DMC being examples.  

Some games lend themselves to controllers better but I have no issues playing any type with K&M where the Dev put a minute of effort into it.  I have both Steam and Xbox one controllers but still prefer K&M as my personal preference.

I'm also no stranger to controllers as my first console was an atari 2600 (Asteroids, moon patrol and adventure are still da bomb).  NES, SNES, GB, GBC, GBA, GB-DS(&3D), N64, WII, PS2, PSP, PSV, GPDXD2 are all other systems that I've owned (most when they were new) and still love to this day.  I also started pc gaming when you had to put floppy disks into the machine (and not the 3.5"" variety).  Ah, the days before Video and Sound Cards...  When I venture to write a review it's based on years of experience and love of gaming, not anything else.  No console vs pc master race, just love of the hobby.

It doesn't take much, the fact that they put no effort into it is off-putting to me and I will be avoiding what looks to be an otherwise fun adventure.  It also lacks optimization as there is occasional stuttering when there shouldn't be, which I've experienced on my rig running a I7-10750 and Nvidia 2080 super.  And frames capped at 30 or 60?

You can tell me all you want how awesome you enjoyed a Kabuki show. If I'm forced to watch it in a 420 resolution, terrible audio quality, and all the way from the backseat with max contrast. It's going to be a terrible experience compared to the original. It's solely a cash grab to milk whatever money they can. Especially with fans of the series (I'm looking at you DS and Skyrim remasters) I will say that the visual quality isn't terrible on 1820 and you can play this game at 60fps thankfully. So if you did enjoy the original at least you can now play it on PC if you have it.

However, if you are getting into this game and you lack a controller. You are tough out of luck with how janky this game is. Not only are the controls everywhere. To a newcomer it's daunting seeing how many keys you need to rebind to have an enjoyable experience. Since many seems to require multiple key presses. Not to mention how poorly it performs as such with poor camera controls. It's overcomable, but the biggest issue is how much work and learning you need to adapt. The worst issue is key prompts. What the hell is B mapped too? Or A? If the game came with the option to give keyboard prompts. All would be forgiven, but it doesn't. That's the biggest issue I have with this game. The best solution I can think of is writing it down on paper and eventually learning overtime.

As I've said above, the issue is that there is no keyboard prompts. If you are willing to overcome that then I'm sure it's a great experience. However, this is Steam. A PC platform if I am buying a game on Steam I expect to use keyboard or mouse. Not to be forced into buying a controller to enjoy a game. Imagine playing Starcraft with a controller, but you only get PC prompts on the instructions. To someone used to the experience or very interested they can adapt. To others who don't want to cash out on a controller and be forced to play with terrible KB+M controls? I'd pass.",1605264831,1605264831,False,5,1,0.495571225881576538,0,True,False,False

Just not stellar like what's in Dark Souls. You actually have combos in this game unlike Dark Souls. Something like what you see in DMC, but not nearly as complicated. Has an RPG-loot system, but if you're not into that, just equip the highest level equipment you get and you're good to go.

Downside is it started to get a little repetitive near the end because the enemy variety isn't much, and the side missions use a lot of repeated levels from main missions..

This game is what you obtain when you combine the fighting mechanics of dark souls with the looting and rewarding of diablo, it is very intense game, I am so glad that that you have missions spit in stages, because the gameplay fused with the music makes this game so intense that you will need time to breath a bit once you are done.
The main missions were 10/10 always delivered, cannot say the same for the sub missions, they are fresh at the start but they will become very repetitive eventually as the game goes on, apart from a couple of them, most sub missions are underwhelming overall but they do have good rewards.
As I thought the plot is meh, what can you expect from a samurai based game, this freaking samurai pride garbo is very weak, almost zero character development for the main cast, Hanzo is cool, but Okatsu what was the point of her existence at all, well she delivered something special, the player will experience the 2 horniest boss fights in a souls-like game when you fight her, that was amazing, having an intense fight rock hard.
I personally think that the KODAMAS are the most addictive thing to collect in the whole game, I really think that people are going to die so much more only for looking for them, there are times you just dont wanna end the mission only because you can't find the last of these green devils.

Where it stands out is the sheer number of boss fights and different tactics you must adapt to find victory. There also more variation in the combat stats you choose from, but far less variation in the combat styles you have to choose from. There are many paths to victory in souls, there are at most 6 in nioh.

-Skill tree
-Weapon variety
-Spirit Animals
-Stance system
-Overall gameplay
-Main quest maps are pretty large

Things I don't like

-Felt like you need a perfect build for newgame ++ (maybe i'm just bad)

-Grinding for equips does not feel good (Not really relevant till newgame + or ++ though)

-Nearly all of the side quest are just reused maps from the main quest but within a certain area and different enemies

Some things I'm kind of neutral about

-Maps are stream lined, this is NOT and open world game

-Because of how the mission system is there is no fast travel within the missions but there are shortcuts you can unlock to make it easier (but also since the game is not open world fast travel shouldn't matter that much)

-I might have not been paying attention but I wasn't to invested in the story. Maybe its implied players know some history of Japan, I did not and didn't know who many of the NPCs were but I imagine they were very important people. 

-There are specific methods that can make humanoid bosses incredibly easy to fight, but its the players choice if they want to cheese it or not. 

-There are lots of shrines within each main mission map (Shrines are pretty much bonfires if you've played ds3), which can feel like the game is to easy with how often you can refill your healing items.

-You increase the amount of healing items you have based on what region you're in and then finding these little green spirit things. Once you move to another region the number of healing items you have is reset back to the default amount.

To go along with this is a very rewarding stamina management system, forcing your opponent to run out of their ""ki"" will open them up to devastating attacks.

i was enthralled for 200 hours up until i wasn't anymore. the game is brutal in a fabricated sort of way. as you go through the main game and subsequent difficulty modes, the primary source of difficulty is ""oops, got one-shotted."" upgrading your armor matters little in the first run. certain attacks are made to one-shot you. you're offered many defensive options, of course, to avoid such a fate, but it's gonna happen, and it doesn't always feel good.

but! you're given an incredible array of tools to buff yourself and debuff enemies, and focusing on a few key skills  that work within your playstyle as it develops and the option to switch it up and reset completely is always there. ninjutsu and onmyo magic are very useful and it's a good time experimenting with the various skills to see what works for you to avoid being destroyed instantly.

and then there's tons of gear. loot galore! so many damn little things. most dropped gear is useless to equip, but provide either selling fodder for gaining gold (which you don't need much in the first playthrough, and never have enough in subsequent runs), breaking down into crafting materials, or using the interesting soul match feature to increase level or transfer perks. items have random perks that you can reroll for a cost, and it's really nice when you find gear with just the right stuff to tune your play.

the various weapon types are super-fun as well, as they each offer very different approaches and movesets to combat, and exploring the potential of each type is very engaging and interesting. i stuck with katana and tonfa toward the latter end of my time with Nioh, with a little dual swords mixed in. but i played with each and every type for some amount of time until i felt comfortable with those picks. anything works with the right gear and perks.

but then, it's not without its flaws. the aforementioned one-shotting is particularly annoying. even some regular enemies do this. amrita fiends in particular have an attack that will likely kill you and comes out nearly instantly with no telegraph or windup of any sort. bosses will similarly work to overwhelm and decimate you. it can feel cheesy and cheap at times, made worse maybe by the fact that you can be as cheesy or cheesier. i found the ninjutsu skill tree will get your there. with the right gear perks and skill alignment, shuriken and kunai can trivialize a lot of the more challenging fights (to a point, their damage seems to fall off severely in way of the demon and up). it's up to you if you wanna play it through like that, but the game doesn't necessarily encourage you to rise to the occasion and focus on your incredible combat prowess developed over time, rather encouraging you make those numbers bigger and appear more often with all the options available to you.

enemy variety seems okay at first, the more time you put in the more familiar you'll get with each enemy type and how to deal with them, making the bestiary seem small after a lot of time put in, and trivial when you're killing your umpteenth cyclops and vaguely remembering when they were kinda scary.

so go forth and make many big numbers and collect more numbers and navigate menus and japanese folklore and some modified historical biz and definitely fight some demons and ghosts and shit and it's pretty great.",1601839267,1604947179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I felt it wasn't up to scratch in the genre and I stopped playing to enjoy other games. I picked it up again recently, and my first opinion was wrong. It adopts a souls-borne formula and incorporates it into a diablo-like loot system. However, Nioh stands on its own with how it utilises the formulae. You really need to read your enemies and treat them as though you are two samurais duelling, if you get hit in a combo you need to immediately block and then dodge as you cannot dodge out of a combo. There are stances that are fun to play around with, and a method to regain your stamina quickly with a well timed button press which keeps you focused on your attacks and not just spamming willy-nilly. Also the skill system is very nice and fun, especially the onmyo magic tree.  

The story is there, and it's good. Some say that if you know your history you will really like the story, but all the information is there to enjoy it yourself through the game. It's a bit souls-like where you don't really know what's going on at first. There's a lot of characters shoved in your face one after the other which is a bit overwhelming but you learn who they are and you get back story for them as you finish sub-quests and main missions. The story is interesting and worth getting invested in.

The level design is really good, people complain that they reused areas and assets which is true but the areas are very inventive and you really only see the same place again in a sub-mission and it's meant to be that way, they are still the same level/area that you are returning to.

While the weapons don't truly change entire attack styles like they do in some games (having two swords of roughly the same size with different move sets, or unique moves to specific weapons) They more than make up for it with their weapon stances, and diversity in combat with each weapon individually. Every weapon has Three stances, which you can change between at any moments notice via hotkeys (Without menu's) To swap stances on those weapons even between attacks, changing from a high stance, which makes your quick and heavy attacks stronger and harder to block, a mid stance, which empowers your blocking and parrying more, or low stance, which focuses around quick strikes and dodging, though at a penalty to damage. Using these gives every individual weapon type hours of playable time, and weapons also have a level up system as well as their own skills, allowing you to loot the same weapon twice, with different stats. All in all, it makes the game very worth it, and that's just the weapon aspect, the magic, ninjutsu, and spirit guardian aspects are more of enhanced combat than actual definitive ways to play through your game, as you have to rest at a shrine to replenish uses for most magic and ninja skills, with your spirit guardian skills being linked to a gauge that fills as you defeat enemies or collect amrita (Energy that gets thrown into you every time you loot stuff) to allow you to activate a kind of ""God mode"" (Think of DMC Devil Trigger or God of War Spartan Rage) Which unlocks new moves, the type and ""Special move"" Of this ""Living Weapon"" is corresponding to what ever current spirit guardian you currently have equipped or ""merged"", with several to be acquired as rewards for completing main and side missions.

Hot damn is the gameplay in this one amazing. 3 stances between 2 weapons along with 2 ranged weapons and a whole bunch of skills really make each play through a unique experience. It's really hard to go from this game to any other Souls-like because of these outstanding mechanics. 

Regarding difficulty, I think this one has a...unique approach to it. If you haven't heard yet here's the scoop; armor is useless for the most part. Most stronger enemies, especially late-game, will likely one shot you in most cases. Prioritizing speed and ki recovery is essential above all else, making for extremely tense fast-paced battles. The only complaint I have about this area is the DLC sub missions and post mission portions, which at points get a bit ridiculous. Most boil down to; fight 2 of the strongest bosses in the game..together. It makes for an artificially difficult experience that kinda betrays the whole tone this game built itself upon.

Story-wise; eh forget about it. It's not deep or as fleshed out as Dark Souls, Bloodbourne, Sekiro etc. I might be a bit biased since I read Shogun, which like this game is loosely based off of the historical white samurai.

is it souls like? yes and no, base line yes but a whole lot of extra bits and pieces that can easily go over your head.

how does it run? i have all settings at worst and this still runs horrible (for comparison i play darksouls3 modded and its fine)
is it still fun? if you get angry easily no, otherwise it can be.

- A lot of weapons and armor variety as well as different special effects and bonuses that would allow you to go build the class you want.
- A pretty good combat system allowing you to have 3 different type of stances (high, mid, Low) for different types of enemies as well as skill attacks to help you fight in certain situations.
- A really good story line set in japan near the end of the of sengoku era months before the battle of sekigahara with characters based on actual people living around the time period.
- Many types of weapons and the use of ninjutsu and onmyo magic does give you a lot versatility against enemies and bosses
- Different bosses and enemies requiring you to have different approaches

Cons:
- Though available on on mouse keyboard the game is not meant to be played like instead play it with controller. 
- The game itself is grindy as the moment you finish the game starting NG+ and the moment divine and ethereal armor weapons and charms are available to you at the end it becomes a grind quest to get the best weapons available 
- The game after completion is a bit boring as the moment you finish the game with all the dlc and NG+ the game becomes less fun and more of a chore due to the lack of content there after as you could grind for the best equipment but it feels like an actual chore tbh.
- The enemies in the game feel really one dimensional at times as most of the enemies in the game often attack you in either one way and the disparity of difficulty among bosses and enemies
- The game itself is not as friendly towards newer players not used to the soul style games as they'll throw you off the bat to fight some enemies and at the start you're going to die a lot.

Conclusion: (7.5/10 rating)
Overall i like the game the game is fun for it to be soul like game it did a really good job at taking some aspects of the soul games and making it different and unique it becomes a fresh experience especially when I'm a huge fan of Japanese history and folk lore this something i love. However, there is some problems that game has especially when you finish the game as the moment went divine and Ethereal items appear it starts becoming a grind to get the best equipment you can get to improve your play through and when you get it the game is pretty much over as you have to now is complete the abyssal floor and whatever you can't finish in ng+. A huge problem i have with this game is the disparity of difficulty  bosses and enemies as there some enemies that you can just brute force your way on them while some you cannot (im looking at you Date Masamune) so be prepared to die a lot in game. Overall i would rate this game a 7.5/10 as the game itself is fun with lots stuff and content the only problems i have comes at the end of the game however its for you to decide  if you plan on getting the game get it when its on sale as the game is worth getting when its on sale.",1602621193,1602621373,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: 

Is this game awesome?
Yes. 

Is it unique?
Yes.

Should you get it?
YEEEEEEEEEEEES.


Pros:
+ Level Design
	+ It does that Dark Souls 1 thing where the world is connected via locked doors
	and stuff. I love games that do this because it feels like the devs put love
	into each section of the game. It makes you feel lost in the level, but you're
	never actually lost. You're always making some sort of progress in the game.
+ Character Customization
	+ Tons of outfits
	+ Tons of secondary apparel like medicine cases, magatamas, omamori charms, etc.
+ Weapons have interesting special effects, making each one unique, despite the fact
that there are so many damn weapons
+ Combat System
	+ You can switch between 3 different stances with most weapons, making
	combat very engaging
	+ Just like you, your enemies also have a stamina bar. If you can deplete their's, 
	you can perform a critical strike which can turn the tides in your favour in a 
	tough situation.
+ Lots of loot
+ Item management rewards you with experience points. Items can also be sold for gold
+ Ending was awesome. End boss was epic. I'm still playing the game after I've finished
the main campaign.
+ Onmyo Talismans and combos are a nice addition to differentiate Nioh's combat system from
something like Dark Souls
+ I liked the main menu map area, too

Cons:
- Sometimes the roll button (The A button on my Xbox One controller) doesn't work? 
I don't understand why either. Maybe it's because I've pressed the button over 21,000
times. I don't know.
- Some side mission feel like complete bs *cough* Kuroda's Determination *cough*.
Double Raven Tengus in that fight, condensed arena? Really? Ok Team Ninja. *okay...*
*cries in the corner*
Edit: Finished Kuroda's Determination by levelling up and just playing as aggressively as possible against the Raven Tengus. Was actually pretty simple.

Mixed:
+/- The story can be stretched pretty thin at times just because some areas will take you
so long to get through. The story is presented more through cutscenes (which I appreciate)
and there's lots of lore to read through, too. The game's setting draws heavy inspiration
from Japanese mythology, real people and events, which is actually quite interesting.

Conclusion:
Yes I think this is an awesome game.

If you've played any of the Souls games, you'll really like this one. Just be patient with the bosses, as always. That's basically the golden rule for these types of games.",1532982140,1601491069,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

There is great combat, decent level design, and interesting mechanics. An excellent game is hidden inside Nioh. But it is artificially hard. In other words, it is hard for the wrong reason.

Nioh's encounters are not mechanically difficult. They are just extremely damaging and have large health pools. It's a cheap way of increasing difficulty, because you can take this concept and make literally any game in the world difficult. I love a good challenge, but the challenges in Nioh don't feel ""good"". They feel unsatisfying to lose to and exhausting to defeat.

I'm not going to give this game the privilege of taking up more time than it deserves. The satisfaction I gain from victory compared to the amount of time it takes to get there is completely lopsided.

I want to like this game so much. All of the elements that I value in a game exist. It's just this one single problem that completely destroys the experience. In fact, I paid full price for it and I'm not even refunding it. I plan on giving it another shot in the future.

The battle system is incredibly refined and this is the most compelling reason to recommend it. I can't phantom the amount of coding and motion capture all combat took. I'm over 100 hours in and I feel I'm just scratching it's surface and starting to fully understand it.

Overall my perception is that the difficult is very fair, except for some steep increases. I finished the main game alone (online is almost dead, 300 people playing on average), I can't say I can do the same for most of the Soul's series, honestly. You'll get used to the lock for zero stamina, it gives a nice adrenaline rush. Also: You can cheese the bosses it if you want to (you may have to, sometimes).

I didn't like the history and the cut scenes at all, but you can skip then (this feels like a missed opportunity). Don't let the unusual graphic design fool you: this is a beautifully designed game.

Don't go in expecting Dark Souls, it's a lot more level based than that. Almost nothing in a Souls game will OHKO you because they're balanced to be doable regardless of your equipment, this game is absolutely not. 

There is a lot of inventory management and grinding, but the core game is fun so it doesn't feel bad at all. The amount of progression is insane and all the extra features and knicknacks don't ever feel like they stop, even after finishing the game. It's also very meaty, my 60 hours of playtime mostly came from the main game and not touching the DLC. The sense of progression feels really natural until RIGHT when you beat the game and then it feels like it's really forcing the grind to make you git gud. I've been playing a lot of frustrating games so I haven't touched the DLC yet, but I will definitely be keeping this game on my hard drive so I can do a couple missions now and then.

Overall it feels a lot more polished than the typical tecmo game, but PC version is a bit messy, I couldn't really figure out how to do anything with the default keyboard controls, but really quality USB controllers are easy to come by and this game was a console game to begin with so I don't take issue with that. What I DO take issue is with the crashes. This game is NVIDIA Ansel enabled but if you dare enable it you have a 50 percent chance of crashing the game, luckily the autosave is diligent enough that I never lost significant time from the 15+ crashes I experienced.

this is a great game but if you don't have a decent controller and can't handle the crashing the PS4 version is probably the better option, but this game is really pretty and the 60fps makes it feel phenomenal.

What is Nioh? Many call it a ""souls-like"", but that is only partially true. Nioh is MUCH more than that. It's incredibly deep with layers upon layers of gameplay mechanics. The best summary I have is a combat system that resembles a souls-like, but is much faster paced, but brutally punishing + a diablo-esque mission structure with constant loot drops with affixes und suffixes and set bonuses, etc.
You will constantly replace or upgrade weapons and armor, which is incredibly frustrating if you have found something that works, but the resources to keep it up to date to current enemy levels are just way too expensive. The only option here is to just farm, farm, farm...and that is annoying.

A big problem I had that even more so than with Dark Souls the game tells you almost nothing, but has hundreds of different skills. At least there ARE ways to re-skill, but damn...you better decide on a weapon from the beginning if you want to get the most out of your points. Each weapon has different skills you can learn and of course has different move sets, but there aren't really any ""unique"" weapons, they're all just variations. You can reforge values, but a) it's random and b) it costs a lot and c) if you don't know what you're doing you're fucked.

On the technical side the complete edition port generally runs fine, until it doesn't...and that has nothing to do with your computing power...it's just terribly optimized in some areas. The controls also sometimes do not feel as responsive as they should, because there is no animation cancelling, so accidentally pressing light attack 3 times instead of 2 locks you into a long animation loop, even though you've only attacked with the first move and want to dodge now, so you have to be very deliberate. This isn't as big of a problem in souls games I think, because the input does not matter until the animation starts.

My biggest gripe with the game, however, is how uninspired and bland most of it is. Nioh is fun, yes, but it overstays its welcome. The sub missions are just filler content, often ridiculously hard challenges, like fighting 2 bosses at once...or beating 100 enemies, including many bosses, without dying. While the main missions also just get samey...you see the same sort of level aesthetic and design over and over again. Same with the bosses. The first few bosses are great (even though Hino-Enma as a 2nd boss is ridiculously hard if you have no idea what the game is even about yet), but then the game throws about 3 dozen differently named humans at you, you will not remember, because they all blend into on. And they're all overpowered and can often kill you in 1 hit or kill you with a combo you can't get out of. Blocking is mostly pointless, dodging has to be 100% on point. 
THAT being said though: Pretty much all human bosses can be cheesed as hell. They can be parried for instance and their stamina can be depleted for an extra powerful attack. IF you know something about the game you will spec into magic to stop them from recovering stamina (Ki) and make them move slowly. If you want to be a real bitch, you will choose the ""bull"" guardian spirit and just knock them down constantly. Once you lock a boss into this death spiral (apply magic, break guard, knock down) they become trivial unless they can one-shot you.

Nioh has a lot to offer any this review is already too long, but be prepared for grinding on end. The complete edition includes 3 DLCs, which just ""continue"" the story, but which are SO overtuned that the game expects you to be 4 times as powerful as you can reasonably be at the end of the main campaign (you basically have to farm ""the Abyss"" for better loot and ""defile"" your gear and level up a lot...especially in the HP department. At the end I had 4,500 HP and was still one-shot more often than not).

Overall I think that Nioh is a rough gem that is hopefully improved upon a lot in the sequel, should it ever be ported to PC...",1600618313,1600618313,False,271,24,0.723605453968048096,0,True,False,False

I literally cannot play this game anymore because the company managed to fuck up the one thing that is consistent across ALL of gaming. The A button is supposed to be the use button. Like, they got it right in the menu, but somehow they actually managed to fuck this up during gameplay. To make matters worse there is literally no way to invert it for gameplay without also inverting it in the menu. Please for the love of fuck release a patch that gives this as a configuration option. after reading my previous review it is obvious to me that the only reason I put up with this before was because I was really hyped for this game.

I cannot recommend this game anymore simply because of 1 game breaking fuck up that is inconsistent with industry standard controls. It could literally be fixed by adding an invert option into the character controller which would be quite literally 3 lines of code.

I'm going to give it another try because I really liked this game before, but this has seriously been the single most annoying problem I have EVER seen in a video game.



*Pre-review*

When I first heard about Nioh I got excited, ""Oh boy a new fast paced souls like I cant wait!"" A short time later I found out that it was playstation exclusive just like Bloodbourne. Since most Sony exclusives almost never come to PC I just simply assumed I would never get to play it because I'm not going to go buy a console just to play 2 exclusive titles. Fast forward and one day I see it on the steam advertisement popup. I nearly sh*t a brick I was so excited. I'm just like Shut up and take my money, I clicked on it, I was dead broke and it was more than I had in my account at the time. The sadness was real. A couple of weeks ago I got myself back in order and finally bought it. I finally had the game I've been waiting on for this long. It felt almost like that tingly feeling most of us got when Skyrim game out. I say all this to emphasize exactly how excited I was to play this game.

*The review*

The game starts off, much like Dark Souls, with you in a prison cell. They just throw you in, no tutorial. I figured it just had the same controls as the Dark Souls games, so I just started trying to fight the guard. Dodge is mapped to a different button in Nioh so I died. Then I went to go change the controls to be more like Dark Souls, and found out that I would just have to Switch the A and B buttons on my steam controller, so I decided not to do that. I just picked a control scheme that looked good to me  and learned it. It picked up pretty quick. Then after beating the first level they give you the option to have a tutorial. I feel this was an amazing design choice, because a new player will now have a frame of reference for the pacing of the game and how much you will actually just die alot before they show you what to actually do. 

The gameplay is very punishing, but its entirely possible to never even get hit. The levels are mission based from a hub screen with options for leveling, buying, crafting, pvp, co-op, and probably a couple of other things im forgetting. At 60 some odd hours I havent even finished the story, I'm around level 85, and I have seen some twilight missions (aka hardmode) that recommend you to be around level 240. There is a lot of content to be had. 

The co-op is done by summoning a random player at a shrine, any player who has beaten a level is eligable to join in that level as a helper. This means that anyone who joins you already know where to go and what to do, and can actually be helpful. A nice change of pace from Dark Souls there. In order to become a visitor you do it from the Torii Gate menu and you gain all kinds of bonuses for this. It's worth doing, and there is no shortage of players to do it with 24/7. 

PvP comes in 2 forms, duels, and revenents. Duels are live pvp combat which you unlock around level 70 when you get the hidden teahouse option on the hub screen. Revenents are non player controlled enemies that you summon from where someone died. When you beat a revenent they drop something that player had equipped. It's a great way to get loot, and I often find things 20 or more levels higher than me this way, which I can equip with no issues. Revenents also drop the ococho cups (pretty sure I spelled that wrong) which are needed to summon people into your game, and they give glory when killed. Glory is used to purchase stuff from the hidden teahouse, its really good stuff, and you want this.

Loot is kinda like Diablo, where stuff just drops and you hope its good. You can reroll stats at the blacksmith, or tear down useless junk to craft new gear. There are equipment sets that offer any number of unique bonuses. The stats on gear are based on its rarity level, white gear has 1 line for stats, yellow has 2, blue has 3, purple has 4. You reroll stats per line so that you can really customize gear to be what you want. And you can transmog it like world of warcraft.

*Story*

The story is based on the story of William Adams, a white guy from England who was the first person from england to ever go to japan in the year 1600, and he became advisor to the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Its got all kinds of hostorical references as wel las mythological ones, right down to the Japanese people getting tired of calling the main character William and starting to call him Anjin because its easier. You can actuall unlock a boatload of text that gives backstory on all the characters. Since its a fictional altered world where Japanese oni actually exist thgere is also a bunch of unlockable text that explains what the oni are and the folklore behind them. This story so far has been one of the best of any game I've ever played, and I'm looking forward to finishing it sometime in the next couple hundred hours.",1519475816,1599774247,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Main issue with souls series was the long loading screen after death ,in nioh faster loading screen is a huge help in the overall experience.

Surprisingly enough its also a looter .A ton of loot is gained in each mission.When you open your inventory it feels overwhelming.With all stats and special effects for each equipment .To make easier developers have introduced rarity system and various sorting option to ease the experience.

For the weak hearts there is CO-OP.But the experience is seriously ruined.(ADVISED DONT PLAY IN CO-OP). It even has a multiplayer aspect but its an indirect one.Whenever a player dies ,the place you died is marked a revenant on other players world.Other players can loot the gear you had when you died , if you are able to kill the AI the is summoned through revenant.

Then there are  cute - cute spirits.These are help you to perform ultimate and there are wide variety of these that you can select from.(my fav is dragon) 

CON:
Only disappointment i have are the controls are mapped for consoles .Even the tutorial all shows console mapping.There is weird launcher when starting the game.It feels as you are playing a cracked game than the real one.

Nioh is an Action RPG with clear influences of the 3D Ninja Gaiden games as well as gear progression that you would normaly find in Diablo. And yes it has a stamina bar like froms games but there is a twist to that.

The meat of the game is clearly the combat, with hard hitting enemies, tight execution button presses and some real sense of panic. As already stated you have a stamina bar but unlike what from did in which the stamina bar kept you from overextending, here you are rewarded for overextending thanks to a little mechanic known as ki pulse. If you lost stamina from attacking or dodging you gather ki around you. If you press the block button at the right time you recover most of the lost stamina, making it possible to stay way longer on the offense. Once mastered only the enemies can stop you from going all out, but be careful because they will. 

You have the option to pick different weapons, from the classic Katana to Spear, Nodachi, Axe or even tonfas, having 7 different melee options and 3 ranged options in total. Each melee weapon has 3 Stances, one for fast movement and better defense, one for a more balanced mix of offense and defense and one for slow but hard hitting attacks. There are also new moves you can get during the game from leveling up or even beating some of the tougher challenges, giving you the option to customize your playstyle to your liking.

The next big point are the bosses which range from kinda eh to fantastic. Most Bosses have clearly defined attack patterns but wont stop attacking, making positioning vital if you want to get your hits in. Most attacks are also really hard to dodge, much harder than in most action rpgs, and a single hit especially on higher difficulties can be fatal. Its mostly due to that that Nioh doesnt really have a difficulty curve. It is hard from the beginning and it stays so for the rest of the game with only you the player being able to get better at using your tools to overcome the challenges.

The one point that i heavly dislike, however, is the gearing progression. Its slow, boring and higher difficulties mandatory. Its pretty much the main reason why i didnt put that much more time into the pc version.

Nioh features a World map in which you can access different locales, each with their own side quests. Each quest places different enemies and objects in these small to medium sized Areas. These Areas are, however, not connected.

All in all Nioh is a great title in the genre, with some hickups in the later parts of the game due to the wonky gear progression but really well made combat that makes up for that and some great bosses.",1598937357,1598937357,True,38,0,0.799239695072174072,0,True,False,False

The loot system means you're constantly browsing through a list of 20 different pieces of each equipment for stuff that increases your damage in different ways - armor, health and the like is nigh useless; human enemies are too weak to matter outside of crowds and yokai enemies kill you in 1-3 hits no matter how much health you have.

Enemies can keep attacking you when out of stamina and not all of them can be staggered - and sometimes they can be staggered a single time and then never again - and if you stagger an enemy that CAN be staggered with a multi-hit attack, you're probably out of luck because now you wasted your chance at doing good damage.

There is very little enemy variety in the game, to the point it feels like there's more bosses than normal enemy types.

The stance system is supposed to be based around dodging on low, blocking on mid and having very little defensive options as a trade-off for more attack. In practice, what with all the tankiness of enemies, high stance is only worth it on axes and odachi, being extremely situational for anything else. Low stance is generally fast weak attacks and gives you the best dodging, but in practice dodging, even in low stance, is too risky. Middle stance offers the cheapest blocking, a good enough dodge and a good moveset on most weapons; considering how blocking is omnidirectional, you'll probably be using it most of the time you're not getting blasted with huge magic attacks.

On the matter of stats, it's also a mess; weapons tend to scale with two stats, but the scaling will have several points where your next point increases attack by 1, but then the next one increases it by 4; you then realize another stat does the same but also affects more things and it doesn't really feel like there's logic to this. Just remember that defensive stats are useless if you're not using a weapon that uses that stat; you go to something around 15 in every stat and throw all your points into a main stat, generally, but eventually there's diminishing returns so...Yeah.

Magic has a few extremely powerful uses for any build with Sloth Talisman - a powerful slowing debuff - and Guardian Spirit Talisman - which causes your guardian spirit to do an attack. The strongest enemies can usually be destroyed if you have a elemental weapon with an element that doesn't match your guardian spirit and then you inflict damage with both elements, which gives them the Discord debuff which just makes enemies melt.

Ninjutsu also has its own uses, mostly in the form of the Quick-Change Jutsu, which essentially gives you another life when you die, though some enemies will combo you, killing you twice very fast, making the jutsu useless against them.

Most combat encounters involve a ranged enemy throwing bombs or shooting at you and while most of the time you can see this enemy in advance, there's also many occasions where you can't and you're forced to deal with the enemy while also fighting another. It's by far the most prevalent design choice in combat encounters.

The environment design is extremely complex and the compass does very little to help; it is extremely easy to get lost, specially in latter parts where there's a lot of multilayered areas. On some maps shortcuts are incredible, whereas on others you open a shortcut that still requires fighting or running past a large group of enemies through a small hallway or the like. The mission structure leads to reusing most maps with different goals and sometimes featuring a sort of ""remix"" of the original mission, so at least doing a sub-mission tends to be interesting.

It's a bit hard to be invested in the story sometimes and it feels like you'll randomly visit a location because you need to do this tour through Japan, then go back to hearing about a plan for war with another new samurai. Some of them get very short introductions and one of them in particular you don't even get their name.

The level design, doing sub-missions, the low variety of enemies and the fact that there's no real incentive to fighting in ways outside the bread and butter means the game feels like a slog.",1597896416,1597896416,False,5,0,0.484150439500808716,0,True,False,False

    [*]Nioh becomes much easier/harder depending on your usage of ninjutsu and onmyo magic (paralysis & sloth)
    [*]Titles provide additional permanent stats and have varying difficulty levels; what seems like an impossible feat when you first start the game becomes much more realisable the more you level up (Ex: clear a mission in 2 minutes or defeat a wave of bosses without taking a hit)
    [*]You can take on the appearance of other characters that you meet in the game (female characters are the most expensive btw)
    [*][u]Additional Note:[/u] If you want to compare this to a ""souls"" title Code Vein mirrors similar characteristics, late game you can just buff yourself to oblivion with ninjutsu/onmyo magic and one shot bosses and have the freedom of changing builds.

[list]
    [*]Why the f0k can William not swim, he's a gAWD dAM pIRATE (literally unplayable)
    [*]Quite literally any other character other than William is more interesting (mainly due to the fact that he doesn't speak much; thus gets overshadowed by many characters)
    [*]Very little enemy diversity, the DLC adds around 2-3 new enemy types but when progressing through new ""Way of the"" playthroughs they just end up recycled in previous regions
    [*]Probably one of the [b]worst video game ports[/b] I have ever played, crashes can be quite unpredictable and even constant sometimes; additionally, the auto-save function only procs once you pray at a shrine, this means that if you crash you lose any/all progress including any items picked up or enemies killed up to the last point you prayed at
    [*]Once Way of the Demon (3rd playthrough) is reached the game becomes more of a one shot simulator regardless of your build or defence rating
    [*]Abyss is a welcome challenge as the hardest piece of content however after the first 100 floors the other 800+ just becomes a one shot living weapon marathon
    [*][b]Too many[/b] obscure mechanics and unexplained details that aren't explained explicitly to the player (elemental advantages/disadvantages, Kagutsuchi's Magatama, forging/buying is a waste when you can just continue to soul match newly obtained gear from missions and reforge the stats on existing gear)",1597804144,1597804144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first time I played this game, I gave it a quite negative review. At the moment, I had almost none experience with a souls like game. You can still see my negative comments at the end of this review. But I feel that review, wasn't fair. Since then I've played other games of the genre, some easier, some harder. After I finished playing Sekiro, dying a million times, I decided it was time to give Nioh a second chance. I haven't finished the game yet, but I wanted to do my wrong right and update this review, because so far, I'm loving this game.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The gameplay on this game actually feels pretty good. I wasn't very familiar with the concept of keeping an eye to my stamina and having to parry a lot, like really a lot, before these kind of games. Nioh, handles this with excellency though, combining different sword stances with a ton of abilities that let you handle your ki in a thrilling way. There is a great amount of tools and skills you can use to add a lot of fun to your fights and the difficulty seems quite fair. It is hard. If you're not the guy who accepts dying on these games is a way of learning, you'll probably won't like this game. But once you get the handle of it, it's a great way to improve your skills (and your patience on real life). The boss mechanics are great with a variety of attacks that makes each of them unique and fun to play. The variety of enemies is pretty decent, but I am still at the end of the second region, so I expect much more coming my way yet. This game feels natural, responsive, and the controls are quite nice.

[b]Graphics/Performance[/b]

I still think that Nioh doesn't have some superb graphics. They are quite well accomplished though, and now that I can compare with other games of the genre, I think the graphics on this game are pretty decent. On any case, this is a heavy action focused game, and the performance on the game is great. I never felt any frame rates drop yet, and that is something very appreciated on these kind of games particularly. Some textures and effects could be improved, but this game looks good enough to keep you going. Nowadays, this game could have been achieved with more modern graphics. But still, the art and designs on the game are incredible, so that compensates a lot.

[b]Story[/b]

I'm still not that far into the game, and I must admit it's a bit hard to follow the story with all these japanese names. Quite honestly, the linguistic breach between their language and my own native tongue is so huge, it's hard for me to remember all the names and who's who. The story seems to be developing on a good direction and at a good pace though. Many of the details on the lore and story need to be found through menus and items, or that helps to better understand everything at least. But I love the context of the game, and getting to play a Samurai with a great variety of weapons, is great.

[b]Veredict[/b]

I still have a lot of hours ahead with this game, which I'm looking forward to, and super exited to keep playing and beating every boss in the game. This is a game I hated the first time I played it, but this game has convinced me I was totally wrong. I think this is a master piece and I will certainly buy Nioh 2 as soon as I get the chance. I totally recommend this game. Be patient, give yourself the chance to get good and you will enjoy this game greatly. I totally agree with everyone who's said there is a great satisfaction to beat each boss on these games. My apologies to the developers for the bad things I've said first about it. This is a great job and I'll keep it among my favorite games on my library.

[b]--- OLD NEGATIVE REVIEW ---[/b]

I'm trying hard to like this game. I saw some videos and I thought it was a great idea for a game. I mean, a game where you play a goddamn samurai, with different sword stances... WHAT COULD GO WRONG?!? Someone should have told me 'Have you ever played a Dark Souls game?' Quite honestly the youtube videos did, but I ignored them. Even more, I bought a Dark Souls game which I'm probably condemned to hate without having played it yet. The thing with these games is, and believe everyone who tells you so, they are IM-GOD-DAMN-DIFFICULT-POSSIBLE. You die 500.000.000 times per level and you kind of improve with each death... but, come on... what's the fun in improving by memorizing each movement you need to do... Because when you have become actually good at something, there is something new that will kill you 500.000.000 times. And the graphics... ahhghhh... I wanted to look away from that, but with all the wrong on this game... really? The graphics are awful man... I've played older games that looked so much better... I can't recommend this game. I will try to give it a second chance perhaps some day maybe, because you get to play a god damned samurai... but I can't recommend this game...",1544821110,1597597854,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,2,True,False,False

Nioh is very much its own beast, and is filled with high action combat and a stronger narrative. This Complete Edition includes the original game, as well as all of the DLC content, so you get to enjoy hundreds of hours of action. Perhaps to the game's detriment, Nioh has a mountain of systems that new players must learn before they can tackle the higher difficulties. Still, Nioh won't disappoint gamers hungry for a rich and immersive action game.

What really sets Nioh apart from the Souls games is the Ki Pulse mechanic. Nioh expects its players to have a solid grasp of Ki Pulse. If you want to enjoy the game and find out how different it is from souls you need to master this, dont complain about combat and stamina being very less unless you have mastered Ki Pulse. Successful Ki Pulse use lets you fight much more aggressively. It also makes combat more engaging, because even when you are withdrawing to restore stamina, you are actively inputting commands and remain involved in the encounter.

Edit:

Yet, I played it anyway. What a horrible decision that was.

The game starts off boringly, with a very poor attempt at aping the Soulsborne ""start with nothing, find your first thing, go forth young adventurer"" beginning. However, it seems that Koei Tecmo misunderstood how Demon's Souls began, given that they heard ""you will have your first death no matter what you do"" and interpreted it as  ""the entire first hour of the game is a complete waste of time and you lose everything you looted from it."" Awesome, nothing like a pointless exaggerated tutorial! If that's not enough, once you get past the worthless prologue, you're given the opportunity for an ACTUAL tutorial. A far shorter one, might I add. What a shitshow from the word go, my god.

But that's not enough in terms of clunkiness. Even the freeze at the cutscene after the first boss isn't enough(fun fact, if you don't skip the cutscene, it freezes at a white screen, and you will lose all of the things you grabbed since you last prayed at a shrine once you reload, which sounds agonizing, and it was until I learned that either way I'd have to restart from square one once I beat the boss so I felt my soul being crushed for nothing). No, they had to make the biggest sin of any game developer possible; make the game control the player, not vice versa.

See, the stance system sounds rad on paper. It's a more universal and expanded version of Bloodborne's trick weapons, in a sense, with how it alters your moveset and ideal playstyle. The problem is that this was done in the most disgustingly cumbersome way possible. If I buy a game, I expect it to function properly. Even the most obtuse of pre-2010 MMORPGs(looking at you, Shin Megami Tensei IMAGINE) are workable, albeit cryptic and overwhelming at first. But Nioh. Hoo boy, Nioh.

Nioh says ""fuck that and fuck you. Wanna play me? Well you're gonna be the one controlled. Dance for me, monkey!"" It's barely an exaggeration to say that with how fucking awful the stance system controls, thus completely ruining the already awkward gameplay, you're going to be the bitch of a bunch of 1s and 0s. If that sounds emasculating, it should. If I wanted to get kicked into a line and essentially be controlled by someone besides myself, I'd move to a communist country.

♣ Plenty of unfair game designs against the player. 
♣ After replaying this game, my excitement of trying Nioh 2 has totally vanish! 😄♥
  Nioh 2 still inherits the same critical flaws.
  The game designers still think those awful flaws are fun / challenging. No, they are not; they are final nails to the coffin of Nioh franchise!
▼▼ TL;DR ▼▼  [i][u]point here for TL;DR ►[/u][/i][spoiler] [olist]
[*] Plenty of [b]TERRIBLE[/b] level designs:
[list] 
[*] Enemies are placed in a close group / horde. 
    Fighting multiple enemies at once is a bane to any Soul-like games, yet the game designers see no wrong doing this all through out the game.
[*] The DLC levels / stages has a huge level spike / gap. 
    All the enemies (even the normal grunt) can overpower (1- to 2-hit kill) player. 
	Player can grind to the level, but the grinding is fruitless, as the level up is minuscule against the bosses.
[*] Facing off 2 to 3 bosses in boss room. [i](I still hate Ornstein & Smough fight till today!)[/i] 
    Even when player is 100+ level above these bosses, the bosses working together can still easily kill the player.
[/list]
[*] plenty of [b]UNFAIR[/b] game mechanics:
[list] 
[*] Level designs where multiple enemies go against the player at the same time. 
	Again, banes to Soul-like games. And, this kind of design is all over the game.
[*] Annoying ""Medusa Head"" enemy which stun-lock player (just by [b]TOUCHING[/b] player), while other enemies take the time to recover and charge towards the player. 
[*] Bosses' (and, most of the enemies) attacks can stun-lock player, with no stamina limit nor deplete any of their stamina. 
	And, they have ""power armor"" ability (player cannot stun-lock them, no matter how heavy player's attack is). 
[*] Once player was hit, player can't dodge away, but is stun-lock to take the rest of the attacks. 
	Player can block, but....
[*] Blocking enemies' attacks drains stamina [b]DRASTICALLY[/b]. 
	Also, getting hit drain stamina too. 
	So, after bracing through enemies' attacks, player has close to no stamina to attack back.
[*] Players' attacks do not deplete enemies' stamina. 
	All bosses' (and most enemies') stamina does not drain away when player hits them. 
	How their are depleted was never explained, nor easily understand. I still can't find any hint from internet. A prove to how terrible the game designs are. (Not applicable to normal human grunts.)
[*] Bosses has unlimited Magic Spells, Special Moves (no cool down, can be used one after another), Firearm Ammo, & stamina. 
	But, the player's are limited. Some are not replenish-able.
	e.g. player's super form has a time limit; and, each time player attack drains some time limit; getting hit also drain some time limit.
	Bosses' super form has no time limit, and does not drain when attacking nor getting hit.
[*] Bosses have long-range, wide-area, un-block-able, auto-lock on, quick-charged attacks. And, they all deal high damage (usually 1- to 2-hit kill).
	Player can learn some of this attacks, but player's version is slow/long charge time, short distance, block-able, and low damage.
[/list][/olist][/spoiler]▲▲ TL;DR ▲▲
Nioh has a lot of great potentials.
But, after experience through those horrible game designs, the bitter taste outweighs the potentials.

One more thing, souls games aren't my thing but I'm a big fan of Ninja Gaiden. I had the time during COVID19 to play and I enjoyed it really much that this is the only game I've played in the last 5 years with over 100 hours other than FIFA.
The game has a great depth and character, it doesn't seem to copy another game. You can spend so much time just arranging your inventory and playing with the blacksmith.
Variety of weapons is a great thing as well as the builds/armours. You can solo a weapon or combine or even shift from time to time for a different experience.
I started with Dual/Oda. Changed to Sword/Kusa and now Spear/Oda. The NG+ is a great addition for those seeking more glory and fun.
However, I do admit that the developers really needed to add variety in the submissions. You may fight the first boos/technically the second at least 5 times during the first playthrough if you chose to do the submissions.
Then on NG+ the enemies are really tanky and it's a time consumed just waiting for the right moment to attack and no new true addition apart from the divine drops.
I didn't play the DLCs yet and no abyss mode but it's basically the same game and some even said there is no new soundtrack.
The grind in this game is unreal, it needs to be toned down. It's all random and the rarity is rarely guaranteed which means you need to redo some mission for hours to get what you want.
With the length of this game including submission I don't think that was necessary.
For me personally, if I play a game that is so grindy I simply playthorugh asap or abandon the game if I hit a brick wall.
Yet, I'm still enjoying it by ignoring the grinding part and I rarely grind a part from missions I do to complete so I go for almost every corner to loot but I hate repeating missions for un-guaranteed drop.

Its strongest point is definitely the gameplay. While it will be very recognisable for connoisseurs of the Soulsborne genre, it adds just enough uniquity and layers of complexion to make it refreshing and engaging to use. While the variety of gameplay is limited to a decision of 'which weapon do i use to kill this foe?', the challenge and complexity it provides more than makes up for it. For the truly hardcore players, the game has an incredibly high skill ceiling that provides separation between the casual and the elite.

The second strong point is the immersion brought upon the players by the game's design. The game is set in the 17th century, where the player assumes the role of an Englishman who arrived at a war-torn Japan in search of an anime-eque adversary who stole the protagonist's Guardian Spirit (a spirit that belongs to the protagonist). Decors vary from destroyed villages filled with scattered groups of soldiers and evil spirits, to a tranquil garden surrounding a temple inhabited by folklorish spirits, huddled in a picturesque, wintery layer of snow. The typical asian architectural style is filled with bows and arches, paper doors, and Buddhist and Shinto decoration. It all serves to succesfully immerse you into a believable, asian-styled world.
 
Its weakest point is the story. its lack of depth and blandness dulls your engagement, and though the main characters have the potential to be interesting individuals who you might get invested in, the story does not do them justice. Additionally, the game does a poor job of explaining a lot of the concepts that are necessary to understand how the world works, and at the same time does it just enough so as to eliminate the possibility that the player's imagination might fill in the blanks, making it very frustrating as you never know enough about what's going on in the greater scheme of things.

- Bugs on the PC version. I've had it freeze 3 times in one level, requiring me to restart Steam each time and losing my progress due to the bad save system.
- Auto-saves from 1992. If you ever need to go do something mid game or it freezes on you, look forward to having to redo large parts of areas or re-fight difficult bosses. Save check ins are infrequent.
- Moves are sometimes inconsistent. There are combat techniques that work very poorly since the same key mapping does multiple things and the game doesn't always recognize a button tap and hold as different. This makes those  moves near useless. On several occasions I've had to hit the button to heal 3 times before it activated because I was moving slightly or something. Very inconsistent.
- The story is terrible. Cartoonish characters are lumped in with grim demons, translation isn't great and the whole thing is fairly silly.
- Plays like Dark Souls, but worse in almost every way. It's still decent, but given these issues, I can't recommend.",1596821610,1596913826,False,4,1,0.445853590965270996,0,True,False,False

+ Excellent Level Design

+ A hell lot of vareity in weapons and their combos + 3 types of Ranged weapons( Bows, Rifle, Handcannon).
+ Levelling up is insane
+ 29 Guardian Spirits to play and mess with, These are the spirits you get throughout the game with each and every one is unique in its own style.

- The co-op is a bit frustrating, You and your friend need to do the first 2 missions in case to unlock the region + Torri Gate.

- The bosses in Abyss are a real mess, If you don't have an OP Build, You can't defeat a lot of bosses, Some bosses are not stunned even by your attack and those are the real pain in the arse, Especially DLC bosses. They have massive attack power, Almost every attack can 1 shot you which is frustrating and just a way to make the game harder. But still you will enjoy it, This game rewards you like no other game imo.

-Level design is fine, but not extraordinary, some missions have a really good one, but most are just average, most complaints are about map repetitions (same map, different objectives and some paths are blocked)
-Difficulty is actually not that high, but some ennemies and bosses have cheap moves that are almost unavoidable or stun lock you, so it's more occasionnal unfair fight design than overall difficulty.
-Stamina system (or Ki as they call it) works like other souls-like, except you can't move at all if you are exhausted for a solid 2 seconds. This is by far the most frustrating thing about this game. I tried to keep that in mind while playing to avoid cheap deaths but in some combat situations you just can't avoid losing stamina.
-Level up system is very similar to Dark Souls, especially DS2, but at 2/3 through the campaign levels just don't matter anymore, the gain is not significant, 
-Upgrading your maximum weight is useless, it's nearly impossible to be fast with a medium armor set
-Bad weapon balancing, some weapon types are clearly above others in terms of efficiency (and you only have 7 of them in the game)

If you are here perusing the comments then you know that this game is the samurai brother to the Dark Souls Series; but with some key differences. That being said, if you like the Dark Souls series of hack and slash punishment then you need not read further; JUST BUY IT because IT IS THAT GOOD.

Nioh is an awesome game that rewards your understanding of the combat, gear, ability mechanics it presents. There is DEEP character customization with armor, talismans, close combat weapons, ranged weapons, magic/spells, ninja gear, combat abilities which, when combined, are extremely complex, rewarding, and for people like me who love to get into the nitty-gritty of character development and combat bonuses, SIMPLY AMAZING.

One thing that I really like about Nioh vs the Dark Souls series is the combat mechanic which enables you to switching between 4 combat stances. The reason that this is so cool is because it differs from Dark Souls because HOW and WHEN you attack influences the stamina or ""Ki"" bar directly. That difference being the ability to time your attacks and transition from stances in order to regain all or most of your stamina; thus enabling you to continue your SAMURAI/NINJA KILLING SPREE. This mechanic, when executed at the right time and in the right way, makes you comprehend how the undefeated master swordsman Minamoto Musashi must have felt after winning; albeit he was probably not fighting demon hellspawn....but I digress. 

Overall, Nioh is just a DAMNED GOOD GAME and I appreciate the differences in the mechanics and honestly, I prefer a lot of the differences they implement to that of Dark Souls series (which I do LOVE). When you get your character exactly how you want with the armor, gear, and weapons you are most comfortable with, you feel like a complete BAD ASS and the sense of accomplishment is AWESOME! The game is challenging, rewarding, complex, and has TONS OF REPLAYABILITY. I cannot recommend it enough for those who love the genre, or even for those looking to get into it!

TL;DR 

Its the awesome Eastern Samurai brother of the Western themed Dark Souls
Great graphics
Good control scheme which is customizable (keyboard AND controller)
Great (IMO BETTER combat mechanics than the Souls series)
AMAZEBALLS character/fighting style customization
Intense boss fights
Diverse enemies

LOOOOOONG review time.

Nioh is one of my favorite games to come out of 2017. 
Some might think this is a Soulslike. However, the only real thing the two have in common is when you die, you lose any unused experience points. Nioh is a lot more forgiving, a lot more fair, and in my opinion, a much better game to play.

The combat is solid with tons of options at your disposal. You have 7 weapons each with their own skill trees, a tree for Magic buffs and a tree for Ninjitsu skills. 
There are an insane amount of skills:
Counters for most weapons
Combo enders for all weapons
Talismans to imbue an element on your weapon
Ninjitsu skills to sneak behind enemy lines unnoticed  

All these and more for you to use so you can tackle missions in any way you wish. 

Nioh is objective based unlike traditional Soulslike games. Most missions will have you start at point A, make your way to point B making sure to collect whatever loot and kill off any enemies that stand in your way for you to either fight a Samurai in magic feudal combat, or a powerful Japanese mythological demon. Other times it's all about finding the right chest to get the McGuffin. Some levels will take longer than others especially if there's a demon you aren't as skilled fighting.

The multiplayer is fairly straight forward.
There's two ways of co-op, Summoning and Traditional. 
There's also a PVP mode where you fight other players in a 1v1 Arena. 

The only downside in this is game for me was the plot. It's kind of a damsel in distress type of deal, but with your character William's Guardian Spirit instead of a love interest or something. Aside from fighting Yokai and participating in Samurai wars in historical locations, not a whole lot was done to keep me interested in William himself. 

There's a lot more I can talk about, like the Living Weapon system with many other Japanese Mythical creatures give you different buffs and blessings, how we have a classic styled Unlockable system where you can turn your character into a skin of other characters you meet in game, there's an awesome duel late game with a familiar Koei Tecmo mascot, every Samurai boss fight is someone who actually existed in history, and more.

- Very challenging combat. 
- Difficulty can be as hard or as easy as you choose based on your build and use of certain Ninjutsu/Onmyo items.
- Combat involves combining attacks together by moving between high/mid/low stances.
- Each stance has a heavy and light attack allowing for variety and creativity in battle.
- Multiple weapons to master.
- First playthrough is really just an introduction. Challenge yourself to 4 levels of new game + to get the full experience.
- Level design is very good with great artwork throughout.
- Enemy design and boss battles are all great. Much dying awaits until you learn attack patterns and ranges. Master dodge timings and learn the punish windows for all enemies.
- Farm enemies and bosses for armor/weapons/accessories and rare smithing texts until you get the perfect items to maximize your build.
- Enemy loot drops and crafting results are determined by RNG. 

Bad
- RNG will decimate your mental health and waste your life away if you have obsessive tendencies.
- Infuriatingly punishing gameplay especially on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th new game +.
- Levels are recycled and get very repetitive.
- Inventory management and sorting through all your loot after completing a level can ruin the gaming experience.

I'd have to say the last feature is definitely my favorite and makes the game stand out the most.

It's inspiration is very clear but it becomes a very forgettable game after about 4 hours. The game feels like Souls 1 with a twist and although sounds good in theory that twist isn't very interesting. A lot of the draw for the Souls series is it's simplistic way of encouraging the player to find the play style that fits them the best. I myself am terrible at fighting games because of the intense demand for understanding and memorizing of player moves as well as enemy moves. In Dark Souls I'll commit the certain enemy/boss that is giving me issues down to memory. All the attacks, weak points if applicable, and weaknesses I can use to overcome the trial. Once I have that down I know my simple strategy of mixing heavy and light hits in whenever I'm able. This same concept in Nioh doesn't really exist when you have combo lists and special moves that require tight inputs as well as memorizing a boss' incredibly fast movesets that give you no time to try any of these special moves. I guess what I'm trying to get across is that you've given a million tools but the enemies don't allow you to use any of  them without severely punishing you for it.

the good:
This isnt dark souls but it does scratch the itch for needing new soulslike experiences. Combat is solid, with 6 types of weapons and 3 stances to use each weapon in, plus unlockable moves, there is a lot to like. There are lots of systems at work which leads to depth and unique customization, and luckily there are items to allow you to respec and try something new. Level exploration is also satisfying without being overwhelming with too many places to check and the looping shortcut structure is done well here. Also, getting back to the boss fight after dying is always very fast.

the neutral:
Weapons and armor drops have randomized passives and varying damage outputs, requiring some grind to get the loadouts you want, it reminds me of borderlands vaguely. This is balanced by being able to pay currency to reroll an ability. Combat has more to keep track of than in other souls likes such as being able to recover stamina (ki) with an additional button press similar to gears of war's active reload and environmental yokai realm hazards which reduce ki recovery until the area is purified by a perfect active reload. There is an item to automatically retreive your lost ""souls"" after death. 

the bad:
Enemies don't have much variety, one particular late game boss has absurdly bad hit detection and requires a mechanic that is not well explained, and some abilities can absolutely break the game's difficulty to the point of feeling bad how most bosses didn't even get the chance to show their full movesets before dying. I don't know why people say Nioh is harder than souls when they give you the tools to break the game as much as it does. Weapons in the same class all have the same movesets although that's balanced by stances, point is there's not as much variety as in souls. You can hotkey a ton of consumables (up to 16) but a lot of them really aren't useful at all. Also environments are re-used for optional side missions which initially isn't bad but the fifth time youve seen the grassy field gets very old if youre trying to be completionist.

the broken:
in 50 hours I experienced 3 crashes and 1 freeze

Mixed bag but if youve already beaten dark souls too many times then this can succeed at giving something fresh. By the time I finished I was getting a bit sick of it but seeing as I'm not interested in the dlc my total time of 57 hours for $25 isn't bad.",1594528376,1594766635,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The UI is confusing.
There are too many stats to track.
There is too much loot and all loot seems random.
There is not enough variety in spells to really become a ""spell caster"", at best you can become another 2h weapon wielder with some damage boost. I guess there's like 1-2 really good summons or some stuff in late game but I've never managed to get that far.
Weapon stances feel pointless as you're basically just switching to another weapon with different stats.
There are no 1 handed weapons so no dual wielding or sword and shield type of gameplay.
The plot is ""Ok"" at best and pretty boring at worst.

Bosses are 1 shotting nightmares, which is actually worse than Dark Souls. In this game I've equipped the best armors and my health goes from 100% to 10% if I don't block enemy attack. The stamina drains faster. Dodge feels very unreliable. There's very few non-human enemies.

Sure if you were very good at this game and played it a ton, didn't take any breaks during games, sure you might be able to enjoy it, but I'm feeling like even Dark Souls you get more freedom to play the actual game. In this game you feel very restricted and you have to remember everything from the confusing UI like dodge roll and that fast regeneration, it's just too much work for anyone who doesn't have time for getting college degree of this game's mechanics.

I would recommend this game to maybe that niche 10% of people who played Dark Souls games and still I'd bet half of them wouldn't enjoy this game but half of those who'd like get frustrated about the constant flow of random items that drop that you have to keep comparing or sacrificing or selling or whatever.

So if you belong that category who has time and commitment to fully divulge yourself into the game, sure go ahead, you might like it. But for the remaining 97.5%, it's too much work and commitment to actually get enjoyable experience out of.

I mean this game is more in league of Sekiro than Dark Souls, where you're actually basically doing the exact same things on every playthrough, using your sword or 2 hander, with slight adaptations, having to play perfectly those boss fights... or you could always cheat and find out everything in advance online before entering the fight.",1594467416,1594467612,False,2,3,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

EDIT:

I couldn't possibly leave just yes,  it insults the game lol

My new favorite game since i've purchased it a few weeks ago (already at like 69h played..).

I started this game knowing full on it would be a blast and also insanely hard at times.

Past the tower level (tutorial level kinda) , i died a few times to the first samurai mob,

I was confused , but i never give up i pushed myself and got better at a fast and steady pace.

The experience kept getting better and better as i progress and so did the game difficulty.

What really made me get into this game and to deeply love this game is the boss fights and the music. 

I never would had thought this game would be this enjoyable and fun !

The music as i mentionned are some of the greatest music i've heard in a video game.

I even started listening some of the boss ost on youtube because it's that good !

Cons :

The story is bad and it keeps throwing names at you. Unless you already know the sengoku period history, the story is going to go over your head completely. And I do know the history but all I could tell was that our arch nemesis is trying to instigate war to collect souls and we have to stop him and get our waifu back on the way.

Level Progression is a waste of time. Reason being that enemies level up as the game goes on which means that the first enemy that one shot you when you were level one, will one shot you when you are level 100.

Enemy Placement is shit. Game is littered with enemies that ambush you and game has a nasty habit of randomly summoning enemies in an area (I am not talking about the yokai mini bosses). Follow up to this even the level design is boring and uninspiring (except the siege of osaka level) It is always a village, a forest or a cave. It is always a drawn out path that you take.

I never felt a feeling of accomplishment after beating a hard area or boss (except a few) instead I would feel relieved that I won't have to do this again but if you wanna level up to keep up with the recommended level, then you have to do other side missions which are on the same level, bringing me back to my point that the level design of the game is boring because we go to the same area again and again.

I bought this with a friend and thought we could play coop with each other. But you can't summon someone who has not completed the level in their own game which means one of us (my friend or I) will have to complete the level solo, so coop got cucked.

Pros :

Some of the bosses are nice, and I genuinely had fun beating them.

Weapons and combat looks cool.

The combat of Nioh is the best I have ever played, period. The Witcher is the only other game I can think of with fun/complex combat and a ""preparation system"". Where you may lose a fight over and over until you discover the weakness. You then prepare for the fight in advanced by creating consumables to make your attack more powerful, add a poison or elemental effect to your weapon, brew a potion to counter paralysis or poison or an elemental effect.

Nioh has no casual combat. Even in Dark Souls once you get high enough level you can peruse old areas with ease. Tapping your attack button a couple times to kill anything that crosses your path. Nioh on the other hand has no casual play. Everything will murder you in 2 hits if you let it. You constantly have to keep up with block, dodge, attack from different stances and absorbing your Ki (endurance). It's a game that demands perfection consistently. Sekiro is similar, but this is way more complex with a huge variety of attacks.

1. Just few enemy types. OMG. Srsly?? Kinda 10-20 types, maybe some with anothers coloring but same mobs all the game.
2.Level requirements to walkthrough the mission. For example you need to be around level 120 to finish last mission!! I was around lvl 100-110. Hard but I finished it.

The art style is moody and fitting, the combat system is an absolute blast and, at least for the Kusarigama, which I picked, the different stances make a real difference in combat and I switched between them constantly depending on enemy and situation, even within a single fight of a non-boss enemy. It's just very varied and really useful to have multiple types of engagement options and a balance between movement and damage available.

So far, so great.

However after a few missions you begin to notice that the whole game has just 5 enemies and 5 reskins of those enemies. Which makes the maps rather predictable, but that is forgivable.
What I absolutely hate however is the balancing of the bosses. Either the boss is a total pushover, or it's cheese 100/100.
And the worst part is that many of the cheese bosses just one-shot you for ANY mistake you make, which makes this an incredibly annoying and grindy game. The worst part is because punishment is so excessive, experimenting is heavily discouraged and some bosses even drop arrows and rifle ammunition to tell you to cheese the boss already... which I think is just awful design.

If you like ""challenges"" that are 0 hit bossfights, then this might be just the thing for you. If you prefer Dark Souls challenging, where it is a endurance run of your Estus vs the boss's HP, this is the wrong game for that.

Overall fun, but really the one-shot ""difficulty"" that is littered all over the game just shows inexperienced boss design, in my opinion, also because many don't have enough tells for you to properly avoid it and if you are in the wrong spot when the basically insta-cast it, you are dead, period....",1593484848,1593851337,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm also not much of a fan of the mission-based narrative structure. Basically to advance the narrative you need to select missions from your discovered locations on an overworld map (which is really just a fancy location menu, think [i]Baldur's Gate[/i]). You receive rewards for completing these missions. Additionally, extra missions for your discovered locations appear afterward.

Once you start a mission, you are locked-in to that mission and can only leave it by completing it or using a rare item (which also causes you to lose all your unused experience) or an even rarer item (which lets you keep your experience). Having a lot of trouble on a mission? Don't worry, you can summon a friend - as long as you have a rare item (""ochoko cup""). When I say rare, I mean I received only one of those items during my entire play time thus far (8-9 hours).

But seriously, as far as these so called ""Souls-like"" games go, this is pretty fun!

Expect some serious challenge, of course, if you are into Dark Souls that's a no brainer, but this plays somewhat differently from that game. For starters, there are a bunch of smaller scale maps, rather than a big connected hub. That, to me, is the only difference that I'm not completely sold. It doesn't mean that the stages are small, since it takes a while to beat if you take your time.

There's also a bunch of different weapons and combo styles which can enhance the combat; there's an incentive to try different weapons and changing your gear, like a classic RPG.

Story-wise I honestly can't say, I don't pay much attention. Doesn't look bad though lol.

I bought this game the first time long ago and finally decided to sit down and feed my neverending hunger for more Soulsborne-like games. This game certainly did just that. I'd recommend it to any Soulsborne fan. The DLC is worth a buy for sure, which I believe is included in this version.

Combat: The combat system in this game is what really shines. Its difficult to learn but a joy to master. You switch between high, medium, and low stance for each weapon and slowly feel out when you want to use each one. Each weapon has a page of skills on top of that which can be overwhelming. But once you figure it out, it will feel more accurate with more control than other games of its type. Plus the combat is a LOT faster... maybe not as fast as Sekiro though. Most will be familiar with the fundamentals of attack, block, and dodge. Oh and you are vulnerable to a critical if you run out of stamina, which adds a surprising amount of danger to the gameplay. Oh AND you have a guardian spirit you can use! When called on you are temporarily invincible and it can give you the push you need to secure those last hits on a boss. Its visually AWESOME and its fun to catch em all in the game.

Missions: The missions are long and intricate, with tons of unique enemies and bosses. My only issue with them is the side missions are almost always levels you have already cleared only slightly modified. Once I realized this, I started only running the main missions except for clearly different side missions. There is a TON of content. I've got 68 hours on this game and that was getting through only the main missions on the FIRST out of FIVE difficulty levels. Back to the enemies, almost all regular enemies and boss fights are very well designed both aesthetically and in combat. They don't attack linearly and you will die from bizarre attacks you just can't prepare for sometimes. But rather than feeling the game is unfair, it feels right cause you're fighting demons/oni. Why shouldn't their heads stretch out and bite you from across the room?

Gear and Levels: When you level you choose between a variety of different stats, but ultimately you'll end up focusing on one with a few points in others for unlocking bonuses. There are usually two weapons minimum for every stat so you'll have two weapons to swap between. For instance I focused on Strength and I had an Odachi (big sword) and Axe to swap between. Each has its own skill tree and felt different enough that I would pick the weapon based on the type of combat versus which did more damage. Armor is typical but extravagant. You can be a fast dodging ninja in cloth that dies in two hits, or you can be an armored samurai general that can take a beating but can't dodge at all. Like other games, heavier armor slows stamina regeneration, you probably know the drill. Finding how you want to play is fun and I enjoyed experimenting with a ton of different armor before I made a medium armor character with enough agility to dodge when necessary.

Story: Well its long but to summarize, William feels dropped into Japan's history and definitely seems like an out of place foreigner. (I mean no harm by this, I mean he stands out.)  Even wearing burly samurai armor is ridiculous with William's english features. The goal is hunting for someone in Japan who also is an ""out of place foreigner"" and further antagonizing the conflicts with spirit stuff. That's all I really want to say, the story is good enough to keep you invested, and seeing major historical figures is awesome. The voice acting is also AAA. I recognized many voice actors in this from animes I love.

I'd like to take a second to address a fascinating game issue. When you die in this game you have a chance to leave a grave that other players will encounter online. If they choose to, they can fight an AI version of you with your gear when you died. If they defeat this revenant of you, it has a chance to drop a copy of 1 - 5 pieces of your gear. This is a great idea in theory, however on my first playthrough something curious happened. All players ended up wearing the same armor set called Warrior of the West with this idiotic donut hat, myself included. I'd find rare gear that would sometimes surpass it, but then I'd find a higher level version of the Western set. Its like a virus spreading throughout the playerbase assimilating everyone. It continues from level 15 to level 150. No joke. The only reason it stops there is because all items cap at level 150 till the next difficulty. Once it stops, min maxing your armor to your type of playstyle is amazing, I just wish I could of experienced it earlier in the game.

TLDR: This game is great but not perfect. I'll give it 8.5/10. You'll have a good time if you're a fan of games like it, and with all the content available its definitely worth the price.

But I can't shake the feeling that it's incomplete. And the problems that do exist make it so I won't continue playing the game or recommend it.

For example many of the sub-missions just repeat sections of main missions, and mostly have the same-ish reasoning for flavor text and a lot of the same enemies. It feels like they only exist to pad out playtime with busy work and they don't really add anything to the overall feel of the game and generally made me not want to deal with them. 

With Main missions I feel like they tried really hard to make a shit ton of moments to be like ""hee hoo you dead now B,"" which is alright but it feels excessive with the amount of times they constantly try it. Overall Level design is good but their propensity to make it try and make it hard kinda got in the way and made it ok overall because of it. 

The Loot system is like Diablo. Get a shit ton of weapons and armor that have slightly differing stats. It just clogs up your inventory and honestly I could care less for it. I don't think it adds anything to the game unlike diablo which is trying to be a looter hack-em up.

Combat is a blend of both, with being able to do finishers when enemies' stamina is depleted. As well as having to play quite aggressively much like Sekiro than playing like Dark Souls. I guess if you have also played Devil May Cry 4 and up, the stance is much like switching styles and the Living Weapon Mode is like the Devil Trigger.

Nioh has a similar approach to hooking the player as games in the soulsborne series. Make the player immediately go fuck this game fuck everyone who makes it fuck everything, and have them bash their head against the wall until a point where the player suddenly feels like they build some momentum in game progression and then all that momentum causes the crash into the brick wall of a difficult boss to be even more frustrating. For me, that boss was hino-enma. This wall will vary depending on skill, luck, playstyle, ect, but it will come, and oh boy will it force you to grasp the game's mechanics quick, and understand that this game is not gonna give you an easy ride. Good parallels include dark souls 3 abyss watchers, bloodborne father gascoigne (fuck him), sekiro lady butterfly (fuck her even more with her stupid ghost babies), dark souls 1 is just a douche in general. It's a tried and tested formula that team ninja perhaps fails to pull off with the same grace as fromsoft, but generally it is quite effective. 

Gameplay is pretty innovative. Stances are a great idea, but some of the weapon stances are only useful in very select situation in my experience. Not to say that is necessarily a bad thing though. It is quite satisfying to snipe those dumb demon heads with a kusarigama high stance range attack, then go in for the kill with low stance for quick stunlock damage. Apart from situations like this, stances also give each weapon class much more variety. If you have an axe focused build you are not limited to slow as hell attacks, since you can use the low stance. If you went with a more dexterity focused build, high stance might bring the brawn where quick attacks fail to do the trick. Of course this variety of combat styles would mean nothing without some good visceral sounds and effects, you might thing these are unimportant, but remember dark souls 2? In nioh there is a certain weight behind your blows that is pretty nice. Nothing like god of war kratos chad thundercocc, swings, but decent nontheless. Skills are lackluster though, stunted progression with very limited moves you can unlock. Ninjutsu is pretty cool, though not really my playstyle, so didn't really use it that much.

Level design is a weak point for me. I know it is an unfair comparison, but think about Anor Londo in dark souls 1. You enter this colossal disney castle from hell with such a sense of scale and grandeur, yet the level is never confusing. So many paths you can take, all of them distinct and soul crushing of course. In nioh half of the level are a goddamn kubrick's shining garden maze where every path looks roughly the same and you are just dying to get to the boss, with little to no motivation to actually explore. The levels are so small, yet feel so convoluted. Given how little searching the maps actually matters, I often found myself just scounring the corridors and caves for an ominous boss entrance, then trace back to find the shrine shortcut. Boom, boss defeated, level done, im never playing this again. That is not what a soulslike/soulsborne should leave you with. There are some good levels though. Worst one samurai of endless halls, best one the demon king revealed (except for the serpent boss)

Boss design is pretty good overall, although with some really shitty exceptions. My most hated thing in these games is those bosses that are physically huge. Lockon based melee games are not suited for enemies that take up more than the screen real-estate while in attack range. Pretty much every bloody soulslike/borne has at least on of these culprits, and I dont understand why they keep doing them. The only way they are hard is if they have stupid attacks that you don't see because they are not in your FOV, and if they dont have these dumb attacks they are just stupidly easy like wolnir in ds3. Human bosses are very well designed, especially the ones who use living weapon. Without living weapon and/or stupid spammy guns and boms however, the human bosses often can feel like standard tricky in level revenants or even normal enemies.

Overall, play this game once, and no more (or however many times you want. A lid for ever pot :) ). If you want to play these games forever, at least play the masterpieces like sekiro and ds1.",1592864364,1593306229,True,2,1,0.449673205614089966,0,True,False,False

Nioh is more about active fighting, moving and tricking your enemies. By embracing unique weapon skills, usable items, ninja scrolls etc. you can improve your fighting abilities a lot. DS skill is a good starting point. One other thing, your weapons and gear become obsolete and you need to constantly loot new items Diablo style. Or you can soul match but that can be expensive and not needed early on. Especially with Revenant Graves all over the place. Those are other players who died in battle. You can summon them and get their loot when you beat them. You also earn glory points doing this which can be spent on fun things like a new character skin. Don't neglect clan battle stuff, it can give you a ton of glory points and even a discount at the teahouse shop.

Most regular enemies are easily defeated, some have a gimmick which you figure out quickly . Nothing wrong with that. First boss in London is probably the most ""Souls"" boss in the game and is quite easy but then you go to Japan and the next 2 bosses might surprise you. The are polar opposites and test different qualities of a warrior (you). Next bosses are by no means pushovers but to me they were all quick wins, except for the real Tachibana. I still hate that guy. My fault though, I got there too early and had very little Nioh skill and tools. ""Dark-souls-ing"" him proved to be a pain.

Anyway after Hino-Enma you should have smooth and steady progress, unless some boss is outside your comfort zone. None of them are pushovers and your ability to see patterns is important. Utilizing every tool in your arsenal helps a lot. This means Ninjutsu, Onmyo Magic and Living Weapon. You might even want to restrict yourself from using certain tools as they can trivialize bosses.",1593073716,1593240702,True,2,0,0.499478459358215332,0,True,False,False

Honestly this game is a constant copy and paste... there is maybe like 5-6 different enemy types, hugely recycled weapons and armour... oh yeah and they will make you do the same mission again to get important items but those missions will be missions you have already done but the enemies will just be in a different layout... JOKE!

You will be getting the same weapons/armour for at least 40 hours, also there is so much unnecessary shit that you end up picking up that half of the time you spend your time getting rid of it all so you don't have an inventory as big as an amazon warehouse, and trust me it will piss you off!

Yes there are a LOT of bosses, combat is decent enough, stances are pretty cool... and the little green guys put a smile on your face! And that but that's about it.. but even then the bosses don't give you the wow factor like they do in DS or Sekiro

maybe if this game went on sale get it but it isn't worth full price... unfortunately KOEI aren't known for putting games on sale however.

The combat is great. It's responsive and typically simple enough to compare to other souls-likes, but it adds stances and combos to the mix to give it a little more complexity and variety. The stances in particular work really well compared to other games that have tried it. Enemies are generally well designed and placed, though the game quickly runs out of new ones to introduce and instead just re-flavours existing ones for later use. 

Bosses don't feel like they've been tested properly. Many of the early game bosses have absolutely ridiculous health bars along with being able to kill you with a single attack sequence, while some of the later game bosses were so easy that the creeps on the way there were more of a challenge. The designs, animations, and attack patterns of the bosses have all been really good though.

Level design is generally very good, however the game has a habit of reusing maps. For a souls-like game where so much of the emphasis is on progression, I really feel that this was a bad design choice as it completely undermines that sense of accomplishment you get for completing the area the first time. This is also true for the overall map system, which consists of missions. This mission structure results in the world not feeling connected; you aren't progressing through a world, but rather reaching out from a home base (which is just a menu screen) to complete random missions that are generally only there to help you gain levels and/or farm the mission rewards. Having multiple 'different' missions on the same mission node makes the game feel slightly cheap, grindy, and somewhat soul-less.

The biggest issue for me is the inventory management. After every mission you will have tons of new items in your inventory to sift through, duplicates to sell/dismantle/etc., possibly better equipment to equip. On top of that every piece of equipment has randomised rarities and randomised effects as well as a level, so trying to ensure that you have the best equipment you can at any point in the game is a really time consuming, and often costly, exercise. If, like me, you are not someone who enjoys inventory management, then prepare for a lot of wasted time.

Overall Nioh is a good game with a few design decisions that I feel are really preventing it from being great. If you're a fan of souls-like games then you'll probably enjoy this, I certainly am.",1592379741,1592379741,True,30,2,0.749150693416595459,0,True,False,False

It is compelling and beautiful and eldritch and overall dripping with creativity. The portrayal of the myriad Yokai featured in this game is just charged with the same anxious energy as Dark Souls while also feeling like something entirely different, like a unique experience that features a little more hope, and a little more of the classic good and evil plot. This game is visually striking in the same way that Dark Souls is while retaining its unique and distinct style. I love everything about the way this game decides to go in terms of its art direction, almost like all of these characters emerged straight from their traditional depictions. Everything in this game is so detailed and engaging, it is like breathing life into myth. The sound design helps along the immersion, and the musical score is thrilling throughout the entire experience. The gameplay itself is the classic Souls-like formula with their own flavor elements thrown in. It is changed just enough to make for a unique experience in this game, setting itself apart from other games of its type.

Things that surprised me in a good way:
- Combat. The controls are really tight, hit boxes are 99% fair, there's a lot of depth. Sekiro's combat is my favorite, but Nioh is just as responsive as Bloodborne with a lot more depth.
- Level design. There's short cuts and paths cross back on themselves similar to Soulsborne games. You're rewarded for exploring, and the levels are interesting and fun to explore.
- Art and Japanese culture. Nioh is very much a Japanese game made for Japanese players. Music, clothing, armor styles, weapons, fighting styles, and art work were masterfully done and were really interesting.

Difficulty is similar to Soulsborne games, probably easier if you use the Sloth spell which slows down bosses to 1/2 speed.
There are a few bullshit mechanics (bats that knock you off a cliff to your death, DLC Siege of Osaka arrow/cannon shower), but the vast majority of the time, it's challenging and fun to rise to the challenge and conquer it.

From casual to hardcore player, if you like this kind of games you might have a good experience here. 
Casuals can profit the story/gameplay and just finish the game one time and it'll still be a great experience.
Hardcore players have a pretty huge playground with 5 difficulties and even after finishing the last one you'll have every level of the abyss unlocked untill lvl 999 with a pretty good challenge on the way.

There is still a decent community to do some co-op stages or you can profit with some friend. The games can be pretty fun on multiplayer. It even gives you tools to prevent/stop people doing wrong on your mission !

Cons....a lot
- only a  hand full of different enemies, unless you count changing the color of their tongues
- terrible story, boring game play and poorly designed levels (not sure how anyone compares this to Souls or Sekiro to this)
- speaking of levels, I hope you enjoy constantly replaying each level from a different starting point
- any other repetitions? of course! each boss appears over and over and over, then boss rushes of 2-3 at a time or in sequence
- boss fights with middle-of-the-road difficulty, but cheap insta-kills (you can take an enemy to 3 health without getting hit, miss one dodge and lose; quite obnoxious)
- can beat the entire game using one attack (why include other weapons or stances?)
- insane amount of loot drops that clog inventory constantly (this is not an MMORPG)

Pros
- end credits do eventually appear (not surprised two other people I know quit after <2 hours)
- music achieved a 5/10

As a PC port, it's not all that great.
The Steam release originally didn't come with keyboard & mouse support, and when it finally got added in, it was very barebones.
The game doesn't have many graphic settings either and it's not entirely well optimized, at least on Windows 7 and earlier; like, when the FPS slows down, the actual gameplay slows down accordingly unless you lock the FPS at 30 in the options settings.

While there is a story going on and a lot of history & lore, it doesn't do much to stay interesting for me, which is kind of a shame because there's a lot of detailed text within the item descriptions, character bios, and even monster bios.
I don't really know my Japanese history, so I'm not sure when the fiction and non-fiction starts and ends most of the time within the descriptions as characters and such are based on real things, and they give pretty descriptive history lessons within the text.

The general gameplay is pretty obviously straight from Dark Souls, with the difference being that it's insanely expanded upon.
The combat is so expansive, that there's a bit of a curve into getting a handle of just the basic controls & mechanics alone. There are so many mechanics and RPG elements in this game, that the only way to truly learn how they work is through experience and searching up on your own something specific you're interested in.

The replay value is incredibly high for people who like to min-max characters.
On the first playthrough, you've got to use your own wits & skills to beat the game as your upgrading options are very limited. Further playthroughs unlock more difficulty settings and more character-upgrading options all the way up to the final difficulty. These are all treated as New Game +'s, and you can switch between all the New Game +'s whenever you want provided you've unlocked them.
To further add to the completionism, there are even in-game achievements/challenges that can grant you small stat upgrades to your characters when you get them.

There's apparently a PVP/co-op feature, but I think the matchmaking's dead and you'd have to ask around for people to play with.
It's a nice game that can take you a few dozen hours just to beat, or a few hundred hours to feel like you've done everything you can.",1590213999,1590214033,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

core gameplay is very similar to sooulsborne(the way stamina used, lost exp on dead, etc) but there is also some cool original design too like skillbooks and amrita system. 
equipment system looks shallow. if dark souls have a lot variation weapon but limited in number and useful till end game, nioh is mirror of it. few variation but so many equipment which is not useful, more like you only use it only for 1 stage.
difficulty is hard to easy. it's comparable to soulsborne but then it's become so much easier at the second region(early-mid game). so don't be afraid of difficulty it's very easy later on.
actually the main draw for nioh is the combat. the combat is so fluid, punishing, and satisfying. i can say this game combat system 2nd best(1st being sekiro) in giving satisfaction to player, punishing and rewarding at the same time. sadly this game combat lacks of weight(omph-ness) compare to soulsborne and sekiro which make it dull and lack tension. 
this game have very fun skills system. it make your character can be build with so many variations. it's quite fun to build your character. 

tldr this game is arcadey dark souls without amazing design and music. fun but not close to soulsborne quality and difficulty. but still this game is absolutely worth to play.

It [i]could[/i] have been wonderful, if its core, quality elements -- simple yet attractive graphics, cool monsters, East-West fusion historical fantasy story -- had been rendered into a fifteen-hour distillate, rather than watered down and spread out over 70+ increasingly dull hours.      

[i]Nioh[/i] exemplifies [u]bloat[/u].  It has a handful of good levels, but very few exceptional ones; they're plain to look at with a lot of same-y textures.  But these exact same [i]okay[/i] maps are continually reused for the side missions, even when you are in [I]different regions of Japan[/i], and yes, you [b]need[/b] to do some of these extras if you want to level up enough to tackle the main ones.  You'll see the same (initially cool) handful of monsters, over and over again, and they act precisely the same too, [i]except they have more health and hit much harder.[/i]  The combat system is, at its very core, a slick and fast bit of game programming; [i]Nioh[/i], however, insists on taking this good thing and encumbering it with countless superfluous systems.  Everything is hidden behind several layers of point-allocation menus, even standard maneuvers like back-stabbing, which I didn't even discover until the very end, shoved to the bottom of the shinobi skill tree -- a menu which, as an unabashed, sword-swinging samurai, I normally had no business in.

I won't get too deep into the ""ki-focus"" system, another silly example of combat bloat.  It involves hitting RB at the right time to recover some stamina mid-battle, and the game really likes to shove it in your face.  Suffice to say that it's novel at first, but gets more annoying as you slog deeper in.

Notice that I haven't formally [i]not recommended[/i] the game.  Well, I do like some things about it.  As I mentioned, the narrative is cool, and the basic combat is very slick.  The one thing that [i]really[/i] kept me going, though, were the interesting soulsborne-style bosses, and [i]Nioh[/i] has a heck of a lot of 'em.  They're well-designed, tough-as-nails, and they gave me that heart-thumping, sweaty-palmed feeling I was searching for when I first loaded up the game.  It's just a pity that I had to wade through so much crap to get to all of them.

There are 4 stands that can be taking while in a battle

Land of Japan and have to save his life and save someone special to him ..

Pros:
      #1. The game does look very nice, and handles nice as well.
      #2. The game is atmospheric and the areas are interesting
Cons:
      #1. Constant re-use of areas. The game is much more RPG styled than Dark Souls, which means there are missions you select from a map. Problem is, since there are soo many mission they'll just use the same area over and over and over again.
     #2. Every enemy does a TON of damage, and they are often quite ganky. You have to be weirdly passive in the game, even if you're on par in terms of gear level the damage the enemies dish out in comparison to you is staggering.
     #3. It gets repetitive really fast. There is a skill tree but none of them give any really fun or interesting moves that change the game very much overall, with maybe the exception of magic.
     #4. A lot of bosses, and most of them a) Feel similar b) Are stupidly tanky and have stupidly high damaging c) Have uninspired design d) Are hard as hell to read, as in they don't telegraph what they're gonna do very well in advance
     #5. The story leaves something to be desired. I didn't get too far but it seemed slow and boring, never really intrigued me.

I really wanted to like this game, but it really feels like they don't have an understanding of what ""Tough but fair"" means. This is more like ""Tough if you don't spend your entire life grinding for levels and gear, easy if you do"". It's boring and underwhelming.

The 3 stances (Low:fast but weak hits / Med: medium speed and dmg / high: slow but hard hits) enhanced the move set of the main weapon typs and on top of that you can unlock new moves to make the weapons even more versatile.  You also have ascess to ranged weapons like bows and guns, Ninjutsu(cosumables, throwables and utility), magic (buffs, debuffs, element dmg based attacks, etc) and a guardian spirit(bonus effects + temporary god mode) to aid you.

Enemies are divided into humans and Yokai with there own strenghs and weaknesses. The game has a good variety of enemies in the early and mid game but it gets repetitive in late game. The highlights of Nioh are obviously the big boss fights which are for the most part really good: unique yokai, legendary samurai, shinobi, human-yokai hybrids,etc.

Story is solid.

Level design/map layout kind sucks. villages and caves get stale really fast and arent memorable. Areas get reused a lot. it easy to get lost in some places.

Loot in this game is all over the place. You get gear with diffrent rarities, level, set bonuses and random additional effects which can be changed. There are some many ways to modify you equiptment that it wouldnt make sense to list them all in a review just watch guides on youtube for it. I personally dont like it at all.

It is a challenging game that can be easy for experienced people that have played this type of ""souls"" games before but keep in mind that this game has a crazy New Game Plus system with 4 NG+ up to level 1220. If you find it easy and you want a real challenge you will need to keep playing.

Pros:
- Great variety of weapons, skills, upgrades, magic, items.
- It is fast paced, this can be good for some people. If you didn't liked Lords of the Fallen because the characters feel heavy, this is the game for you.
- Great ambience, inspired in the old Japan with a great touch of their culture.
- The cutscenes and the music are beautiful.
- It references historical figures.
- The game is well optimized, some frame drops when there's a lot of explosions but I was able to run the game with old hardware at 60 FPS.
- The game includes the 3 DLCs and it is pretty cheap on sale.
- 50+ hours of gameplay.
- Great voice acting.
- Every boss is unique.

Neutral:
- The inventory system could be better. Since this game has a lot of items it can get overwelming.
- The story is confusing, you have to keep up with a lot of foreign names that they give you every cutscene.
- The graphics are good, not the best and can be pretty rough on some spots but overall they are good.
- Basic skills in other games like parry are being locked behind a skill tree.

Cons:
- The entire game was in japanese when i first launched it, I had to watch a video to see where can you change the language and even after changing it to English, there's a message that appears everytime that you open the game in Japanese.
- The tutorials regarding the crafting of weapons, armors, skills, upgrades are very bad. I didn't understand anything about the Blacksmith, I didn't used it but I was able to finish the game without any major issues.

Additional:
Keep in mind that while the texts and the UI is in English, the voice language depends on the character, they can speak either English, Japanese or Spanish. While this game can be played with keyboard and mouse, a controller is highly recommended.

I bought it again in 2020 - and it's the best game I ever played.


WTF Why?
------------------------------------------------

I grew up on Ninja Gaiden and Dynasty Warriors 3 & 4, and later on Samurai Warriors. Heck, 12 year old me dressed up as a Ninja for Carnival/Halloween and knew the entire history of the chinese 3 kingdom era and the waring states era of japan by heart. Of course, Ninja Gaiden had been my first game on XBox, and to this day it's in my Top 3 of best games ever produced. I loved the difficulty of it. I loved the lightning fast, skill based, fluid combat. I loved the seemingly impossible to beat bosses. I loved the progression system, and the variety of weapons available.

I learned about Nioh back in 2017, when I was having a flash of nostalgia, and was looking up Team Ninja to see if they had released any new games. And indeed they did - just a few days prior. I got myself Nioh, and hopped into the game..... and it was really not what I expected. The enemies in the first map were super slow. Their attacks seemed very poorly telegraphed and dealt a million damage for what looked like a guy stumbling rather than attack. You had like two different combos. There were really only bastard swords and spears. Everything was slow. I hated it. Immediately refunded it.

Then I played through dark souls and developed a whole new understanding of pace and difficulty. Decided to give Nioh a try again and immediately fell in love with it.


General:
------------------------------------------------

Nioh, like any souls game - is made for people who do not enjoy having their hand held - but instead want to figure out a game by themselves. Part of dark souls charm was not providing any tutorial for people. You are not introduced to the game with what is a metaphorical Green Hill Zone. You dont get to have time to familiarize yourself with game mechanics step by step before you need them. You are forced to either find creative ways to deal with an enemy through the various tools you have, or simply overcome it by sheer skill. It's this swim or sink mentality, coupled with a severe lack of information about the game online that has people develop very unique playstyles step by step. You discover a solution to a problem, and when faced with another problem try to find a solution very close to the last one. In that vain, you might end up entirely relying on Magic buffs to boost your combat stats to get through the game. You might utilitze items and magic to inflict elemental damage and debuffs. You might rely on stealth kills, muting your footsteps, going invisible and throwing smoke bombs. You might lay traps, throw stones and lure the enemy into said trap to execute them. You might throw a plethora of bombs and shuriken, fire bows, guns and cannons to kill the enemy from afar. You might exclusively use your melee weapons to dance around the enemy, dodge and chip at them. You might try and hit weak spots with slow weapons and deal massive damage with precise strikes. You might choose not to use any weapon and rely on killing your enemy with their own weapon.

It's all up to you - and it's all very much viable for your first and second playthrough. But with every playthrough, you are faced with new challenges. Suddenly that thing you did deals very little damage. Suddenly the enemy is a lot faster and doesnt give you enough time to do that one thing you did. Suddenly an enemy is immune to that element, or cannot be knocked down anymore. Suddenly, you cant just trade damage like that anymore. Suddenly, they do this new move that always gets you. Suddenly you need to adapt and find a new way of building your character or approaching an enemy.  Suddenly you need to invest into this specific stat to make sure your previous strat still works out.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is absolutely done by design - and the very essence of Nioh.


Combat:
------------------------------------------------

The combat is absolutely the best combat I have ever seen in any game. And it needs to be, in order to make it so the absolute mountain of mechanics, abilities, skills, traits and interactions at your disposal can be freely combined and integrated into what is the core melee gameplay.

Do not be fooled however - although you've got a lot of freedom in how you want to fight - and although you got a lot of tools to deal with whatever opponent comes around - you are very, very easily punished. Not only by the enemy, but also through environmental factors like terrain.


Online Play:
----------------------

Online play is for the most part limited to coop. You can offer a cup at a shrine to have random people spawn into your world and help you out. Or you can get into a lobby with a friend and start missions from there. You can actualy play with up to two other players. Good news is, that even if you get stuck and are on the brink of giving up, you can summon another player who can help you complete the mission. Bad news is, most enemies and bosses can be mowed down and stun locked by two guys up until you get to the highest difficulty. Visitors who are way higher level than you do not get scaled down in terms of damage hence tend to 1hit almost everything. They get rewarded well, since they get special items for crafting and the souls they gain are scaled well, so there's an incentive to queue up to help other players, even if you are way overleveled for the mission you are helping with. That's a good thing. But it also means that you dont get to enjoy the game as it is meant to be, if you summon for a visitor. On lower difficulties, you might just end up just lagging behind and picking up items and gold behind the guy rather than play the game. This is not an issue if you at higher difficulties, if you queue with a friend, or get the occasional visitor that plays more of a supportive role. The abyss, is scaled to #of players, so you have to fight 2-3 bosses at the same time, if you summon for a Visitor. 

While there are some PVP aspects wherein you can queue up for a 1v1 or a 2v2, it's very hard to find a match. Nioh is also fundamentaly not really made for PVP.


Story:
------------------------------------------------

I dont think most people really understand what the Story is supposed to be. It's certainly not the Arc of your Character. Your character is just the vessel to guide you through the locations in the game. Heck the dude is an absolute nobody, has no personality and even towards the very end of the game, when asked, doesnt have the slightest clue why the actual fuck he's going through all the events in the game. That's because William/Anjin, the dude you are playing, is just a vessel for the game's progression through the world.

The real story of Nioh is the setting. The very much real history behind the characters that appear throughout the game. The ancient shinto rites, believes, folklore, and culture that is seen everywhere in the game. The story of Feudal Japan is told through both explicit and implicit means. The cutscenes are aestaticaly pleasing and do well both in introducing historical characters, their ambitions, believes and standings, as well as delivering the feudal japanese vibe Nioh is set in and introducing you to folk lore. The environment tells many a story. The enemies all have ties to folklore. The weapons, armors and items have descriptions that further introduce you to happenings, folklore and history of japan. Heck, you are even taught about Japan's geography, their most important temples, mountains, cities and sights, as well as their current and former prefectures, how japans political system evolved and came to be. The game is essentialy a course on japanese history, folklore and culture. THAT is the story of Nioh.

The story for Nioh is nuts with Japanese folklores knitted into it.
From what I've gathered so far:
In Japan there is a war. The ""bad guys"" use what is called Amrita. This is the equivalent of souls. William, the main character, is a pirate who is caught in England and sent to prison. William manages to escape prison and runs into a strange man from Japan. He uses his spirit and steals William's spirit and teleports to Japan. William, refusing to let his spirit go, follows this spirit stealing bastard to Japan. While in Japan William learns that the strange man is using Amrita to turn normal humans into giant monsters named Yokai. It's such an interesting story with the right amount of strange.

The monster designs are fantastic.

Combat is tactical and requires attention and thought as well as response time.

I have such a sweet spot for Nioh. Really the devs did a fantastic job at creating a fun experience.

The game is extremely well balanced and if you played the demo then you remember how difficult it was. These are the people who made Ninja Gaiden. They spit in the face of difficulty. But when I die there isn't a feeling of unfairness. I know I used too much stamina or got greedy with my attacks.

I love the constant acquiring of power, getting new gear, gaining levels, unlocking skills. 
most of the game is well explaned, but consider looking up tips for finer details.

my main complaint is with the controls, the game doesnt allow the fine tuning with the controles required for you to set up a prefered set up, and the pre set configurations all have one issue or another i feel. makes the interface more clunky when compared to the souls games.

update: i can not consider this game good after 58 hours.
the controls and interface have me second guess my every imput, leveling up and obtaning gear does not feel satisfing. 

but the nail in the coffin is the story and presentation ""i do not care about these characters""
i finaly decided to quit after a late game cutscene presented several of the story's charicters and i couldnt recognise or care about any of them. this is the games fatal flaw and why i ufortanantly cant consider it a good game.

First off, I see many people complaining about things saying its mechanics are too convoluted or annoying or punishing for players or blah blah literally anything really.  ""ITS NOT DARK SOULS, SH*TS TRASH"" well sorry but just because it's a difficult third person RPG doesn't mean it's intended to be a Dark Souls copy.  Sure, it shares lots of fundamentals but it is most definitely it's own game, with its own unique systems, as well as many different viable weapons and builds.  I personally enjoy it far more than Souls and find it more replayable due to the loot-grinding and build aspects (think Diablo loot systems), although of course the Soulsborne games are absolutely amazing too, just different.  I might be slightly biased, since I'm a bit into Japan and I absolutely love the setting, but overall I just enjoy Nioh more.  I know this is probably an unpopular opinion (!) but to each their own.

Anyway, onward to what I'd like to say is my main point:  I don't want to be that guy, but seriously you just need to persevere and get good.  When I first played I was utter trash and couldn't beat the second (first proper) boss for hours and hours, and hit a wall on the following boss.  However after coming back and trying again at a later point in time I really loved it and got a bit more of a feel for it.  Fast forward to playing NG+ on my first character and I feel like an absolute boss, destroying everything.  Granted, I haven't really played in a while and any skill I had has probably decayed, but that's not really too relevant, and as I was saying; you just need to stick with it and you will literally get good, and probably have a more enjoyable time.

Anyway, don't want this to be too long, hopefully it isn't too ramble-y or anything, but yeah, I highly recommend giving it a go, just make sure you understand the differences between this and Souls and know what you are getting yourself into.

Also side note, sale right now is a good time to pick Nioh up, doubly so if you are uncertain of whether you will like it or not.

The freakin game lags every ~5 seconds no matter what (other than that it is perfectly smooth). No matter what are the graphic settings (I have strong enough PC for the highest quality anyway), no matter what is (not) happening on the screen, no matter how many apps are (not) running on the background. It does this when the game is starting, it does this in the main menu, it does this in-game. Every 5 seconds. Too annoying to bother playing.

Biggest disappointment on Steam so far. I guess this will finally make me learn how to refund games.

EDIT: Ok, so I finally solved the issue. You need to have gamepad plugged to your PC or at least an emulator installed. Keeping negative review because: WOULD IT BE THAT HARD TO JUST TELL ME THIS?

EDIT 2: Gj, I think this is like the very first 1-char rpgish game ever that naturally made me combine physical and magic skills not because it is cool but becasue it is the most effective way to progress (or 2nd, I remember battlemage in TES: Arena was also good). I mean, yeah, I know people play it naked jumping around bosses without being hit even once, dealing very good dmg with bare fists, but that kind of play wouldn't satisfy me... or at least is not natural for me. My way is to wear the heaviest armor with maxed toughness (which is completely useless against bosses) and the slowest and biggest weapon available. Except hammers ofc, bc beating enemies with hammer simply doesn't make sense.

EDIT 3: Another great piece of fine programming is when I get the 'Disconnected from network' message and have to 'Confirm' it. I literally tried out every button on my keyboard and my mouse, including wheel up, wheel down and wheel click, and nothing worked. The best way to get out of it is to stop the game in Steam client and start it again. Really GJ lol.",1586476507,1586992559,False,3,1,0.44519159197807312,0,True,False,False

What really makes this game bad for me is the repetitiveness. One of my favourite things in souls-like games is the exploration of new areas without knowing what I'll face because I've never been there before. Nioh reuses the same levels over and over, for different missions as well. Having to play in the same level many times gets boring. In addition, the game rarely introduces new enemies. They continually reuse the same enemies, just increasing their damage and health. It gives the illusion that the game is getting harder, but is it really getting harder if you just make it so the same enemies can now  2-hit kill me if I don't grind?

Its pretty much the same with Nioh. 
Facing the first Boss and get killed several times without even understanding what was going on I wanted to stop playing. But after I found out how the enemy attacks work i realized a certain pattern. And suddenly it made fun. I mean: Lot of Fun!

The game is very tough though. You will keep dying in an instant. Even if you think you got decent gear and know how most of the enemy work.

The Best Part of this game is the Character Design and how to use your gear:

There is a ton of different Gear around- Lots and Lots of different Weapons. All with their own Style of fighting. With each Weapon you can choose 1 of 3 Stands: Low Stand, Mid Stand and High Stand. All with their own Animations, Benefits and disadvantages. Besides aiming for different body parts, each stand differs in speed, damage and stamina exhaustion.
Even Humanoid Enemy use this Mechanic. And they change their Stance during a Fight - so you need to adapt every time. With Skills you can make your own Combo Moves - you can literally build the fighting style which suits you most. 

And you need to do this! Nioh is all about understanding the patterns of your enemy and find a way to crush it! 

Besides the fantastic Weapon and Fight System (which really feels awesome!) You can learn Magic and Rogue Skills. Sorry, I mean Onmyo and Ninjutsu of course!
Those skills will help you by buffing your weapons, debuffing your enemy, doing damage and give other advantages. They come in handy quite well. Using a ""Cat Scroll"" will make your feat leave no voice which is good to avoid enemys or to make a stealth attack.

Very solid, no technical issues at all other than some weirdness with my XBOX controller during the first 5 mins. Also, I have had one fatal crash that required me to do a system restart. It's not the best port but overall, you should be ok. 

Gameplay is challenging and rewarding. Every encounter matters and requires your full attention. So much depth you will be able to replay this for years.

First playthrough took around 70hrs! NG+ is completely worthwhile along with the DLC that comes free! This is easily going to be a 150hr+ experience...

Minor Complaints: 

* Enemy variety is a bit low...environment design is the same
* Level layout and colours/design appear very similar
* Loot management can get annoying but not too much
* Navigating some of the larger levels can be frustrating - Worse than mazes!!
* Last third of the game feels grindy...need something to spice it up!?! Also starts to feel really cheesy. No increase in challenge from clever, new enemies. The game would rather throw multiple old enemies at you...old enemies that just chase you around and overwhelm. Also, there are many archers and shooters placed in some pretty cheap locations just to catch you out! I know it's how these games roll but man...it just feels so damn cheaty!!
* Finding a boss, dying and then trying to find your way back there or investigate other paths 
 whilst the boss music is played at full volume for no reason at all!! VERY ANNOYING!!
* End game and parts of DLC are ridiculous as they throw 4 to 5 fast, powerful enemies at once all running at you. The dev's obviously thought they were working on Bayonetta or God of War. Throw in a boss that has a one hit death blow move that's homing and yeah, you'll have a riot!! I hate the dev's for this as it nearly ruins the whole experience.

The combat is alright but thats all that the game has going for it and after a while, it too becomes stale as all the monsters start to look and move alike.

Difficulty : 
This game is hard and it test your reaction and muscle memory, fooling around when facing a mere skeleton mob could make you see the respawn screen. 
HOWEVER, the only time I feel cheated by the AI was against an environment hazard. And frankly, it was my fault too. 
In a game where getting one shotted is like a constant occurence, not once I felt the AI pulled something out of their ass to win.

PRO
- Gorgeous visuals, especially characters and gear. All the samurai armors and weapons look fantastic, and character models and animations are very well done.
- Nicely designed levels. Linear, but the freedom of movement is enough to not get you the 'running in s tunnel' feeling like in Code Vein.
- Equipment crafting and upgrade system
- A bit unusual, but quite deep combat system. Spamming R1 won't get you anywhere so you'll have to develop some skill in order to progress. Except the KI (stamina) regeneration which is outrageous (see further on).
- Boss designs. All different, all gorgeous. Not boss fights though (see further on).

Neutral
- The plot. It's kinda there, but you really loose nothing if you don't pay any attention to it.
- Music. It's there, it fits the setting, but it's not even close to the level of Nier: Automata.
- Reused levels. You have to go through every area at least 2 times, and sometimes up to 3-4 times. Doesn't annoy me as much as other people though.
- Enemy varieties. A bit more diversity would've been welcome.

CONTRA
- Any stronger enemy can kill you with at most 2 strong attacks, regardless of your gear. And they throw those attacks in series of 2 or 3. This in turn leads to 2 consequences:
  * The life bar is useless. You've been hit - you heal. Otherwise, the second blow is guaranteed to kill you.
  * Getting better armor doesn't do anything. At any point in the game you still die from at most 2 strong hits.
- You can get stunlocked indefinitely. In other words, consequtive attacks can nail you to the spot, unable to dodge. You mash the dodge button in rage while your character is helplessly standing still while being sliced to bits.
- Your attacks don't interrupt attacks of most enemies. A bummer for a veteran DS3 player like myself.
- Because of the previous 2 issues, you can't trade blows. If you try, you get stunlocked while your enemy doesn't. And even if you strike first, you don't interrupt enemy's attack so you still get hit. 2 hits and you are dead.
- Very 'thick' enemies. All the enemies and bosses heve enormous amounts of HP, which effectively devaluates your weapon upgrades. At no point in the game you have a weapon which is powerful enough to oneshot even regular weak enemies, let alone stronger ones.
- Some of the normal, non-boss enemies can (and will) oneshot you. I think this is especially unfair towards the player because of the amount of health the enemies have. You have to hit a large demon like 50 times while he just oneshots you. I'm sorry, but this is a game, not Olympic figure scating where a single error costs you a medal.
- Souls-like system where all your 'souls' are left where you die and you need to go and retrieve them. Imagine getting to your body when all the enemies can kill you with 1-2 hits. And you have to do that time and time again because any little mistake gets you killed.
- Stamina recovery delay. Let's take DS3. When you get out of stamina, you wait a tiny bit, and it starts regenerating. As soon as you have even 1% of the stamina bar, you can already so something, i.e. dodge/roll. Not in this game! When you run out of stamina, you can't do anything until like 40% of the entire stamina bar has regenerated! Now, imagine having to stay still for 3 entire seconds in a fight against an enemy that oneshots you at full health. OMG, SO MUCH RAGE!
- Grind. All but absent in the beginning, the amount of it increases as you progress. Further into the game it becomes increasingly difficult to reach the recommended level for plot missions. So you have to do some missions over and over again multiple times, as even with EXP gain bonuses it takes ages to get enough for a level-up.
- Boss difficulties. Some of the bosses are disproportionally powerful compared to the overall difficulty of the mission. You can reach a boss without breaking a sweat, then die 30 times in a row. And the more you die the  harder it gets because you run out of consumables.
- Consumables don't always get consumed. You try to heal, but it doesn't work because the swing animation didn't finish completely yet, or you are in the last few frames of a roll, or sometimes for no apparent reason at all.
- Detection range of the enemies is quite small. For meelee enemies it's around 15 meters. You can stand there in plain sight aiming the bow for a pefect headshot, and the enemy won't notice. This doesn't apply to shooters which have adequate detection ranges.",1586051770,1586051770,False,185,78,0.660178422927856445,0,True,False,False

The combat is a lot faster and at times much less forgiving.

Equipment varies and matters, different weapon types handle differently, and ranged attacks are nowhere near as cheesy as Souls, for comparison's sake.

I will always love Dark Souls and its successors, and will never stop buying and playing those games, but Nioh exceeds Dark Souls in mechanical complexity, and in my opinion, fun. And this is coming from a big Miyazaki fan. Each weapon class has three stances that each have their own moveset, customizable weapon skills, and dodge mechanics. The gear and weapons grant bonuses you can customize to suit whatever build you're going for. 

I absolutely love this game. It's very different from any Souls game. Where Dark Souls is considered difficult but fair, in my opinion Nioh is easier and fairer once you wrap your head around the mechanics. But the shining aspect of Nioh is a depth to the combat that no Souls game has ever had. No more parry/backstab fishing, which gets old as you get good at both. Nioh also has WAY MORE content to it, including an endless mode. No more tedious and repetitive NG+. PvP is isolated, which means no more tedious invasions spent catching up to the host or having to deal with the host running or ganking, because whoever's in PvP chose to be. There's a progression to it, as well as clans (and a progression to clans as well).

I'm almost 200 hours in, and although I beat the story and DLC a while ago, there's still a lot more content.

This game may have the best combat ever designed. Deep, original and extremely satisfying. 

Since this game gets compared to Souls all the time I'll bite, and it's a mostly fair comparison but don't go in expecting a Souls game. I'd say this game takes inspiration from Souls games but does not seek to reinvent the Souls formula.

Weapons all are quite deep, even the simpler ones have quite a bit of depth.

The main difference IMO in this game's combat to Souls (outside the game-specific mechanics) is you cannot use roll in this game like you can in Souls. It has very few invul frames. You often need to recognize the attack and move in a specific direction to avoid it, like Tekken. Even if you time your rolls right, if you roll left when you should roll right, you might just die. I think a lot of people get frustrated using roll in this game like in DS.

Team Ninja wanted to create a soulslike, but apparently didn't know what makes a good soulslike. Enemies are damage sponges, mobs have little variety and are reused in missions, there's a lot of mechanics most of which are poorly explained. Difficulty level is cranked up not by quality enemy design, but by ganks, limiting space (mobs won't fall off a ledge when dodging, you - sure), debuffs making you slow and stripping your defense, long combos that you cannot escape by dodging out of reach, god-like tracking (90 degree turns when jumping while [i]in the air[/i]), spamming the same attack over and over, or, even better, all of it at the same time. Bosses crank this up to eleven with their one-shot potential, anime-speed moves, grab attacks that can hit you through the whole arena, and AoEs that don't allow you to get close until they begin another attack. And NG+ cranks it up to twelve.

When combat in DS3 and Sekiro feels like dancing with the enemy, Nioh is more like crossing a busy highway on foot. One step forward, one-two hits for a ridiculously small damage, two steps back, wait for another window for hitting the boss with a wet newspaper.

Oh, and add to it dropped inputs. Completely scuffed focusing that changes the focused enemy at the slightest move of the mouse (or sometimes by itself). Saving only by praying at shrines which resets the enemies and traps (which would be fine except Nioh likes to just freeze sometimes and then you lose all progress since last shrine). And playing online, when it disconnects from servers it shows you a splash screen that you have to dismiss to continue playing (game is not paused, so you stand there and get pounded by enemies) - and for whatever reason no keys work and you need to Alt+F4 closing the application as if it froze.

That said, Nioh can bring quite a bit of fun. Some of the bosses are well-designed and give immense sense of accomplishment when defeated, some of the mechanics are really interesting and shed a new light on a well-known concept. And if you are a hoarder, Nioh has plenty of equipment for you to loot and upgrade. Nevertheless, as a whole, not recommended - the bad parts bring enough frustration to overshadow the good ones. Maybe Nioh 2 will fix some of them - although, judging from watching gameplay streams and videos, it didn't really.",1585590210,1585590254,False,23,7,0.564484119415283203,0,True,False,False

I have to admit people compared it to Dark Souls a lot, and I was no good at that game so I had a bit of fear about playing this one.  It is hard.  I won't lie, I am no good at these style of games with the kind of patient and practiced combat (I am more of a Dynasty Warriors combat person) so it was a tough game for me especially.  That aside I liked it.  I genuinely enjoy the story (thus far, have not gotten very deep as of this writing) and I am really digging the combat mechanics, weapon variety, and loot galore.  This is an underrated gem in my opinion, its just a strong, fun and deep game.

Pros:
-Great Visuals.  This game has some stellar graphics and visuals.  Cutscenes are rendered in engine too, so your character keeps their gear for them, which I always prefer.
-Strong selection of combat styles.  You can use a spear, an axe, a sword, double swords, a bow, a rifle, a hand cannonm, a hammer, tonfas, an odachi, and some others I probably forget,  But there is a lot here to choose from!
-Loot galore.  I think of it as Dark Souls meets Borderlands.

Cons:
-Its a Hard Game.  Its not going to be easy, I had numerous deaths trying to advance.
-Some content is overwhelming.  Once you start get into reforging, forging, soul matching, and a host of other meta elements it can all seem overwhelming.

Update (at 160 Hours play time):
So I got hooked.  Finally started getting better at the combat...like a lot of these games its about finding an enemies patterns, learning to fight them and sometimes learning the levels and just ploughing through them and avoiding a fight.  I have to say...the game has even more depth to it than I thought.  With like at least 3 New Game Plus levels (I have not cleared the second BTW, but read there were at least 2 more after the second one:  Way of the Demon and Way of the Wise) there is endless play here.
But the bad news is there too.  I honestly think the game is basically impossible at some points.  I mean seriously.  I found myself stun locked and insta-killed in situations that seemed doable except that the enemies suddenly could chain fire paralyze/knockdown attacks or one particular enemy would do the same command grab over and over again with no way for me to react and dodge out of the way.  Its kind of sad because I would love to play more, but beating my head against some of the tougher bosses and levels is just tedium.",1584131780,1585476979,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't mind the controls being bad if when you changed them, the prompt icons alter in accordance, but they don't. If you change 'A' to do what 'B' used to, then the HUD, the UI, the entire game shows the 'A' icon. It's difficult to explain, but have fun getting used to the dogshit controls.

""What pushed you to give this game thumbs up instead of down, given your just-proclaimed stance that the game is sort of average""
The answer is rather simple, the game's combat is so amazing, so crisp and on point that I believe it's something everyone who is a fan of high-octane action should experience. It's when you're outside of combat that the game leaves much to be desired but let's tackle these in order, shall we?
Exploration:
Let me commence by saying I am admittedly no fan of loot based games, I despise inventory micro-managing which means that even games which have it in small doses (think Horizon Zero Dawn) still manage to get under my skin. This is why you should take everything I say about exploration with a grain of salt. Anyway, IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, this game's exploration system is boring. To me, good exploration is about the idea that a cool secret might always be around the corner, whether it be a new area, a new weapon, a rare item or even (when devs want to spoil us), an optional boss. Nioh...under-delivers in all of these. Most of the time, what exploration in this game will bring you is either: a) a weapon your build is not optimized for, or b) the weapon you have but slightly stronger/weaker with so many small stat changes that your head will spin. 
Aesthetics and Graphics: 
I like Nioh's aesthetic style, it's unique, colourful and easy to recognize. But this is in reference to the enemies, areas are more often than not filled with drab, uninteresting and plain colours. It sometimes honestly feels as if the devs asked themselves ""How do we make this level as drab and humanly uninteresting as possible"" , case in point being the Centipede's level which is agonizingly boring to look at. Graphics are fine but it feels as if the game's requirements are too high for the graphics it brings (Doom 2016 runs better on my PC while looking miles better). I assume this is because the game was initially a PS4 exclusive and the PC port was an afterthought. 
Story:
Sucks but is complimented by good voice acting and some of the narrative moments were surprisingly heavy (I'll name the post-Ogress cutscene and post Yuki-Onna fight cutscene as my examples). The villain is about as boring as they come. He looks like an edgelord who was bullied in high school and now chuckles at the slightest display of cruelty to show how awesome he is. The main character is Irish Geralt with none of the depth of character Geralt has (albeit Geralt did have 7 novels and 3 games to develop so a bit of an unfair comparison there). Side characters, with Okatsu as an exception, are painfully uninteresting and about as forgettable as the finest of 1-note-no-personality characters you'd find in Flaubert's novels (ouch). 
Combat:
Is nearly perfect, aside from the fact that I felt the game was sometimes not registering my inputs, this is one of the richest and most complex combat systems I have indulged in. With 3 stances, each offering its own variety of attacks, you are sure to be kept on your toes and will be well-rewarded for immersing yourself in, and mastering this system. However, a keener eye would notice my usage of the word nearly, the reason being that the combat has few flaws.
1. Everything kills you in one hit. Some people will likely claim I had light armour and that this was the reason, but my equipment was frequently in high 60s (weight percentage wise) and I was still being annihilated by everything. I could've gone into the 70s but I'd have to forsake all notion of Ki recovery if I did that. 
2. There is no enemy variety. As of writing this, I am 38 hours in and (not counting bosses) I've encountered around 20 different enemy types with (VERY) slight elemental variants. You can have the richest combat in the world, but if all you're using it against are dumbass skeletons with barely 2 tricks up their sleeve, it drags down the experience. 
3. Like I said upwards, the game sometimes doesn't register your inputs, this wouldn't be as big of a deal if everything didn't...y'know... KILL YOU IN ONE HIT. 
4. Raven Tengus... yes, they're getting their own point because screw them.
5. The healing system in this game is trash. It is a weird blend between acquiring elixirs (Like bloodvials from Bloodborne) and finding Kodamas to increase the minimal stock of elixirs you have (like kindling bonfires in Dark Souls) and it sucks because if you have more in stock than the minimum Kodama shrines give you  (which will always be 3 upon starting a region because this game requires you to get new Kodamas per region because it hates you) you will always be forced to expend the ones from your personal stock first instead of using the ones freely given by Kodamas... and that blows. 
Music: 
Some decent tracks all around but ultimately forgettable. It's no Persona 5 or Nier Automata that's for sure. The generic boss music is tiring but I get why they couldn't have given each of the 30+ unique bosses their own tracks. 
Bosses: 
Before you say it, I know this is supposed to be under combat but I love bosses so much I have to single them out. Disregarding a few duds, this game's bosses are amazing, there are plenty of humanoid and beast bosses for you to manhandle (and...let's be realistic, be manhandled by) and a lot of them offer some very unique and interesting mechanic to play around, this is further emphasized by the game's stellar combat. 
Other game mechanics:
The upgrade system is far too complex for my liking, the spirit guardian system is dull to me but I get why some would be engaged with it. I just stuck to the beginning fire wolf and never changed him. The game also has plenty different ways to increase your (already complex) stats, like getting renown and titles, which feels out of place. The levelling system is not striking, it is neither bad nor good. It's just there and does its job, further reinforcing this game to be as much about stats and grinding as it is about skill (which I do not like at all).

The most important change isn't the Japanese history and plot of the game. It's obviously well researched, the plot and setting are enjoyable even if you aren't a history buff and don't understand a word of what everyone's fighting about. The fighting is the fun part. Just like every Souls-based game there are various weapons differing in power, speed, and reach, each with light and heavy attacks. But the combat has been fine-tuned and fitted out with 3 different stances per weapon, a huge number of unique combos and skills for each weapon, a button that when timed well lets you regain expended stamina, and more. As if that wasn't complicated enough, it also has a Diablo style loot system with randomly generated stat buffs on equipment, so you have to be managing the mountains of garbage loot the enemies drop to find better gear. At first all of the complications and insane difficulty scared me off, but if you invest the time in learning the systems and playing cautiously, then it is one of the most deep and rewarding Soulslike's I've played.",1585345930,1585345930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is well worth your time and money. It is a must-play for any fans of Onimusha-style games. The artwork is unique and impressive, with obvious inspiration from feudal Japanese paintings. All the enemies are also based on Japanese mythology, adding an interesting layer of lore to each encounter. The voice acting is appropriately and passionately done in the native language, making it far more immersive.

Overall, this is a great action RPG with souls-like elements. Although I feel the ""souls-like"" genre is overused and often given to games that don't fit the criteria, this game has earned the title. The mechanics are there, the difficulty is there, and honestly the combat is more fluid than Dark Souls games -- to be fair that's a low bar though. Almost any enemy can kill you in 2-3 hits for most of the game, yet you quickly get to a point where that doesn't phase you anymore. The game will still surprise you, and you always have to be making calculated risk choices. This game is not Dark Souls, but that shouldn't matter because it is a great game on its own.

[i]As an aside, when Halo made regenerating health popular in FPS games, we didn't call them ""Halo-like"" games. Although many games borrow the mechanic, they were never judged as ""Halo-like."" Similarly, games shouldn't be judged as ""Souls-like"" just because they borrow the respawn/experience drop mechanic. It distracts consumers from what the game actually has to offer.[/i]

Anyways, this game is a classic story-driven hack and slash akin to the Onimusha saga, with many different weapon categories/combos, some limited ability for stealth kill/ninja skill-sets, and an expansive optional magic system that doesn't suck. Want to be all three: a jack of all trades but master of none? Totally possible and works great for PvE. Want to pump nothing but melee specs and ignore the convoluted ninjitsu/magic hippy nonsense? Absolutely possible to clear the game with that. Decided you ruined the stats on your 40+ hour character and need to re-roll completely? There's an in-game item that lets you respec relatively seamlessly so you don't have to make a new character -- thank you Koei Tecmo. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this. It is a modern classic.

Yes it's easy to see the parallels and inspirations from Dark Souls, but don't let that fool you; this game has its own identity.  You can choose to fight 'graves' of other players that have been slain.  A fun gameplay mechanic is some of the tougher enemies will create sections/'pools' in the arena or area that make your stamina recovery really slow, causing obvious problems.  You can 'purify' these.  Also worth noting that the RNG loot system is cool because weapons are all randomized in terms of abilities.  Just because a weapon or armor piece may appear more powerful number or stat-wise, does not mean they are necessarily better.  Some weapons carry unique stats and abilities.

I would love to recommend this game and I really think it has the potential to be the best and def top 3 games I have EVER played however this is what game play is like and after researching a bit it has been for a long time...

1. Finally get enough amrita and try to level up well great because the game will freeze and delete progress..

2. Finally beat that boss you have been working on for hours and hours well great again because it will turn black freeze and delete your progress...

3. Take a break and decide to start again tomorrow because your mad its been freezing and wasting all your time well great again because it will uninstall itself from your steam directory...

4. Getting nice and immersed into the world and BOOM the resolutions start changing screen turns black and it erases your progress...

I have over 100 hours into this game and im only on the third part because of these issues.

I saw team ninja say if people buy NIOH on pc then they will port the other games but why would people buy it if they can even get this one to run on PC?

100 hours on a powerful pc, I was really liking this game but it is pretty much unplayable on PC and seems a simple search will show these issues have been going on for a long time.

PLEASE fix this game and make it GREAT!!!! Unexceptable currently :(

Edited March 14th, 2020 - Just read a comment on a Nioh 2 article. The guy can't handle the stress of playing a challenging game. My earlier criticisms stand, but fuck that guy, I'm going to beat this and I'm going to recommend it, because a game is what you take from it. I'm gonna gitgud, even if it pisses me off half the time.

Original Comment:

Game feels clunky. Ruins the experience and prevents it from being fun. You fight against the control mechanics almost as much as the enemies. I'm very disappointed.

I'm comfortable with Sluggish controls, like in Monster Hunter, and I'm comfortable with other Action/RPG's like Dark Souls, Bloodbourne, etc. This game is a near miss for me. It has so much potential, but I just couldn't ignore the control issues.",1541987144,1584357415,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Everything about the combat, bossfights, level design, etc is amazing. It's so fun to play, its incredibly satisfying to get good at the combat and I absolutely love it. Lots of variety, it's honestly never boring to rip through new missions. 

The loot system is a neutral area, its not great but its not that bad. I have no problem with it, if you really need gear you can fight other players dead spirits which are scattered everywhere in tough levels from them dying. (They drop pieces of the gear they are wearing).

However, the music, story, characters, UI, menus in general, etc are all absolutely forgettable and kind of terrible. The guardian spirits in cut scenes look ridiculous, while I dont mind subtitles... Reading while enemies are lunging at you can be frustrating and I wish there was an english option for voice. While the level design is good, the fact that it has levels kind of makes learning lore about any area completely forgettable, same with characters.

This game is is hard but mastering boss fights and enemies is very rewarding, the game has a loot system very similar to Diablo which makes gearing up take longer but feels more rewarding when you finally finished a build with the perfect piece you finally got. Strangely enough this game's multiplayer is actually quite amazing, games like dark souls go with the host and summon approach which is an option in Nioh but there is a second option called Torii Gate, pretty much you and another player are put into a level together with a new gauge mechanics, it's quite simple if you or your partner dies you lose some gauge and start losing more until you revive them by simply walking over to their marker and pressing a button, the dead player can also at the cost of possible recoverable gauge can just revive on the spot, now that sounds like it makes the game a lot easier and it kind of does but then you learn that Torri Gate has more enemies then soloing the levels normally would have, checkpoints only give you gauge back, and if you both die it's back to the beginning, you do however don't lose your currency like normally so thats a little plus. Enemy diversity is on the low side but I've noticed some of the enemies from the 3 DLC maps do appear in the earlier levels with this Complete Edition, in Torri Gate anyway, Bosses are great, I know the game's second real boss is going to thrash some people for a while but if you can get passed it you are pretty much prepared for the rest of the game. I recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of the Soul's Series especially those who enjoys playing those games with a buddy, and more bonus points if you are a fan of Japanese mythology",1583976815,1583976815,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It crashes when I try to enter the training stage, blacksmith or any other available option. I would only try it again after some updates.

In short, it's a poor Dark Souls ripoff. The different stances aren't viable or add anything new to the genre, it only makes things more complicated. The familiarity system is just about boring grinding. The leveling atributes system isn't as intuitive as it was with Dark Souls and the prestige points makes it even more confusing. The game is based on missions instead of a single Metroidvania world and lacks all that exploring factor that DS had. After killing the first boss, couldn't ever play it again because it crashes.

Edit: Yeah, after some patches I could make it work. And wasn't worthy. The mission based system is such a chore. And they still send you back and forth to previous scenarios in order to complete ""sub-missions"". After getting some extra levels and better equipment, the game becomes a cakewalk.

It's got a great, engaging combat system (stance based movesets for all weapons, minor rhythm mechanics for stamina recovery) and really broad item options that make the game seem like it will have a really amazing late game.

Unfortunately the levels are not particularly inspired, are often re-used between missions, and the enemies are dull and repetitive. You get the distinct sense that the developers didn't fully understand how to generate 'challenge' for their high level players and just turned up some numbers (damage, health, number of enemies) or created unavoidable disadvantageous situations to try to score a quick, cheap kill and keep the player from realizing that they haven't really faced anything new or exciting since about hour 50. 

Bosses are not great either, in particular one giant skeleton who is larger than the screen so your camera doesn't know where to look when you accidentally quick-swap your target from his near ankle to his torso mid combo. The second real boss is based on paralysis, which seems like a poor choice from a psychological perspective. Watching the boss wind up for a 2 second animation that kills you while you can't move isn't much fun.

On the other hand, the initial learning curve is the right kind of steep, and the story actually makes some sense compared to 'atmospheric storytelling' such as in Dark Souls. Item options are tasty for the more ARPG minded among us, allowing a great deal of customization while levelling.

Again unfortunately, when you get to the top, there are strict restrictions on what items you can use if you want to be at all functional. Sets are a must, and you have to farm a special item from the post-game dungeon to swap traits on those set items until you get the right traits. It doesn't leave much room for imagination once you realize that you essentially 'must' stack close combat damage, an attribute damage boost, and a stat damage boost on your weapon for example.

All told, this is a fun, engaging, satisfying souls-like for a while, but it eventually becomes clear how thin the veneer is and the enjoyment fades.",1583857216,1583857216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I die, quite a bit, but I'm having fun figuring out the mechanics and grinding along for better loot, more levels, and the little bonus titles.

A few things you should know before buying this game, if you're not familiar with games like Nioh:

1) Get used to dying. It'll happen, multiple times, and aside from the frustration of occasionally losing a fat haul of level-increasing Amrita (the games' mystical plot-driving substance) if you die a second time before reaching your death site and recovering your remains, there really isn't a penalty for eating dirt again and again (and again, and again, and again).

2) Get used to dodging, blocking, and recovering your Ki. All three will play a critical part in how easy or hard your fights are.

3) Learn what each stance is good for, and when to use it (and how to swap on the fly). Sticking to just one, tempting though it may be, can often make fights harder than they strictly have to be.

4) Don't worry about trying to optimize your stat and skill points from the start. You can respec everything for money--though it'll get rapidly more expensive as you go--so don't worry about ""messing up.""

5) If you can, play with the online feature enabled. Even if you don't co-op any of the missions, you'll often find the fallen remains of other players. These leftovers can provide a useful clue about potential threats in the area, and calling from them the dead to kill them for good will net you plunder! (In offline mode, there are scripted NPC remains that will always respawn in the same locations each mission; online remains are random as to their location.)

6) Have fun!

Plenty of weapons types, again weak stats make most nearly unusable.  Lots of armor and weapons, RNG makes most of them worthless.  

The core problem with the game stems from your weak character.  You're like a trash mob NPC who decided they were going to take on the villain himself.  Rarely are you beaten by an enemy, you're beaten by your stats. 1-3 shots from most enemies will kill you even if you're overleveled and overgeared.  It's like you're constantly trying to level up just so you can be underpowered.  Often you're exploiting the environment or a game mechanic rather than having a satisfying battle and some battles are so unbalanced it's a wonder how they made it past testing (I'm looking at you Tachibana Muneshige).

First I'm gonna point out the negatives:
- If you're a keyboard-mouse player, then it's gonna be a drag at first. Having a gamepad is highly recommended (It's a must, unless you're a nerd like me). The hints and prompts always show the gamepad buttons. So it takes quite a while to fiddle with the keyboard settings to find out which button represents which key.
- The optimization isn't that good, moreover the graphic settings are minimal, (i.e. render resolution, shadows, one or two post-processing and that's all) so there's not enough scope to tweak these.
- Framerate is capped to 60 or 30, depending on your choice.
- The hitboxes are sometimes inaccurate and in rare cases your attack may not register at all although it was supposed to.
- The UI was meant for consoles and not navigable with mouse.

Now moving on to the positives and why I love this game:
- The gameplay is fast-paced and quite challenging. The combat requires focus and Ki management, and every mistake is punishing.
- The setting of story is compelling. I haven't finished the story yet so can't comment on that for now.
- There are a bunch of complex mechanism including different skills trees for each weapon, stances, ninjutsu, onmyo magic, Ki pulse etc. 
- A wide variety of weapons and armors and quite a few playstyles to choose from.
- The bosses design are gorgeous and scary at the same time.
- Loot system, forging and upgrading weapons, soul matching system are done quite well.

Just remember that this isn't Dark Souls despite being inspired from it, so don't expect it to be on the same level as Dark Souls.

Pros:
- Is genuinely fun gameplay/good combat that is challenging
- The dark souls template is hard to screw up and it adds its own flair
- The game is deep and you could easily put 200+ hours in 1 playthrough (I'm at 175 in the DLC completionist style) and significantly more if you go beyond NG
- Wide array of weapons

Cons
- Poorly optimized/bad port. Lag, 5+ drops losing up to hours of gameplay each time on a good rig (gtx1080). Things I don't experience with other AAA games.
- Story is a bad
- Diablo levels of loot but more confusing
- Fairly absurd amount of skills/skill trees. If you combined the weapon skills, ninja skills, magic skills and  proficiency skills its in the hundreds and there aren't that many no brainers. Feels like quantity over quality, but once you figure it out a bit its not too bad its just unnecessary imo I ran around with 30+ skills on each of them for half the game because I didn't know what was going on and trying to read through hundreds of skills is a chore.

I wrote more about the cons because I didn't want to gloss over them the way a lot of these positive reviews have because Nioh has flaws.

Pros:
+ Smooth, responsive, more action-oriented combat than Souls-type games. Very high ceiling for mastery, if you want to play it that way. You can tell this was a Team Ninja (Dead or Alive, Ninja Gaiden) project.
+ Tremendous customization options. The skills system is like putting together your own fighting game character.
+ Easier co-op than Souls-type games.
+ Hugely replayable. I don't go in for Diablo-style loot collection, but if you do, you could just play this forever.

Cons:
- The loot system and combat system are at odds. The levels are well-designed and fast-paced, like a Ninja Gaiden level, but once in a while I have to take a 30 minute break to sort through the loot I picked up. It hampers the flow, IMO.
- I really loved the coherent world map from Dark Souls, but this is a disjointed missions structure. It's not all bad, but I prefer more metroidvania style worlds.
- The customization options for equipment and skills provide so many choices, it can be paralyzing. Even just deciding between major weapon types can be mystifying when you can't test out the entire moveset without buying all the skills. TIP: the smith sells a respec item for relatively cheap, go HAM in skill trees just to try them out, then respec if you don't like it.

It feels less polished, the story less cohesive, and the enemies are far less inspired. Guy in leather armor with an axe. Guy in plate with a sword. The same exact model oni you fought 2 other times this mission. Combat can be frustrating as you watch your weapon glide clean through an enemy that somehow dodged into the wall he had his back against.

Being a straight console port, this game is locked at either 30 or 60 FPS, and does not change game text to account for mouse and keyboard instead of controller either. Settings are clearly designed with a console in mind as many advanced graphics settings cannot be changed. I experienced a loading screen hang twice within the first couple sections of the game.  

The last gripe I have with the game is small, but was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. The game boasts online co-op but nowhere on the Steam page does it state that you must unlock this feature, and to do so means going completely through the first chapter of the game. Not the first tutorial, or the optional (but necessary) second tutorial, but the entire first chapter after that. A friend and I bought this to play together and had to play for hours solo just to get to where you can unlock co-op.

Be warned, this game is very time consuming. You can't just do main quests without being severely under-leveled and you have to get pretty far into New Game+ (called Way of the Strong) to be a fair level to beat the 3 DLC areas. The loot system is also pretty complex. The first playthrough is fine, higher level and better rarity usually means better stats. Way of the Strong adds a new rarity called ""Divine"" that can be upgraded by combining them together. Way of the Strong was my favorite for this reason as I could throw away any loot not Divine and combine any Divine loot I had. NG++ to NG++++ has both levels and Divine loot and this is where I stopped playing. I think the two systems of levels and combining rare loot don't work very well together. If you are unlucky like me, you can get stuck with the same, now under-leveled weapon from NG+ and not get anything better in the same weapon category you invested stats into. You can increase the level of your items, but it costs a LOT more than just combining weapons, making farming almost a necessity. One hit kills become super frequent in NG+++. This is because of elemental damage not being blocked by most armor, some enemies having attack buffs until they are defeated at least once, and new/stronger enemy attacks that the player will not have seen on their first three playthroughs. 

These were the only flaws I had with the game, and the developers have said the Nioh 2 New Game+ difficulties will not be as crazy. I can only hope the loot system will be fixed for New Game+ as well.

However, Nioh has so much more to offer:
- the combat is very good; you have a few types of weapons that play very differently and you can buy skills for each type; you can also respec your character if you later decide to go another playstyle

- stances; you have 3 stances for combat (low - low damage, fast swings, good dodging; medium - medium damage and speed, but better blocking; high - slow, but high damage); some stances work better for some enemies; you can combine these stances in many ways and you can even get temporary bonuses from switching stances; I played most of NG in medium stance, but the NG+ cycles kind of forced me to get more technical with my combat

- bosses are quite varied in aspect, gameplay, gimmicks and on how they feel overall

- loot; this might throw some people off, but I didn't mind the loot aspect; you get a ton of weapons/armor/items that you can sell for money, donate for Amrita (aka souls) or Glory (MP currency), or disassemble for materials;
      * you can also forge your own gear, reforge the stats, or level up the gear using other, better gear (Soul Match); one thing I didn't like about Soul Matching is that it got ridiculously expensive the more you did it on the same item, but thankfully, once you get to NG+++, there is a way to reset the base item

- NG+ (and beyond) adds new and stronger enemies around the levels, so, for the most part, you still have to pay attention; you can switch between NG cycles whenever you want

- different game modes; you can play most missions in Coop with another player, with the caveat that the guest must have completed that mission beforehand, in his own game; I haven't tried Coop, because when I got around to playing Nioh, there was pretty much nobody else playing, but I'm glad that I did everything by myself;
      * there is also the Abyss, where you fight bosses that have certain buffs, while you have debuffs (but you can disable the debuffs if you complete some side objectives);
      * there is also Multiplayer, but I haven't tried it

There are some not so good parts, of course:
- the UI feels a bit clunky; you gain a ton of items, and the UI displays them as a vertical list, so you have to scroll a lot through the menu;
- speaking of menus, you spend about 40% of the game in menus; there's a lot of gear managing that needs to be done between missions
- sub-missions are very repetitive; while the objectives will vary, you will play the same levels over and over, with minor variations
- story isn't very special, though the setting is great (warring states Japan); there are some nice characters, though most feel under-developed

It took me a little over 300 hours to get all achievements, but I kind of ignored the Abyss (which has one of the Achievements) for most of my playthrough, so I guess it's not very indicative of how long it actually takes.
Anyway, overall, I love this game (I've played it more that all 3 Dark Souls games combined :P) and it's a must buy if you like this souls-like genre.",1583066292,1583066292,True,100,10,0.891611754894256592,1,True,False,False

CONS:
- controls are horrible in my opinion; it takes some time to get used to them even after you re-bind them

I think it must have crashed around 20 times in the amount of time that I have played it and its FPS drop almost everytime the camera gets too close and in cinematics (so around each 30-60 minutes).

For me this game scratches the Diablo progression itch, instead of the controlled-fantasy itch of FromSoftware's games.
The level and enemy desing are usually good, the item progression and item systems are kind of meh but ok.
The posture system is actually quite good, much more better than I expected from reviews and all.

I don't really like the endgame approach, where there are certain skills that are pretty much mandatory. I mean I like a lot better the balance of skills in NG. For example the damage difference when reducing the armor on level 800 enemies is insane. But I guess they had to do something to make NG+* difference than NG. The game also clearly favors some weapons and skills. For example katana and dual swords are easy builds all around.
I don't like or care about the story of the game, for me is a bunch of nonsense and idiots.
I think the japanese and mythical settings were well done and I wish Sekiro had a bit more of mythical beings.

So in short: This is a good game to relax from FromSoftware's games and kind of play something similar, but do not expected the same care or quality that makes them unique.

I don't know how easy keyboard controls are to use, but these sort of games typically almost require using a controller with how bad their keyboard controls are. Don't say I didn't warn you. In addition to the other weapons I describe below, you can also use bows, guns, and cannons as ranged weapons, but the majority of your time will be spent using a melee weapon.

[i]Nioh[/i] is a linear, story-driven, souls-like game based in feudal Japan. You play as William, an Irish-born English pirate who sails to Japan in search of his guardian spirit Saoirse, who was stolen from him by an alchemist named Edward Kelley. The game's story revolves around William's search, with him meeting various allies and enemies along the way. The story is decent; though confusing at times, it serves its purpose.

There are a total of 7 different weapon types in [i]Nioh[/i]: katanas, dual katanas, spears, axes, kusarigama, odachi, and tonfas. You can also use your fists if you'd like. Each weapon type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it's worth experimenting in the early game in order to find which weapon types suit your playstyle most. Each weapon has its own skillset with some skills being shared between weapons. You can choose to use your weapon in three different stances: low stance, mid stance, and high stance. Stances emphasize different weapon characteristics, such as speed or damage, and can be freely interchanged. The game also has magic and ninjutsu, though I barely scraped the surface of these categories, so I can't say much about them.

Combat in the game takes some getting used to. When I first played the game, it took me several hours to beat the first area, and I consider myself well-versed in souls-like games. You have to get the hang of the game's unique mechanics, such as Ki pulsing, where you recover a portion of your stamina after an attack with a well-timed button press. Learning these mechanics takes time, and you should be prepared to die many times before you get the hang of combat.

Enemy variety is by far the weakest area of the game. After the first couple of areas, you've seen all of the enemies the game has to offer, with new bosses being your only saving grace. This is my biggest gripe with [i]Nioh[/i]; the lack of enemy variety makes combat repetitive. I suggest that you only do some of the side quests to help mitigate this problem. Many of the side quests take place in already completed areas with the same enemies, which can quickly bore you if you're trying to do every quest.

Just about every enemy drops weapons or armor on death, and you're meant to switch to this gear when it is better than yours. If you find gear you particularly like, you can opt to upgrade it at the blacksmith by increasing its level to that of higher level gear or by modifying its attributes. This system is interesting, and allows for many different weapon builds.

One of my favorite parts of my game is the customization options you have for your appearance. You can modify the appearance of any weapon of piece of armor to that of another. Basically, you can make yourself look however you want. This feature is awesome, and I wish more games had it. Often in other games such as [i]Monster Hunter[/i], I'll find myself not using a weapon or set of armor simply because it looks stupid. Thankfully in [i]Nioh[/i] I can use whatever I want, choosing my own fashion.

I don't have much to say about the level design; it struck me as neither great nor poor. The soundtrack is pleasant and suits the game well.

Overall, [i]Nioh[/i] is a pretty fun game with extremely difficult combat. Be prepared to die many times before you master combat, and don't expect the game to get any easier. Enemy variety is unfortunately a big issue, though if you don't try to complete every quest, you might not notice it as much as I did. If you do end up playing the game, try an odachi out. An odachi is a gigantic katana with heavy slashes, and it makes you feel like a total badass. But if it's not your thing, no hard feelings.",1573420263,1582446504,True,18,0,0.676952779293060303,0,True,False,False

First of all, if you are going to make a port to computer, make sure you get the controls right. I go into the menu just to swap the functions of the A and B buttons, but whoever was in charge of the controls thought it would be a great idea to (instead of swapping the functions), swap the actual buttons instead. So now I press B to back out of the menu, but the game thinks I'm pressing A instead, so it thinks I want to swap the input I'm on with another button. Naturally, I didn't understand this right away, so I press down button (trying to scroll down of the menu). So that now sets A to be D-pad down. You follow so far? Yeah, me neither. Took me 5 minutes to do some DaVinci Code Mystery Solving BS just to get my controls back to normal because Down is Accept, A is back, B is up and a bunch of other crap... JUST TO SWITCH 2 buttons around. Seriously? How did this make it past playtesting?

Even if the port was amazing, the game itself is still meh. It's actually pretty fun for the first couple missions, but then you realize that you've seen all that the game has to offer within the first few hours. The world is set up as levels rather than 1 whole connected map, so the game's areas and story feels disconnected.

Overall, fun if you have a friend over and you want to take turns trying to grind through a somewhat challenging game, but nothing close to a fun immersive world to get lost in.",1581133795,1581133795,False,0,2,0.415808647871017456,0,True,False,False

What makes me really really hate this game sometimes is, the problems with input eating...
what I mean by input eating is that every so often your character is unable to perform the actions for your inputs.

Coming from all the souls games where it is 99/100 times a player problem and not a game problem initially I put it down to a problem on my side, where I though I must be doing something wrong, however, one day while farming some Revenants for gear, by somewhat cheesing them with the Odachi's Groundquake skill to break down the enemy stamina to perform a follow-up grapple attack. 

During this process I noticed that every so often after performing the skill I would be rendered unable to move or perform any kind of action for about 1 second or so (that is a hell of a long time in a game like this) resulting in me missing the opportunity to perform the grapple attack. 

Now that isn't a problem against Revenants when farming even if they do land a hit no big deal, BUT, against things that deal massive damage where every action you want to do IS important it SUCKS a hell of a lot, so much so that it ruins a potentially great game.

Unfortunately I have not been able to figure out exactly the cause my guess is something in-game goes wrong and the command queue is unable to register any incoming commands, I have noticed this happen with other events like dodging, attacking and using items. Using the strategy above with the Odachi I can't determine when it will happen, but, it always eventually happens, sometimes the very first attack on the 1st revenant, other times I can take on 5 or 10 before it happens.

This game is a lot more of a Diablo-like game than a Souls-like game. Unfortunately it kinda misses what makes both those so great, Diablo has a lot more depth with the looting system and although you change your equipment up a lot as you progress that slows down, in Nioh you are constantly having to change your gear for higher level gear (over 100h in and I just keep getting slightly higher level gear (not really different gear set Warrior of the West mostly) so lots of loot but very little freedom and variety to change). 

What makes Souls fun is not that it is 'difficult' for the sake of difficulty, what makes it fun is that the game is challenging most of the time and you learn the moveset of your foes and it is designed to be something you overcome with skill. Nioh unfortunately went to the school of Gank, Nioh teams inner monologue: 'You know what is tough, let's create enemies that 1-shot kill you, or better yet fight multiple bosses/strong enemies at the same time'. Not to say skill is not at play here, but, the motivation for what a 'challenge' is here seems lazy at best.

Another issue is inconsistent difficulty, at first I thought maybe there is some dynamic AI difficulty going on here, but, I haven't found any online evidence for this. Sometimes you fight a boss and it is really really tough and it seems like nothing you do is working, but, then you try again without having really learnt anything new or some silver bullet strategy and you sweep the floor with them, like stupidly easily beating them. What I have noted in these instances is where it is unbearable tough is the Bosses seems to chain their attacks much closer together, and noted on two occasions across 2 different bosses what almost looked like near simultaneous activation of two abilities. Not sure if it is something similar to the input eating issue, but, in reverse, where the boss issues two commands but they get executed all messed up.

BTW:
I am running a decent i5 with a GTX 1080, 16GB RAM and using a XBox 1 controller, which should be plenty juice for this game. I did also try killing background tasks including disabling AV in hopes of combating the input eating, to no success :(

Overall:
Everytime I find myself really having fun, something happens be it input eating or inconsistent difficult, or an awful Gank boss fight and it makes me hate the game.",1580063794,1580847134,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Way too much loot drop. It's just annoying. Despite itemization being different than Dark Souls, it drops 10x more items, it really hinders the gameplay loop and the ""reward/thrill"" effect from getting new items;

1. On Nvidia drivers, the game is really laggy until you do a settings fix in the control panel (I found the solution off of a Steam guide)
2. The game crashes--although not often--and there is definitely potential for lost progress due to these crashes. I had only 2 in my ~50 hour playthrough, but just be careful of crashes and be sure to save often.
3.  Hitboxes are screwed up on a few attacks, particularly from larger bosses. This is pretty normal for Souls games and their derivatives, but it is especially noticeable in NIOH where there are very few dashing i-frames compared to Souls.

You can mish and mash together different kinds of gear for your desired playstyle, be that unarmed combat, throwing stones or using normal weapon like the rest of us. It's got great replay value as you can infinitely grind for more armor and weapons and levels. Choose your allegiance to a faction based on personal bias or due to the bonus they give. There is a lot to this game, and the DLCs offers very very challenging additions to the game in terms of whole new areas and missions to do.
I believe it took me around 80 hours to complete the first clear of the game (not 100% but most of the base game), so if you're not one for the NG+ system you should at least have around 80 hours of gameplay!

Actual Review:
This game is very beautiful, and fluent. Its meant to play with a controller and controller only if you can master mouse and keyboard you deserve to be called God. Anyway Ive never played the Dark Souls titles but this is what everyone compares this game to. For those like me that never played it, it means that you dont run into enemies thinking youre hot shit and will kill em in an instance, you gotta dodge, learn all of their moves, and time your attacks right. This means its not a very fast paced hack and slash game, you actually have to think (thats why it took me 7 hours to beat act 1). You find equipment to better increase your stats and attacks, same goes for gear. There are stats to boost the loot content which means yes...RNG you go from plane gear (grey) to unique (purple) and everything in between (blue/yellow). There are shrine critters to locate in each main mission that boost your stats, which means exploration is necessary. I have yet to even beat the game but you can do it in no time if you dont do sub missions and twilight missions (missions that are harder but greater rewards). With that being said, aside from main story the rest of the missions are reppetitive...you replay same maps for sub quests over and over just to kill one random boss and call it a day...even bigger problem is that once you kill the main boss in that mission thats it, all missed enemies die and you cant spawn the Gosts of fallen players and farm their gear, half the time you dont know if the boss is even a boss because he will be an every day encounter enemy and you kill em with ease and thats it, all over. Thats my only gripe really, otherwise its a solid game thus far.",1576085781,1578589220,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The weapons system in this game is great for people who don't just want to swing around one type of weapon all day as well (Sekiro).

It takes an old type of fighting style game and implements it's own traditional samurai vibe to it while also staying mostly in Yokai culture in terms of what you're fighting.

The depth and variability in the move sets to the different weapons in NIOH are a step up from other games in the genre, and weapon switching, stance switching and ki pulses add a great deal of depth to the combat.  There is a great deal of unlockable moves to be explored and I found the combat never once got old even 60+ hours in.  

There is also an actual narrative and cut scenes in the game, unlike dark souls, and while the story wont be winning any awards, unlike some, I enjoy a decent story and narrative to keep me motivated more than, none at all (heres looking at you Dark Souls).  That being said there are some weak areas that keep it from reaching that other games lofty heights, and for me it is the Diablo style loot system and the poor magic mechanics in the game.  I like Diablo style loot when it is done well like in borderlands, but in NIOH the gear is all boring.  It is nothing but simple stats and number changes on the gear and weapons.  No awesome unique effects on weapons  like in borderlands or diablo.  Also the ONMYO magic is just mostly useless except as a debuffer and if you wanted to be a naruto ninja braething fire you are going to be dissapointed.  I dont know why they even have fire balls and blasts in the game if they are not a viable method of combat.  I can spend all my points in ONMYO magic and stock up on as many fire balls as possible, literally 9 shots, and it will not get me a single kill on a Yonkai.

These issues can be fixed and mitigated for most users, but the methods needed will vary depending on your graphics card and will require some research and maintenance on the buyer's part. If you have the patience to deal with the port's shortcomings, it's very much worth buying. If this sort of thing would bother you, I'd give it a pass.

 It's a fast-paced soulslike(More like Bloodborne) with a more intricate combat and magic system with features such as unlockable and assignable moves, powers, and buffs across 7 melee weapons along with three ranged weapons to supplement your playstyle. You also have Ninjutsu, which adds another potential playstyle revolving around gear like smokebombs, shuriken, speed and stealth, etc. Instead of an open world you have several regions to visit via repeatable missions(and therefore bosses) along with a loot drop system with colored rarities that determine the number of abilities and buffs the equipment will have. As a result, there's some RNG involved if you're wanting to maximize things, but it doesn't seem mandatory for progression and more for fun. I am however only about 12 hours in, so don't quote me on that.

Refashion and soul-matching are cool functions, but it doesn't redeem how much the inventory system is bogged down by duplicates of the same item. Dark Souls had a clean inventory system that didn't feel overpopulated, even with consumables. This one does A LOT. You will have a ton of SHID to sort through after every mission.

The stance system seems like a cool combat mechanic at first, but this acts like the whole moveset for  weapon class. Every sword has the same moves, and so does every axe with a few exceptions probably.

A ton of areas are reused or slightly modified. I don't like going through the same area a bunch of times with a new boss somewhere I have to find.

Bosses are not as intricate as Dark Souls bosses, a lot of them have WAY too much health, even if you hit them with the correct elemental enhancements. Unless you have A class agility, simple running is often more effective than dodging, even in close quarters.

On the good side the combat is really fun. Especially once you start getting things like the special ability and parry timings down. When the combat of this game clicks it just feels so good. For that alone I'm glad I played this. The plot is pretty weird, but weird in an entertaining anime kind of way. It is fun when you don't take it too seriously. I mean really, there is a giant frog boss that smokes a tobacco pipe in this game. How serious can it possibly be?

My major problem with this game is the grind though. The amount of money and XP you need to take your character and equipment up quickly adds up into ridiculous amounts. On top of that there is a check list of things to do for bonus stats and they add so much time to the game. I'm okay with some grind in a game, but this is enough that I actually gave up 40 hours in the first time I played it. Now I'm over 200 hours in and I still feel the same way about the grind. It isn't fun, it doesn't add anything to the game play, and the game (for me at least) doesn't do enough to really warranty the amount of grind involved.

If you play things like Dark Souls and Sekiro and wish that they were more like Diablo this is a great game to play. If you want to play something a little bit more steam lined this one might be a good one to skip.

On a side note this game also crashed on me a lot. Probably 20 times. I finally figured out it was because of the action camera. When I turned that off the game stopped crashing. So just in case it happens to some one else, there you go.",1577433337,1577433337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
485510,60654035,76561198317192693,43,4,1020,0,1020,1577341144,"Nioh is by far the worst soulslike I've played. The level design is awful, there's no sense of exploration because the levels are very linear, yes there's twisted paths but that's merely an illusion to convince you it matters which way you go. Its mission based instead of one connected world like Dark souls and the environments are bland and uninteresting and lack any flair to make up for the boring level design. There's no sense of discovery either because items are absolutely useless, you get a ton of loot from every enemy you kill but the only item that matters is the healing potions and its never fully explained how it works, unlike Dark souls you don't get a fixed amount of healing potions (elixirs) every time you die and respawn at a bonfire (shrines), sometimes you will have 4, sometimes 3, sometimes 0, then you offer all the useless loot at the shrine and it will give you more elixirs.  There's also a way to get blessing which will increase the elixir drop rate but how to actually put points in these blessings is very unclear. 

As for the combat, its much more complex than Dark souls and significantly less fun because of that. There's three stances low(fast). mid and high (heavy) and each stance can have its own special moves for different combinations. There's  separate skill trees  for every playstyle (ninja, magic and samurai) and every weapon has its little quirks that makes it advantageous against certain enemies. You can drain an enemy's ki(stamina) but half the time that's just a bad idea, just slash and dodge. There's also an ultimate move that slowly charges over time and once its full, you can go invulnerable with insane damage, you can actually beat every boss this way, it takes away at least 60 percent of their health bar which is necessary because the bosses are easy but maliciously unforgiving. Every boss has multiple one shot moves and you will die many times simply because the game hates you and not because you're bad. This approach to boss difficulty is definitely more inspired by Ninja gaiden than Dark souls. I do not appreciate it because all it does is frustrate you. The game isn't too hard other than boss battles however, because there's like 9 total enemy types, you will soon realise that despite all the complex combos its best played as if its Dark souls and the enemies are boring to fight anyway, they never surprise you, every enemy seems to have a basic 3 hit combo and ranged enemies fire with tracking projectiles disguised as arrows. 

There's no sense of progression or accomplishment on a grander scale, its always  ""oh finally beat this boss lol"". Every mission has a recommended level and there's side missions for you to grind these levels. The side missions are set on even worse maps than the story missions and generally involve loot collection or checklist gameplay. Its mindless grinding like Diablo but you can do it with a friend although that makes a game a bit too easy, you can try the twilight missions with a friend though, The story is pretty uninvolving and is mostly told through still images with chat boxes. Its not a reason to buy this game.


Nioh is a repetitive slog that's only fun for the first 10-15 hours and because it lacks the mystery, and the magical exploration of Dark souls, the repetition really shows. I don't recommend it.

I reached Way of the Nioh, but I never finished the story missions in the final DLC. For perspective, I was able to finish the base game's story missions before hitting level 100, which I still find ridiculous for myself.
There is a TL;DR at the bottom as this review is long.

The music in this game is good, but not great. The few soundtracks used throughout the stages are repetitive, and the repetitiveness diminishes their purpose or meaning overtime to the point where it feels like the music is only there to fill in the silence. However, the music for the boss fights are more on point. They are energetic or somber in the correct fights. The only downside is that even these soundtracks are recycled. There are no unique soundtracks for every boss. Even the final boss in the last DLC uses a variation of the soundtrack heard in the trailer and a few cinematics from the game. I’m not saying this soundtrack is bad; it’s cool to hear in the last fight. I’m only making the point that there are few or no distinct soundtracks for each boss.

Nioh can be a game a person loves and hates, but the same can be said about the other games labeled as ""Difficult"" by players (ex: Hollow Knight, the Dark Souls series, Ori and the Blind Forest, etc.). You may have read or heard that this game is like Dark Souls or Ninja Gaiden and that it contains elements from Diablo III. They are correct to some extent. Enemies and bosses can be related to Dark Souls in the sense of how quickly they can kill you and the experience points you lose on death (XP and currency are separate in Nioh). The checkpoint restart is similar too, but many games have this mechanic. The combat, however, is nothing like Dark Souls. The combat is reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden in speed and the need to be aware of all enemies. The block and dodge mechanics work together similarly as Ninja Gaiden. For some reason, it even reminds me of the Fable Trilogy. You can dodge immediately after blocking while you have Ki available. On top of these combat mechanics, the skills for each melee weapon, Onmyo magic, Ninjitsu, the armor sets with set bonuses like Diablo III's sets, and, most importantly, the Guardian Spirits and Living Weapon ability present a variety of builds and opportunities for those who take the time to read the descriptions or watch the video demonstrations. For me, these elements of the game made the battles far more thrilling and added more depth to the combat compared to Dark Souls. If you like fast-paced combat while having several buffs at once instead of just two or three buffs and slow whacking, this game is for you. However, the existence of these game mechanics is more reason for enemies to become ridiculous to the point where any major enemy in the beginning of the game kills you in one or two hits.

If you can't get past the first three regions of the game solo, specifically the first boss in Japan, the lightning boss, and the boss in the ""water level"", then you probably won't play the game beyond that. Those bosses, in my opinion, are your ""make or break"" bosses. I kid you not, on the PS4 version, I was summoned so frequently to the water-level boss fight to the point that I left those levels by choice. Whether those were veterans or people who were stuck on the mission, I could not tolerate it anymore. This mission and the summoning frequency for this mission say much about the early missions’ poor design. These early bosses give both a false idea of what to expect later and an eye-opener on your ability to apply both your memorization and your reaction skills together. Not every boss will kill you in one or two hits. Not every boss will be a huge yokai, nor will they always be a person with a one-shot attack available (looking at you Warrior of the West). However, even if you are a Dark Souls veteran or someone who only know Dark Souls, you need to be faster in interpreting and reacting to various situations. I would say you need to be slightly faster than one playing Bloodborne. Not sure if I want to say this game is on par with Kingdom Hearts II on Critical difficulty. The feeling is there for me. You will have moments to catch your breath and opportunities to escape. You can reach a point where you can skip most of a mission to reach the objective. The game will discourage in the beginning, but if you can overcome those difficult scenarios and the seemingly unreasonable enemies, the game experience is very rewarding. Except for the story. I didn't get much of a feel for it, unfortunately.

TL;DR (you’re missing out on key points if you buy the game):

Story is meh. The music is good, but most soundtracks are recycled for similar meaning in the battle. Combat and variety are great when you get used to it. Enemies are unreasonable at first but are more than tolerable later. This game is not for the light-hearted. You will be discouraged early on. You will struggle, die, learn, adapt, and repeat until you are victorious. This cycle will reward the competent with a sense of accomplishment and make the rest quit early in the game.  I give this game an 8/10, on par with my rating for Dark Souls III.",1577425858,1577425858,True,5,1,0.542772650718688965,0,True,False,False

In later difficulties sloth isn't viable anymore as the duration is very short but by then you'd already have an idea on what to focus on for your build. 

Level doesn't matter as much but gear does. With the abundance of gear comes with the abundance of build. in later difficulties you could become a Iai master glass cannon and one shot bosses, make a tanky character and still have decent damage, make a ranged build and throw kunai all day, mage type build and so on...

Combat is extremely rewarding when you practice all of it's mechanics, managing stamina (attack, blocking, dodging), switching stances, living weapon, and using ki pulse (an action used in between moves to regen stamina faster). You can't jump in this game, thought i should point that out but certain moveset allows you to jump but in general you can't jump which sucks

However there's some huge drawbacks such as it frequently crashes and the game is incredible difficult but for the wrong reasons. Unlike From Software games the games difficulty doesn't come from its compiling complexity of enemies but rather their damage just becomes unreasonable and armor has little to no effect. Going a full armor build maxing out resist and boasting a good 700+ defense and 3K health normal mobs still managed to do over a thousand damage with a single attack. So by fully investing in defensive attributes you can still be 3 shot.

The combat system is unique and fun with lots of movesets yet you are have no use for most of them , especially against bosses, because the bosses barely have any downtime in their attacks, most of the time you gonna use a weapon with long reach, hit them once then run, because 1-2 hits are more than enough to kill you, no matter what your gear is.

Level designs are sometimes great (multiple paths, smart enemy placement), other times the developer just wanna be a dick (very well hidden shrines where you rest, traps and ambushes everywhere, one wrong move and you dropped to death). A funny thing is your protagonist is a sailor yet he cannot swim.

Sometimes there will be a ""checkpoint"" (hot spring) in the game that you can use to restore health during long levels, then there's the stupid ""collecting kodama to increase health item storage"" mechanic.

Disclaimer: only played with a gamepad, no idea how it plays with mouse+keyboard.

While it's mission-based instead of an open world, inside a mission the level design is technically comparable to a single zone of Dark Souls, as you keep finding more shortcuts back to the same shrines while exploring forward until you reach the end (shrine=bonfire). The side quests use the same mission areas, but often in different ways - like starting from the end location of the main quest and going backwards a bit. It can start to feel like repeating too much, but I personally still enjoyed them - the side quests change the enemies so it isn't exactly the same anyway, and there's usually only 1-2 side quests in the same area (excluding a couple of small arena-like maps which are used a bit too often).

Combat is what you'd expect in a souls-like, with your standard stamina meter and all that. The clearest difference is that human enemies also have stamina meters which you can exploit (i.e. get them out of stamina to get a free hit or two). Demon enemies have their own equivalent of a stamina system which is a bit more complex, but the idea is still the same: empty their meter and you get free hits for a while.

There are also a lot of different melee skills which you will want to use along with normal attacks to i.e. deal more stamina damage, gap closers, knockbacks, parries, things that just deal more damage, etc. It took me a while to get used to them rather than just spamming normal attacks, but the abilities do give a lot more depth to the combat.

If you like farming after the original playthrough, Nioh's equivalent of a ""new game plus"" actually adds new mechanics in the game. While the content is mostly the same but with bigger numbers, you'll gain new different ways to progress your character, which keeps you interested for a lot longer than your normal ng+. There's also a boss arena mode that unlocks after first completion, further increasing the game's lifetime.

I think that people give way too much credit to Sekiro, when they say that it's combat system is complex. I mean, compared to Dark Souls combat, basically anything is complex, but Nioh's use of different stances and customisable combos provides great amounts of extra detail.

The fact that there are 'linear' levels, rather than an open world fits the game better, since it tries to tell a cohesive story. Dark Souls is trying to showcase a world using hidden lore, making an open world better, but that is not the case here, since the lore is pretty obvious, as every piece of information about the world and its inhabitants are provided to the player as they continue to play.

The weapon variation within the game is decent enough to keep you occupied, even if it's not as varied as Dark Souls. Over time the player will learn the move sets of all of the enemies and the weapons that they use, meaning that the notion 'git gud' definitely works here more than in other games, since the game could just become a memory game, especially later on.

Probably my favourite part of the game is the Living Weapons, because it gives the player more things to collect, as well as change up their playstyles. The crafting and smithing mechanic may be unnecessary, but they are still a welcome edition to people like me who like to control how their character looks.

Overall, I think that Nioh is underrated when it comes to souls-like games, and to anybody who wants a game like Dark Souls, but could never actually get into the said series, then Nioh should be a definite try.

The mix of weapons, stances, combos, loot and gear all provide a plethora of variety in building out your character. When I first started playing Nioh, I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. However it didn't take long for me to tire of the repetitive, punishing nature of the game. Admittedly with 40 hours, I put the game down for a bit and came back to it later. Suffice to say I gave it a chance.

I would highly suggest using a controller on pc to play this game. I struggled immensely always trying to convert keyboard and mouse controls into the xbox controls the game dialog said I needed to use. The game did get better once I started using a ps3 controller since its easier figuring out what Y, B, A, and X convert to on the ps3 controller.

Much like the DS series, Sekiro and Bloodborne type of games, Nioh seems to follow the must be a, 'hardcore gamer', gamer in order to derive any satisfaction from the game. While I do get the idea of beating impossible bosses and starting over and over and over and over again before moving on with the rest of the content of the game (and therefore reaching high levels of dopamine release), its just not for me. For someone with a busy schedule, limited time to game in addition to having other responsibilities and interests in life, I have to give a Nioh a pass!

I recommend Nioh for those with the time and patience to endure its mechanics and, 'git gud', philosophy. I grew up in a era when games were fun, still challenging and yet accessible with a modicum of time and effort.",1575764874,1575765877,True,1,0,0.502834856510162354,0,True,False,False

Not a terribly fun experience.

Edit: I have decided to power through and try to experience the game better. I find myself likening this to an old fighting game called Bushido Blade, where again the main character would die frequently in one or two hits. The key here is basic sword fighting. Blocking is an absolute must. This game is not to be played like dark souls where you rely on iframes during your roll to get in and out of combat. Careful selection of your distance to your enemy based on your weapon selection, keeping an eye on which stance the enemy is in and countering with your own, as well as timed blocking/parrying(a skill you can receive with certain weapons, in certain stances) make for successful combat in this game. I have found myself enjoying this game more by way of enemy stamina depletion by blocking large attacks and using stamina depleting moves myself like the kicks and lunge attacks, getting in special attacks when they fall down. I have changed my recommendation to a cautious recommended but only for patient, calculating combat lovers.
Pro tip: At the start of the game just wear a shitload of armor, play around with your weight limits later when you have mastered the block/parry and stance changes during combat.",1575327693,1575521765,True,0,0,0.47176554799079895,0,True,False,False

It's hard to put the pros and cons into a list because the mechanics of this game seem to mesh well together so I can't bash on one mechanic because it would be directly tied to another mechanic I like.

Nioh has five difficulty levels. A casual player can clear the first difficulty, get the full storyline, and drop Nioh if all they're playing for is story. Although there are five difficulty levels, the harder difficulty levels, the better gear that drops, and the difficulties unlock higher levels for your gear and also the last 2 difficulties are the only place to get the best rarity gear in the game. At the higher difficulties all the enemies have crazy health pools and they have the capability to 1-3 shot you. Also at the higher difficulties DLC yokai show up earlier in the game and Yokai and enemies are placed in different spots on the map, and they may have an extra skill or two.

This game has great replay value, and a great item rolling system. Think Borderlands 2 leveling, skill trees, and gear stats... on top of a third person action game. There are different kinds of weapons and they have their each skill tree. Levels allow you to add stat points which allows weapons that use that stat to do more damage.

The AI is pretty dumb and repetitive. By the time you get to endgame, you hit wise difficulty and yokai start using new skills, which keeps things interesting. Once you learn the new AI the worst thing that can happen is by going deep into the abuss where enemies can stop mid skill and use a new one to screw you over.

All in all I've been playing this game very frequently since I got it and when I get bored I play something else but I always end up coming back to this.

Nioh is one of those rare games, which in my eyes is like the first Disgaea, where there is a huge grind that's fun and possible.

It's hard to find a game as good as Nioh.",1575028797,1575028797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Superb gameplay and combat system, great aesthetics, decent story, a tad bit tedious loot system and meh port (It crashed 3-4 times throughout my 500+ hours of playtime)

IF YOU ARE PLAYING THIS AFTER BLOODSOULS OR SEKIRO, FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE GAMES. This game may have been a little bit inspired by FromSoft's BloodSouls games. However, Nioh is its own beast. 
If you play this game with the BloodSouls mentality, you will end up bitching and crying about the game like every other hardcore FromSoft fanboy who couldn't get his\her 0.0001 lbs of a brain to adapt to a different game.



Nioh has the best combat system in any game, PERIOD. Ninja Gaiden 2 is a close second, but still not as good.
The combat is fast, smooth, fluid and allows you to come up with neat combos and ways to utilize your weapons. The Pro community discovered shit load of neat stuff you can do with the various skills this game has to offer (for example: look up Demon Dance dodges and what not). The stance system is neat as it allows you to diversify your approach to fighting enemies and bosses. 

Another neat and unique thing about this game is the way you can interact with illusory walls and mimic chests using gestures. Not to mention, the Living Weapon (LW)\Guardian Spirit (GS) mechanic which will come in handy in many situations. 
Think of LW\GS as your Persona or Digimon, you choose a guardian spirit (animal), once its gauge is full you can pres Y + B (or Triangle + Circle) to activate it and go crazy. (Once you become a better player, you will learn how to manage it and what not)

The loot system gets a bit tedious at some points, so always manage your inventory between missions and what not. Also, make sure to soul match (upgrade) your equipment (armor sets and weapons). Oh oh oh oh, and if you don't like how a weapon or an armor piece looks, you can refashion it while keeping the same stats. 

As for the story, Team Ninja decided to take real life events and mix them up with some anime bullshit because why not? amirite? ;) 

I dunno what else to write, I mean I enjoyed this game enough to do a Level 1 run of the whole thing (I did the same with Bloodborne). Granted, I lost my shit so many times, but man! it felt so good.

Having played the Nioh 2 Alpha, I seriously cannot wait for the full game. They added a lot of new and cool stuff, SPECIALLY THAT SWEET YOKAI SHIFT HOMG!!!

There are jujutsu things, which are like active/passive skills that are too many. And, this is apart from the regular skills which were too many to begin with. All in all, the items, skills, blacksmithing, and hub are confusing as hell. Why is the hub confusing? How can a hub be confusing? Whatcha smokin'? The hub is not like firelink shrine that you can visit anytime. You have to lose all your mission progress to visit the hub, which sucks and I am not sure what purpose it serves in devs' minds. However, I will give them a break because of the pros:

+ Amazing combat. You have 3 different stances. Enough said
Lore - Its a great marriage of fiction with real events during the 1600s. Because of those real events, the game sounds more believable

In a souls like game, you only want combat and lore to be amazing, which they are. This game has differences most of which gives this game a unique twist and are welcome. However, some changes like hub I mentioned above are total nonsense. Ohh, BTW, this is not an open world game like SoulsBorne. You go on missions which are different areas inaccessible from each other. But, within each area, there is so much to see, so many paths to go to, and so many secret areas, it doesnt matter. If you like SoulsBorne and are looking for a unique twist to that formula, play this game.

First issue: Dodging. Unlike Dark Souls, the dodge move seems to have no i-frames at all. Or if it does its completely abitrary as to when it does and doesn't. I understand the concept of using the 'dodge' as a way to clear short distances quickly, to literally dodge an attack entirely, and to the game's credit this can be done on most enemies without much difficulty. The problem being in the cases where it NEEDS to have i-frames, such as fighting an enemy with massive swing arcs in an enclosed space. Then you're stuck dodging or trying to tank hits, and good luck with that because...

Second issue: Sponging. Everyone who has played borderlands knows what this is. Its when enemies, or the player soak up a huge amount of damage before going down. Here's the issue, the enemies seem to sponge damage for days, meanwhile the player can take maybe 3 hits from most enemies. I don't know how far you have to level up for this to stop being the case, but this is extremely tedious. I have to fight an oni for five minutes perfect dodging everything, and if I miss one crucial move I have to restart the entire fight all over again. Not a good first impression.

Third issue: Level-based loot system. Really? This is what you came up with? I'd like to just state for the record that not everyone likes borderlands or its system. In fact, some of us find the game mind-numbingly boring and tedious. And that certainly seems to be the goal of this game as far as I can tell.

So in culmination you get a game where there are what seems to be mini-bosses all over the map that tank tons of damage, so every fight devolves into you hacking away at their ankles for five minutes, and if you get hit twice you have to start all over. And level-based loot so I have to swap out weapons every 3 seconds and micromanage my inventory. The result is me being somehow both bored and mildy irritated. Keep in mind I only died twice on the first non-prologue level, and twice to the boss on that level. Again, not difficult, just annoying and boring.

The semi open level design, the extremely high battle difficulty that even the miscellaneous soldiers have to deal with carefully, the severe death penalty, and the tension caused by the difficulty and the insidious level design It's not from the ""Dark Soul"" series, I'm afraid the most loyal fans will not believe it. As for the sense of attack and other more intuitive experiences, Nioh is more like Ninja dragon sword biography than the ""Dark Soul"".
The basic system that determines the way to fight is weapons. There are five basic weapons in the game, namely, single sword, double sword, gun (spear), axe and lock sickle. In addition, there are three kinds of long-range weapons, namely bow and arrow, firearm and cannon. There are some subcategories under each weapon, but the same weapons in the same category are almost the same in the basic movement mode. At first glance, the design of these five basic melee weapons is much thinner than the ""Dark Soul"" series, but it is not. Because each weapon has three additional postures besides two attack combinations, each of which can generate many different attack modes (although the mechanism is different, but the effect is similar to the weapon shape system of blood). In addition to some unique combination techniques, the richness of the fighting methods of RenWang is almost the same as that of the ""Dark Soul"" series. In fact, on the premise of not changing equipment, the fighting options given by RenWang to players at the same time are much more than those of several works of fromSoftware. After a little skill upgrading, there are more than ten attack methods for each weapon.The limiting condition behind these attack methods is the player's weak endurance (energy). Because attack, defense and dodge all consume energy, the control of energy becomes the key element to control the battle rhythm. Moreover, in Nioh, not only players' characters have the concept of energy, but also enemies including boss can only act within the scope of energy. That is to say, not only players will be forced to stand there motionless panting, the enemy will also.
Such a design naturally leads to many endurance based tactics in the game, such as luring the enemy to make invalid attacks, launching fierce counter attacks after its endurance drops to a certain extent, and then letting the enemy with zero endurance fall to the ground. In short, in addition to considering the enemy's attack routine and health, the enemy's endurance has now become a set of data that we need to consider in the battle. In many cases, before we consume the enemy's health, we have to find a way to release them. In terms of the allocation and use of endurance, the developers also add a very interesting ""broken heart"" design, which can restore objective endurance through rapid response and accurate operation. It's not easy to use this skill quickly and properly between the lightning and flint, but its practicability and appreciation can't be underestimated. In some cases, it's the only way to win.",1574427581,1574427581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is mission-based, with each one having a limited (but for main missions, fairly large) location, usually interconnected through doors and ladders, kind of like demon souls.

There are a lot of weapon types each with different playstyle (in 50 hours I really only learned one, the sword).
A lot of addicting mechanics like a much more exstensive loot system (though you'll soon learn most modifers are of little use), interesting consumables and spells. The plot is more of a background between missions than what you might expect from the first few hours, but is still a welcome addition if you're tired of being a blank-state character meeting characters with vague backstories.

The crashes would occur when the server would time out with all settings maxed out. Set to default high settings without any changes and online servers still crash relatively often but it doesn't cause the entire game to crash to desktop. 

I love the game on console and was happy to buy it on sale when i saw it for PC. If you have a console and are interested in the game I would definitely suggest playing it there. Online play is unfortunately dying quickly due to server crashes (which originally caused game crashes on PC with all settings turned on and maxed. Don't run custom settings)

Online play is killed by the servers for one simple reason. Nioh is a game to take slowly; methodically working your way through the world with relatively few save points. Crashes can lose 30 min to an hour of gameplay. When assisting a player or being assisted by a player, the server crash can completely lose all gameplay that has not been saved to a shrine.",1573825440,1574091173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Reminiscent of other Team Ninja Games, esp Ninja Gaiden 2 which was the hardest game ever made. NG2 makes dark souls feel like a walk in the park. The combat system is interesting and offers a great amount of skill to master. Loot system is similar to Diablo. Enemy variety isnt good - this needs to be improved in Nioh 2. The story and progression in the game is a bit archaic and need to be improved. The levels themselves can be passed through quickly if you try and don't offer much depth so its gets kinda boring after a while. Bosses are interesting and fun. Its basically a dungeon crawler crossed with Ninja Gaiden and Dark souls. 

The sequel should make an effort to create a rich world rather than just level hopping through the story, and have more enemies.

This game is not as good as Dark Souls 1 and I would encourage the developers to be more ambitious next time instead of trying to play it safe - the influence from Dark souls is very obvious in some places and in its marketing. I don't think they had as much of the budget as From Software had but nonetheless, Nioh needs to find its own niche in this genre and reinforce it. This series has a lot of potential. Nioh 2 is just around the corner and if it has not made large improvements to its weakest areas then the series will not be worth playing.",1574033601,1574034295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Basically, Nioh takes some of the pillars of a souls game (""bonfires"", spending currency gained from kills to level, highly difficult bosses, unforgiving) and then adds a touch of Diablo-style loot systems and deeper combat mechanics.

Nioh's combat is what makes the game so easy to come back to over and over again. There are a great assortment of weapons, which all have 3 stances that change your attacks for them, strong and fast attacks in each stance, special abilities unlockable for weapons and stances, ninjutsu, magic, and a ton of viable builds. While melee will be the bread and butter of most builds, the magic and ninjutsu trees can be very powerful when focused on as well.

The one area that Nioh doesn't stand up to Bloodborne and Dark Souls is that the story, lore, and atmosphere is not as good. It isn't bad by any means, but it is not on the same level of godliness as those games.

i have so many hours in the various dark souls games, across multiple platforms, and this games combat system is probably the closest to that in comparison, but this game isn't dark souls.

loot system like diablo, with items that drop with various rarities and item levels, and those rarities dictate potential enhancements on those items which include set bonuses etc, and others which can be reforged at the blacksmith for gold/materials.

non linear, but not open world. the enemy types are repetitive, but most enemies are capable of two shotting you even if you have decent gear, which also helps to draw the comparison with the dark souls games. where it differs vastly is the map and the levels, which are all self contained zones.

the story is scattered and not well stitched together from a narrative perspective, but some of that possibly has to do with translating issues between english and japanese, and non linear nature of the gameplay.

i've only put in about 40 hours, and am at the end of the 2nd zone, as i've taken my time to do some grinding as i learn the various game systems and character building options. apparently there is a new game +, and there are items which you can buy to respec your character, so there is some potential replay-ability here.

You will die over and over until you can find a method to defeat what is in front of you which is very rewarding.  The problem isn't so much how punishing the game is, it's the controls.  This felt more like a Devil May Cry game mixed with Diablo style loot drops.  The boss fights reminded me of Dark Souls, which was amazing.  The regular and sub mission levels were not too bad, however, at the end of a few they just through wave after wave of enemy at you which was even harder then some of the bosses.  Without mastering the controls, these would have me defeated before i knew what was happening.

After 18 hours and several bosses I finally had to throw in the towel.  I made it to the 3rd region and wanted to keep going, but I just could not make the controls fluid no matter what I did.  I would change stances when ki pulsing and couldn't figure out the combos.  Tried different weapons, and even ended up using cheese tactics when all else failed.  I would almost always be in the middle of an action when the enemy attacked which would be an insta-death for me.  Blocking was something I tried to use a lot, but would end up out of ki which would have me dead in 1-2 shots.  The game had promise, but after an 18 hour learning curve and still not grasping the concept, I'll park this one for now.

I may come back for a visit one of these days as I REALLY wanted to play this one through.  A word of warning to those who purchase this one, the controls are going to take some time to click.

A variety of weapons and skills to add replayability and customization. Magic is a bit broken, the rpg elements are overbearing (too much pointless loot, and levels/builds are too impactful for my taste), and enemy variety is lacking (mainly due to the many remix missions that repurpose levels and enemies in a new order). The DLC in particular doesn't integrate very well since it's higher level than you'll be at the end of the main game even if you do every sub-mission. The living weapon mechanic and phantom battles don't achieve much but don't negatively affect the game either.

The story has some nice cheesy moments but overall disappoints with cutscenes reducing William's power and ending bosses before you drain their hp to zero (one of the final bosses ends at 10% hp to show you a cutscene where William loses, and almost every mission ends with the villain teleporting away after achieving what he came for).",1573758793,1573758793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This may be a great game on PS4 but It is honestly embarrassing the state this port has been released in on PC, it shouldn't be allowed to be in the store at all.
I have a decent gaming laptop that can run almost anything on the highest settings yet Nioh is so poorly optimised and no matter how low the settings i use the framerate is appalling and it is completely unplayable, really don't know how powerful your PC must need to be in order to run this because my laptop far exceeds the recommended specs yet even the menues are stuttering all over the place and I can't play even 5 seconds of the game.
I was really looking forward to trying it out and was excited to see it on sale but am now left extremely disappointed, guess I will have to stick to Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro.

Nioh made me appreciate the big ineffecient attack animations of Dark Souls much more. The bosses in Nioh love to immidiately turn around with little to no signalling and take out half of your health, likely lead to being stunlocked to death. At least in Dark Souls the ineffiecencies in user experience are rewarded with top shelf game play elements because without it the format is to frustrating to be worth the effort.

Its really just to complex
It has this giant selection menu where you can select which special moves bind to which button combinations, which is just really complex and dumb.
Learning skills is great, if it wasen't so damn complex again. Each weapon type have their own set of skills for it, where you can for that specific type go into the selction menu, for that type of weapon, and set the skills, for that weapon.
Thats called redundancy.
You also have to select spirit gift or whatever its called on each mission.
It also has this wierd way of giving you more quick select slots, where you can press r2 to switch between 2 sets, this is bad. If you forget to change it you might use fire on your weapon instead of healing. This can be fixed if they just made so that you needed to hold r2 to select from the second menu.
The map you roam in is also usually really poorly designed, you usually have this one linear path to the goal, where you really cant deviate much. Its also usually enforced by locked doors.
The setting/theme is refreshing though.
Magic is kinda good, except for how you use it, the quickslot system.
Having 2 weapons is also good, but i do wish it was quicker to switch.
Also the fact that some enemies are really low so you need to switch attack mode to hit them. Thats just dumb.
Combat is okay, its not really unique or anything.
The loot system is great, but having to sort through all the crap that isn't useful isnt really great.
The pc port is also great, except for the part where most other programs that run on directx act wierd when you alt tab, you need to click the hotbar icon some 3-4 times for them to be clickable again.

[h1]Conception[/h1]
NIoh is a RPG game, which in may ways look like Witcher 3 + Dark Souls 3 + Dishonored.
From Witcher 3, this game took loot system. From Dark Souls - gameplay mechanics and half of combat. From Dishonored - word progression and world design. This game is not open world like Dark Souls. Instead, you game main and sub missions, and they design is so much like in Dishonored.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Story is about the world, where exist soulstones, which calls `Amrita`, and humans live with spirits together. Our protagonist, William, lose his spirit after Kelley, main antagonist, steal it from him in unbalanced fight. After, they go to Japan, to complete their objectives. But, they become implicated in a war between clans of Japan, where each one took his side. William must fight with his new friends the other side, which are helped by Kelley.

And this is what i remembered after i complete the game. Game itself is divided by 18 story missions. Buy 75% of them is just fighting and eliminate our's clan enemies.
I could say that story could be interesting, if it was better spelled to the player.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
So, lets bring down all Nioh gameplay elements:
- We have 2 close-combat weapons and 2 long range weapons;
- We have 5-items armor system, with 2 equipment slots and 8->16 consumable slots;
- You have 2 currencies - Amrita, which is used for lvl up, and Gold- which you will use on blackSmith to craft/ upgrade, refashion your weapons and armor.
- Healing system is something between Bloodborne and Dark Souls: you still have a minimum of `Elixirs` (from 3 to 8), but you can also get from enemies additional 3 elixirs, which in max you can have 11.
- Stamina system is almost the same as in Dark Souls, with exception - you can restore a part of your lost stamina, if you press in right time KI button. Point is that whenever you lose stamina by direct action(attack, roll), your loose stamina, but not completely. In lost stamina rise KI bar, which will fill this lost stamina, and if you press in right moment, you can easy restore your lost stamina, without waiting if to self-restore. 
- Weapons system is equal to Witcher 3 -> we have 7 types of melee weapons(katana, dual katana, long katana, axe/hammer, kusarigama, tonfa and spear). And each one have his own gameplay. But after you choose weapon type, you will start to chose between weapons in dependence of which stats they have. Also, practically no unique weapons existing, because you can also change weapon and armor looking. So, only that matters is weapons stats and buffs. There is not the Dark Souls system, which every weapons is unique(if we not take duplicates).
- Armor system are also equal to Witcher 3- you chose armor in dependence of Max weight allowed and stats & buffs that armor holds.
- Fighting system is just the part of Dark Souls, because:
 a) Game have stances, which change you light/heavy attack: high stances -> heavy and long attacks, but slow; mid stance - medium power/speed attacks, better use in defense; - low stance -> low damage and stamina consumption;
b) You have sprint-dash-roll actions on same button. Roll is used only after you use dash.
c) Game have weapons skills, which unlock different weapons combos and even parry.
d) You block attack with your weapon;
e) If you lost all stamina, you cannot move.
- Because in this game existing sets of armor and sets bonuses, in dependence of your knowledge of character building, you can play as OP one-shot character, or as the simple samurai, which will kill bosses in 100 hits.
- Bonefire system is equal to Dark Souls 1. Also, you cannot teleport between bonefires.
- Crit-dame is dealt only when enemy lost all his stamina or is getting down.
- Your spirit is your ultimate, which gives you invincibility for some seconds. Ultimate looks almost like Genji Ultimate from Overfck.
- Fighting enemies you will be in more safe style, where you lands some attacks, and after quickly dash back from them.
- Some times, without  a right build and power, you cannot pass some areas(dual bosses or High Level areas), because you will need a very powerful weapon(weapon itself with right weapon stats and character stats with right armor), to be able to kill fast, when enemies will land a lot of attacks in one on you. In comparation, in DS you can at LVL1 done all game.

[h1]Enemies[/h1]
Enemies in this game is the most crazy and mindfcking thing i ever saw. 
The first, a lot of them have midblowing design, and also, unexpected attack, which can fck you up in any moment.
A lot of bosses and enemies have minimum 1 one-shot-kill atack, which they will use in many times right after you've been staggered. You know, the best enemies are who can one-shot you(no). Is so fcking funny to fight to them. But is not.
A lot of the times, your life will depend not on your skills, but on your build and what series of attacks will do enemy/boss to rect you. For example, we have boss Shima. It could be a very good boss, but he have 2 cheating one-shot attack, which he will use in many cases only after he will stagger you, which will cause you instant death. And the main reason why i hate such attack, are because they don't have bright start, to show player that soon boss will use one-shoot attack, which will cause you to be unable to counter them. And if you try to block them, this attack will make you lose all you stamina, and you will be stun for few seconds, which will give boss free insta-kill. This is so poor boss-design, that the worst bosses of Dark Souls series looks much better than this ones. This fcking trash buried me so many times, than i wanted to leave the game each time, when a 10 times in the row boss one-shots me. Those mdfk, who designed those bosses, sure now make some gachi-movies, because i will not believe, that those crazy japanese devs are something related to normal people. Also, game sometimes place enemies in such way, that you will be fckt hard in this place 100%.

[h1]Audio-Visual[/h1]
Graphics looks pretty ok, but more important is the design. Design is very cool, in special enemies design.
Audio is just ok. Nothing WoW.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
To play smooth in this game, you should have a video card with minimum of 3 GB video memory, or you will play on 50% resolution.

[h1]Final[/h1]
Is very hard to recommend this game. It plays very fun, until you reach such enemy/boss, that all your positive emotions are totally fcked by poor japanese game-design. 

I recommend to try this game, because it's feels something different than Dark Souls, but if you was unable to beat minimum 1 Dark Souls, i will recommend you to stay away of this game.
Upd.: DLC is the most awful thing i ever saw, if we talk about game design. Bosses - one-shot's you with almost every attack, which is the worst thing boss can have. Japanase developers again prove that they are most mindfckd people on the planed. Also enemies are just crazy trash. For this, i downgrade the final note to this game.

I wish that I could give it a mixed review, because that is probably what it deserves.  The actual combat system is pretty good.  It's just a shame that literally every other aspect of the game is flawed at best and downright bad at worst.  Maps and enemies repeat to an insane degree.  The story is utterly forgettable (and the DLC story just kind of ends out of nowhere).  

The game also has the worst loot system I've ever seen.  Seriously, it is that bad.  Virtually every item is useless and more than 90% of item attributes are both boring and pointless.  Enemies are fond of killing the player in a single hit, especially later in the game.  The final side missions are especially infuriating, because the game throws you up against multiple bosses at the same time, which the combat system is clearly not designed for.  I won those fights by out-leveling them or cheesing them, not by getting better.  

Pride and stubbornness were pretty much the only reasons I suck so many hours into this game.  Since I had spent money on it, I wasn't going to quit partway through.  Due to the game's many problems, I can't in good conscience recommend it over its alternatives.  If you want a game with Diablo-inspired loot that makes good use of it, try Grim Dawn or the Borderlands series.  If you want a good action RPG, play any of the Dark Souls games or maybe The Surge 2 instead (I've heard good things).",1572746433,1572746433,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

NOTE :-
[b]The review is long.So,I would like to point out that one thing that I hate the most [/b]
Absolutely No Learning Curve So Far:-
I completed NG+ and NG+2 ,and let me tell you the bosses are absolute tank in these difficulty modes . They barely take damage and do tremendous damage. Specially in NG+2, the bosses are also buffed. This not only makes the fight irritatingly difficult (just because they can still one shot you,unless you farm extremely hard for better gear) , they also take even less damage and have insane health. The fight becomes too darn boring and lengthy. I generally go on upto NG+3 in Souls like ,but I could not continue beyond NG in this game,that I had to ask for some help. The higher NG is for those who are too lucky or can farm gear a lot (more than any  game which relies on grinding,that I have played so far). There is a section called the [spoiler]The Abbys [/spoiler] for hardcore players. So,why make the regular bosses so boring? And also, in some side missions,they put two bosses at once. Again,the same story of tankiness. I request KT and Team Ninja to take care of this in Nioh 2. 

[b]Complete Summary[/b]

I played and completed Dark Souls Series on PC,and after reading a lot of reviews and watching some in game footage I bought the game. This review is done after beating up two bosses  . I am so far enjoying the game but I also HATE some mechanics of the game-not just because it isnt Souls like (which it isn't),but because it takes away the fun that is intented to be had. So,here goes the things that I like and dont like and I definitely hope the devs take them into account for their Nioh 2
[b]Things I like :- [/b]
- Combat system (truely satisfying)
- Graphics (good enough)
-  Weapon types (dont have to get confused from them)
- Guardian Spirits (really a cool new mechanics) 
- Stance changes
(will add more after playing,if there are any)
[b]Things I HATE :- [/b]

- [b]Limited Heal items[/b] -Need to farm them a lot,because you dont get enough replenishment from the shrine.

- [b]Too much info[/b]-Have to keep so many things in mind that you dont get to use everything when you need it most. As an example,there are accessories,Talisman,Skills,Levelling,etc.,which I could not understand until I gave it a bunch load of time

- [b]So many buttons to use[/b]- There are buttons to change stances,to dodge,to attack to use an item,to change shortcut items,and so on. That's too much until you get used to it.

[b]No open world [/b]- You cant go anywhere you want. There are some restrictions

[b]Mission concept[/b]- Although I dont like new games completely copying ideas from old ones,I must add to the fact that the mission system in the game makes it so boring and less fun to this otherwise amazing game. I want to kick some boss' ass,but not as a mission.It should be normal progression,where you get to fight the boss after entering in its arena;not as a mission.Of course,there may be side missions and mini bosses to increase the content of the game,but choosing the main bosses as mission from the menu/map totally takes you away from the story that you were already enjoying. So,I would say,lets just progress through killing bosses,while side quests may be selected from anywhere else-map or menu.

Overall, if you like hard actions,RPG, and a bit of grinding,Nioh is up for grabs. But ,only if devs could fix the things,I think they would deliver a must buy Nioh 2 next year. The game being old,does not require to be reviewed,but hell,I could not stop myself though. 
Anyways,I hope to play improvised Nioh 2 on my new Playstation :)

UPDATES :-
Now that I am halfway through the game,here are more of those likes and dislikes
 [b] I like:- [/b]
 Boss battles :- Once you know their weakness,and have a good level weapon,you can easily beat most of those bosses. One of the other best thing is that,in the game,there are barely any enemies and obstacles from the nearest shrine to the boss battle,so its just you and the poor boss waiting to be beaten.
 Content :- 50+ hours,and I am not even close to completion. Comes from a guy who has completed Souls series,so I had a little bit of advantage.

[b] I HATE :- [/b]

[b]-Boss battles (again)[/b]:-Just like Dark Souls 2 and as stated above,most of the bosses here are not very difficult,but they have high hit power,and tank build. That is,they can mostly one/two shot you (unless blocked,which is again limited to your stamina),but require you to get better weapons(otherwise the fight will be long). It means,there is no room for learning the boss mechanics,other than dying a lot.Apart from having less number of elixars,which are to be farmed mostly,most boss fights are not big enough for you to go around to heal,and learn their movements. If you are too distant,they are going to use ranged attacks,which deal good damage. So,to learn the boss' weakness,you need to die a lot more than required,which is pretty annoying at times.
It could be a troll by the devs,and it could be so that,being easy bosses,you might end up losing your patience,and make mistakes,but still,dying uselessly is a boring idea.I would rather have more like [spoiler]Lothric and Lorian,The Legendary Duo, Phontiff Sullyvan[/spoiler],than bosses from Nioh. There are however,some excellent boss fights,which will be memorable after you beat them. But that number is not much.
[b] I would rather prefer running out of elixars (healing items,which again should be available in good numbers or should be replenished in more quantity) than dying,when it comes to bosses in Souls like games.[/b]
[b] -Bad Port :-[/b]While,I thank the devs to bring this awesome game to Steam with better graphics,I also didnt like the port,which is really bad. Even using GTX 1660Ti,12 GB RAM,Core i5 9th Gen processor,the game had lagging issues,stutters,dark screen issues,force close issues and so on. It never happened at all times,but still they were significant.
[b]-NG+n :-[/b]Bosses were already tanky and hard hitting;in addition to that,now,in the new game ++ and so on,the debuffs wont work completely,as the bosses develop some kind of resistance to it.This makes the fight boring as hell.",1570372870,1572617423,True,17,0,0.534782290458679199,0,True,False,False

In terms of exploration it's not on par with Dark Souls, but it's still very rewarding in it'
s level design and the secrets you can find (level with hub world, no connection between areas).
The combat system is one of the best I've ever played, but I still like Darks Souls system a little better. I prefer a more tactical combat systems like the one in Dark Souls, where it's not about pressing the right button combination, but about timing and knowledge about the enemies attack pattern. I think this combat system is in between Dark Souls and something like DMC. On the one Hand you have to know the enemies pattern and you have to be tactical with your timing, but on the other Hand there are ""skills"" (button combination) with long animations and iframes. I think for most people this will be a good match up, in point of combat system and for people who like Dark Souls and DMC, this might be the holy grail.
Do not buy it for story though, because although the story is somewhat interessting, the presentation is on NES Level and only happens after a mission in text form. And one of the biggest problems for westerners might be the names, they're so long and unfamiliar I can't remember them except for William, Hanzo and Tome and some historicaly important persons, I already knew.",1572601702,1572601702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Going a little bit deeper though, coming to this after a burnout on the souls series having spent more than 2000 hours in the trilogy (I may or may not have a problem controlling myself), this was a very different and pleasant challenge, and I am gonna say it right now, this game felt harder than souls, it was faster, you took more damage than ever, where even basic mob would one shot and you really needed to play smart (No more R1 spam against the PvE). And while this has some similarities to souls, namely being hard and losing your stuff permanently if you cannot retrieve it after death, that is about it. Everything else is completely different, the build matters, equipment matters and your skill really does matter. Now that we have that out of the way.

Best parts of the game, the combat, dear lord, that smooth combat. Despite have a limited group of weapons, the sheer number of over the top and flashy skills brings more variety than any other RPG.
The level designs were very good and greatly balanced. The character and enemy design was quite outstanding and helped in creating a very intense and fitting atmosphere.
Lastly, people seem to forget that there is an actual plot in this game and it is done quite well, taking real life historical characters and building something out of it that works cannot be easy but they have executed it wonderfully. Overall, i would rate this game, 9.7 out of 10, if you like the challenge of souls and continuous game play of diablo, this game is for you.

Now coming to what could have been better, firstly the online, while it is decently active, there is a lot problems with the net code, lag can be horrendous, even when playing with a friend in close vicinity where both of us have fiber.
Second - They could have done something more with the enemy variety. This is a personal gripe, team ninja is not really at fault, nobody twisted my arm to play this for 600 plus hours but when you give players the opportunity and challenge to get to the highest difficulty on NG+4, there will be people who get there and the feeling of tedium can get immense. These are very minor rants that most people probably don't even experience.

Interesting as it is, and a nice job from Koei Tecmo, but far from perfect. The stage-based design seemed a bit cheap, specially since ""secret stages"" reused the exact same stages in exchange for useless rewards. And I don't get it when games use random drops as the main way of getting your equipment. It's awful, and destroys the player's hope of finding some iseful reward for opening that chest hidden behind a miniboss and his minions, or the one behind the mimic wall, or the one at the end of a winding path beneath the waterfall.

+ Fantastic fast-paced and punishing gameplay. There are different weapons and tools to experiment and play around, which is pretty cool. The level grind isn't so bad, and if you're good enough you can even skip it.
+ Level design highly encourages exploration.
+ Co-op is fun too.

Cons:
- Very lackluster story. TeamNinja tried to tell the history of the Japanese period of the Warring States, but with mythical/fantasy elements like the yokai (Japanese folklore monsters), which is pretty cool. However, the writing is just passable, most characters are bland and almost forgettable, including your contact man Hanzo Hattori and the supposed-to-be waifu Okatsu. Many are explained through illustrated expositions. which is understandable considering how many important figures there were during that period. I just wish TeamNinja tried to focus on the few instead of bringing everyone in and giving none any depth. As a result, the story feels like a means to an end, not the end itself. If you've already known about the Sengoku period, you'll have a better time enjoying the story than other people who haven't.
- Repetitive music. It's good, but there isn't a lot of variety. I'm just kinda tired of hearing the same music for every boss fight. Really isn't helping with how unmemorable the bosses are as characters (the fights themselves were interesting though)
- Enemies are not highly varied.
- There are sometimes performance drops in highly densed areas, luckily there's only the snowing castle and the underground catacomb that has this during solo playthrough. During coop however, they happen way more often.

Verdict: It's a hard pass for me, even with the cons I find it difficult not to recommend this game to an action fan. Perhaps it's worth it at discounts.",1569656257,1569656257,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

positives:

- awesome combat. even better than soulsborne series. can't recommend more.
- story is getting more and more interesting as game advances. i am curious to see the end of story.
- diablo style loot and progression which makes game even more addictive. 
- very nice weapon and armor variety
- ok  ish soundtrack. (personal taste)
- good boss fight ( not at soulsborne level but still executes very well)
- keyboard & mouse control is really good. i have no problem whatsoever.

mehs: 

- meh level desing. nothing spectacular but doesnt fail either.
- meh enemy variety. once u kill a boss u will see him/her be a mini boss later stages.
- ui gets time to get used to. not the most brilliant ui ever.

negatives:

- some difficulty spikes especially early game. forces player to play gitgud or grind and level up
- end game and ng+ mobs can one shot u. so u must even more git gud.
- dark theme and enviroment gets boring after a while. i miss sunny but scary dark souls maps.

overall: 

game is 7/10 is easily. if u like soulslike and diablolike games it is 9/10.

1/Story wise, it's straight to the point, unlike souls game where you have to figure it out, it's also kinda cheesy

2/ Gameplay: 

My NG run, I play like playing DS, means I mainly use light+heavy attack, sometimes parry if I can. But bois, you're supposed to use skills in this game. Yes, this game has skill tree beside the stat tree. 

Also, unlike Dark Souls where you can find most of the items in fixed locations with fixed stats (yeah, some items are dropped only, but they're only dropped from a specific enemy thus easy to farm), this game itemization is like Diablo,yes, Diablo, not Grim Dawn, they don't have fixed stat, some of them have one special stat and the rest is random. That means you have to farm and pray to RNGesus not to just get the piece of iteam that you want, but to get the piece that you want with a perfect roll. This is the reason I don't like this game as much as Dark Souls, because grinding is not my cup of tea, it's painful.

One more thing, in Dark Souls, each weapon has its own moveset, yes, some of them are worthless, but still, they feel unique. This game however, has only 5 types of weapon and all the weapons you found in a same category will have the same moveset,same skills. 

3/ The setting

Well, it's japanese, if you like Japan, you're gonna like it. The world is small compare to Souls games, some area feels like a maze, which is bullshit, especially the first map, it's easy to be lost and waste your time.

4/Boss

Boss is hard, but you won't have the epic feeling as with Souls game, the Boss area is also kinda small.

Shallow combat -> Seven weapons, three styles per weapon, light and heavy attack make 7*3*2 = 42 combos. Add three ranged weapons, special skills for ever weapon, throwables, spirit mode , ki pulse ... and you get a great combat system.

Tons of loot -> True. You can easily ignore it and only pick up rare items though. 

Bad boss design -> Depends. Some are great, some not so much, just as in every game. So far, I enjoyed the bosses in Nioh more than in Dark souls, even though it should be noted that Dark Souls bosses are more epic and from what I saw so far have more attacks. Nioh boss fights feel fairer though, since you can see and deplete their stamina.

Port -> I had two total game freezes so far, apart from that it runs flawless

Story -> Easy to follow, and based on real people. Lots of cut scenes.

Combat - very satysfying (best part of game)

Optimalization was ok although game crashed few times for me.

First of all, let's define what Nioh is. Most people consider or label this game as an 'RPG', but it's RPG elements aren't actually very deep. It is an action-RPG that has *extremely* satisfying combat, featuring 7 different weapons all with entirely different playstyles and movesets and an array of 3 different ranged weapons and Ninjutsu & Onmyo (Magic) characteristics.

Gameplay

Nioh, first of all, is a 'gameplay centered/gameplay focus' game, it relegates alot of things to the side but it does not make the game entirely and only about the gameplay. Nioh in my opinion offers the best action-focused combat that is still in the ""Action"" territory and hasn't reached the ""Hack N' Slash"" territory I've ever played yet. It is fast paced but as I iterated earlier it is not hack-and-slash fast. So it has this pacing & speed that are extremely satisfying that you can keep track of everything going on and elaborately carry out attacks, movements or skills instead of buttonmash them, and tactics & thinking actually pay off.

As I said before, the game features 7 different weapons; Katana, Dual-Katanas, Tonfa, Spears, Odachi, Axe and and Kusarigama. Each weapon has a unique tree of weapon arts, skills and movements. With each of these weapons, there are 3 stances, each stance has it's own advantages, shortcomings and specialties. The stances are 'High stance', 'Middle Stance', 'Low Stance'. The stances differ significantly from weapon to weapon, but generally high stance usually has short but slow-winded and hard-hitting combos, in this stance you can only roll out of attacks, middle-stance has slightly faster but less damaging movesets and a slightly faster dodge animation that starts with a skip instead of a roll. The low stance has, generally, very fast attacks in long combo chains, the dodging animation changes entirely in some weapons to a 'twirl' instead of a skip or a roll, it offers alot of agility and speed at the cost of damage. I personally always play my Katana with high stance but many other people can find home with a different playstyle.

The game also offers 3 secondary ranged weapons with actually fun, good ranged fighting with good hitboxes on enemies, enabling headshots or critical shots on some enemies, the weapons are; Bow, Matchlock gun powder arm, and a hand-cannon. The bow offers the highest speed, easiest use, fastest animations & reload, highest amount of ammo, but lower damage. The matchlock offers hard-hitting projectiles with a slightly slower reload animation, the hand-cannon has limited ammunition but hits very hard. Infact it's a viable strategy to use it against bosses between their attacks. Each ranged weapon has two types of ammunition.


Story

The story of Nioh is about an Irish sailor named William and his guardian spirit 'Saoirse', who is imprisoned in the dreadful tower of London, you escape from your cell and make your way through the tower before the game's main apparent antagonist; Kelley, sends his executioner to kill you on top of the battlements, while he steals and makes away with your guardian spirit; Saoirse. William from there embarks on a journey to recover his guardian spirit and defeat Kelley. The main antagonist, Kelley, seeks to elevate England to greatness with the help of 'Amrita' stones, these stones are dangerous and have capability to open portals to the 'Yokai' realm. Kelley seeks to weaponise these stones and the consequences of using them, he travels to Japan, a land rich with these stones, William sets off in pursuit to recover his guardian spirit. There, William there is intercepted by Hanzo Hattori, a former Kuroda spy working for Tokugawa Ieyasu, he convinces William that Kelley is their common enemy, and that Ieyasu Tokugawa also seeks to bring peace to the land and drive the demons from the world back to their realm and end the use of Amrita. William gets caught up in the Sengukou era conflicts of Japan, which at the time were approaching the grand battle at Sekigahara and Ieyasu's unification of Japan. 

It would be later revealed, in a plot-twist, that Kelley turned out to be a mere henchman, a shadow of a man one could say. The real villain and antagonist is John Dee. He resides in the very same castle you escaped from in the beginning, he captured a man named Kelley and conducted experiments on him with the use of Amrita, in the process he cloned him many times and uses him. The antagonist, horribly mutated by the Amrita himself, climactically fights William in the tower of London. John Dee, who was obsessed with the ability to see everything and miss nothing, is blinded by William, who slashes both his eyes, leaving him blind. The main game's story ends there, from there you can play the amazing DLC's, where William returns to Japan at the behest of Hanzo to help chase down a Spanish agent who attempts to woo several lords in Japan with the promises of Amrita, in an attempt to shatter a peace that is still in the crib achieved by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who has now become an aging old man in 1624-25. The events of the DLC take you through the Toyotomi insurrection and the subsequent siege of Osaka in 1625.

Performance

While being a Koei port, the port surprisingly runs very well and even has incorporated Nvidia Ansel support, which is amazing. The game is locked at 60 FPS, and runs well in my machine. There are dips in framerate when you break through too many items and create lots of dust, though. The loading times are ok. There is the occasional annoying CTD but I've encountered only a handful during the game. 

Lore and Artistic & Design directions

This is, in my opinion along with the gameplay & characters, is one of Nioh's strongest points and one of my absolute favourite things about the game. Nioh's enemies and fictional fantasy characters are so cool and amazing for one important reason; they are ALL sourced from real Japanese folklore and mythology. They are all based on legends, myths, superstitions and fiction writing. And all of them have been deployed in their own very unique iterations in the game, some are hostile (Fiends, Oni & one-eyed variations, Onyudo Monks which are basically giant demonic buddhist monks, Flying bolts which are faceless flying succubi, Nurikabe that are demons that pretend to be walls/solid surfaces that you can find around the game and either fight or peacefully interact with, Kodamas that are friendly little spirits that aid and guide you, etc) though these enemies are somewhat limited and repeat in the game frequently but I did not feel that got in the way of the game in my experience. The design of many levels is also great and historically accurate. Shigisan castle being among my favourites as well as Sanada-Maru from the bloodshed's end DLC. The design of weapons, armour, the variations of all the equipment and swords and other weapons are also amazing and great. The wardrobe in this game is very big, and sets and armour pieces all possess different stats and set-bonuses but the great thing is that Nioh's blacksmith & shop owner; Senji Tome and her grandfather Muaramasa (whom you rescue in an optional mission) can refashion your armour to different looks, allowing you to have the stats you want with the fashion you want. They can also do this with weapons so if you got a plain-looking Sozasa Monji sword, you can refashion it to look like the extremely aesthetic Sohya Tsurugi. Or alternatively you can refashion it to a wooden practice sword that hits like a truck, and enjoy slapping enemies to death with the toughest piece of wood that ever existed.

Verdict

Nioh is an amazing Action RPG game with amazing gameplay, it is honestly one of the best action RPG's I ever played. And I heartily recommend it. But you have to know what you're looking for before getting this game, this is, as I said before, a gameplay-focused experience.

485510,55120984,76561198105768426,78,2,977,0,977,1567626901,"Pros:
- Graphics, settings and overall surroundings are beautifully crafted and pull you in right away
- Complex yet intriguing crafting system 
- Versatile combat system featuring three basic styles combined with a huge variety of weapons 
- Opponents are tough but never unfair, learning to read their stances and preferred weaponry and adapting accordingly, really 
  makes a difference
- Some nice trivia for people who enjoy Japanese folklore

Cons:
- Repetitive: Every time you die - and I mean EVERY SINGLE TIME- and you will die a lot, all opponents respawn, every single 
  one, respawns. This really doesn't make a lot of sense story-wise.
- Your inventory gets swamped with loads of loot, most of which doesn't have really useful applications.
- Sometimes there are deathtraps, which seem highly arbitrary -just the developer basically showing you the middle finger.

Summary:
Nioh could have been a really compelling title but the repetitive nature of the game makes sure, the game very quickly feels unrewarding and more like a onerous chore. I spent 16 hours on the game, most of that slowly grinding my way through level 1. After having had a 4-6 hour try and die run through level 2, having overcome an annoying opponent guarding a narrow passage with a lethal drop to my right, I was just pushed over said precipice by a bunch of bats coming out of a cave. That was the point I where I decided to uninstall the game and never pick it up again, unless the developers decide to do something about unnecessary respawn and arbitrary deathtraps.

Now longer explanation:

First of all, my problem wasn't with the gameplay, story or anything that game makes a game. This might be a great game, rich in story and very playable, but all my problems were technical in nature. This is just another example of retard developer that doesn't understand that consoles and PC are not the same thing. Here's why:

1. strike: game wouldn't launch and crashed every time after Koei(or whatever) logo appeared. To bypass this, I had to fiddle with the nvidia driver just to start this game. This took me around half an hour searching around internet for a solution.

2. strike: Settings for game are 30 or 60 fps and are heavily favoring console settings which means you can only chose presets defined by the developer. Anisotropic filtering? Anti-alising? Uncapped frame rate? Forget about those.

3. strike: one would think Escape button takes you one step back or cancel a command, but not in this game. It took me 2 Alt+F4's and mashing around keyboard to find that ""Q"" button is the new ""Esc"" button. Silly me, it was so obvious.

4. strike: All the prompts at the bottom of the screen have controller buttons. Your mouse has no power here! Good luck figuring out what to press in the heap of the battle. Good thing this isn't a highly dynamic game...oh, wait...

Nioh is a loot based classic rpg that takes heavy inspiration from Dark Souls, emphasising quantity over quality for the most part. It is an amazing game with a truly unique combat system that offers hundreds of hours of content, but be prepared to battle through an impenetrable gearing/looting/inventory system without a useful wiki. 

[List]
[*]Be warned that the port is not reliable. The game will randomly crash, drop frames in particle heavy areas (snow and rain), and suffer memory leaks on certain levels.
[*]Take a good look at the requirements, if you're not comfortably above the recommended specs I would advise caution. 
[*]I would also heavily recommend a controller, the combat does not translate very well to a keyboard unless you're very committed or stubborn.
[*]The file size is 70-75GB, 58-60GB when compressed.[/list]

[b] What am I getting into here?[/b]

Nioh takes a level based approach to Dark Souls, separating the game into bite sized missions that usually end with a boss. During the levels you'll be fighting enemies from a heavily recycled pool and optional revenants (that marked where another player or npc died). You'll be showered with a lot of loot, ranging from weapons and armour to smithing materials and consumables, all of which come in different rarities with randomised special bonuses. In between missions you'll be sorting out your cluttered inventory and wondering how to optimise your build. As you gain experience you'll be able to learn new abilities, attacks and spells, greatly expanding an already rich combat system.

[b] How hard is it?[/b]

It depends. Like Dark Souls you'll lose built up experience upon death if you don't spend it, and levelling is generally much more grindy in this game. Enemies in general hit very hard, however the difference between light and heavy armour can make your health go significantly further here. Spells and guardian spirits can prevent your death, whilst also allowing an incredible amount of cheese for getting past infuriating bosses. All bosses have a weakness, and if you commit to learning them you can always beat them (or cheese them if you cannot). Nioh is not a game where you can spam attack to win, you'll have to be patient and know the limits of your weapons. Also, you'll need to start blocking, it's actually useful in this game.

[b] What's the combat like?[/b]

Complex. You've got your standard strong attack and quick attack, blocking and rolling/dashing, and a standardised moveset for each weapon. However, each weapon also has three stances, of which each has a different move set. In between combos you'll need to time a 'Ki Pulse', which also allows you to gain back spent Ki (stamina), change stance, change weapon or transition to another combo, it's fantastic to learn. As you progress through the game you'll gain more moves for each weapon that activate off new prompts. Each of the 7 weapons are extremely unique and worth a playthrough each.

[b] What's the story like?[/b]

Hard to keep track of to be honest. Those who are clued into Japanese history and folklore will probably have a much better time following the story, which is based off feudal Japan and its path to peace. The cutscenes are very well made, they're cheesy, but interesting and fun to watch. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, and like many other Japanese games it knows how to clown around and be fun, despite having serious undertones. If you find yourself drawn into the story, every item, enemy, character, spirit and event has a detailed description to help you immerse yourself should you wish.

[b] What's the music like?[/b]

Very good, one of Nioh's greatest boons. If you're doubting picking up the game, give the OST a listen on Youtube.

[b] Endgame content [/b]

It's almost endless, a true paradise for perfections. There are many stages of NG+ that provide new items and item rarities. You can very easily respec, allowing you to change your build in each NG as you discover more items. For the heavily invested, there is an infinite dungeon crawler unlocked after completing the game.

[b] The Wiki [/b]

PROS: 
+ Difficulty – I must say Nioh difficulty is just right for me – very challenging but possible to overcome any challenge by adjusting your equipment, strategy style or by learning how to play better. It may be frustrating at times when you lose all your level progress due to falling off the cliff or stung to death by undead spearman (and then died again off same exact thing without picking up you avatar:D) [Sekiro difficulty is a joke, die to a boss 50 times to learn his moveset to dodge well – you cannot adjust anything it is just the matter to dodge in right time and to know each bosses animations]
+ Full of Lore and great areas [Ok Sekiro was as good or even better here]
+ Loads of Different play styles; weapons etc. [Versus just one in Sekiro (+ prosthetics but 90% of them are situational and mostly useless)]
+ Bosses are well done and very challenging [Bosses in Sekiro are also well done but you only have one option how to defeat them and no matter what your play style you think is or what you are good at you still need to follow Devs only and true strategy]
+ Lots of things to do between the missions; some extra missions a lot of collectibles  [in Sekiro you do not have much to do other that follow the side quests/main story line; die to bosses and visit few merchants that are available]
+ Coop option feels and is great [Sekiro has no Co-op as it would have been too easy to just die to boss 10 times in coop – it is better to die 60 times on your own]

CONS:
-	Childish avatars from Anime flying around you or hot anime girls to look at [Ok, Sekiro is much more serious game in this regards]
-	Story – not very engaging but not entirely terrible [Okay, Sekiro had a very good story that I wanted to follow and understand]
-	Main Protagonist William – nothing to him really feels like playing a random guy with a sword who looks like beefed Witcher [Sekiro did not feel that special or interesting but there was much more to him that to William]


All in all Nioh is a great game that I enjoy more than Sekiro and less than Dark Souls. It has loads of things to do and loads to offer. I know I should not be comparing it to Sekiro but I just felt like doing it. These are two different games – they just feel similar on surface due to Japanese/ninja/shinobi setting but if you look closer at them, Sekiro is a title with more serious story and despite obvious fantasy setting it is set in some real time-frames of Japan whereas Nioh is a fantasy game that takes all its Ninja/Sekiro settings from animes.",1567591454,1567591561,True,5,0,0.478760004043579102,0,True,False,False

In actuality I think Nioh is a 29.99€ price game, even from launch, especially if you played it from launch, as it takes inspiration from From Software's soulsborne games in terms of gameplay, looting from Borderlands, and armor sets from MMORPGs such as Guild Wars 2 / World of Warcraft, and doing them rather... decent.

Decent because Nioh seems to lack focus on what it wants its players to focus on, gameplay, loot, or having the right set? Nioh isn't clear in any of these 3, nor is it any clear about describing the stats on weapons, armor, or trinkets, to such an extend that it isn't even borderline helpful. 

Nioh isn't clear about what it want for its players, as it's more focused about japanese yokais, and ""difficulty"" of enemies... by ""difficulty"" as tossing two bosses you've fought before as... ""end game"" content which essentially just means it's RNG about when you can attack, and not use your parrying for the most parts because...  fuck actual skill. 

Nioh doesn't take its balancing to a competent threshold either, and either makes them decent, bland, or just stupidly powerful against certain enemies, like Odachi for the most part being nigh perfect against revenants and normal enemies due to its range, damage, and ki damage (stamina) so you can finish them. Or axes just basically break enemy ki with nearly  no challenge. I personally found sword / dual swords to be most difficult to use due to their range and low ki break (except when using certain ki breaking talents of course).

As for the story... it's nothing memorable, just a flick of history with added sugar (being yokai), and the such... Overall, I'd say the first half of Nioh is great, and the second half is basically the first half of Nioh, so nothing much, with the exception of story and some few new bosses...",1567110579,1567110579,False,3,0,0.478924930095672607,0,True,False,False

-Basic but well designed game around fantasy about yokais
-Versatiliy of weapons (7 primary weapons going from slow hard blows to fast mosquito hits) and some spells/objects to choose to main something or going hybrid, which if you end up enjoying it, you have lots freedom to try different combos between weapons and spells
-Different approach in situations, not every enemy will have to be just a smashing button or endurance test encounter or using always the same tactic.
-Combat is satisfying, it can be pretty fast paced sometimes, and as i mentioned, the versatility of weapons and its skills lets you try different combos you wanna try, and you have some sort of berserk mode that can be activated
-While the story and campaign can be short, it isnt that bad, you still got the choice to do a new game, or aid people randomly in blind coop

[b]But what is possibly the awful or not so enjoyable part of this game?[/b]
-Inflated difficulty problems, specially for beginners, this game can be really easy or really hard, what makes it ""difficult"" is that the first missions can be easy, but the latter can be hard due to your level difference between the mission and your character, (no, not because there is a difficulty curve really, there are missions that become also easy on the late game) the higher stats of the high level monsters makes it difficult for you to advance no matter how good you are, you will end up grinding previous missions for leveling up to not suffer their one kill blows and finish sooner their inflated life points for how low your damage is
-Maybe it is just me but possibly some mundane grinding, for leveling up and for objects, but mainly getting the right gear, you'll end up changing the gear constantly the more you go forward until late late +new game, but couldnt be too bad for those who are patient with grinding, doesnt feel too harsh than other games.
-Random PVP is dead, if you ever find one match, hope it is not one player that doesnt spam omnyo mage spells and ruins the fun
-I couldn't play with my friend side to side, not sure if it was just me, but we tried many times to get to work that feature of the game, and we ended up using the random visitant summoning, which has the risk of summoning another player that is not your friend and not synchronise the checkpoint once either of the player dies.
-Multiplayer community is semi active, it can be a problem to wait too long for a player to help you, most people are active on weekend, so during another day, dont hope too much for help, or on higher levels, but never hurts to give it a try to summon a player to help you

Farming; there's definetily no farming or grinding if you just do the normal difficulty. If you go up to the higher difficulties you just need to read some guides to understand you can avoid farming all the way up to the last difficulty.
The loot system is absolutely no hinder to the normal game and still relies purely on skill and some knowledge about the mechanics. Once you get the hang of the stance system, switching every few seconds and focus on dex/magic/spirit you'll see that it's all about understanding the underlying mechanics and using them, instead of the whine and cheese about loot.
Yeah the enemies are rehashed too often. You get over it or you don't, there's no middle ground there.
Instead of whining, use that time to learn the meta and the stances. You'll see there's an awesome game with a lot of interesting mechanics and deep gameplay to master.

In the beginning I wrote a negative review because the beginning of the game is way too hard for a beginner, and the tutorials suck. The default control scheme did not work for me, I had to swap a few commands until I found a control scheme that semi-made sense. Early boss Hino-Enma is way too hard for level 3, took me like 50 tries and I still don't really know how to dodge that spin kick. 

Once you get past level 3 this game becomes pretty enjoyable. Graphics definitely have that AAA look, controls are good once you find what works for you. Killing revenants in online mode provides tons of opportunities to gear-up quick. Loot table has lots of variation which adds to replay value.

In short this game scales with your intelligence/attention span/ingenuity. I've seen people able to continuously attack by using multiple minor mechanics together. These can be regaining Ki (stamina) while attacking enemies, which is boosted by changing your combat stance instead of regaining Ki. So you can attack attack attack, swap stance, get more Ki back than normal, repeat. You can change your stances AND weapons on the fly (2 melee + 2 ranged).


Pros:
Fluid combat
Varied weapon choices
3 stances per weapon
Varied skills
Spells
Ninjutsu
Spirit posession
Living Weapon
Lots of enemy types
Fun mechanics
You gotta use your brain


Cons:
Some enemies have too fast animations. Like one boss I dislike. After I start to use my item, she starts her animation, flies into the air, starts her attack animation, sends a projectile to me and hits me with that projectile before my item has been used, interrupting the item use. This feels really cheap when it happens.

Enemies moving in strange ways, like an ogre being knocked to his knees and turning in place while locked on to you. This makes it look like he should be getting a wicked carpet burn on his knees, but nope.

Griefers like to join missions, AFK and leave to waste your time. It's sad that people have this little to do.

Some enemies should seriously be interrupted with some of my stronger attacks, but they don't.

I should seriously not be interrupted when doing some of my stronger combos, but I am.

Upgrading gear to a higher level is far too expensive.



What I love:
The yoki
The music
The animations
Exploring
Sneaking

1) Atmosphere. Even with the raging civil war and demonic infestation, in-game Japan is nowhere close to the despairing state of Boletaria/Londor/Drangleic/Lothric. 

2) Story. You are not here to save or destroy the world. Tbh, I have no idea what are we looking for.

3) Gameplay. It's somewhat better than BloodSouls - your character can kick ass even better than the Chosen One from Bloodborne/DS3 - but some of mechanics are overcomplicated for reasons unknown. For example, enemies drop A LOT of loot, so after every mission you have to scroll through it to equip better gear. Believe me - don't ignore gear upgrades. Equip the best, dump the rest for souls or cash.

4) Translation. If you speak japanese - good for you. If you don't - turn on subtitles, because ""someone"" didn't bother to hire additional english-speaking actors. Some of the characters are dubbed, some are not and several don't have the voice at all. It's like the publisher suddenly ran out of money. Can't say about other major languages - German, Italian, French, Russian, etc. Maybe these were executed better.

5) Reusing game assets over and over. FromSoftware is known for reskinning bosses and even one location during our BloodSouls journey. Team Ninja, however, performed this on a massive scale. Same maps, same bosses, not many variations of standard enemies too.

6) Online. Invasions don't exist here - yay! - however you still can enjoy the jolly cooperation in several modes. Well, try at least. Dark Souls 2:SoTFS edition(2014) and Dark Souls 3(2016) are very much alive several years after their release. Nioh is almost as dead as Dark Souls Remastered. Not because the game is bad, but because it requires you to sit still in the main location, while the game searches for matches. IMO, soapstone summoning is far better.

The game is not bad, it's different. Don't blindly follow ""Souls-like"" tag, don't expect to see Dark Souls 4. It's a decent follower, but not the original franchise itself.",1565080933,1565080933,True,11,2,0.55941927433013916,0,True,False,False

This game and the Souls games have the absolute minimum in common, the biggest difference being that this game is everything Souls games should have tried to become, it is simply better in every way, aside from the co-op being restricted to 2 players, I believe 3 in the Abyss at end game. But that is just my hypocritical side talking, they really can't be compared legitimately due to how drastically different the games are, just know you won't find a Soul-like casual experience here, this game will bend you over and punish you if you try to treat it like one. If that's all it takes and all you're looking for, I can TLDR it and say, this is worth every penny AND it still would feel like you're cheating someone out of deserved cash buying it at full price.

- The combat is outstanding, the variety is huge.
- The depth is intimidating, but fully understanding and utilizing that immense depth is not required to beat the game. If you want to ""complete"" it, it certainly is though.
- A low skill floor allowing for newbies to not feel overwhelmed by a learning curve but an astoundingly high ceiling for those that really want to just get good.
- Speaking of learning curves, the game does a solid job of easing you into all of the mechanics over time. Some things could use more explanation up front, but all the explanation you need is available in game if you just ask NPCs and look at the menus.
- Content-wise there is more than enough to keep you busy for 100-300+ hours if you are deep into it, and even if you just want to play and beat the stories there is still well over 40+ hours of gameplay.
- Although the Co-op is restricted to just 2 people, there are two different modes of Co-op available, and they are very, very, different experiences from one another, which adds to just how good it feels to play this game with a friend.
- Even on return visits to the same maps/levels for different missions, things change plenty to keep it fresh each time, on top of the previous differences of solo play and the two separate co-op play styles mentioned previously.
- The NG+ playthroughs are also rather different consistently through the repeated cycles of increasing difficulty as new mechanics and even attacks are added to enemies.
- The scaling of the gear will also keep you invested with new, better (both statistically and in many cases visually) equipment. No issues like Souls games where you get that one weapon and that one set-up of gear and never change it again, but if you put your mind to you, you CAN keep the same gear, which leads to...
- Transmog system so you can look gud before you git gud, as well as while you git gud. Along with a system to allow you to level up your favorite gear instead of solely relying on random drops.
- A system that allows you to, with application of learned knowledge as you play, change the bonuses and stats on your gear to customize it to your play style.
- Speaking of, the play styles abound as one would expect. Some do no become viable until a certain point in the game, but once you're there you can go nuts.
- Finally, the general visual appearance of the game world, levels, maps, enemies, weapons, armor, characters, ect... are amazing.

Side Note: There is PvP and I've heard it is decent, but I don't touch that trash in any Souls-like games, nor this game so I cannot give you an accurate idea of what it is like. Though I can say, you can get all of the PvP rewards without ever fighting a real player, which is fantastic.

It has typical Dark Souls-stuff like stamina regeneration, fast time to die, and some of the lore hidden in its items. But what's unique to Nioh doesn't work well with Dark Souls mechanics: one of which being the enemy behavior, the enemies in Nioh are too relentless for a game that has stamina management making anything other than 1 on 1 fights stressful. Unlike Dark Souls once you run out of stamina then the character takes a breather and sits idle so on gang bang fights there's not much of an option other than just back pedaling, you shouldn't even block because of the constant attacks you'll receive thus depleting your stamina. And with how fast the enemies attack, all I ever really thought was ""there really shouldn't be a stamina meter because this feels more Ninja Gaiden than Dark Souls"". There are also ninjutsus and magic to somewhat 'help', but they have casting time and in a 2 on 1 boss fight(2 bosses vs you) wherein every boss a long-range attack, do you really think it's worth it to take the hit in a fast time to die game? The game also has a false sense of progression, this game is level-based so main missions and side missions are separate. A lot of the bosses you fight are recycled from one another(what appears on main missions will appear on side missions, no variety) and the loot obtained are just loot with different numbers(looks the same but only has better numbers when comparing weapons and armor from different levels)

Let's get down to the actual game play though: 

This game starts off real strong. Gives you cool character customization options and fast, frenetic game play, but then... you actually face the first real boss and it's literally a health sponge that two shots you. 

If you optimize for damage, you will still literally spend 10+ minutes killing this thing. There are no tricks, no amount of skill that can shorten the length of this fight and if there is one thing I have learned getting older is that there's no point in doing something unless it's fun when it comes to games. 

The combat is, for the most part, very fluid. It is like dark souls with added fluidity, stances and good character customization. In short, it's just like dark souls, but with more combo moves and depth that you can learn.  

Not to mention the diablo loot system, which I actually enjoyed. 

Seriously, a boss with 2-3 moves where you dodge always at exactly the same time, or it two-three shots you.. and you have to repeat this over a 10 minute interval. 

Get more creative, or better yet get more talent behind the boss design.

The game is brutally repetitive, will throw the same levels and same enemies at you, the story is badly written, and the game is full of huge design flaws. Every bloody time it was about to get interesting the game immediattely ruined it big time with something new to piss you off.
 There supposed to be a deep looting system, that is useless, since you can summon dead player phantoms controlled by the AI that are easy to kill and will drop way better gear than you can find in the whole map. Team ninja made sure to borrow every idea from the soulsborn series that were bad. Stupid spinning wheele enemies? check. 0 explanation on the game core systems ? check. Rather than trying to create new harder enemies they just threw more at you, later on even doing double boss fights (ohh yeah, not new, but reused bosses, with the same AI, wich means stunlock and overlapping onehit attacks..)

Too bad the fighting is still either boring or just shit and rarely gets into a good flow. 

The enemies energy meter is basically just a why to tell when they re close to being staggered, something which i find needlessly complicated if you couldve just added a true sense of weight to the weapons instead of an energy meter which decides when an enemy is staggered and when not

The games atmosphere feels similar to a museum where you see the occasional thing that peaks your interest for a very short time. 

I dont understand what the point of all the loot is. 

Level design is forgetable.

I realised the games story was really shit when (spoiler alert) the useless cat dies with which i barely had any conversation and the game tries to give me the ""feels"". Besides that every character i meet seems to have less personality than a mannequin. 

Overall
Unless u like diablo, borderlands and want a ""souls like"" experience (which you wont have btw because this game merely copies the difficulty and rpg quality) then go ahead. Ill continue playing because i want my moneys worth since i cant refund it.

To all the fans saying the game is pretty:

The bosses are HARD. I had to summon a friend in for all of them, that allow summons. 

I like the loot and blacksmith system. You can switch out attributes you don't need for ones that you do want. Which just adds good synergy support for your build. It took me while to learn how to maximize gear, with crafting. But now creating a build isn't just about the stats and skills, but also about gear that has attribute that suit your build. Min, maxing stats is something I like about rpg games and Nioh takes it to the next level. You are not so at the mercy of RNG to find the weapons with stats that suits your build. 

I find games like Dark Souls you tend to create a build around a small group of special weapons you can get in game. However in Nioh you can create a weapon around your build. Oh you can also change attributes on armour. All that opportunity for synergy. Better get the spread sheet out.

This game is definitely in the Souls genre, but the controls feel really... stiff? My character could be a massless cube moving around the screen and it wouldn't feel any different. My character had no sense of physics to him at all. It was a wholly unnatural sensation. 

Finally, early game enemies were able to stagger me with a single blow, and then finish me off with the second. This isn't a skill cap problem, this is a balance problem. If I slip up, even once, some low level peon can clip me with an axe, stagger me, and follow up with a single other blow to restart my session. This led to me playing a really annoying game of poke the bear where I simply stood outside their attack range and hit them with a spear then dashed away. 

The first boss was obnoxiously easy to beat, but there again was this problem of, get clipped once, die. What is the point of my healthbar here? Just make it like Pacman, one hit and you die. 

Once I got close to beating the first boss the game crashed. That's an instant strike 3 for a game with this level of difficulty (read: imbalance)

[b]Nioh[/b] is like Dark Souls, without all the bugs, BS, or bad game design; in a samurai costume.  Core gameplay is slick, but coop is poorly designed, and bosses make it literally unplayable. 

[h1]Reasons to Buy:[/h1]
+ Functional Dark Souls
+ Intense 1v1 samurai swordplay

[h1]Reasons to Bail:[/h1]
- Stat creep
- Coop is game breaking
- Bosses are unbeatable BS

[h1]Pro/Con Feature Nags:[/h1]
+ Dodge
+ Reload stamina
+ Collectible frogs
+ Multiple skill trees
+ Restockable items
+ Instanced coop loot
+ Fancy hair & cloth physics
+ Interesting lore and lite story
+ Impressive enemy pathfinding
+ Weapons show on your character
+ Controls properly mapped, and buttons match the HUD
+ 1v1 battles are engaging, interesting, intense tests of skill
+ Crisp lockon with a flawless camera and smooth movement
+ Lootables work as an interesting version of reverse breadcrumbs 
+ Storage lets you infintely collect items, and restock for adventures
+ Reponsive accurate movement.  You see a tiny log, you walk up tiny log, gg
+ Options for everything.  Targetting, HP display, graphic quality, rarity colors, nice
+ More usable equipment in the first 10 minutes than Dark Souls has in its entire series
+ Enemies make a sound when they agro, so you never take unfair damage from offscreen
+ Enemies generally can't knock you off ledges, it will trigger a stagger animation that you can roll out of
+ Can sheathe weapons, without negative impact on combat, and even do some special moves when sheathed
+ Weapon types and stances provide many playstyles, that can be quickly swapped between, and are used to add enemy variety
+ Good map design, rarely backtracking or dead ends, and intuitive teaching.  Basically the exact opposite of Dark Souls.  
+ Revenants (ghosts of dead players) are far better integrated than Dark Souls.  More interactive, better info on why they died, and you can 1v1 battle them for loot.  
+ Meaningful map progression.  Mini-Bosses don't respawn, loot only needs collecting once, collectible frogs, Revenants don't respawn, shortcuts open up further progression, instead of just loops back to where you've already been
+ Multiple ways to heal.  Enemies restore 100 HP on kill.  Shrines heal to full.  Elixirs restock at shrines, but can also be collected on the go.  Spells allow for multiple forms of regen.  Guardian ults can restore HP and/or make you invincible temporarily.  You can even get lifesteal stats on equipment, though its somewhat rare and not especially strong, maybe for different builds than mine.  

+- Transmog, but the UI for it is awful and without preview
+- Barber, but limited styles, and its the only customization
+- NPCs join you on some missions, which is great, but its rare
+- Can see objectives on the minimap, though not usually useful, if even visible
+- Corpse runs are handled much better than Dark Souls, but are still a pointless waste of time
+- ARPG style gear stats.  These would be better as 1off fully customizable perks, instead of small stackable % stat buffs
+- Maps are re-used for side missions, though they do have different starting locations, enemy & loot placements, and blocked paths
+- There are rarely insta-kills, though enemies can sometimes stunlock you to death, and the perk that's supposed to stop you from dying unless already critical is worthless
+- Hold O to open.  This makes sense on a few things, mission exits, revenants, but not on chests or doors.  Not sure if this is here to stop people from opening them during combat, or prevent overlapping item-pickup controls, but those shouldn't be an issue
+- Multiple tutorials.  The opening level tells you things on the fly, then theres an optional stiff tutorial, then the 2nd level tells you things on the fly again, then there's a dojo with even more stiff tutorials.  
+- Gameplay is designed purely for 1v1s.  The devs are actually aware of this (for once, unlike Dark Souls, and many others) and rarely puts you up against multiple enemies at once.  But when it does, the entire combat system falls apart, for multiple reasons.  

- Stat based
- Can't jump or climb
- Need PS+ to play online
- No option for foreign subtitles 
- Could do with an auto-loot option
- Can't animation cancel spells/items
- Can't fast travel between respawn points
- Game is stupidly dark at default brightness
- Yet another console ""exclusive"" now on PC
- Missions auto-end after 60 seconds in coop
- Switching targets when locked on rarely works
- When you aren't in combat, holes are insta-kills
- Many features locked behind ??? story progress
- Could do with an auto-lockon if you hit an enemy
- If the host dies in renta-coop, the entire game ends
- Matchmaking has no timers or estimated wait times
- Half the time, matchmaking fails to find a match and gives up
- Stat text doesn't fit in the weapon window, and scrolls unreadably
- There are 2 coop modes, rent-a-DPS and full fledged partner, neither works well
- Skill trees are a convoluted jumble of everything, impossible to find specific skills in
- Coop breaks progression and the metroidvania style shortcuts, because shrines don't exist
- Shrines are basically disabled in coop, which means no item refills, leveling, or checkpoints
- Coop balance completely destroys the game, basically makes coop AND singleplayer unplayable
- Practically no graphic settings on PC, FPS is locked at 60, and half the time can't maintain that on a 1070
- You have a limited number of revives in coop (which is better than the none in SP), but if you use too many, the entire mission fails
- Bosses are game breakingly difficult.  I'm surprised anyone even makes it past the first level without ragequit uninstalling, and it only gets worse
- Sprint being on X is problematic.  You can't control the camera when sprinting, can't lockon when sprinting, and can't easily sprint-attack.  Would have been better on L1 or R1, or just clicking in the left stick to toggle.  
- There is no warning you're about to enter a boss area, so you may end up losing a ton of Exp and/or going in with no restockable items.
- The minimap doesn't have an actual map layout on it, nor is there an actual map of any kind
- Abilities like Enemy Sense (which make things appear on the minimap) should be default features, not gear stats
- The armor weight system is still broken, not as bad as Dark Souls, but its still best to run around nearly naked for the mobility
- The revenant system breaks the loot economy.  Because you can essentially duplicate a player's gear by fighting their ghost, once one player gets a super good item, everyone in the game gets it.  
- Guardian Spirits are poorly integrated.  They don't join you as a combat pet, or really exist in any form.

In some ways I got what I expected especially in the base mechanics of death and souls (amrita). But the combat is completely different being fast paced and rewarding use of skills over just basic attacking. Every different weapon class invites different play styles and the supplementary magic or Ninjutsu add even more options. Combat just feels more fluid and varied than dark souls, but with that comes a learning curve as you learn to mix in skills, dodges, and ki pulses. If you get good at using them all together you'll find yourself fighting with the only pauses being to dodge an attack before throwing yourself back in. The gear system is a little annoying because you constantly have to choose higher level gear in order to keep enough damage to hurt enemies which means that if you get unlucky and a good weapon hasn't dropped from the style your currently running it can get interesting.

Overall, I'd suggest the game to anyone who enjoys fast paced fights and dark souls levels of difficulty and game style. I would suggest playing with a controller though, I play mouse and keyboard and it took me through the first 10 hours to figure out the key bindings, still mastering them if I'm honest.

I would say what is really lacking is that this game doesnt seem to have a Soul. It doesnt grab you and pull you into its world.  It looks ok, but it looks generic.  It sounds okay but if you put it all together, it is incohesive- some of the sounds don't support the atmosphere or the mood, I assume, they are trying to create.  Some of the added ""mechanics"" seem like it would be interesting at first glance, but its gimmicky.  Some of the ""options"" you get to choose to develop your weapon/skill set are merely just extensions of what a weapon move set would be in Dark Souls. So that last swing in a combo in Dark souls would be something you would have to spend points on to get. Some say additions like this makes the game more interesting, but I prefer the simplicity and prefer foregoing the illusion of player choice options to flesh out their weapon. Also, the constant diablo-like weapon grind and the lack of uniqueness really takes away from the pleasure of developing and upgrading a weapon.  Another negative is the constant grind for heals.  Its like they made the game ""difficult"" for the sake of making it difficult, but it seems rather obnoxious and senseless unlike Dark souls. I played through a good part of the game and I didn't find any of the bosses particularly difficult, although, at first like any boss, it takes getting used to.  Also I would say the bosses are pretty lame. The fight set up is poorly done and somewhat anti-climatic when all is said and done.  Frankly, it all felt like a chore. I ended up uninstalling the game without finishing it. I usually like to finish what I start, if its marginally good, but I just didnt want to do it.   I just didnt have a reason.

The weapons are cool, the combat is cool and the hitbox system feels just. I can whole heartedly recommend this game to most people, and especially to hack and slash fans. And people who love grinding.

That said its A-Tier for hack and slash. Definitely a head above most games, but not in the upper echelon. Its not genre defining though it certainly has some mechanics that were interesting. The game focuses too much on lategame grinding and gear mechanics while allowing the story to feel slightly disjointed. They had what could be called a fully fleshed out story. The way you launch missions and navigate what would otherwise be a ""central"" hub really disconnects you from the story. They tried to tie together all these different levels and areas but nothing really seems... connected. You'll get this... long mission, I think a few took me over an hour, maybe 2 when I first started, that'll immerse you in the journey and then you get yanked out of it and it feels like nothing has happened in the game world. Which is fine because at the end of the day the game wants you to repeat these levels and they serve that purpose very well. 

I also found the enemies, bosses and whatnot very enjoyable and challenging. The methodology for boss creation was sound. They all have hard to read sweeping attacks to prevent rushes but the core focus is on maintaining interesting and engaging mechanics that differentiate each boss.

A: Well yes, but no.

It's similar in that enemies hit hard and can be incredibly punishing but the mechanics are largely different.
Blocking shields you from all damage but uses more stamina based on how low it's parry stat is, as an example.
You also get even more mechanics once you hit NG+.
The levelling/building is far more in-depth with not only stats but skills across different weapons and ninjutsu and onmyo (magic), there's Diablo levels of loot, there's even the Badass Tokens from Borderlands here.

There doesn't seem to be very many level designs. One or two maps per region with ~5 regions but each mission grants blocks off or opens up different paths, usually starts you off in a different area of the map and has different enemy placements. I never felt like the maps were being recycled too much but do be aware that you will be playing the same map a few times when going through, particularly for side missions.

I've only just reached the ability to go into NG+ and I haven't touched the DLC yet or done all of the optional missions. Bosses also seem to have a chance to drop the recipes for their armour/weapons and also have rare materials for crafting, which gives some incentive to fight them multiple times.

The game is similar enough to Dark Souls and Bloodborne that you will likely enjoy it but also different enough and brings in a lot of ideas to keep it separate from that series. I whole heartedly recommend the game if you enjoy challenging ARPGs.",1562136866,1562136866,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Word of advice though, do NOT Play with low shadows. It will kill your FPS more than high shadows. So play with none, medium, or high shadows.",1562001547,1562001547,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GOOD :
• Its RPG mechanisms are great.
• The learning curve isn't as steep as some other ""soul-like"" games. Once you understand how to use the block, attacks and stances, it's get really good. Before you get the hand of it, the game is a lot (almost too much) harder.
• The character designs are interesting and truly Edo Japan-like. A bit like the Tenchu series, but with monsters and magic added into the world.

My first playthrough was keyboard+mouse with default keybinds, this was before I got a controller, but I did fine and enjoyed the game greatly. I admit, the controller does feel better when you get used to it, but it is still possible to play AND have fun without a controller. 

There is a lot of content, even if you don't like new game plus, but there is a massive amount of content when you take into account the NG+ cycles. Also, the new game plus runs aren't carbon copies of the previous runs like DS3 or Bloodborne.

You have to measure your attacks, or you will burn out of Ki (stamina, to you or me), and you have a little meter which when full allows you to channel special powers. You can figure out most enemies quite easily. Consistency is definitely key. If you rush into some types of enemy, swinging your weapon, you will end up skewered. Where you will die a lot is with the bosses. And you will die. A. Lot.

The story is meh, but you don't play games like this for a well-connected and detailed story. You turn up and slice things to bits. That is all you need to know.

The settings are not too varied. If corpse-filled, burning towns and cave networks are your bag, then you are in for a treat. You go back to previous settings a lot to do different missions once you clear a place out and kill the boss. Let's hope that is more variation when Nioh 2 comes out.

The port from PS4 is quite bad. A lot of issues can arise. It is definitely worth reading up on these issues as a precurser before starting. The cutscenes on my PC are a torn-up, pixelly mess. That is my main gripe.

As everyone and their mothers has said, gameplay is kind of like the souls games - with stamina management, dashing, difficulty, and respawning enemies when resting at a checkpoint. But calling it a souls knock-off is pretty unfair. The combat is pretty fast, with a select few weapons. Each weapon type has a bunch of variants with different stats that can be modified because it's a loot-based game. You're constantly picking up better equipment that can be fine-tuned and even re-skinned (Which I love). Each weapon type has a totally unique moveset, with skilltrees providing even more moves. The stance system is really good, enabling faster, weaker attacks, regular strength/speed, and slow & heavy attacks. The combat feels far more satisfying than in the souls games imo

Combat in Nioh is smoother and way more versatile than DS 3, PVP works easier, CO-OP is faster and actually makes sense in the game and it works for both casuals and no lifers. Equipment grind is totally optional, but, like the extra difficulties, adds a lot to the endgame.

Story is not the most original ever made, but characters are not cringeworthy and cutscenes are simple, but engaging. Way more than DS, most of the time played here will be on actual combat, and after figuring how to use your own arsenal, it is much possible to go through stages on a first attempt if you're skilled - as opposed to the mandatory die-to-learn DS logic. Overall, that makes it a friendlier game for newcomers, but experienced players will definitely still be challenged.

However, being from the same producers, some of themain issues inherited from DS remain, such as the lack of a chat (why???????) or the character customization system, not to mention a more-than-lazy adaptation to PC that doesn't even bother taking the joystick buttons out of every tutorial (you will have to write down which key is relative to each original joystick button by the beggining, or learning any new move can be very confusing). Nonetheless, it's a much more streamlined game in comparison to DS 3, that won't make you waste hours just running around like an idiot, but actually dying hundreds of times to improve your skills while going through several main and side missions - and that's what a game should feel like.

If you like the historical fantasy setting of Samurai Warriors/Warriors Orochi, Nioh takes the anime down a notch while adding a whole bunch of Japanese mythology into the mix. It takes awhile to get used to the fact that you're no longer a one man army able to smash through hundreds of minions thoughtlessly, but it just makes the combat more rewarding once you figure out the rhythm of the game.

No open world concept, but not a game breaker for me.

The different kind of weapons, different stances and different moves you can learn add up to a lot of customization in how you can take down enemies. I haven't tried that much Omnyo magic and Ninjutsu but I've watched playthroughs on Youtube that utilize these two for interesting play styles.

Set in Japan during the Sengoku period at the turn of the 17th Century, Nioh is about a western man who becomes a samurai in search of his lost companion. The plot unfolds as you make your way through self-contained levels across an overworld map. These maps can and will be played back multiple times, with different variations. The world is expanded through the DLC included in the Complete Edition -- Defiant Honor, Bloodshed's End, and the excellent Dragon of the North content pack.

Through multiple playthroughs, players are granted access to higher tiers of equipment, which scales up with ever tougher enemies to be slain.

This is a game I have quite enjoyed for the longest time, and I keep coming back to, just to climb higher and higher up the ladder to get up there to those who are nearly considered good at the game. I come back for its combat, atmosphere, and graphics (moreso if you clean it up more using re:shade).

When you begin the game, you are mainly thrown in the midst of it, not knowing what you need to do, which sets the bar on high of  an  (oh crap, this is going to be a hard game), but after the first mission, heading into the 2nd, you begin to adapt more and more, from fleshing out what kind of build you may want to be, either weapon wise or what other options you are brought upon, to what kind of armor class you wish to run around in. The one thing I learned playing this game is that when you hit the higher difficulties, that's when you should really attempt to fully realize your build, since you are going to be seeing a lot of gear that seems really mundane for you.

I must admit there are some stupid moments where I get hit by a backhit from a monster, or some other thing that gets me killed in a dumb way, and others where I am in a area I thought was low enough for my level, but if it is a level with a boss in, about double that if you wish to kill them, but that is what punishment in this game is, a never endless cycle of dying and learning and dying again, got to learn to adapt and overcome. To you out there that are skeptical or wish to NOT recommend this game, instead of comparing it to a game that set the bar, try to see this game for what it is, and not for what it is expected to be bar-wise. 

Also, if you are stuck in an area, you are always welcome to get help from others, via online play by torii gate (which is how you online play), or the bodies of dead players, who can help equip you with their items, so you can advance further, and work out what you want build-wise in the future of playing this game.

I highly recommend this game for the sake of the combat, being a sucker for medieval era-esque armor, weapons and the like, and the art style/graphics that you experience and take in when you play this game. Like all the others who recommended this game, hope to see you in the game, and lets kill us some yokai.",1561830195,1561830195,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

This game is completely the opposite. Yes, min/maxing is a grind much like a diablo loot system but it is not required. The amount of depth that comes from the vast loot pool, the different armor types, different builds, 8 or so weapon types each with unique skill sets and 3 different stances, ~20ish guardian spirits, item reforging, and the abyss (999 floors of hell) add so much to the game that I have put this game in my top 5. 

I beat all the missions and the abyss on both the PS4 and PC, yet still finding myself coming back to this game. This is not a dark souls like game, but having 2k+ deaths makes it rage-inducing much like a souls game. But after farming, the feeling of seeing that rare weapon drop that completes your build and taking it to the smith to re-stat it fit your build make the grind bearable and rewarding. The learning curve for the game is massive, but the greater the challenge the better the reward? There are iconic characters with a solid story and impressive boss fights. 

Spoilers: The fight against Jin Hayabusa and being able to learn iconic ninja gaiden skills/weapons (Izuna drop, Dragon sword) was one of many wonderful additions in the DLC.

You have Dark Souls style combat that gets a bit more in-depth with the stance and spirit division system as well as the skills that let you unlock and mix and match combos. You get tons of randomly generated loot like in Diablo, set items, etc. The hunter formula is there mainly because of how the game is structured, you have a set of maps and missions you do on them, sometimes the maps get reused in sub-missions and get new enemy placements, slightly different configurations. There is LOTS of content in the game, even if a lot of it is rehashed. Tons of replay value if you like the combat system alone.

Speaking of which the combat is fast paced, frantic and a single mistake can end your run and teleport you back to the shrine (this game's equivalent of a bonfire). Victories are as satisfying if not more than in Dark Souls but I've heard a lot of the game's difficulty depends on your build. If you use pure melee and decide not to invest points in ninjutsu or certain spells it can get really frustrating, so it's certainly flawed in that regard.

The port has several issues - it can chug in some places despite really good hardware (Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, GF1700), it's kind of unplayable without a gamepad and likes to crash and freeze sporadically.

The mouse and keyboard controls were a pain at first, but there is a guide on the optimal settings for those.
Main difference was that the game is mission based, which means bosses can be fought again and again without going NG+.

It borrowed a lot of things from Souls, but also has a lot of unique mechanics:
Gaining enough amiritas (Nioh equivalent of souls), you can activate a so called ""living weapon"", during which you fuse your guardian spirit with your weapon and can take no damage to health or run out of stamina, but in return received damage reduces the remaining time of your living weapon.

3 different stances, which determine how much ki (stamina) your attacks, blocking, and rolling cost:
High stance: lots of damage, but lots of ki, slow rolls and attacks
Low stance: smaller damage, few ki, fast rolls and attacks
Medium stance: in the middle of high and low

The loot system is a bit different. An enemy can when drops an item, it can have different rarities:
Common (white), Uncommon (gold), Rare (blue), Exotic (purple), Divine (green, NG+ and onward), Etheral (orange, NG+4 and onvard)
Each equipment has a random level, which determines it's attack and defense values, as well as random stats, depending on their rarity.
The higher the rarity, the more random stats an item can have, as well as the rarer stats it can have.
Item levels are raisable, by sacrifising a higher level item and the stats can be rerolled at a blacksmith.

The new game cycle acts a bit differently than in Dark Souls, as once you beat a cycle, you can select which NG cycle you want to play on.

The con I have to mention is that after the few missions, there are fewer and fewer new enemies.

pros- 

-Fun gameplay and a boatload of ways to play
-Looks alright aesthetically
-really well designed armors and weapons
-somewhat has replay value

cons-
-Story isn't too much to write home about, they're more or less recapping a little history from the sengoku era along with gay fantasy sh*t you've probably seen a million times before.

-The game has a whole bunch of content and mechanics you need to learn in order to not be raped by standard enemies

-They put no care or thought whatsoever in their enemy placements, atleast not later on in the game. They're completely random.

-The design in difficulty for the bosses is terrible. Nearly every enemy and definently every boss can oneshot you. Some of the bosses oneshots doesn't even have any windup, it's just a 1-hit KO slap to the face. This is an extremely lazy way to design difficulty. It honestly makes me believe that the designers didn't have time or will to give bosses a proper movesets. Because all of the bosses movesets are extremely easy to telegraph, it's just this bullsh*t oneshot you have no chance reacting to that truly makes these bosses ""difficult"". Good difficulty isn't meant to make you feel lucky for surviving a fight, it's meant to make you feel accomplishment. 

And as if oneshots wasn't enough, they sometimes force you to fight two bosses you've already killed before. What makes it worse is that these bosses aren't even designed for a 2v1, they literally just plastered two bosses on each other, it's lazy, boring and a poor excuse of a boss fight. These ""fights"" can more or less be summarized as a cat and mouse chase that takes 20 minutes.

All in all, if you enjoy getting your c0ck and balls crushed with a sledgehammer I guess this game is for you.",1561646065,1561716336,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I dropped it because when I reached the second world map the new missions were kind of the same, so I didn't feel enthusiastic enough to just repeat everything with new visuals. 

So to breakdown what this title is, it is kind of like Dark Souls meats mission objective Japanese styled game. It is a lot faster than Dark Souls and offers multiple stances for weapons effectively giving more combat potential for each weapon, I played as heavy damage offensive stance long katana and was almost wreaking every enemy until I misstep and might as well die at that point. 
Choices are varied, and while I was leveling up there were options to increase my magic but I haven't came across it so I don't know.

Story isn't really well told for as far as I have played, it kind of felt like it wasn't to be the main focus at all. Visuals weren't all that great seeing as a lot of missions are simply underground tunnels and so on, sightseeing in these maps practically do not exist. But any other outdoor mission were honestly pleasant. And music was fine, nothing fancy but gets the job done I would say. 

So it is obvious that the meat of this game is in its combat variations and styles. If you enjoy triumphing over enemies with unique styles ore just raw strength, then this will be a fulfilling experience to say the least.
And to be honest, the game is fairy priced for what it offers and it arguably gives more value than similarly priced games AAA or not.

Its similar to a Souls game but not.
First Impression of the of combat feels cheap or simple, until they introduce the stance and upgrade skills then the game is more fun to customize your preferred build.

Difficulty so far Its similar to Dark souls but easier, like you know theres a trap or an hidden enemy if you not very careful on your surroundings. I died couple of time due to mistakes I made. there are times that enemy can overwhelm you by numbers. But I mostly cheese it by sniping and luring them one by one (it feels cheap to use this tactics).
Camera can sometimes be disorienting especially in the Cave level.

I like the Diablo loot style makes me want to grind more for rare gear by fighting revenants.  
Boss fights I'm still on the 3rd boss and having fun fighting it. 

Haven't tried coop yet want to finish this game solo on the first run. 

Performance wise, first couple of mins of the game I got a Stutter on cutscenes and during combat, i only fixed the problem by changing my the game to Borderless Fullscreen and turn off the NVIDIA Highlight reel then all in all game runs smooth will update on the go.

The story is soso, I got to know the main focus of the story but I still don't know why you as a british prisoner hast a guardian spirit like all of the eatern heroes and so on.. The loot system is Diablo-like wich is somehow good because you get a ton of weapons and armor in different quality but maybe not what you are searching for, it's very random (you have smith to conter that but it's still  random...) 
The graphics are okayish for a game of 2017 you can see all the different armor types/weapons on youre carackter and the skills and fire are good but there were no breathtaking scenes (for me).
The combat is good in my opinion 'cause you got different weapons that are very different to play with and even some differnet ranged weapons. Unfrotunately there are just 7 different meele weapon types but it takes time to master them and unlock all the skills. Ah and there is even magic alias Ninjutsu and Genjutsu (Omnyo ^^) (wich can makes the game easy mode with slow spells :/ )
One mechanic I realy liked are the bloodstains of the players if you are online. Like in Dark souls: if you die the place will be marked with a bloodstain to retrieve your lost ""XP"". If you play online you can see the bloodstains of different people that died in this place.

The second big problem is the loot system that's an absolute clusterfuck of stats and levels that are ultimately pointless and annoying. You basically just kill a bunch of phantoms to get higher level gear from other players and you end up having 20 of the same item in your inventory. 
The third substantial problem is the lack of variety in the enemies and in the setting. You do have varied locations but they're all so restricted exploring is a big pain in the ass.

My main complaint is the lack of 3440x1440 support but you can easily fix that by dragging a file into your Nioh folder and running it.  File is here: https://github.com/LennardF1989/NiohResolution

The fix works for most resolutions.

This. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.

If you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.
In order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.

Summery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!
Highly recommend!

It is very much more anime than Dark Souls, featuring super-modes you can temporarily go into (Super Saiyan, Rage mode, this isn't even my final form, etc), ninjutsu and some scroll magic stuff, etc. A tad more fast paced than Dark Souls, more akin to Bloodborne than anything.

This game is filled with many content and things to do you can easily spend more than 100 hours in this game from doing the main missions and also the side missions, with a unique combat system which i won't talk a lot about since many players talked about how great the combat system there's nothing else to add.

- Boss design: i can't lie and say this game doesn't have any cool designs it does but they are few and far between and this is apparent  in late game where there are more human boss fights than yoki (demons ).

I first played this game when it came out March 2017 and I liked it enough to beat it once and call it a day. Fast forward to roughly January 2018 and I had the game and all it's DLC beaten thrice and a Platinum to boot. Let me break it down:

Pros:
- If you're even slightly into Japanese history and myth, the game gives you enough to chew on.
- Combat is difficult, but rewarding and slyish. Definitely more action game than souls-like. Carrying four weapons (two melee, two ranged) allows for highly customized Williams.
- Graphics are not top-notch for PC, but the art style, armor sets, and even William himself are a joy look at.
- Bosses are tough, but fun and well designed
- The loot system is actually really great, even though I found it off puttin during the beta times. The weapon variety breaks down to whatever fits your play style best, don't let the amount overwhelm you.
- With the exception of maybe spears and axes, the weapons are an absolute blast to use. You really can feel like the worlds most badass white guy samurai.
- Music. Sparse, but the boss themes get stuck in my head to this day.
- Replayability is through the roof. The higher difficulties don't just add more health, but add different enemy placements (think Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin), higher levels, and more/varied loot overall.
- The classic ""level"" structure. In the Beta, I legit hated this idea--I wanted a seemless world! But after playing the full release it really grew on me. It gives a nice breather during a particularly difficult level, and it allows you to focus on the gameplay rather than the world traversal. Some may not like it (which I totally get), but I found it a really nice addition.

Meh:
- The story. I love the foreigner-in-Japan feeling the story and dialogue gives off, but it never goes deep enough. The ending is fine, but actual story beats and cut scenes are lackluster.
- The graphics. Again, good not great. More options on PC are needed.
- The port job. Functional, but you need a controller for this one. Graphics options are lacking, but the resolution choices are oddly nice.
- Enemy design. The levels, combat, gear, and promise of mouth-watering loot carry the game, but definitely not the enemy designs. 
- While it fits my play style perfectly, some aspects of the game feel like Onmyō (magic) is required. Seriously, if you never even touch magic, AT LEAST make sure to get Sloth. Again, the way you fight is highly customizable but I still feel like a very minor part of each build needs to have AT LEAST some magic or ninjustu. 

Negatives:
- The combat can be a little too overwhelming for those looking for a less action-oriented expereince. Ki pulse is tricky to pull off without practice.
- The level designs are great aesthetically (in most cases), but can often be confusing.
- What's the point of heavy armor? Sure I can take more hits, but Jesus Christ did it feel worthless at higher levels.
