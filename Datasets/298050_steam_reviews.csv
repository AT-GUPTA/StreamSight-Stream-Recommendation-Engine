Not a fan of the Antaren thing. They will come by every once in a while to blow your stuff up, while bypassing your system defenses. Not really sure why they did that.

4. Diplomacy is meh, basically you have trade treaties with everyone except maybe one person who you hate.

The game maintains the spirit and play style of the original MOO and many good things came through from MOO2.  The landing screens are fun to watch (though they do get repetitive) but the moprhing of the planet views as the population soars is a nice feature.  I like the ship customization, graphics and voice overs (I can imagine that they weren't cheap).  Generally game play is smooth and I didn't encounter any critical errors.

That aside the game comes with frustrations and this is unfortunate as someone who was around for all previous versions.  Overall I played it 7 years after its release (I was busy :D).

1. In comparison to other games, like civilization, no victory condition can be chosen.  One of the most frustrating things is to be told by the computer that ""XXX won and though it would be a hard grind they are 'the best'"".  Starting before and continuing after the message, I was ripping up stated empire apart.  A complete oversight in a strategy game market that seems to favor a particular 'way to win'.  Not being able to turn this off and subsequently turning off other victory conditions is a slap to the face.

2. DLC's are a money grab.  In the original version of the game the races being offered as DLC were original to the game.  This observation was made from a quick look at the race selection screen in the beginning.  So, all I can see is that a significant purchase price of the games value for the DLC that only adds a race.  During ship customization, there is a second picture that can be chosen for the model instead of the 'standard'.  I did not check to see if DLC's offered up new ship models based on race, but THAT would have been a good feature for sale.

3. No Hotseat multiplayer.  I actually  peeked into the multiplayer servers and they are more dry than a piece of toast on the back deck lid from a car in North America in August or more vacant than a politician's soul (do they have souls?). 

4. Autosaves - I did not see an option to control this.  On one hand, you certainly will not build up too many saves, and that is because I can only see a single one being kept.  There is no way to correct further back than your last turn other than manually saving yourself.  It would have been nice to have a selection to keep the last 10 or 15.  Something configurable.  (possible that money went to the voice over budget).

For a game where voices that are repetitive, too much was likely invested and things that would have been important for gameplay likely glossed over (I would be assuming due to budget).  Baldur's Gate 3 is a good example where good voiceovers in a very rich story line with alternate paths are a key investment! Understanding games are expensive to produce, I do wonder if the Project Manager of Chief in Charge on this was a true fan of MOO2, arguably the best game of this series.  Unfortunately they missed the mark on improving and lost maintaining that resonance by clipping the victory condition.  Even though you can continue 'for just one more turn' (reference to Civilization and Sid), the game doesn't feel the same, in fact I did not notice the Antarans continuing to attack, though it is possible I didn't give it enough time.  

I do not recommend buying this.  I have had better deals (cost wise) with the civilization series, and certainly recommend grabbing them, especially when on sale.  They have continued to maintain their timeless allure, and set the bar high for how games should be done.

I wouldn't say it's better or worse than MoO2 because there are enough differences that it's noticeably different and there are things I feel each game does far better, though fans of MoO2 will probably struggle for awhile due to the changes between the games. 

Pros over MoO2-
- Most of the species and the ships look better from updated graphics.
- A greater degree of customization in the galaxy seed, how quickly or slowly you want production, research, and population growth to be for that game, how long the game can run, and what conditions for winning are available.
- Expanded diplomatic options with other races including the options to buy/sell tech and colonies, offering multiple items in exchange for tech or treaties, and declaring war on another empire in exchange for money/tech.
- Trading tech with AI players is a bit fairer though with there being less tech available to trade it's still usually more useful to offer to sell a tech.
-Galactic ""monsters"" can be detected without first having to encounter them with a ship (and probably losing that ship) or by using the Omniscient trait (though it does make that trait far less useful in MoO).
- Greater control over espionage actions and players can ransom or kill captured opposing spies. Spies can level up becoming more effective offensively or defensively.
- The size of the map and the number of players determines the number of leaders an empire can have and though leaders now only have one or two abilities (compared to up to 4 in MoO2) some of the abilities are very powerful.
- Barren planets are able to provide food. Toxic planets can be cleaned up to become barren planets that can then be terraformed. The new Volcanic planet is great for heavy industry due to pollution not being a factor on them, though volcanic planets can't be terraformed and the Lava Breather homeworld trait basically requires taking the Lithovore trait since Volcanic/Inferno planets otherwise can't produce enough food at the start of the game to support your population.
- Pollution affects food production instead of losing industry efficiency.
- Changing a ship blueprint automatically updates any ships currently in production or in queue.

Neutral-
- The game uses MoO3's starlanes making choke points easier and players can explore the entire galaxy from the beginning. Players can buy and trade star charts as soon as they make diplomatic contact with other empires.
- Galaxy map sizes favor larger number of players or larger games so even the smallest maps have a few dozen systems.
- MoO2's turn based combat is replaced by a version of MoO3's real time combat (I much more prefer turn based). It offers a lot of interesting options for combat but it becomes a clusterf*** keeping track of what's going on once combat involves more than a few dozen ships.
- All tech has branching paths and prerequisites- more realistic but it means each empire specializes less and overall there are fewer times upon completing a tech field where you have to choose between what technologies to learn.
- The tech trees have been overhauled. A number of techs have been removed and a few have been added. Empire wide techs require building and system techs usually limit the bonus of that tech to just the planet it is built on .
- Population growth is dependent primarily on the amount of excess food produced. Food can only be distributed within a system once the technology has been developed.
- Attacking a colony directly requires bombs thus the player can design some specialization with their ships (but not to MoO3's levels).
-Morale no longer offers bonuses or penalties to colony production but instead factors in how many population of a colony will work at a given tax amount (higher taxes lower morale, tech raises morale). I would almost put this as a negative as it means until mid-game most of your planets will start featuring striking population once at 6 population (7 with a Marine Barracks).

Things MoO2 does better-
- 3 of the original races are paid DLC
- Any condition for winning you disable is completely disabled (examples- turning off Political Victory means the Galactic Senate never forms. Turning off Economic Victory disables players being able to buy, sell, and trade GMF stocks).
- Unless you want a challenge there is no point enabling Antarian Victory. Everything about the Antarians is worse- from the lackluster design, that the Antarians will always attack the player with the highest score and always at the same planet (which the same planet is the only way it becomes possible to make a defense). In MoO2 Antarians would send slowly growing raids of ships with end game tech and by mid game players could build large enough fleets with enough developed technology to defeat them. In this game Antarians have only slightly higher levels of tech than players but rely on overwhelming numbers that actively change depending on the leading player's military strength (no matter how many ships that player builds beforehand when the portal opens every 30-45 turns the Antarian strength will be greater than the player's).  In late game this can result in raids that are massively stronger than what's defending Antares.
- Combat is actually kind of boring and with how shields regenerate focus fire is a necessity. Planetary defenses are also not as useful in MoO (possibly because they are no longer an optional technology to learn and instead something the player will get at certain tech points)
- There are fewer race penalties available in custom races to make min/max races and a number of the races in the game are unbalanced (can't be made in character creator due to using more points than are available)
- MoO2 offered 4 different types of governments, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and each with a different playstyle. They have been removed here. 
- Trade and Research treaties only last 20 turns and have to be repurchased each time at an increasing cost. Research treaties are not worth the high cost even early in the game and usually an empire can't afford them (they provide a one time boost of research points at the end of the treaty). Trade treaties are almost a necessity for much of a game if an empire is doing any kind of planetary development.
- By mid-game the player is usually struggling financially with economic technologies and trade treaties being a necessity due to spy, leader, and development upkeep costs. Upon attaining the late-game Galactic Currency Exchange tech money becomes almost unnecessary outside of refitting and buyouts.
- Declining any AI diplomatic offers harms relations with that empire and having any diplomatic contact with an empire they are at war with also harms relations. Factors affecting relations can linger for 40-50 turns. When it comes to major treaties (non-aggression pact, alliances, peace treaties) the AI will often make heavyhanded demands if the player asks but will offer to bribe the player with the same treaty and no demands if the player waits (sometimes in the span of a couple turns).
- Refitting ships can be very expensive and can only be done with BC. Refitting engines is cheap but upgrading or even adding additional weapons increases the cost significantly. The cost feels bugged as generally the price to increase the number of weapons on a ship (even by 1) costs more than stripping the ship to add all new weapons.
- Some tech only becomes available too late to be all that useful (like the Planetary Supercomputer when the tech tree is nearly maxed out) and research becomes useless (and a drain of BC) once an empire maxes out the tech tree (in MoO2 continued development made ship tech smaller and cheaper).",1676009657,1694118590,True,147,0,0.923549413681030273,4,True,False,False

(The above was my review in Nov 2019)

Today, Sept 2023, I was looking at the reviews for this game and was completely surprised to see all the negative comments. People complained of many bugs, crashes, and the game being unplayable. In my over 180 hours of playing this game I never saw any problems, so I decided to play again to see if something had changed. So I started up the game, made all the option changes that I wanted, picked the races I wanted to play against, and tweaked some of the settings (like having GNN not show up and no pirates)....and I then started. I played quite a while and found no issues, not even the slightest bug or hiccup. The game was smooth, the graphics decent (for a game that has been out for 7+ years), the challenge of creating a space empire still there......I enjoyed myself immensely! I can only wonder how others have set up/tweaked their gaming machines, that something as simple as MoO is having problems. Bottom line, MoO is a fun game dealing with research, warship design, diplomacy, and strategy. The game is simple to play but can be hard to master. I have found it to be bug and crash free, no issues in over 180 hours of play. It is simply and VERY good game and I highly recommend it.",1573827525,1694009570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MOOs turn based tactical combat was one of my favourite things about it and they just threw that into the dumpster.  

Overall I recommend it but think of it as MOO re-imagined more than a remake and you have to look past all the bugs that are never going to get fixed.",1693681286,1693681286,True,1,0,0.50304257869720459,0,True,False,False

For an old Master of Orion addict like myself this game is really not something I should have on my drive. It's way too easy to spend way too many hours playing this. 

The nostalgia is there, the artwork is spot on, the voice acting is a real treat for someone into Star Trek and other shows. This game is mostly a revamp of the old Master of Orion 2 (MoO2) but it has some features from MoO3, like the star lanes. Those give you a chance to block off your opponents and concentrate your forces in choke points.

You have a limit of 7 Leaders and those can be any mix of ship or colony leaders. You no longer get the last Orion by beating the guardian. Other space monsters are there as well. Antarans are there aswell but they are somewhat easier than in MoO2.

Space battle is ""real time"" with pause function. Missile boats can still take out beam ships by shooting and scooting but the map size is of course limited. Many maps have asteroids that block both missiles and beams. Other maps have nebula parts and when inside a nebula your shields will be down (unless you have the Hard Shields option added to your ships).

The tech tree is a bit limited and I wish there was a ""Future tech"" in the end that you could just research over and over again for further minor bonuses to ships.

All in all it's a fun game. And at 80% discount I just couldn't resist it.",1692842399,1692842623,True,2,0,0.506081581115722656,1,True,False,False

I played MOO2 excessively in my youth and stand by my position that it was/is the best space 4X game of all time. All they had to do was update the graphics and maybe the combat to a 3D experience and the next MOO release would have been very well received.

The graphics have been updated and do look great, but the combat is TERRIBLE. Still not in a 3D space (combat is all on one plane) and the “Admiral” control of the ships is painful to experience (not to mention the “odds of winning” calculation is WAY off). It would have been better to keep the turn-based combat of MOO2! Instead, you end up learning how to cheese the opposition without using all the combat options provided (which don’t seem to work anyway).

Oh, and then there’s the very annoying marine invasion situation where ALL of your troops just disappear after wiping out the opposition in battle. Even if you landed 20 troop ships to attack a planet defended by 1 population, ALL your troops are used up… gone.

But that’s not the real problem… the game is just dull! It’s lost its charm. It didn’t feel like I was exploring strange new worlds or building a civilization or interacting with other cultures (diplomacy is flat). I just did the same process every turn on each planet over and over.

I went through the whole game (which was a yawn fest) and “won” via conquest (wiping out everyone and then rebuilding, as that was easier than dealing with a conquered population), just before being able to create the portal to take the fight to the Antarans (who were comically not terrifying – more like annoying bugs), only to find out that because I met the conquest victory conditions, I can no longer enter the Antaran portal that I had just built… WHAT?!? Why? That was the ONLY reason I kept playing this tedious game…

Oh well.

The music composed by Dave Govett is some of the best I have heard in these types of games, however the way his music is incorporated into the game is very poor, where we end up hearing basically the same two musical loops over and over again, ad nausium. So if they had improved how music was implemented in this game, it would have been a lot better. The game play is okay to bad. The AI is either pathetically easy or so hard it wipes you out quickly but very little in between nuance. The initial Pirates AI mechanic is horrible, where tiny bands of pirates attack you incessantly and can easily wipe you out early game. So I always end up disabling pirates in the custom game settings on launch of a new single player game (which is unfortunate). The AI in this game is really dumb. The graphics of the ships in this game is mediocre to poor. The games I mentioned above are far better alternatives. This game looks like it was developed by one person using the Unity game engine, and getting all their assets from the Unity assets store. Where they did a great job is in the voice over cast, where we have famous Star Trek  actors such as Michael Dorn (who played Worf). and John DeLancie, who played Star Trek Q, voicing the Human ambassador. So that was a really nice touch. Too bad the game itself is so mediocre or this could have been great. The space battle simulator is laughably pathetic. This game would have been so much better if they had a good space battle like Endless Space 2 does (which has the best battles) or like Sins of a Solar Empire. Seeing games like this be so mediocre makes we want to try to develop my own space strategy 4X game. The only reason I gave this game a thumbs up is because some things are really good while others are 'meh' to poor.

tech points and more tech than I. Along with they are better than me in every way except I own the most planets
still and I have the largest population still as well.

Antarans open a portal and attack one of the AI, actually taking out a huge fleet the AI owns.
Then jump back into their portal. That AI had it's Victory points hardly drop and I see 2 more fleets of 
the same HUGE size flying around their space just 2 turns later.

The Terrans and the Humans go to war. I send spys to keep them at war. They destroy each other all over
my area and their own. The humans manage to take out another AI and the Terrans take out 2 other AI races.
They stay at war but keep moving around these huge fleets of ships.

Please keep in mind I have more planets and more population then they do and they are still asking for
the warp tech to navigate unstable warp paths! I have my Production cranked now too.

( No idea how they are all over the universe, they must ignore the ""unstable"" part and move freely. )
Sure enough, I see them flying up and down the unstable paths unhindered!

I build my first Titan and I assign it to my main fleet. I save the game, at this point I am going to experiment.

The humans are ahead and the Terrans are close to me in every aspect other than population, planets and tech.
I am still ahead in tech. against them even though the AI seem to have more points. Makes no sense because when I
over to trade tech they have none I do not have and I have a ton that they don't have.

I attack the Terran Home Capital world and manage to take it out. I now own it. They take out 2 of my smaller planets
and I head for their 2 main fleets.

I take out their first main fleet, all the while my spies have been killing their leaders. We took out 6 leaders before I attacked the main fleet and won, total annihilation of that fleet they lost a lot!. I lost about 40% of my fleet.
I scrambled and pull all my ships from everywhere giving up all protection for my systems and make a new main fleet.
I attack and take out their 2nd fleet, which had also grown in size. I am down to about 25% of my fleet left but they have no ships anywhere. I have scout all over so I can see all their map area and more.

I go on a bombing run across their systems to keep them rebuilding and so they can not make a new fleet.

The human AI is still asking for the warp tech I mentioned above and they want an alliance. I say no, then turn around and 
sell them back 4 spies that I catapulted for some good cash and annual payments from them to me. They complain about it and I end negotiations. 

Maybe 50 turns have passed since I took out the 2nd fleet of the Terrans, many of their planets have been bombed by me
and I am still behind the humans in Victory points. No other races left in the game. I think this should be easy.
I hit the Orion Planet system kill the Guardian and take over, then about 20 turns later My capital is hit by a MASSIVE Terran
fleet and destroyed! Not taken over mind you, but not worth anything now.

I send my refreshed fleet to take on the Terrans new fleet and when I see the size of it I am like, "" There is no way they could have built this!"" 4 Titans, 7 Battleships and what looks like countless others ships.. All from where???

Now, I have to say I love a challenge. All my years of playing MOO when it came out, MOO2 ( Best game ever ! ) and yes, 
I even played Moo3. I never had the game cheat like it does in MOOcts!

I am left speechless at how bad the developers must be in programming and at tactics that they have to write the game 
so the AI cheats so much! I never even made it to where you go after the Antarans. 
Yes I could go back and play but what is the point.

The game uses cheating to compensate for bad programming and bad written AI.

I think I will stick with playing MOO2 when I feel the urge to play. I may come back just to try some crazy setting and see
where that takes the game. However for anyone wanting a great game, full of Sci-fi fun, tactics and a good challenge,
please, go play MOO2. It is a much better game, easier to find out what the different techs do and you feel far more 
in control of your ship design, weapon upgrades and the overall experience is far-far better!",1691253439,1691253439,False,25,3,0.699305057525634766,0,True,False,False

This game not only satisfies that craving but also outshines its competition by a mile. What sets it apart is the perfect blend of turn-based gameplay with real-time space battles, creating a seamless and exhilarating experience.

I've been playing for a short while, and I'm impressed by the absence of any bugs or lack of polish, making for a smooth and immersive journey. The empire management system, particularly population management, is brilliantly simple yet effective, allowing you to focus on the aspects that truly matter.

For fans of the classic ""Master of Orion 2,"" you'll be pleased to find a mostly faithful remake, with enhancements that I personally find superior, such as the inclusion of star-lanes from the third installment and the revamped RTS combat system.

I highly recommend this game, delivering everything you've been longing for in the genre.

I played this lazy dumpster fire of a game when it first came out because I genuinely love the genre, but between this and Stellaris from about the same time they soured me on the whole genre with their disgusting fake challenge.

What is ""fake challenge"" you ask? Well, when you have the A.I. pulling suspiciously large military forces out of nowhere when they lose a couple of planets...it's kind of suspicious.

When you can pour everything into developing planets and technology and someone whose been in a two front war has more planets with bigger populations and more infrastructure than all but your homeworld...it's kind of suspicious.

When a spy causes your homeworld, i.e. the capitol of your civilization, to revolt against the civilization it itself controls...it's kind of suspicious.

BUT! When you have a coalition of species united in a glorious war only to, the very next turn after the last enemy world falls, immediately have one betray you because it's the ""lowest"" rated of your allies at a whopping 77 instead of the 85 of the other ally and immediately declare you to be interstellar Hitler...well that kind of clinches it, huh?

The developers spent so much time and money getting Sci-Fi actors to voice their characters that they forgot to actually make a game. Thanks, it's much more important to me to have Mark Hamill voice a frickin' bird man instead of actually have functioning game mechanics. Great choice, guys.

I don't care how long it's been since release. The makers straight up didn't care to actually make a game, which considering that's what I, and presumably you, came here for, is flat out insulting.

I mean, just saying the name brings back so many memories of the first game that it's hard not to get excited for the remake. Even if you've played it before, check it out again.

It's been a while since I've played the game, but stepping back into it was like stepping back into a familiar universe filled with intriguing races, intricate diplomacy, and epic battles. The game is a true homage to the original, with updated graphics and mechanics that make it feel like a modern game without losing its classic charm.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963117206
One of the things I love about Master of Orion is the variety of races you can play as. Each has its own unique backstory, strengths, and weaknesses, making each playthrough feel fresh and exciting. Do you want to be the noble and honorable humans, the sinister and technologically advanced Sakkra, or the enigmatic and powerful Psilons? It's your decision.

The game also features deep diplomacy mechanics, allowing you to form alliances, negotiate trade deals, and wage war with other civilizations. There is always satisfaction in successfully negotiating a peace treaty or allying with a powerful empire to defeat a common enemy.

Of course, no 4X space game would be complete without epic space battles, and Master of Orion doesn't disappoint in that regard. Watching your fleets battle it out against huge battleships, frigates, and fighters is a thrill, especially when you emerge victorious.

But what sets Master of Orion apart from other space strategy games is its humor. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and is full of quirky and funny moments to keep you entertained throughout your gameplay. From the crazy racing designs to the silly dialogues, it's impossible not to smile while playing this game.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963117119
In summary, Master of Orion is an excellent remake of a classic game that will delight fans of the original as well as new players. It's a perfect blend of modern mechanics and classic charm, with deep gameplay, epic space battles, and a healthy dose of humor. It's been a while since I've played the game, but I can confidently say that it's still one of the best 4X space strategy games out there.

The initial gameplay is moderately high and straightforward ‘find planet, colonise it, allocate resources to increase productivity and search for another planet’ scenario. To a small extent tiresome once you begin to understand it, but in time another race is encountered and once contact has been made you can communicate and attempt to make trade agreements or alliances, swap technology secrets or declare war. Becoming friendly with other races is beneficial for trade and is a good war avoidance tactic, but it also allows you to put in a particular position spies who will get involved in industrial espionage and sabotage.

There are many ways to achieve your objective, from exploiting the discovered planets and being pleasant to other races in the hope that they will cast their vote for you at the council meeting, to destroying any alien you come across and taking their planets. You can overwhelm the galaxy with members of your race on uninhabited planets and make the atmosphere suitable for breeding - no soft lights and [b][i]Barry White[/i][/b] records, but concentrating resources on keeping the atmosphere clean and free of industrial waste.

Advanced technology allows you to develop everything from killer ships to lethal weaponry to a improved pop-up toaster that doesn't burn the bread on one side while leaving the other cold.

Another feature is the inclusion of Leaders, talented freelancers that hire their services out to players. You can sign them up to lead your space-craft, head up battles, take care of planets, adding all sorts of variables into the strategic mix.

The game's music is also excellent, with a sweeping orchestral score that adds to the epic scope of the game. The game's single-player campaign is engaging and well-written, with a variety of missions that test the player's strategic abilities. The game also has a multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete against each other for galactic domination. One of the game's few downsides is its outdated user interface, which can be confusing and difficult to navigate for new players. The game's AI can also be inconsistent at times, with some civilizations proving to be too passive or too aggressive. Master of Orion is an excellent turn-based strategy game that offers a deep and immersive experience. Its complex game play systems, impressive graphics, and engaging single-player campaign make it a must-play for fans of the genre. However, the game's outdated user interface and inconsistent AI may make it less accessible to some players.",1680220399,1680220399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong there are better space strategy simulator games out there, heck Stellaris came out the same year as this game and Sins of a Solar Empire is still a better game than this one and came out nearly a decade before it. That being said Master of Orion (the 2016 remake) is still way better than a ton of other space sims that I've seen. So why am I not recommending it despite believing it to be a pretty good game and having bought this in 2023 for 6 dollars? It's simple Master of Orion and Master of Orion 2 were the best space sims to come out in the 90s. 1996 was one of the best years for video games in history and some of the most important genre defining games came out that year Elder Scrolls 2 daggerfall, Duke Nukem 3d, Super Mario 64, Final Fantasy 7 came out in Japan in 96 but would come out in America in January of 97, Quake, Star Ocean, Diablo, and Master of Orion 2. Master of Orion 2 really stood out that year, the other genre defining games were rpgs and first person shooters but Masters of Orion 2 was THE space game. There are some truly die hard fans of this game because compared to the other games on this list Master of Orion 2 flew under the radar and the people who discovered MOO2 felt like they had found a piece of buried treasure. If you want to remake a game with as much depth and nuance as MOO then you can't just make a generic 4x space sim and throw a coat of paint on it and slap MOO as the title and expect fans to be happy. This game should have been extraordinary but instead it's just okay. If the title of this game was Random Indie Space Simulator 2016 then I would have recommended it but when you tell people that you are selling them a Rolls-Royce but actually sell them a Toyota Corolla then people are bound to be unhappy and feel cheated.

There is another thing that I would like to add. I went back and played MOO2 the other day and realized that the combat in this game isn't as good as a 4x space sim made in 1996. Every battle in MOO2 happened around a particular star system and fleets interacted with planets in the middle of space battle which meant you could ignore an enemy fleet entirely and carpet bomb a planet. This made space battles far more nuanced in MOO2 and there was far more tactics involved. Sometimes your fleet's objective was just to bomb an enemy planet and flee because your fleet didn't have any strong attack ships and had to rely on nimble stealth bombers to hurt an enemies production capabilities during war. Sure your enemy has a bigger stronger fleet with better technology but you have hundreds of suicidal bombers that are waging total war on every planet your enemy holds.",1678596990,1678849038,False,1,0,0.482404142618179321,0,True,False,False

I played 1 game in MP with 1 friend and 4 AI.

When you initially start playing this game it seems like a pretty simple 4X with decent production values.
However the further you get in the clearer it becomes this is NOT a good 4X game, the game doesn't give you a lot of information you need to make informed decisions, like what components of a tech do, it also sometimes gives you false information.
There are basic design and interface issues everywhere, it seems like the designers looked at other 4X games and took a lot of inspiration from parts of their design without understanding *why* that design was made.

An example is the Antarans, they initially seem like they are a form of end game crisis, they appear randomly (or not so, they mostly harassed my friend) and will go to one of your planets, bomb it once doing minor damage, and then leave. Simply moving your fleet away makes them safe, because they don't follow them.
Another example is pirates, pirates become a non issue as soon as you have a few ships. their combat potential does not scale at all with your own making them a pushover even from the start of the game.

In MP you cannot fight tactical battles, only auto resolve. This is pretty boring and a lot of ship parts you unlock via tech seem to only do something in the tactical battles and be useless in MP. Designing ships is a pain in the ass with bad UI and an auto upgrade system that really seems to want to downgrade your ships most the time.

TLDR:
There were many other annoyances and issues I haven't mentioned, this game is not fit for MP play, and given that the AI seemed utterly brain dead and large parts of the game are just bad, probably isn't any fun in SP either.

There are some notable exceptions though.

You cannot go to the empire screen and simply drag and drop population from one maxed out colony to a new one.
Instead you have to build transport ships and move them where you need them, which increases micro a fair bit.

But my biggest complaint is the lack of repeating end game tech.
Once you reach the end of the tech tree, there is nothing else for your scientist to do.
But you can also not just put them into production because production slots are capped.
At that point half the population is essentially useless.

In MOO2 and virtually every decent 4X game you have repeating end game techs, that give you small incremental bonuses and keep increasing in price. 1% more credits, 1% more miniaturization, 1% more energy weapon damage ect...
How anyone could release a 4x game without that is beyond me, to be honest.

Sure you could, at that point just go for the sciency victory and win the game.

Menu animations, cut scenes and texts waste too much time.

It clearly borrows from both MOO2 and MOO3, as well as other games like Galactic Civilizations and Endless Space. I got this for about six bucks on sale with all of the DLC and MOO, MOO2, and MOO3. 

Spoiler: It's not a terrible game, but Master of Orion 2 is still the best in the series. You can make it playable by changing the Growth speed setting when creating a new game. If you don't, it's too slow and boring like Gal Civ.

TLDR This is streamlined Endless Space.

What's good?

- Graphics. Everything got an overhaul including the main screen, the close ups of aliens, GNN, and battles. 

- The aliens have a lot more personality now via diplomacy.  The Gnolams are the most lifelike. Bird people are next, and I'm pretty sure Mark Hamill voices the Avian people.

- You can now specify the number of duplicate items to build.

- Unlike Endless Space, it's not endlessly buggy. That is a big achievement.

- Unlike Endless Space, it's not a resource hog.

- Unlike Endless Space, it doesn't need an internet connection for single player.

- There are now more ways to win: Science and Economics


What's ok?

- The voice acting is ok. More on this later.

- They now have focused AI management e.g. Food, Production, etc... and it's still broken, but nearly every 4X AI management is broken except for one game and that game is really boring. There is still a lot of micromanagement. 

- Music is solid given the genre.

- The new Gal Civ space constructor mechanic isn't bad, but it takes out two major game mechanics.

- Spaces lanes are definitely borrowed from Endless Space. Not bad, but it kills two major Master of Orion mechanics.

- Tech tree is ok. Most of the time it doesn't piss me off. It is familiar.

- They added space pirates and minor factions. It's ok.

- They have a tutorial system.

- They improved the Espionage mechanic a bit.


What sucks?

- The way the game treats population growth is just too slow. It doesn't even matter if you have a small planet. Even with cloning labs, you're not going to fill up all the space at turn 200. What makes this issue even worse is that the colony ships remove population as they're built. The end result is that pacing is mind numbingly slow. 

EDIT: You can fix this with settings. Just change Growth to ""Very Fast"", and the game becomes playable. This should be the default setting. I'm now changing this game to Recommend since I didn't need a mod to fix it.

- There is also no longer a ""Housing"" mechanic where you use production to grow the population which makes the above problem even worse.

- They have real time battles with limited control, which is what everyone hated from Master of Orion 3. Maybe instead of dropping so much money on really expensive voice actors from Star Trek and Star Wars, maybe they should have spent it on tactical battles instead? Again, this is what makes MOO unique. They need to bring this back. At least it looks pretty now.

- They removed colony bases. Why? It made no sense. None. It also drastically slows the game down just like with the insanely slow population growth. Colony ships seem to be almost just as expensive as MOO2.

- They took out the limited travelling distance mechanic. This is a key mechanic that is unique to MOO. 

- They messed up the colony list management screen. You can no longer see researcher, farmer, and worker allocation per colony. This is even worse since the AI does bad allocations automatically. 

- You can no longer select multiple workers like in MOO2. Why?!

- The Anteran mechanic is now just really stupid. No matter what you have, they will always have better tech. It scales, which again is stupid.

- The Galactic Counsel where you vote for Supreme Leader isn't guaranteed to happen. All races have to meet each other. There is no guarantee of it ever happening. I've beaten a game where this didn't happen. While I hated it in MOO2, in this new game it's essential to keep it from dragging on.

- The Creative trait is a lot less useful. Your choices on which optional tech to take is much less gut wrenching. This game prioritizes growth over everything else.

- You can't do counter proposals when the AI offers you something diplomatically.

Minor complaints 

- Not all of the speed settings are saved from new game to new game.

- There is too much voice acting. I don't need everything narrated. I can read.

- There's too little variety in events. GNN could have been much better.

- The AI management is really broken for Silicoids, but no one plays them anyways.

- Whoever thought an overly happy old lady voice was a good idea to give to the Silicoids is an idiot. Most of the tech research voices are terrible. It's so bad that they have an option to turn it off.

- The cinematic fights have a frequently recurring jitter at certain angles. Definitely does not look as good as Endless Space.

Conclusion

It's not a terrible game. It's just Endless Space Lite. The main problem is that there are many other games in this genre that are better including Endless Space. If only they just released an HD version of MOO2. If only. Development would have been way cheaper AND more there would have been more sales. 

This would have been an amazing game if they didn't waste so much money and time into voice acting. I have a feeling that management just wanted an excuse to meet with the Star Trek and Star Wars actors.",1676879912,1677316735,True,5,0,0.554551005363464355,0,True,False,False

Just to be Clear - The negative review is just crushing disappointment.
But yet I can't help but be impressed with how cynically the publishers tapped into the nostalgic impulses in my brain.

Yes it is MOO2, but they managed to take out all of the interesting parts or tactical and strategic nuance.
It is a copy of the original 4X game, and then promptly doesn't do anything new or interesting, from an update of an over 20 year old game.

If you want a prettier Masters of Orion 2 clone - Stars in Shadow is a pretty fair copy and while not as pretty as this outing, it does tap into what made the 20 year old game great.

If you want a game where challenges and play styles are asymetrical between factions  - the Endless games are very good with interesting story telling.

If you want THIS exact game but done better, ZeroSums - Stardrive 2 is worth a look, just use the mods and be prepared that he will probably never get round to actually finishing the game.

In short, on my one Vanilla play through, I was hoping for something interesting to happen, but it never did.

Also didn't help was that I won through the intergalactic version of ""The Big Short""

This is a boring game - it is that simple.

In fact, it is so boring that I struggle to find subjects and themes to write about in this review, but it is reviving through my mind like sludge, so, here goes...

I do not like there is not a campaign.
Maybe I am too old and traditional, but I like the campaign, the expertly crafted levels, and the story to take me through and CARE about the game.
However, this game only offers randomly generated maps with randomly generated enemies - SNORE!

Then, it does the Civ games nonsense where a nearby enemy is OP very early in the game.
For example, I chose the first style of map and number of opponents by clicking through, which brought me to a ""small"" map with 5 opponents.
I bumped into an opponent 5 FUC KING turns in, and they already had 3 war spaceships, whereas I started with a colony ship, two scout ships, and one war spaceship.
It is impossible to create that many war spaceships in that amount of time - even if a player had the resources!

No.

Also, the game does the chickensh it Civ thing of introducing random space pirates in a long cleared away area from nowhere.

The game inevitably begins in a hospitable solar system, which I can quickly colonize - cool.
Then, often, the nearest system which the game indicates had a ""Terran"" or hospitable planets, which I would carefully direct and, balance and husband my resources to create a colony ship (which takes many fuc king turns to create from the ONE colonized planet), would have a planet which was marginally suitable and took like 60 turns to be anything worth anything.

60 turns!

Yes, it is neat to explore in a huge map all the different planets, but soon it gets boring and repetitive, because there are really only so many types of planets.

Combat and strategy is over-simplistic, and I can simply create fortresses at strategic choke-points.

I found myself asking - WHY?

Why in the absence of a campaign with a clear goal would I want to trudge through turns, and turns, and turns of tedium to advance ever so slightly, I guess?

I gave up when I found a ""Gaia"" planet in the bottom corner on my side and while I was sending a colony ship, a transport ship and a space factory with it at different intervals, a flyspeck space pirate appeared from NOWHERE in a space I had already thoroughly cleared and threatened this endeavor which took HOURS to create and more HOURS to rectify.

It's a great blend of both with elements of its own. At first I wasn't sure about the real time combat but it's been implemented really well and makes trying different weapon styles more enjoyable. Seeing those Gauss cannon rip up the other guy's battlestation and capital ships is great. The additions of nebulae and asteroids add a bit of variety. The advisers are a nice touch and are fun - I can see the designers spent a lot of time getting them right and didn't need to. Voice acting is superb. Calling up the other ambassadors is made quite a lot of fun because of those and the animations.

When you've finally assembled your fleet and think you are ready to take on the winning race who's way ahead of you - suddenly declaring war on them after amassing a huge fleet on their doorstep is exciting but feels a little disturbing.

All in all - if you liked MOO1 and 2 you'll enjoy this. Really well done! Worth full price.

Obviously, the graphics are superior. The monster animations are nice, and races are portrayed well. With the base game, there are a similar number of races (and most are familiar if you've played the old games) and more that you can purchase. The AI isn't as bloodthirsty as its predecessors, but that may be good or bad for you. I kind of miss the urgency MoO2 had to the beginning of the game. 

A few things that are glaringly absent: combat isn't turn based. While the RTS style they use is okay, I miss the turn based system from before. Also, your ships don't level anymore. No more fleets of green, regular, and elite ship crews. They're all just NPCs now. Diplomacy would have been a good thing to fix. Like in the older games, AI races will declare war on you for seemingly no reason whatsoever. Admittedly, it doesn't seem to be as bad as the previous games, but it's still not very realistic. GNN is just... well, it's a hard nope for me. It's trying way too hard to be funny, and it comes off worse than Dad jokes. I just turned that shit off.

I like the addition of anomalies and pirate attacks. It takes a bit of the boredom out of the beginning since the AI doesn't usually try to hit you very early.

I think it could do with a little more balancing though. There's really no need for larger ships when you can kill about anything in the game by Zerging it with a horde of frigates and destroyers.

All in all, if you liked the older games, this one is pretty good and familiar enough to strike a chord or two within you.",1640462971,1676046974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Reminds me of Civilization IV in a way. It's kinda like Civilization IV in space. Which is awesome.

[b]The main difference between Master of Orion (MoO) and other 4x space games on Steam is its focus.[/b] 
While all other titles strive to deliver in dept game systems and have a steep learning curve, MoO went back to the basics and focuses on a clean game interface with a simple approach to pretty much everything. 

It also puts a large emphasis on presentation as all races have their own ships, population icons, voiced advisors, leader and spy pictures and so on. In fact, the entire game is voiced from race selection, over advisors, to GNN the funny news channel informing you about important events throughout the universe. In terms of accessibility there are no sub menus to get lost in, managing population or ships in a fleet is as simple as to drag them around, the most complex thing is weaponry and its fire directions.


[b]Now to the cost of keeping it simple[/b]: 
The game has some major cons, that have been ironed out by other titles and their advanced systems in systems, very typical for older games where game creators had not put as much thought into things:

Since there is nothing limiting your expansion, the only viable way of playing is to forward settle as many good planets as possible, build many buildings on them to out-tech and out economy your AI adversaries - a pure numbers game. This also means you are at the total mercy of the random galaxy creation when you start a new game. [i]There is an option for balanced starts... but it doesn't work[/i]. It is possible to not get a single immediately life supporting planet anywhere near your home world, while someone else gets a system with three large earth like planets right next to their home star. Last game I had to restart FIVE times until I had something I deemed acceptable, far from perfect but playable - it's a major annoyance.

The second negative aspect of this is how incredibly stupid the AI acts. They too are just a numbers game in the form of a disposition bar that swings more left to hated or right to loved. Pacifying an AI is relatively easy if you gift them on a regular basis and make trade treaties. On the other hand AI does not take no for an answer and acts like a diplomatic elephant in a porcellain store. 

[i]Example a[/i]:
If you support a much weaker race with money and tech while they are at war with someone else, they will love you for it and their opponent dislike you - so far, so logical. But then it is inevitable that the weaksauce will ask you to go to war with them - which is a big deal, but declining will instantly drop your relations enormously. Yet, even if you said no and took the relationship penalty, then rebuild your good terms with them, they will ask again. They have zero regards for your stance of saying no as well as your continued support, even if they depend on you for economic survival. 

[i]Example b[/i]:
If the AI decides they want to trade something with you, they also get mad for declining. Normally a trade should be something that is either accepted or not no harm no foul. But in MoO aliens see it differently. They might offer you a tech you don't need at all and demand something you're not willing to give up in return. Or want star charts you do not want to share... not only will they like you a little less for declining, they will keep asking again and again and again, until you are basically at the brink of war.

Now, the AI is no push over even on normal. They will build strong fleets and take your worlds. But it mostly stems from settling really everything, even barren worlds, very early on and always instantly knowing when an obstacle (monster) is being removed by the player so they'll send colony ships from everywhere right away and you have to have your own ship ready. 
As well as spamming small ship fleets. In other games small ship spam has been eliminated through more complicated battle systems - in MoO it still beats technologically superior large ships when you have more small guns pointing at them. It should be noted that a major fleet loss will pretty much lead to the AI taking most of your worlds if their own fleet did not get crippled as well. They act very goal oriented here.

This game did also not receive a lot of post launch attention and bugs never got fixed. It's nothing too bad though, the one things that bugs me is how assigning roles to your ships in their building screen uses the wrong role if you changed another ships before it, so you have to slide it back to what you actually wanted.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
If you can look past these obvious flaws, you get an otherwise really nice simple strategy game. Wether you are new to the genre, or don't want to think things through too hard after a long day at work, or are a dad looking to get your children into 4X - Master of Orion would be the perfect choice. The only limitation for small children I would make is to deactivate the Alteran encounters as their herald looks pretty scary.",1670555818,1670555818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Longer: I've played Master of Orion since it came out 30 years ago and was super impressed with how much this mimics the gameplay of the original and hit my nostalgia bone in the exact right place.

I generally stick to Civilization on turn-based 4X games and don't have much experience playing any kind of space based 4X game other than Master of Orion, but I played Stellaris for the first time a few weeks ago and saw some obvious comparisons between the two and will help explain what I see as the main differences.

Both Stellaris and Master of Orion are pretty similar in colonizing planets/star systems, gathering resources and research while managing very complicated and in-depth diplomacy (or at least way more in depth than anything Civilization offers). 

While Stellaris is kind of a hybrid RTS and Turn-based game, Master of Orion sticks to turn-based only formula which I prefer. Stellaris has a lot of little pop-ups and side quests that come up while exploring, and to me it was difficult to manage everything in real time such as reading side quests and managing tech/build orders while the game is running. Yes, you can pause time to do all these things, but it gets exhausting to me and Stellaris is just too busy and has a much higher learning curve to understand all the nuances. 

Master of Orion is less busy, more streamlined, and arguably more dated overall gameplay experience than Stellaris, but I 100% prefer this version of Master of Orion to the 90s version of Master of Orion and Stellaris.

I do want to mention that combat in Master of Orion is either real time where you control ship and can maneuver around and maximize efficiency of battles, or let the game decide for you quickly; previous version combat was turn based and had a much more archaic and less fun combat system.

At the end of the day, this game may not be for everyone, and the vibe I get from reading reviews is having memories of the original Master of Orion is what tends to win people over with this game; so if you're looking for a faithful recreation of Master of Orion with great new gameplay updates or a less busy and complicated version of Stellaris that is purely turn based, this might be the game for you.",1670352912,1670352912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having to pay for DLC right away to get the addtional races that were in the orginal is pretty shit IMOO however that aside the game is.... ok. 

Its not as good as MOO1 or MOO2 IMOO. Trying to make something better probably was a fools errand anyway but at least someone tries. Honestly I would probably have liked it better if they did not try and replicate the old games and made something new. That being said however as some other reviewers have said this game is pretty slow to play. There are still bugs ( 2022 ) a full 6 years after release which I find odd that they are not being fixed. One of them is when the game goes to try and upgrade a custom ship it will sometimes crash. Its best for you to just manually update the parts on your custom designs even if your going with the recommendations. 

Also you cannot invade minor races for some odd reason. You can blow up there starbase and whatever defenses they have but then you cant do anything else with them as they wont talk to you after that. I wish there would have been some kind of text or something when going to there screen where it stated that you cannot invade this race or some such. Would have been helpful... 

Thats the glaring problem with the game tho is lack of info and unnecessary reasons for some stuff like moving pop from one planet to another that could have helped with pacing and feedback to the player. 
Also combat is just... total shit. Its bad just auto it every time and don't bother. MOO2 had a infinitely better combat system honestly. 

Its not a bad game if you can get it on sale the graphics are good but some of the elements in the game are flawed. I wish I could give it a nutral review rather then then just a up or down but its not bad enough to warrant a non recommendation.",1664668299,1664668299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The tactical combats are also more interesting. When designing a ship you can give it one of three roles in tactical combat (blitzer, brawler, or sniper).  You can set the maximum distance a ship will engage at and a distance that your ships will try to keep between them and enemy ships.  

The usable ""cells"" for each planet size and planet type (volcanic, barren, etc.) is a nice touch.   Pollution is also more realistic, because it only affects food production and takes time for the pollution to build up and time to reduce.

The elimination of fuel cells and the introduction of warp points in systems gives the game a more strategic feel, because you can decide which systems to colonize and which warp points to place a military outpost in order to create choke points and create areas of the galaxy to back-fill at your leisure.  

All in all, MOO CtS is a solid successor to MOO2.  It is not as a wide open free for all that MOO2 is.

The best part of MoO is creating your ships and building a fleet and the tactical space battles, but it takes hundred of turns to get there. I actually think about reading a book because that is more exciting.

I have played MoO 2 decades ago, and it was great at the time but pales in comparison to games in 2022 and beyond.

The Explore phase is boring, is there any events other than gaining a small amount of credits?
The Expand phase is boring, few planets are worth anything and take too long to become worthwhile.
The Exploit phase is boring, you build the same things on every planet in the same order. 
Exterminate is decent, the RTS combat is fine although I rarely need to give out any orders so again it feels boring. Ships don't have enough space to equip most of the fun devices so most of your ships are generic missile or energy or mass driver boats.

The voice acting is awful but it might be that the dialogue is awful and not the voice actors.
The GNN and Galactic council screens are cringe worthy, really really bad. I couldn't turn these off fast enough.
You watch each leader for 15 seconds say how they will vote, and they always either vote for themselves or abstain......at least it's skippable by slamming esc.

This game is a remake of MoO II but I can't believe they didn't try to make some things more interesting. Leaders have the most boring traits like +10% to industry or +10% to energy weapons. They level up and now it's 15 % to industry....

One of the reasons MoO2 was great was because they wasn't any other good 4X games out there, sadly MoO2 doesn't hold up.",1655679275,1655679275,False,4,0,0.5141562819480896,0,True,False,False

It's like an odd cross between Endless Space and Master of Orion 2 with some tweaked bits.  Planetary management is similar to Master of Orion 2, but navigating between systems is more like Endless Space.  The revamped Espionage system is mor ehands-on and offers a much more nuanced control over how your agents carry out their missions.  

Pros:
- Graphics are pretty nice
- Ship auto-design is decent enough, upgrading fleets is fairly simple.
- Ability to automate battle either by a single click on in cinematic mode (a la Endless Space.)
- GNN is as hilarious as ever.

Cons:
- Seemingly arbitrary limits on how your citizens are assigned jobs
- Space navigation is no longer the sandbox , go-anywhere style.
- Lack of planetary terraforming options.  They're now ""Uber"" planet picks you have to choose using racial points.
- Menus seem to be a bit laggy.
- Tech Tree seem to be a bit short.  ship designs stop improving, and there's no automatic miniaturization as your overall tech improves.

Others:
- No government types, some of the traits/bonuses associated with Orion 2's government type are now tied to racial traits.  This can make a lot of races kind of flat.
- While there are more nuanced traits to pick from for custom races, there just aren't enough points to go around and make something really unique.

Meanwhile seemingly nothing important has changed, the producer and devs are deaf to the concerns of the players. There is nothing I can do about it (I already invested wa too much time and effort, I was forced to spend twice more time in the forum than playing the game - I really wanted this game to become good - but the effort was - obviously - in vain). What I can do is that I will NEVER EVER AGAIN buy a game from either ***NGD STUDIOS*** or ***WARGAMING LABS***. These two inept, ignorant, jaded and greedy hustler companies stopped existing for me. The combination of inability in coding and total ignorance of al the customers and fans of Master of Orion is way too bad.[/h1][/b]


 
EDIT: [b][h1]One of the worst game experience I've ever had. MoO was given to NGD studios which had no experience in making 4X strategy games. And then they left 2 month ago leaving behind an unfinished game.[/h1]

It is not only the total failure of space combat which I discovered first, there are zilliion of things, from missing informaton about own units, huge balance issues, bugs bugs bugs, and an AI who is totally sucking. NGD tried to learn along the way of making their first 4X game but when Victor Kislyi pulled the plug ... everything left ever since in the state. This game should still be early access. When I am playing MoO I discover so many issues, that I spend much more time in the forum reporting and describing issues and looking for a solution fo them. Leaning back and enjoy a game is something different...[/b]


The game has a great awesome potential but in the present state I can *not* recommend this game.

There are heavy issues (quasi non-existing multiplayer, bad game design aspects which lead that you have to colonize a lot of small planets rather than a few large planets and therefore you lose yourself in mid and end game in too much colonies with too much details instead of having only a few strong planets and clear overview and your head free to think about strategy and decisions instead of doing tons of micromanagmentg - examples for that: growth penalty on large and huge planet and pollution penalty on large and huge planets with big population and strong industry - many small planets with in summary same strong industry suffer not the same pollution penalty, then bugs bugs bugs, a ton of heavy balance issues resp. AI stupidity - even on the hardest difficulty you beat the AI at first attempt, and the developers from NGD studos have abandoned the game, not a word from them and from Wargaming (who has the intellectual property of MoO)  since two months.

One of the big things is the TOTAL FAILURE OF SPACE COMBAT: The AI is not shooting back if you keep your distance: 

With a weak ship you can destroy much bigger KI fleets: You use missiles and the AI only uses beam weapons (which have a shorter range).  If you keep your distance you can fire missile after missile after missile while the KI fleet does not fire a single shot back - simply because ther weapons are out of range and they dont build fast ships to quickly bridge the distance.

You dont have to research and build good ships and weapons and shields, armor etc. and build huge armies, if a single weak ship with some lousy missiles is enough to win vs KI even on the hardest difficulty.


[b]THIS IS A TOTAL DEAL BREAKER![/b]


Furthermore there is no up-to-date manual and apart from the new stuff in the outdated manual even many of the older things are not explained e.g. that population on small planets growth faster (that is a pretty important thing which you might easily miss to discover if you don't know it), how armor penetration and armor resilience is working (these two terms are in the short tutorial - but missing in the manual), how ground combat is working, etc.


[B]THE GAME HAS A GREAT POTENTIAL  - IF ONLY IT WOULD BE USED BY SOME CARING DEVELOPERS.[/B]


Basically we paid for the game and now it is up to us to fix it. If you did not buy the game I would check back in half a year, because there are many things you can not just mod, in order to improve those things you have to change the code. And btw I don't like the idea that you first have to do your bachelor in MoO and install a ton of mods before you can enjoy your game


Should the developers ever come back and fix the space combat system and the other things then I will write a new review.

BTW: The space combat is in real time though the game is round based. that alone is strange,  but I could forgive it if only it would work with an AI who is able to shoot back in a space battle. There is a guy who writes one game fix mod after another - but the devs do not even apply these fixes in a new version. It is beyond me how you can willingly keep some known bugs for which even a resolution have been found.

But, the space battles... They are pretty to watch, but the only thing you do is put the fleet together. Useing the above mentioned games, in CIV you can put ranged units behind melee. In this game it doesn't matter that I have seen. You have ships with only missles and a few with only lasers, they all bumb-rush the oponent and open fire, en-masse. In Endless Space the battle plays out as well, but before the battle you can choose a stratagy, which was reserched . AND when you have point defence ships they fire away until all incoming missles, fighters & bombers are destroyed. In this game they only defend the ship they are on. AND Missle ships tend to stayat Max distance or try to keep the point defence ships between them and the enemy. And the only ships Bumb-Rushing the enemy have short ranged wepons with a shorter cooldown time.
 But having this said it stands on its own and is a game I enjoy playing. I think most people who like CIV style games will like this. It was worth the money I spent like 13 bucks for the game and 3 dlc races.

 After dowloading the x5 mods, there are 3 of them, I have very little if anything negitive about this game. Only, why didn't the developers do this?

First and foremost, if you are playing a large galaxy with lots of aliens (as I like), the size of your saved games will soon exhaust your google drive.  The game provides a feature which allows you to return to a prior turn without actually saving the game at that turn. This leads the size of saved games (even if it's just the one you're playing) to grow in a VERY non-linear way. I have to ask why? I can save my own games, and I don't really feel the need to preserve the game state at the start of every, single turn.

This version continues the limited travel between star systems which was created for v3. Okay, I'm not happy about the restriction, but I can live with that change.

I played 3 games, with the first two aborted early (see below). Even when I solved some issues in that 3rd (and final ever) game, my summary judgment is that if you like to watch paint dry, you will absolutely love this game.  EVERYTHING takes LONGER than it should, even the visual movement of your fleets - turn, creep across their route, turn again - it looks nice the first time, but by the hundredth time you've seen it, you'll get my point.

Then there's the fact that next turn sometimes doesn't mean next turn in population growth. If you're timing your growth to fill a colony type vessel, the settler (a farmer) is removed first; so, your food falls short pushing pop growth back a turn. (Why not take a worker who finished production for that turn?) Of course, you can go back to the last turn and put in an extra farmer (unless all your ""slots"" are filled - the number of farmers and workers is limited well below max pop, unlike MOO 2).

And all food must be produced on the planet (or, later game, in the system) where it's used. (Really? You can move people and armies, but not food?) So, ""barren"" worlds allow some farming?? It just seems to defy logic.

I also have to ask why left over production (especially after a buy out) is NOT reflected in the first turn buy out price of the next item. It does show up later, but that's some major BS.

Then there's all those bar graphs. Pretty, but some actual numbers would be a good deal more useful, especially when you're doing late stage (big numbers) research.  It's a real pain to find yourself a fingernail's depth short. Either you basically waste an entire turn of research (no carry over here), or go back to find a few more points, which it would have been nice to know was all I needed before I went through that long, draw out inter-turn.

Oh, did I mention how LOOOOOOONG everything takes. Late stage ""load game"" is a 10 minute operation. ""Next turn"" takes almost as long.

Also, the game likes to be boss. It will move your focus as it sees fit, override your zoom setting, and (another waste of time) zoom out and back in when you ""Move Next Fleet."" UGH! Just go there; if I need context, I'll zoom out. Or, better yet, just leave my zoom setting alone entirely.

Now, as to the first 2 games, I was jammed with 2 of 7 races into 1/4 of the galaxy. Unstable warp points, only passable with mid-level [turn 150?] tech, blocked access to everything else. GRRR! Turns out that is an UNDOCUMENTED feature of selecting your galaxy shape (""correctly"" chosen in 3rd game obviated the restriction). I only discovered this ""effect"" when reading another player's comments.

Finally, those first two games were whacked by disaster after (random event) disaster.  In my first (very easy?????) game a turn 50 settlement was attacked by the Antarans on turn 83 and then a turn 105 settlement attacked on turn 127. In MOO2 Antarans never attacked before turn 130, and MOO2 progressed much faster (I made MOO2 turn 130 equivalent around turn 250 here).  In another game, a turn 50 disaster basically destroyed my first colony, and that session.

I can take a hint. It's being-hit-on-the-head lessons in here, and I don't like it. Bye.",1643978659,1646666527,False,7,1,0.482774347066879272,0,True,False,False

The biggest improvement over the old titles I found was that the aliens are better balanced - not perfectly, but better. There are far fewer dud games, though the same few aliens still usually rise to the top.

The disappointment was in the missing 10% of fun they took away from the previous games (1 and 2. 3 must not be spoken of).

4/10

This could as easily be a ""No"" recommendation. Like so many, I want to like this game. I still remember the amazing experience of Moo 1, and have continued to play Moo 2 for over 20 years. Given the failure of Moo 3, I really looked forward to this version (Moo 4!) And,..

Hollywood keeps trying to remake classic films, and usually they are disappointing failures (think remakes of Valley Girl, Pelham 1, 2, 3, Godzilla, King Kong, and so forth.) Moo 4 is in this vein. It's a terribly disappointing and flawed game, but not the worst time waster if you buy it on sale for under $5. (I see it settling at $1.79 like many much older games in a few years.) You can have fun playing the game, and it is an improvement over the utterly failed Moo 3. But after you play for a while you realize how seriously flawed and pointless this edition is. 

The game began ambitiously enough. The intro graphics are good, if brief. The voice-acting was first-rate, including greats like Mark Hamill, John DeLancie, Dwight Schultz, Robert Englund, and Michael Dorn. The galaxy map and world graphics are an improvement, but maybe not as much as expected after almost 30 years of Moo. The rival leaders are well animated and drawn, and then voiced by a good cast of real actors. And, unlike Moo 3, all your favorites are here, including the Elerians, Bulrathi, and a new Terran race. And GNN is back too, if somewhat annoying. All of the familiar 4X elements are present, from starlanes to tactical battles. And ship design is as good as ever (the real core of Moo.) So, what could be wrong? 

It almost looks like the developers gave up or ran out of time/money when they shipped this, and over 6 years later have no intention of completing or repairing this effort (there are Mods, and they even built modding into the Steam version, basically leaving it to the fans to fix.) The absolute WORST aspect of Moo 4 is there is no Hall of Fame! That's right. In every 4X game you play for two goals: to beat others in multi-player, or to best your own score and build the biggest, best empire you possibly can. After a while you realize that your instinct to colonize every world, max out the populations, conquer every enemy, etc., is just pointless. When you meet one of no less than SIX victory conditions (you can disable these), you win. No victory screen, no HoF entry, no nothing. It's a real let-down after playing an lengthy and intensive game. In lieu of ""winning,"" you get Steam achievements. So, you can try to win a diplomatic victory as the Silicoids, or a military one as the Psilons, if you want to earn all the badges, 

Also, the expected graphic upgrades are uneven. Leaders, the galaxy, and planets look nice. But colony development is very blah, with ugly square 'buildings' plopped on the surface. Inferior to Moo 2. Ship designs are limited, and each class is portrayed identically on the map anyway. Ground combat is essentially Moo 1, lacking even the limited combat graphics of 2 & 3. Space battles are another thing. You can resolve these automatically, which is recommended, especially for large battles, or in 3D. 3D looks cool, but is hard to control and runs choppy, even on a 8 gb GPU. (You can allow the AI to run the battle and just watch the pretty, if slow, screens.) This was another exciting idea of the designers that appears to have fallen short. 

The victory conditions are too many and, as with other 4X reboots like Civ4, can be annoying when you ""win"" by surprise. You can (and should) disable many of these at the start screen if you want a longer game. In addition to the usual win by conquest, election, or defeating Antares, you can conquer the galactic stock market, achieve a scientific  victory, or just get the high score by the end of a timed period (which can be disabled.) But even here the game is annoying. The Galactic Council cannot meet until ALL races have met each other. This is hard to actually make happen, especially when smaller empires stay cramped in corners of the galaxy. I have played several games and yet to have a meeting. (Mods have apparently fixed this.) And attacking Antares requires acquiring 4 ruins asteroids and exploiting them, which usually necessitates invading your neighbors. 

And there is the infamous ""slow-down"" effect as you get into later turns. 

The Antarans are also a problem. They appear to be attracted to attack whatever system has the largest fleet, even early in the game (like one frigate.) Apparently the goal is to add balance, but it is really annoying. Even worse, it can be spoofed. Instead of fighting the Antarans, lead them to a shielded planet, leave before they arrive, and let them drop a few bombs on the shield (ineffective) and they go home. The Antaran fleets only get stronger if you defeat them, so why bother? 

There are some new features that are improvements. You can convert asteroids and gas giants into planets even in systems without colony planets. You can build military outposts (forts) at jump points, as well as listening posts, labs. gas mines, etc. You can choose different galaxy types which actually lead to different movement rules and numbers of empires. Some races even have their own alternate ""Gaia"" worlds, suitable to their physiology. And, while somewhat dull, custom race building is a lot more balanced. No more omniscient, telepathic, creative feudalisms. (Unfortunately, there are no government types any more.) Also, you can now build advanced colony ships that add Automatic Factories, a basic lab, and hydroponic farm to a new colony, a nice time saver. Maybe the best improvement is a much expanded and improved espionage system.

But a lot is also missing, You can only build one Death (Doom) Star per empire. Why? No governments types, all are just you. Also, there is no in-game documentation of techs, weapons, etc. You need to refer to the online manual. or download it. And tech descriptions are often sketchy. So, should I develop Fusion Beams? I have no idea what they do until I have them and am adding them to a ship. Movement is slow, even at advanced tech levels. And some useful advances, like fighter bases, don't exist at all. In fact, planetary defense is something of a joke. Antaran fleets (and your enemies, if they could ever get it together) bash aside star fortresses and orbital batteries with ease, although shields are much harder to defeat. 

Bottom-line: You can spend some enjoyable hours with this game, but in the end it is rather unsatisfying with the lack of benchmarks (HoF) and some missing elements that made the earlier versions fun. But for a few bucks, it is OK. But no way is it worth $25 retail. With modding, it gets better. But I would not pay the developer full-price for a game that owes much to volunteer modders. 

And here is some good news: For a mere $6 normally (and less, on sale) you can buy Moo 1 & 2 as a bundle. And both, especially Moo2, are much more complete and playable games. And compared to this version, Moo 2 is not all that primitive. Enjoy!",1646361416,1646361416,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dull and boring.  Uninspired.  For kids.  I really tried to like this game but there's nothing interesting here and the game is easy enough that even higher level difficulties don't help challenge.  I would call it cookie cutter but even generic samey cookies are better than no cookies and if Conquer the Stars was the only 4x game available I'd probably switch genres.  There are signs of inspiration here, dashes of talent and effort but that's only when you're watching the various NPCs.  NPCs are animated, distinct and interesting to watch and listen to but that seems inevitable since the hiring manager for voice talent for this game seems to have just wanted to meet all these celebrities and used the game as an excuse.  But aside from the NPCs this game is awful.

There's a lot of hand-holding and most systems are automated.  You -can- design your own starships, but there's rarely any need as the AI can't keep up anyways so there's little difference between hitting the ""Upgrade All"" button and intricately designing a killer ship.  You can develop the best path for a colony to grow but all colonies end up being samey and uninspiring and it makes just as much sense to hit the autobuild and leave them alone..  

Galaxies are small and uninteresting to look at with one star per system and star systems only have a couple points of interest.  There's a difference between simplistic to the point where information is distilled down to the most important parts (see original Master of Orion) and being boring an uninteresting.  Star systems look all the same after a while, orbital distances are always identical and I never felt a sense of discovery or exploration when entering a new system.  If you've seen one CTS star system you've seen them all.  Literally.  There's not too much available in terms of different art assets.

I wanted to avoid comparisons to Stellaris because Stellaris is widely considered the dominant 4x space game right now and it feels unfair because they're very different games.  Stellaris is designed to be complex, big, epic and cinematic with an emphasis on the exploration and grandeur and vastness of space.  It creates a sense of literally anything being possible and that space is just -waiting- to rip you apart.

CTS is designed to offer the most minimalist experience one can have and still be called a 4x game. It's good for kids under 10, I suppose.  They can learn the basics of 4x but the same can be said of Candyland being an appropriate introduction to table top wargaming and RPGs.  CTS is cute and dull, flat and unimaginative.  If you want to introduce someone to 4x games you could give them MOO1.  Or MOO2.  Or Pax Imperia: Emminent Domain.  Or the Galactic Civilizations games.  Sword of the Stars 1.

Mechanics for exploration are micro-managed but nothing happens during that management.  Who cares what class a planet is or whether it's Rich or Poor.  These values don't matter much.  More planets = Win.  Technology research feels like asking Mom for a toy at the store and she tells me to pick one.  Combat is boring and uninteresting to watch or participate in, not that your participation really changes outcomes all that much.  It was so easy to pull ahead of the computer that most wars are effectively over at 10 turns and the rest is just convincing the AI that you won already.

Overall just a big disappointment.  Occasionally I reinstall just to make sure I wasn't being harsh, play for 20 minutes and then realize I was actually being nicer than CTS deserves and delete again.  I just wish CTS realized that more than 8 year olds play video games.

(Update for 2022)

Started playing MOO and MOO2 again this year so I thought I'd try out CTS and see if it had gotten any better.  No patches, no releases, no new DLC.  I bought all the DLCs for the races but unlike Stellaris, there are no new game mechanics to go along with their race pack releases.

The same bugs that existed before still exist.  If you use the cinematic camera view in battles the ships jitter and shake as the camera tries to keep up with them which just looks awful.  Like freshman college 3d animation work.  What's worse is that there have been no new editions, galaxies are still pitifully, ridiculously, comically small and there's no way to ever have all the races in the game in the same galaxy as each other.  

I give up, this game just plain sucks.  I like it even less now than when I was first disappointed by it not being a ""better MOO2"".  And after years and years of regular, large content updates and DLCs from Stellaris I can safely say that the only thing CTS offers is inspiration for a mod for Stellaris bringing over all the playable races.

Man, I really looked forward to this too.  Such a waste of voice work and character animations.  Even mods don't always work correctly and some cause constant crashes.  Not that it's the modders fault that basic features like galaxy generation and number of opponents selections are, for lack of a better term, neutered.

Actually, yes, that's the perfect way to describe CTS in 2022: A neutered 4X game.",1597678259,1645510116,False,5,0,0.498793870210647583,0,True,False,False

It still was a bad investment.

They kept it somewhat close to MoO2 in some points, but changed others. The problem is that the things they have changed made the things they didn't change no longer work.
For example MoO2 was an open galaxy kind of game. You could fly anywhere, but you were heavily restricted by range. All fleets were automatically hostile to each other, but that did not matter since nobody could get to you.

They changed from free movement to star lanes. I don't even think that this is a bad idea. Star lanes have many advantages in terms of game design. However all fleets are still automatically hostile and now everybody can reach anybody (in your locked in area of space which everybody shares). Which means that everything you are building will be destroyed by someone. Any scoutship that encounters anyone will be shot down. And if it isn't the other races, then it is pirates beelining to your new building project (or colony ship) from halfway across the galaxy.

Which changed the game from an open galaxy exploration (with defense being mostly a colony thing - and most of your space being defended by range) to basically building walls/strongpoints and operating behind them. The map in this game becomes more like a board game where you try to block choke points to secure space.  It feels very small.
There is a certain fantasy that people want to fulfill when they play a specific kind of game. And this mechanic kills the fantasy. It's not enjoyable.

This also applies to the Orion System itself. It used to be in the middle of the map and everyone had more or less the same chances of reaching it. Now with the travel restrictions Orion is in someone's territory (and not even close to the galactic center for some reason). Everyone else is unable to get there (without declaring war to several other races or opening your borders to several races). The first few playthroughs I never even knew Orion existed. And even after beating it a couple of times... you just have won by the time you can get to Orion. There's little to no point to it.

Right away, in the first 5 minutes or so, the game welcomes you with bad polish. Like the opening developer cutscenes not being skippable. The first time I tried to start a new game it froze. Custom races need to be redefined every single game. The build queue is horrible to operate. 
The UI is confused. For some reason they replaced hovering the mouse and explanatory tooltipps/popups with the need to click on things to see details in some other control. Which I don't get at all. Did they think they were making a smartphone app in the beginning? How does that happen?

I was warned by the bad reviews. The game quickly gave me an impression that they were right. And nothing happened to make up for the initial impression.

I will probably play it again and maybe even invest some time into it. But for me it is the kind of game that I play because I want to figure out how to beat it (and then forget it). Not the kind of game that I would play because it is fun/engaging and keeps me coming back.

If you are looking for a good MoO2-like 4x play Interstellar Space. Or MoO2 (between the three I would prefer MoO2, even today, but IS came pretty close).",1644707100,1645375237,False,5,0,0.499925911426544189,0,True,False,False

I really wanted to love this game having enjoyed Master Of Orion 1, 2 and 3 first time around as well as in the collectors edition, HOWEVER there are far too many BUGS in this game for it to be playable. 

Aside from the random and infuriating game crashes, at some point during the game it stops completely and gets stuck on ""processing turn"". The only way around this is Alt-F4, reload and try again. 99% of the time it will get stuck again and have to start a new game. This can happen randomly on turn 15 or turn 125 (the highest I've been able to get without game breaking.

Ultimately the Game is very seamless and interesting in the beginning but after the midway point of a match which varies, the game quickly losses the same special charm and turns into a very limited 4X.

Who wouldn't like this? again just my opinion but people who play 4X games which are famous for the numerous choices you can make, they might find this game overly restrictive, and even poorly made.

Likes 
The Cinematic Galaxy, from the very beginning the game tries to make the Galaxy feel alive.
The Unique Races, each are special and offer a fresh perspective on the Galaxy.
The Easy UI, and Simple approach to 4X strategy game.

Some positives and negatives:
+ The planet graphics are very nice and probably the biggest improvement over Master of Orion 2.

+ The tech tree is, for the most part, copy-pasted from Master of Orion 2. This includes the innovative ""you can only research 1 out of 3 possible objectives"" mechanic.

+ Designing your ships yourself with a slate of techs is cool (copied mostly wholesale from MoO2)

+ They, at least, made an attempt to add tactical combat. More than you can say for 99% of the post-MoO2 4X space games.

+ Espionage is slightly better than in MoO2 (but still not great).


- For some reason the dev team got confused about what they were building and made this game partly into a tower defense game. There are limited paths from each star, only allowing you to go to certain other stars. You can have stars right next to each other where you can't travel between them without following some convoluted maze. This makes no sense in the context of the game world and is annoying gameplay-wise. 

- On top of this, the ships can for the most part only move 1 ""area"" per turn. ""Area"" meaning planet to planet, planet to warp point, warp point to other warp point. This is regardless of what engine technology you research. The net result is that moving your ships anywhere is mind-numbingly slow. Even at end game it'll take you a minimum of 3 turns to move a ship from a planet in one system to a planet in an adjacent system. It absolutely ruins the gameplay. Because of this point alone, I will never play this game again.

- The tactical combat feels like a demo that a few programmers whipped up in a couple days. It is completely inferior to the detailed combat in MoO2 where you were encouraged use specific weapons in specific scenarios and methodically figure out where to move your ships next. In this game you'll almost always just be making minor adjustments to what your ships are choosing to do on their own, which never involves any strategy. The formations feature seems completely broken as I've never gotten it to successfully work. For some reason there are speed sliders (why would you ever want your ship not at full speed?). I'm sorry, but 2D tactical space combat is superior. I've never seen a dev do a good job with 3D 4X space combat. FTL showed the world how to do fantastic tactical space combat over a decade ago and yet no one seems to have gotten the hint to copy them.

- The fleet management in this game sucks. You have no way of assigning names or hotkeys to your fleets (or ships). The creation of fleets is completely haphazard- a fleet is created if ships happen to be sitting in the same area doing the same activity. This means in late game when you actually have a lot of ships and want to keep groups of them together and not have them mix accidentally, it's next to impossible.

- Trade deals were overpowered in MoO2 but in this game they are insanely overpowered. From early to mid-late game, they give you many multiples what you might earn from your colonies alone. I don't have a problem with trade deals being lucrative, but I have a problem with them being so unbalanced in comparison to what colonies can earn on their own.

- Capturing enemy ships is not in the game

- Ship veterancy is not in the game. This was a crucial aspect in MoO2 (and is in most 4X games) so its absence really sucks.

- The end-game sucks for a bunch of reasons:

  - Inexplicable limit of 1 Doom Star per civilization. Why would you put a limit on the coolest and most powerful ships in the game?

  - Once a planet is full, your excess food is useless (unlike in MoO2 where it could be shipped to other planets or sold)

  - Once you've exhausted the research tree, your science points are useless (unlike MoO2, where you'd research hyper-advanced techs that offered additional miniaturization benefits)

  - Going to Antares just takes you directly into a battle screen. No cutscene or anything cool about it.

  - No end game cutscenes after achieving victory

  - The economic victory condition involves investing in some galactic stock market which offers no other benefits than points towards the economic victory

- The ship design screen is a mess. When you make modifications to a weapon you can't directly see how much space it takes up. You have to just add it and then see how much your available space decreased by. It's this way with lots of other stats too. Why hide statistics from the user? In short, it looks a little cooler but is vastly lower in utility than the comparable screen from MoO2.

- For some reason, you're offered 2 models per class of ship to choose from. But if you choose the alternative model, it will not appear in icons or on the main map. Only the primary model ever appears.

- Invading a planet just sort of throws the results on screen. There is no animation, no effect, no dialogue, no nothing.

- The devs forgot or never bothered to offer terraforming for lava or grassland planets.

- Lots and lots of other bugs not mentioned here",1641927856,1641927856,True,185,5,0.905823051929473877,7,True,False,False

Its not a Stellaris clone and considering its pedigree was never meant to be; more old school in the classic struggle for dominance. There are no penalties for going to war, you can be at war the entire game, with everyone, at all times. You can also Ally with everyone, and win diplomatically. You can get open borders with someone one turn, fly your fleet to their Homeworld uncontested, the next turn declare war, and in the deplorable words of Col. Miles Quaritch, ""when we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep, that they won't come within 1,000 parsecs of this place ever again."" The interaction between civilization management and diplomacy is more decoupled, no war wariness, no limits on empire size, or debuffs for being successful.

I will say Galactic Civilization III is probably the better game, go check that out.  Both are very similar in many ways.

It is surprisingly complex for it's price-point, and has a reasonable amount of depth to really go for many different playstyles and strategies.  The tech-tree is pretty deep, and the micromanagement of planets definitely makes large impacts.  It is also simple and easy enough to jump in and start playing after watching a 15 minute youtube gameplay video, unlike games like EUIV where you have to basically watch 8 hours of tutorial to know how to do everything.

There are a variety of races, good graphics, and the combat/battle system seems fairly complex with different weapon types, armor categories, engine and speed differences, as well as weapon facings.  It is worth noting the manual battles are difficult to control, and most experienced players resort to auto-resolving everything.

Now for some negatives.  You need deep research of a specific far-teched military troop invasion in order to conquer an enemy planet, and must spend dozen[s] of turns getting an army from one of your worlds to one of theirs.  I will say other space games similar to this also have similar barriers, but im not sure I like the forced tech down a specific line every game if you want to conquer anybody.  

I played my first game on a cluster based galaxy, this was probably a mistake because the ONLY way to travel between distant star points is again a very specific technology far down the tech tree.  I recommend a normal spiral galaxy, even then you are limited in exploration until again, you reach a specific technology down a specific path fairly deep into the mid-game.

The Good
Pretty much everything, has the 4x down and the alien interaction is excellent.  You can really build a relationship with alien neighbors, one you can count on, and the game has a great GUI to let you know how your diplomatic efforts are going.  Tech tree captures all the classic MOO technologies.   The custom alien design, excellent as always.  Just note the pre-made alies break the design rule having far more build points than normally allowed.  Nevertheless is satisfying to win against such opponents and the game is challenging but not impossible to win.

The Bad
Ship combat.   The user interface and controls are too high level, not intuitive at all, hard to use and no where explained.  This was not the case in MOO 1 or MOO 2.  I love that the battle spaces have stuff in them that can be used to advantage BUT with limited or no ability to control ship movement or weapon use it is pointless.  

For example, despite on-line videos and tutorials have found no way to tell a ship to hold off firing a weapon (in old MOO games you could click to turn it off) this is critical to tactics as many good weapons have such a long cool down you get one shot really.  It very much is an issue with missiles as they have a long cool down and also there are certain defenses that trigger on the first missile so staggered missile waves are the way to defeat them.

The controls you do have are not great AI, like stay at a certain range, fire at a  certain range etc.  They require micromanaging to work as advertised.

In all this makes fighting the Antarans at home impossible as one must use tactics to defeat them, sheer numbers and tech wont do it.

The Ugly
Nothing ugly about this game.

The best way to describe it - take Master of Orion 2, change a few things, upgrade graphics and here you are. If it's enough for you then feel free to stop reading this review, but if you want more of a indepth analysis, then continue reading.

As I said before, the base line for this remake was obviously MoO2, however in remake the devs changed quite a few things. Probably the most controversial of the changes is the math behing pollution. During the early access times they change the system quite a few times (3 in total, if I remember correctly), before stopping on the current one. It's decent enough, however, they also changed a few core buildings and technologies that made the pollution really annoying and a general limiting factor for your production. However it also made it possible to send you production into overdrive mode and pollute your planet to oblivion (or to the point of climat changes), so... a plus and a minus from me.
Changes to technologies however are a minus with no redeamiong factors. The process of researching became more unified and less impactfull. There is a high chanse that everyone end up with everything, as there is not that much branching choises. Some tecnologies and buildings are pretty dumb, to the point of total uselessness, like i.e. warehouse, that makes buyouts cost less for all buildings. On paper it should be a decent upgrade, however this building is pretty high up on the tecnology tree (lvl 4 out of 12) and as such require a considerable production or money investment.
But on to the more positive side - combat. Let's face it - as much as I love the indepth combat in MoO2, everyone know that as soon as more then 10 ships are involved in the battle, it becomes a very tedious process.  Here this problem does not exist, as turn-based combat was traded for realtime combat. And devs made their best effort to translate the weapons and abilities into new realities. They were finetuning the combat balance probably the longest before the release, and as such I'd say they've done a really good job. However, the rocketspam is still strong, but there is also a high chanse that you end up on the other end of this, as an AI sometimes takes a liking to that strategy too.
To more of the positive changes - espionage. In most of the instalments of the series, espionage was nothing more than a bunch of numbers. Here it is more personalised, with agents being valuable and loosing one may hurt you a lot.
But the one thing I will never forgive the devs for - the beautifull invasion screen from MoO2 is gone. Now you have more or less MoO1-style invasion instead of a simulated battle animation that was acurately portaiting the numbers of troops, tanks, mechs, even jetpacks!

Each of the empire management screens is well-organized, easily accessible, a pleasure to look at, and easy to understand. Miraculously, the screens are [b]always[/b] available from the top-right corner of the screen, which is a crucial detail that's so often neglected.

The game is fully playable in the sense that you can build ships, use them to settle new colonies, negotiate with your neighbors, spy on them, and blow them up. There are multiple ways to win and the game is free of bugs. There are a couple of clever ideas like having individual spies gain experience and having 'warp points' that connect nearby systems and give you a place to build a powerful defensive outpost or just place some ships in position to intercept. Fans of Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga or Elizabeth Moon's Serrano series will enjoy playing out 'wormhole blockades'.

Unfortunately, I have no further praise for the game. The elaborate real-time combat system is inscrutable and left unexplained by both the manual and the tutorial; I wound up just clicking 'auto-resolve' every battle even though I'm usually a control freak. Despite being a veteran from MOO1 and MOO2, I have no sense of what kinds of ship builds are useful here or how I would coordinate different kinds of ship tactics with different ship designs. The leaders show up with random abilities and there is little reason to care which planet or ship they are assigned to. The planetary buildings mostly just let you collect more of the same basic resources (food, production, and research). The unique planetary resources like ""dark quartz"" also mostly just give you a modest bonus to production or credits. There's no way to trade them with other species.

One of the game's most promising ideas is the 'system administration center,' which lets you export surplus food from large, urban planets to newly settled frontier worlds, and import production from those frontier worlds to help your stellar HQ crank out large projects a little bit faster. The problem with this idea is that systems are too small to really benefit from it -- the average star only has 2 planets, so you really don't wind up doing that much intra-system trade. The system administration centers come relatively late in the tech tree, so they have only a small impact on the game.

As far as trading with alien species, it's fun at first, but most of them keep only a tiny amount of credits in their treasury. As the game continues, the amount of money needed to sign a trade treaty or research treaty keeps increasing, and eventually none of the aliens can afford it. The aliens have no sense of proportion -- they'll offer you 0.1% of your GDP in exchange for declaring war on a powerful enemy. I captured one of their spies a few times, and the aliens never once tried to ransom their prisoner -- but then if I ask them what they'll offer me to get the spy back, they're willing to pay far more than it would cost them to recruit a new spy.

Espionage missions are likewise wildly imbalanced -- the cost and risk of driving an entire world into revolt is similar to the cost of blowing up a random building on that world; the cost of stealing an unimpressive galactic map is comparable to the cost of stealing cutting-edge military technology.

In theory, asteroid belts and gas giants offer interesting extra-solar targets that you can exploit even when you don't have a colony in their system. In practice, they're just not an important source of income -- 6 gas giants (which is nearly all of them on the map) will get you 30 credits a turn, compared to a total empire-wide income of about 1,000 credits per turn. They're literally not worth defending against pirates and rival empires; rather than building a warship to protect them, you'd be better off just building another production building on your core worlds.

I don't think I've ever been this bored playing a 4X game. If you're a graphic design student or UX engineer, buy this game to learn from its example. Otherwise, give it a pass and play the original MOO or Alpha Centauri.",1639111464,1639111464,False,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

Most buildings are not worth building because of high upkeep costs until late in the colony development or not worth the investment at all.  Slow population growth (sometimes 40+ turns to increase worker count by one) slows construction to a crawl.  New colonies are not self sufficient for a huge stretch of turns so you can only create so many before your funds are strained.  Fleet production is expensive and the cost of maintaining planetary defenses is so high building a marine barracks is probably all you'll ever do.  Combine lack of defenses with pirates, Antaries, space monsters, disasters and other races you get a situation where the fleet is constantly being redeployed to put out fires.  This is because ships are slow to build, slow to move into position and heavily limited by cost and fleet cap.  Research goes from useless to usable for 1 out of 5 colonies.

This is not the most complicated or deep space 4X game, but neither were its predecessors. For me, it feels like the right amount of complexity, except in the specific cases where it falls short of its namesake.   

+ I'm not sure about the hyperlanes themselves, but I like the way they've handled movement within a system. It's simple, but adds just enough extra strategy to make it interesting. 

+ The game looks nice, and there are a lot of small touches that help elevate it. Selected fleets point in the direction of your cursor. Ships in hyperlanes have a nice warp effect on them. The UI is light years better than MOO3 (but not 2). 

- The overall tone of the game is much more cartoonish, from the goofy GNN broadcasts, to the voice acting in general, to the Disney-esque animations of the characters. This is probably not a negative for everyone, but it's something that I personally don't like. 

- The Antarans are not mysterious or scary. They remind me more of the Vorcha from Mass Effect than the Antarans of MOO2. Basically space goblins. They show up and gloat and hiss at you, then yell ""We'll get you next time!"" or something else dumb, after you defeat them. The first time they attacked me, with two destroyers and two frigates that I thought would decimate my homeworld in the early game, I was shocked to discover that this elder, interdimensional race was using the same technology as me. Lasers and nuclear missiles on Antaran ships. Weird. 

- There are some aesthetic choices that I don't personally like. The Mrrshan are quite silly now. Basically just furries who use the word pride too much, and show a lot of cleavage for some reason. The new Elerians are generic, looking more like a minor race from a fantasy game than the techsuit-wearing telepaths of MOO2. And I guess the Bulrathi are nature protectors now? I never thought of them that way, but maybe I just missed that somehow. 

- There are various mechanical changes, some of which make sense to me while others don't. The main changes worth mentioning are the real time combat and the simplification of ship design. Also the fact that the game will update designs for you automatically, which steers the player away from thinking about their designs at all. It's convenient, but that convenience is bypassing something that was interesting, which is a bad thing. And the real time combat obviously results in some things being streamlined. I don't think ships have shield facings anymore. Energy weapons still have the envelopment mod, but since there is only one shield on a ship, all the mod does is increase damage to shields, which is boring. There are lots of little changes like that. 

? - Time to ramble: I think one of the things that Master of Orion has lost in its modernization is the ability to activate the imagination to the same degree. Older MOO games had to work with less, in a sense, in terms of showing this universe and its characters directly to the player - mostly text and single images. Adding higher fidelity assets and voice acting all over the place has taken some of that freedom of interpretation out of the player's hands and into the developer's. That may be a problem for people who had an image of this IP that is not in line with what they're shooting for with this game. 

I was tempted to assume that this 'less is more' approach is something that's kind of lost to history, as standards for presentation have shifted in AA and AAA development. But on the other hand, Amplitude's Endless series has done a great job of using development resources in ways that activate rather than constrain the imagination.",1632864436,1632867934,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

You take over planets and populate them. You go to war with fleets of ships. You build economies, research technological advancements, and can engage in politics to keep people from invading your expanding Empire.  You are running all the shows, and it is so satisfying. This game will help you learn strategies to survive and thrive.  Build fleets of ships and build a spy to infiltrate the ""Allies"" you build.  There is so much to do and it all rides on your decisions. 

This game blew my mind how in depth it was. Being a huge fan of the Koei series Romance of the Three Kingdoms (mostly 8), I was looking for a game like it in space. My friend introduced me to Master of Orion 2 and it was so much fun.  What I love about this game is that you can get on a roll getting planets, but they are never safe at any time.  You can lose them and have to start over, but that's reality. Every move matters in the grand scheme of things. I like that you can win by various conditions, or by domination only.  I have spent too much time on this game, and I don't regret it. It does come with some negatives we have to speak about. 

 Please note that anything i'm about to say will not impact my score. This game is amazing and work the hours.

The bad of this game are in some of the functionality and in depth of options.  A good thing they added was multiplayer. The problem is that it didn't work for me and my friends on steam very well.  The first reason it didn't connect was because one of us used the mod feature, which has a lot of changes to the core game people enjoy.  If I download any mods and want to play with a friend who doesn't use my mods, we cannot game.  You can uninstall the mods, restart the game, and you will get the same error message. You must reinstall the game and restart the PC for it to work. The other reason is sometimes the other party just disconnects for no reason.  So if you are playing multiplayer, quick save/save all the time. Trust me.

The other thing is the tech tree, and is purely subjective, so take with a grain of salt.  If you want a more robust tech tree, look in the mods section.  Master of Orion 2 had one of the best tech trees i've ever seen.  In MoO, it's simplified and it's still very effective.

But it's like all the other ones out there.    The same conceits,  the same exact format, and same exact game-play as every other 4X game out there.

Let's start with the biggest problem:   Hyperlanes.

Every game has them now,  and they exist solely because the developers feel they have to have hyperlanes because every other game has them.    MOO2 I could launch my fleet in any direction.   There was no camping at a choke point and fortifying behind it.    That's the same strategy that works in all the other hyperlane based 4X games out there.   And I am tired of it.     One of the appeals of the open-format style of map is a threat can come from any direction.   You have to plan accordingly.    Hyperlanes take that out of the game.   So long as I stack fleets at choke points I've effectively won the game.    This shows a general lack of creativity – strategy that works in one game should not carry over to another game.   Especially when there is no excuse other than a lack of creativity – for a game that is based on MOO2 it should follow MOO2 closer.    If nothing else,  a complete map rework is in order.  Do away with the hyperlane model entirely and go back to an open map system,  otherwise the game is basically Stellaris Clone #471,3128.

Second:   The ship combat is fairly terrible.

I'm not here to watch poorly rendered ships pew pew with each other.   Nor do I want to click “AUTO RESOLVE” and have the random number generator tell me I won.    Cinematic space-battles done up with smash-cuts and predictable fighter-jet like antics are just jarring and out of place.     MOO2 had the best combat resolution – while I do not want stacks of pixelated ships to click on,  there has to be something better than watching the game dogfight dreadnoughts over and and over and over again.

Finally:   What the HECK is it with this trend of having an advisor utter “yes master,  right away master,  you are the best at what you do master no one is better than you master” every click?     Not the first game that has done this.   Took me awhile to figure out how to silence the infernal prattling.  I'm of an age and a generation where I don't need constant praise and reassurance.   It's sickening that this is the default setting and that it requires searching the menus to find a way to turn off the prattling.",1629640923,1629640923,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is nothing wrong with this game. It is absolutely fine. It looks good, the gameplay is fine and it is more or less free of bugs.

But as there are many types of flavours, your opinion on whether or not you would like this game is subjective. For me, this game is not what I hoped for. I have great memories from Master of Orion 3, and this is ""meeh-version"" of the same in prettier clothing. There is nothing new or nothing better. It runs and looks good though. I have a sense of this game was developed based on the opportunity to gain some income based on nostalgia. I do not sense there has been any dedication from the developers to take this to the next level.

Not sure if you played Civilization for years and then saw when Sid Meyer dropped a mobile version... and an online version of the game. And lately they've also have moved in a more ""cartoonish"" style.... this version is like that. It is an arcade version of a 4x Space Strategy game.

If you, like me, like grand strategy and have played paradox games and enjoys that kind of depth... which is more like a simulator than a game... Master of Orion is nothing for you. Keep away.
If you enjoy mobile game, arcade style games and easy going, and easy-to-pick-up games. Master of Orion is a perfect 4x game.

FIX IT or I'll never buy anything else from this studio or publisher...

More info.........
Imagine having numerous alien races at your disposal, instead of each one feeling unique they generally feel the same save  a few re-skins of the ships, different buffs that don't really make them stand out from each other but they do have talented voice actors. You may at times forget which one you're playing as, until your assistant keeps screaming at you every-time you discover something. I've never been so grateful for a mute button. 

Imagine a UI that looks amazing, but requires you to open numerous pages. Have a system of three colonised planets? Go to each one individually to build, constantly recheck the tech-tree by opening another tab in your tech tab, buy galactic shares from another tab inside the empire tab, and how about saving everytime you've built 2 or more of the same ships so it clogs up your production tab even if now they are outdated, you can't delete them so have fun trying to find your titan amid 30 other ship queues.

Do you like the News? Well you better because they will come on constantly like an YouTube advertisement telling you whats happening on your notification's just in case you couldn't see the brightly coloured icons above the end turn button.
Thankfully you can also use an 'adblocker' in the settings to stop those pesky news reporters.

Do you like being a Tyrant? Well you better because once you declare war on someone they in essence tell you to ""Leave me alone and don't talk to me"", even when they are on their last planet and your fleet is hovering above their devastated fleets remains with an arsenal of highly fatal spores locked onto their population. You could ask them for a un/conditional surrender but they are threatened by you and hence will block all communication with you, so your only choice to hear them one more time is to blow them out of existence. So they can complain about being defeated.

It is worth noting that you can solve some of these with mods.
On a arbitrary side note I also found it humorous that every time you were checking your Empire tab scrolling up and down would also zoom in and out of the galactic map.

BUT its GOOD. Why? Spies. Want to build a massive spy network and insert sleepers everywhere, who will topple entire empires? You can. This mechanic was so fun it kept bringing me back for more even though it is extremely exploitable. With a superior economy you will have so many spies in fact you can kill all their heroes simultaneously, make nearly half of their empire revolt and lose their hard earned colonies, steal all their tech so you don't need scientist or waste any money on science infrastructure. Use that money to get more spies. Leave them as counter-intelligence as they level up to lvl 5 while they capture your enemies spies and you ransom them for even more money.

It also has a RTS feature. Click on all your ships, get them to attack each enemy ship at a time, kill all of them. Feel like a badass admiral. Exploitable but fun. Until you become so cocky you send your small 10 ship fleet into an Antares portal, discover they have over 50 ships complete with Doom stars and your odds are so terrible that it forces you to auto-resolve. Lose your fleet. Then have another Antares fleet spawn in, go to your planet, bomb it with 40 bombs and still not kill your population, have another Antares fleet drop only 10 and kill everyone. Watch as they insult you. Build a bigger fleet and crush their invasion fleets. Watch them insult you anyway.

The Antares are perhaps one of the best parts of the game.

Voice Acting. There is Joker Bird-alien. A retired firefly pilot as a 1950's alien advisor. A disembodied Klingon narrating. And Rick's computer visualised in human form so people can stare at her. Plus many more. Needless to say they went all out. But maybe too much money went here and not on the UI. 

It can be fun but its hard to justify the price when there are many well crafted 4x games out there with superior game mechanics (eg Endless Space 2 has different game mechanics for each civ making each one feel unique. Something MoO sorely lacked.) Another is crisper more well thought out UI, opening a tab to get to another tab was just time consuming and tedious. Add on the fact they also locked one of the classic fav civs behind a paywall,  a move only a Ferengi would be proud of.",1626326125,1626346687,False,1,0,0.509345769882202148,0,True,False,False

Comparing rounds in this game to deep 4x games like MoO2 and Stellaris is like comparing a round of Starcraft 2 to Civilization 6. This is a better choice when you can only sit down once a week, or you're trying to get a 4x novice into the genre. There's only really this and Endless Space in that pocket.

They designed the rounds to average eight to twelve hours, rather than twenty to thirty. They designed it to be shallow rather than deep, so you can dive into the action rather than grind an entire session on building out a fleet or managing your empire's economic future (that you'll have to adjust solar system by solar system after 20 minutes because of research).

The game was actually very well fleshed out. Diplomacy and espionage are well done, to the point where it is entirely possible to win a game without firing a shot, or you can have minimal interactions with them and just attempt to wreck their day. Research actually manages to matter, but not be impossible to win without, battles can be as simple or complex as you want by controlling the fight. You can micromanage your economy for maximum profit or work it in broad strokes.

But... with all those options, unlike other 4x games, you can ignore or involve yourself as you choose, and not be punished for it. Mostly. Battles, unless you play a total war game well, I recommend leaving alone. Point is, you don't have to remember what your last twenty-five and next twenty-five moves were when you start up your save.

It is relatively simple, arguably pretty and has a dash of humour.

In its bare form, it is very flawed and it seems the developers aren't working on it anymore : the last patch was in October 2019.
There is however an ""Unofficial Code Patch"" (UCP) that improves the game quite a lot.

edit April 30 2021 - Playing the game on a huge map in the hardest mode, its not hard, the AI doesn't upgrade their ships, they all run beam weapons and obsolete shit to make it easy mode.

Note also helps that I'm a massive nerd who made sure I never missed X-Files, Deep Space 9 and Babylon 5. So I loved Master of Orion 2, hell I still play it now and then as it's just a classic.

Then we got Master of Orion 3 and it sucked the big one. I kid you not when I tell you I beat the game the first time around by just clicking ""Next Turn"" still it was a massive pile of crap and shows why you shouldn't make a 4X Space Civilization game too 'real' oh and aliens looking like actors in rubber masks is fine. Really look up the making of that POS. It made Star Control 3 look good.

Still I was happy when I heard that there was a new Master of Orion in the works. Hell I would read some of the early stuff about it and it sounded NGD had a pretty damn good idea of what they are doing! Hey look at the voice cast they got! Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, John de Lancie, it's a game with Luke Skywalker/Joker, Worf and Q! Nah there's no way Stellaris will even be anywhere near as good as this new Master of Orion!

And it's just okay. Well alright let me put it this way... This is a very good game for someone who wants to get into 4X titles but if you are someone like me who spent late nights in 1997 making fleets to go kill that Space Dragon as I really want that planet it's guarding? You'll be bored.

It's just very simple, where I remember MoO2 offering up a number of things that I had to keep track of and look at. This just doesn't feel that way. This just felt kinda over all simple, I already knew what to do, I could just coast by as I knew what to do. Hell even playing on the hardest mode I had little trouble with the game. Just gameplay wise? It just felt like I had no real trouble.

The story is still the same, for those of you who never played MoO before? You run a Empire taking it's first steps into space. Alien races tend to have one thing they are really good at. You fly ships around exploring the galaxy, starting up colonies on new worlds. Try and keep the other Empires happy or go to war with them. And then there's Orion the homeworld of the galaxies big precursor race left behind with all of their super powerful tech. They also left behind a massive robot warship to keep the younger races off until they are ready.

The voice acting is very good, I mean after all look at the three names I put down there are more. The game has a nice look to it, vastly better then MoO 3. No real game killing bugs I found and it's pretty stable. I will admit it does feel much shorter then other 4X games I've played.

Now will I recommend this game? Alright... If you are someone like me who spent a lot of time playing 4X games and you really want a 4X space game? No I really can't recommend it. Go with Stellaris, you'll have a lot more fun and yes while there's a ton of DLC for it? That means there's a crap ton of new content for it. If you are someone who's new to 4X titles or maybe you have a kid who wants to get into them? Then yes by all means pick this up, it's a great intro to those games and something like Stellaris can be overwhelming to the new player.",1618997655,1618997655,True,29,0,0.704183757305145264,0,True,False,False

This is your first iteration into the genre.  It's  a poor first impression. The game has no depth. It is very basic in terms of forming fleets, upgrading ships, taking over planets etc.  A few annoying game mechanics like pollution removal and command points for ships just adds to the frustration. Yes, plenty of games have command points. However, i've im close to my limit and I need to build a few more ships to finish my fleet, i'd rather not have to do math to see if i'm going to go over my command point limit when those ships do finish construction.

Diplomacy is actually really fun. You see in real time the effect of a trade deal or forming an alliance. The animations during diplomacy are good too.  

Whats the issue? You have to download mods to make the game somewhat enjoyable. 5x and UCP mods are basically mandatory since the developers have abandoned the game years ago and players have to fix the tech tree and crush all those bugs.  The game is just plain boring. When you have games like Endless Space 2, another 4x turn based space game, why play an inferior product.  I suppose the big difference here is you actually use spies, which is interesting. Whereas in Endless Space 2, you have to hack all the time, which is annoying. Another quality of life addition i'd like to see is fleet power comparisons. If i'm about to assualt an enemy fleet, i'd like some idea of how difficult the battle will be before I fly over to them. 

Soundtrack is like 3 songs that loop over and over again. Sound design is a huge deal breaker for me as it adds to immersion. Endless Space 2 has an amazing soundtrack. This....wow....3 songs that loop. When you enter a war state with someone, it changes to an ominous sound track but again, it loops after a few songs.

Just overall lazy. The developers abandoning the project after a few years is testament to that.",1617724256,1617724256,False,5,0,0.503034889698028564,0,True,False,False

With the mods, it's a pretty 4X with a decent call-back to the original Master of Orion games.   It won't break new ground.   It won't stand up to something like Endless Space II or Stellaris.   It will feel familiar and it won't do wild wacky stuff to differentiate itself.

For what it is (which is a modern remake of MOO1 or 2), it's a good, pretty 4X that does everything you expect in a 4X.   Planets, ships, exploration, conflict, research, diplomancy and espionage, it ticks all the boxes and hits all the bullet points.   Again, with the two mods.   Species leaders and UI helpers are ell modeled and voiced, and the game has a very easy 'Just one more turn' flow.

The 'special sauce' in Master of Orion is the big bad, that comes out of portals every couple dozen turns and delivers a smackdown to a random player (strongly weighted towards the higher score players).   Middle-game, you can start fighting off these raiding fleets, but early on they'll just hurt whoever's in the lead and keep the power balance fluctuating.   Even into mid-game, you'll still need to put effort into fleet response and defenses, and in end-game you can take the fight to them.

I would have preferred the game if they had just taken MOO2 as-is and updated the graphics. With mods, the gameplay here is pretty good. Problem is that the GUI is really tiresome. No mini-map and you need to get an individual planet view to control planet output and resource usage properly. So there is lots and I means lots of scrolling and zooming in this game. It started to drive me crazy after a while. There is a colonies list but you can't control the colony fully from that list. Also food can't be shipped around the empire with freighters as with the original so you have to micro that aspect too much. Also the tactical battles are pretty lame - you end up auto-resolving or just selecting all the ships and targeting each enemy individually. Nothing much to do there.

The art, voice acting and realtime tactical battle are fine but:
1. Starlanes severely limit the number of contacts each faction can have at any time: they are mostly restricted to having 2 neighbours
2. Maximum amount of factiosn on map limit the games scale even further - even the base game without DLC has more factions then what the game allows to be fielded in any game
3. Diplomacy is almost none existent: AI doesnt form alliance or tries to haggle over spy activity
4. The micro-MGMT of colonies is very very high: unlike SiS or even ES2 each colony needs to be managed from a different view, there is an overview view a build view and a view to view buildings that have already been built with a filter that does not remember your selection - per colony :)

MoO is a good-looking game with a lot of little things I like, such as the humorous robot newscasters and the slick, beautiful planetary graphics. Other things it does are a little unimpressive, like the ship models flying in against a mostly static image when colonizing new planets. There's a lot of give and take, but fortunately, most of the options various players may have mixed feelings about (such as random events and Antaran attacks) can be turned on or off, as you please.

This isn't Stellaris, so don't expect deep diplomacy or incredibly complex gameplay. It's almost a kind of ""4x-lite."" However, I enjoy it for that, because as much as I love games like Stellaris, that's not always what I want to play; sometimes I want something more straightforward and requiring less attention and brainpower.

That being said, there are two real complaints: First and most damning is the lack of hotseat multiplayer, which I know is no longer the industry standard, but which has always been a staple of the franchise and is incredibly disappointing to see absent from this version. It's very much a case for me, as a lifelong MoO fan, of being unable to justify the purchase of more than one copy. I didn't mind buying it once, but while I'll gladly play with a friend who already has it, I'm not shelling out for a second copy just so I can use network play to get someone else involved. Second is that the inclusion of the Elerians, Gnolam, and Trilarians as a paid DLC is kind of a slap in the face to MoO fans.

Overall, I like this game for what it is and what it does. The price has come down a bit since I first bought it, and now I can say it's worth $35USD for the collector's edition, not least of all because you get MoO 1 and 2 in that package. It's not, however, worth the $42USD price tag that includes the additional race DLC, so get it on sale...especially if you want to play with friends.",1615262920,1615262920,True,0,0,0.497925281524658203,0,True,False,False

The game has lost the flow of Masters of Orion II and instead is a grind, no matter how you look at it.  There are several broken parts to the game that worked in the past (MO2).  Travel between systems takes a very long time, so when Antarans attack, you have no chance of getting there unless you have a fleet in system.  Entering and leaving a system take a turn by themselves and then travel between systems can take many turns.  There are only travel lanes between systems and not direct travel, so you have to follow routes to get to where you are going, making trips take even longer.  Another aspect that slows the game down dramatically is the idea of system defense.  Rather than have each planet defended, the travel routes of a populated system can be protected using defensive bases.  These bases create another level of combat, extending the time it takes to try and achieve conquest victory, as mentioned I have played many hours and have yet to achieve a conquest victory as I am not willing to take the 24-36 hours of game play it would take to make that happen and that would be the speed on ""Lightening"" mode...  Another aspect that is broken in the game is economics.  In the game you have a tax rate, which is directly tied to morale, if you raise taxes your people revolt in short order and there isn't enough technology to placate them.  You can augment your taxes by build revenue generating buildings, there are three of them in the tech tree and you need them just to stay in the black.  Every other building costs you and does not contribute to revenue and there are more of them than you can count, so you have to be real selective when building.  In the past Production was tied to revenue, but there is a definite disconnect where your facilities cost you and without the revenue facilities, you would go bankrupt.  Finally the espionage and combat are broken, technology doesn't provide you a whole lot of advantage in combat, it seems that fleets of frigates (the smallest ship) are the best way to go in combat as numbers appear to play more heavily than the combat and defense values of the ships.  10 frigates will almost always win against a Titan (the largest) and the one Doomstar (only one allowed at a time) you get is easily swarmed and killed by the computer that uses almost exclusively Frigates, Destroyers and Cruisers.  The Spy system works well, but is broken because each spy costs more than you most expensive buildings and you need 10 spies for defense, this often is the cause of bankruptcy as you need them to keep your tech, ships and colonies alive, but you can't afford to have them.  All in all it is a frustrating and pointless struggle with your revenue and an endless grind to play.",1614036604,1614036604,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Second Update to review  tagged on at the bottom.

Review 1 From release

Open up with.. this is a redo of an old game to modern standards with its own vision.

Basically  this game feels like a spiritual successor to Moo2/moo1 not a reskin of moo1 or moo2.
I would even go as far as to say its Civ5 in space.. but done better in some aspects.

The building system,  ship design, research and races all feel reminiscent of Moo2 but with improvements, older players can just pick up the game with a small learning curve.

It takes the real time combat and star lanes from Moo3 and to me makes them work better, judge that as you will some like starlanes, some don’t, the debate over that will not be solved here as everyone has their own view. I do think it could use some form of off road with a large turn penalty 
The real time combat seems ok.. just ok. It could use more depth, more control over the ships, more detail in what is going on.. and a larger battlefield to begin with.. thankfully this is just a meta portion of the game and though it can be improved.. it can be overlooked.

The game adds some of its own twists, voice acting and a few other things like actually having to watch your finances to avoid going broke.

The AI is getting better at building and expanding.. but again its combat tactics and ship designs seem silly still.. but vastly improved over the earlier builds.

Diplomacy is ok, but could be better.. not enough options it feels and the AI's really seem to not work together leading to it feeling like a cluster of 1v1v1v1 with no cooperation between non player sides. That being said that has been an issue with many 4x games.

Really enjoying the games take on Spying so far.. id like more options here or more effect from existing options.. stealing tech really seems to be the only decent option... would like to see some form of optional automated spy option.. or some way to reduce the micro for those who dont want the micro.

Pollution control i rather like.. if you do not clean up your polution your planet devolves to a different biome. Some dislike this as they feel its too micro heavy.. I personally enjoy it.

Colony management still needs work (moving population in the Civ window is still not present)

More Tech is needed with a few more building options in terms of ships. Though that is a minor issue.. it just would improve the overall experience.

The game is stable, has had some performance fixes all in all improved with each patch.

However it still has work to be done and a ways to go before it becomes gold.

I still really am enjoying the game and still get that ""next turn"" feeling.. it still feels like a nice comfy chair that I am returning to after a long break.  

I still am quite comfortable recommending this game to new and old fans.. 
I will just say however.. this is not moo1 or moo2..  if you expect moo1 or moo2.. you will be disappointed.. this is its own game :)

Review 2, DLC and patches later... 
They never did really fix the late game performance issues... though i dont think they can (stellaris also suffers from this)

The combat didn't ever get improved..

The new Antaran content just felt toxic..  not like in Moo2 where it was somewhat fun.

Spy system and diplomacy just never really got improved either.. i ceased playing the game at the end of 2018 as it had lost its magic somewhere along the way..

The game is still good.. but its just good.. they could have done so much better.. and i expected them to take it to new and better places.... instead Wargaming essentially dumped a small DLC (3 new races) with a touch of Moo2 content into the game and have more or less abandoned it..

Everything this game tries to do ... Stellaris ended up doing better.


I still recommend it for someone seeing a bit of Moo nostalgia .. or a super casual 4x game... but if you want the glory days of 4x  id go more for stellaris",1472407909,1613798281,True,9,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay so the bugged fixed itself, I don't know how or why but it now plays quite well. 

To put it simply, if you love MoO 2, you will love this one. 

Workshop support is a huge boon.

I really love the fact that when you lose a space battle, it isn't all over like in Stellaris. Enemies can get bogged down taking your planets, you can muster a defense in time. I am beating a superior foe atm doing this. 

So in all, 8.5/10. The downside I see are the pollution mechanic being quite harsh. I had to mod that part a bit to feel like MoO2, but that's it.",1456721019,1613417625,True,0,0,0.500796079635620117,0,True,False,False

Lets get right to it:

The graphics are great.
The voice acting is very good.
The diplomacy and interactions with other races in this game are good (and pretty fun).
The basic game mechanics in this game (not combat) are very close to both the old MOOs, with tweaks and improvements.
The tech tree is full and gives you quite a lot of options.
I really had fun with the above mentioned, and it brought back found memories.

Now for the unpleasant news:
The combat is not turned based.  It's real time pausable.  Based on your taste this may or may not be a bad thing.  I was very upset to see no turn based, but I grew ""tolerant"" of it in order to enjoy the other parts of the game.  You are able to tweak and build your ships to your hearts content, so this helps buffer the blow to the ""no turn based"" punch.  Combat is a wash for me, as some things I really miss, but a few things make up for it.

But the big blow to this game is the UI.  Uggg.  And I mean UGGGG!.  As anyone that's played this type of game before knows, the planet screen is where you spend most your virtual life, and boy is that a micro, tedius, mislaid mess.  First, every button you need to click on is in an oposite area of the screen.  You'll be moving your pointer to the far reaches of every area of the screen for every single little action.  Want to just use your right mouse button to get out of everything?  Too bad, because that's not an option.

Next, to pick what you want your planet to build or work on, you'll click on the build choice button (off course), but the building choices then pop up and block the ENTIRE planet info screen.  So you'll find yourself clicking back and forth, back and forth to get your planet info, then make build choices; planet info; build choices.  It's crazy tedium.

But worst of all is the Auto Build AI.  After you get a couple dozen planets, there no way you'll want to micro them all (especially with the UI mentioned above), so your only ticket out of micro hell is the AI ""mayor"" to do the busy work for you.  The problem is, the AI builder is AWFUL.  It will build crazy buildings, for no reason, in crazy orders, and in crazy locations.  And if your tight for money, it will bankrupt you building stuff you don't want or need (on EVERY planet). 

So your faced with a choice: Micro hell as your game gets more than a couple systems, or risk the AI taking on some of the work, and risk going bankrupt and/or having planets with just plain crazy setups on them.  

And this problem is multiplied by the fact that even planets in the same system as one of your colonized planets needs to have a separate colony ship built to colonize it; then a transport ship for every single unit of population you wish to move to new planets; then the micro or crazy AI of cueing up alllllll the buildings again (there is no blueprint or saved build cue system).  

The micro, tedium, busy work, and fiddlyness just eats away at the good parts of this game.

On sale, this game was a nice little ""demo"" to see how the game was.  I would have been very upset if I paid full price.  And I am glad I got it.  But if given any other choice then thumbs up or thumbs down, I would have to grade it a C-, which means buy just a tiny margin, I am forced to give it a thumbs down.",1530166522,1613102339,False,38,1,0.741373002529144287,0,True,False,False

I am still grinding out a learning curve about all the strategic number crunching, but I've moderately enjoyed the climb so far.  The extensive 'glam' of animation and narration is fun and helps make the RPG aroma linger pleasantly for a lot longer than it would without it.

Acknowledging the good art and graphics, this game has problems. Like the ending of THX-1138, they just quit polishing the subject before the job was really done--probably because it was overbudget.  Let's assume I'm content with a nostalgic resurrection of MoO2, don't expect too much game mechanic innovation from the title, and am just going to let the animation and cut scenes fill the emotional void.  What they did is amazing job for all the in-game stuff...but only where player race selection cancels out.  Plus they set themselves up for a big let-down when the game ends...those final cut scenes are really underwhelming by comparison.  (Come on guys, I have to auto-resolve the big Antaran fight, and even then no cinematic battle scene??)

Yes, I get it...a dozen or so races multiplied by a half-dozen possible victory conditions is 70 or 80 grand, epic animation sequences.  But remember how little game mechanics innovation I'm asking for and then tell me not finding a way to make those epic climaxes happen was a good game experience design strategy.

Now let's say after 20 years I actually *do* want some core game mechanic innovation.  Yikes.  This was a timid project at heart.  To be fair, I'm enjoying the ship customization, and the battle cinematics are really admired and appreciated.  But can't the pirates have some racial variety as well, instead of using the same clunky WW1 submarines for every pirate from one end of the galaxy to other?  Same with all the races' space stations and missile silos.  If MoO ""RPG"" ambiance is what you're selling, all that design uniformity on every freakin' planet is killing my immersion.  The assymetrical game balancing also seems really undercooked.  I've always found the Mrrshans annoying, so that doesn't bother me.  Variety and diversity means some of these characters should annoy me.  But the cats really seem *unplayable* this time so far.  Maybe I'm just too dumb to have yet figured out why marines matter more than the 6th decimal point.  (Why can't we have some planetary marine fight cut scenes now in 2016, either?)  Customize my own Mrrshans?  Thank you, I will!  But that menu seems really underbaked and unbalanced to me, too.

I leave with the caveat that I'm still dissecting this game and maybe my perspective of ""balance"" issues will change.  But without those grand epic finale cut scenes we talked about to reward the monotonous effort, it's a lot to ask for trudging my way through the same old tired Civilization-style 4x visual vocabulary with arbitrary ""star lanes"" that don't bear too much logical scrutiny.

I got my money's worth out of this title, and I'm not feeling bad about the hours I gave ""Conquer the Stars.""  I had genuine fun revisiting these old friends.  But we're on the back nine of this course far more quickly than I wanted to be, and more quickly than the obviously hard-working, big budget game makers wanted me to be.  I hope the company learned what it needed to about project management and has more presentable goods for the future.  Including another MoO.  It's obvious this was a labor of love, and the studio deserves credit for keeping the franchise's divine spark alive for new audiences.  Let's impress the next generation of nerdy kids next time too, without JJ Abrams style hand-waving in the critical late stages.  Take better care of your titles and don't leave the essential polish up to the ""mod community.""",1589832138,1611776526,True,1,0,0.501431763172149658,0,True,False,False

So, the raids are not random and are done based on a hard multiplier of the player's fleet strength.  However, how the game assesses fleet strength seems to be bugged.  So, certain custom ship designs can result in the game spawning raids over 2x as strong as what you actually have.

Other things:  
-  The pollution mechanic varies wildly and results in wasting hours with pointless micromanagement.  The buildings to manage it don't do much.  Balanced, well outfitted planets still become polluted.
-  Many of the buildings have been changed to the point of being useless cash sinks so you have to micromanage buildings across dozens of planets individually, wasting more time.
-  You Citizens are more unhappy an will frequently kill themselves by striking out of the blue.  Meaning, yes, more micromanagement.  And, the mood boost buildings cost more to maintain, naturally, and do less.
- Volcanic worlds are the new toxic worlds.
- Constructed planets are high gravity.
- The leaders appear to be randomly generated and are mediocre mish-mashes of 1 to 3 skills, occasionally with some empire wide skills that are OP when leveled.  So, no more epic leaders, including Loknar and Zanatus.

Táto recenzia je v Anglickom a Slovenskom jazyku:

Older MoM titles are legendary games. Any remake of such games carries the risk that the new game will not meet the expectations of what it would like to achieve. Unfortunately, the new version of MoM belongs to the category of the less successful successors of legends. The game has several conveniences that stand out from most current space strategies:
1. It is a turn-based strategy that allows you to enjoy the management of great empires more.
2. It has a quality diplomatic system with sufficient capabilities and adequate AI responses.
3. As one of the few space games, it recognizes the star system as a set of several bodies in it and not as one whole. This means that in one system, planets can be owned by several opponents. This is very realistic, unlike most other space strategies, where building a small base will usurp the entire system and automatically prevent you from passing through it (such as Stellaris).
Unfortunately, everything falls on two serious shortcomings:
1. The game is very unbalanced. Who is more technically and economically advanced has no rival. All you have to do is secure a head start in research and a well-functioning economy, and no one will beat you. The game offers the possibility of a certain balance, where the mysterious Antares race repeatedly attacks the strongest player. It's interesting, but overall it's a weak patch to balance the game.
2. Boring! After a short time, the game becomes so incredibly boring that even the most rock fans will turn it off! The game has almost no storyline and very few side interactions.
The game is not expensive and does not have many DLCs, but it unnecessarily pushes you to buy connected content such as purchase of a collector's collection. Although it is not a bad game, I do not recommend buying it, because nowadays it no longer meets the demanding requirements of the gaming community for this type of games.

Staršie tituly MoM sú legendárnymi hrami. Každé prerobenie takýchto hier nesie riziko, že nová hra nenaplní očakávania toho, čo by chcela dosiahnuť. Nová verzia MoM žiaľ patrí do kategórie tých menej úspešných pokračovateľov legiend. Hra má niekoľko vymožeností, ktorými vyniká nad väčšinou súčasných vesmírnych stratégií:
1. Je to ťahová stratégia, čo umožňuje si viac vychutnať riadenie veľkých impérií.
2. Má kvalitný diplomatický systém s dostatkom možností a primeranými reakciami AI.
3. Ako jedna z mála vesmírnych hier, rozoznáva hviezdny systém ako súbor viacerých telies v ňom a nie ako jeden celok. To znamená, že v jednom systéme môžu vlastniť planéty viacerí oponenti. Je to veľmi realistické na rozdiel od väčšiny ostatných vesmírnych stratégií, kde si postavením akejsi malej základne uzurpujete celý systém a automaticky znemožníte prechod cez neho (ako napr. Stellaris).
Bohužiaľ všetko padá na dvoch závažných nedostatkoch:
1. Hra je veľmi nevyvážená. Kto je technicky a ekonomicky vyspelejší, nemá súpera. Stačí si zabezpečiť náskok vo výskume a dobre fungujúcu ekonomiku a už vás nikto neprekoná. Hra ponúka možnosť určitého vyváženia, kedy sitá záhadná rasa Antares opakovane útočí na najsilnejšieho hráča. Je to zaujímavé, ale celkovo ide o slabú náplasť na zabezpečenie vyváženia hry.
2. Nuda! Po krátkom čase sa hra stane tak neskutočne nudnou, že ju vypnú aj najskalnejší fanúšikovia! Hra nemá takmer žiadny dej a len veľmi málo vedľajších interakcií.
Hra nie je drahá a nemá veľa DLC-čiek, ale zbytočne tlačí do kúpy spojených obsahov ako napr. zakúpenie zberateľskej kolekcie. Aj keď nejde o zlú hru, jej kúpu neodporúčam, pretože v dnešnej dobe už nespĺňa náročné požiadavky hernej komunity na tento druh hier.",1611137627,1611137627,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Same with managing troop transports, and moving excess population around from fuller planets to newer colonies. Previous MOO games had these problems too, but after 20 years you'd expect some fixes to these problems which other games have done. The combat is pretty meh, and the spaceship tech tree is pretty boring until you get way into late game (in which case the game is largely decided by then). It is just too much work for a game.

It just crossed into don't recommend territory because of the following...and this is based on comparison to the dozens of 4X, turn based space games etc I own.

1: The AI is really dumb. All seem to speed build massive fleets and every time I am leaps and bounds ahead in technology, one race seems to suddenly gain EVERYTHING in the tree when they had been behind me 100 turns before. 

2: On very easy setting, there is always one race that sweeps through the galaxy with titan ships while I am still researching cruisers. I have yet to have a game where I see some advanced tech. I even modded my own version of the game...which brings me to #3.

3: ALL races use the same tech trees. The only differences are visual and the race traits...I found this when I was going through the mod files. It killed the game for me as it made everything seem the same.... 

4: Again, it started off fun...but by turn 300 or so and spamming tech and planet colonies, I was always WAY behind the rest of the galaxy. Other 4X games I don't have this issue.

5: Can't name fleets....

The Space Combat is definitely what I keep playing it for. 
Building all the new ships and the different combinations is fairly fun. 

However it is a fairly bare bones civilization building game. The visuals are certainly a good reason to play this. but, it's lacking the depth I wish was there. 
I find it to be a very unpolished game. And it's a shame since it's coat is so pretty. 
I bought the special edition, (which includes the original Trilogy) and even the DLC for this game. 

After you've explored what the game has to offer, the replay value falls off. 
I put in an extraordinary amount of hours after purchasing. (Had plenty of time after getting COVID) I was absolutely captivated. The Voice acting, The Lore (What little their is in Game), The Menu's and sounds/music. It all looks fantastic. The Large Battles are truly fun! The Designs and art style is rather superb! 

I got my money's worth. I'm more disappointed how little the game has to offer after it's initial learning curve.
The mechanics are rather shallow after you've figured everything out and played a few matches.

- Revival of the races of games that I used to play in older games
- Difficulty at the highest rating -> early game

What seems bad:
- Technological progression - There are some points in the game where your power level just jumps to unreasonable levels. Most notably are the increased income (Galactic currency exchange +100% wealth) it's really hard to not accidentally get an econ victory. There is not a smooth transition at any point where it's a steady progression of technology. The power gained by a very few of them is crazy and can go from a losing situation to domination.
- Victory Conditions - Technology pretty much gives you access to all win conditions, some win conditions are completely unattainable. A conquest victory, for example, will always end in a diplomatic victory unless you keep on not voting for yourself in the galactic council. At that point anyway, when you are that large you would win anyway.
- Almost all enemies just mass a single fleet to fight, there's no attacking multiple fronts it's very basic. The game further rewards this with anti-missile defenses stacking, so the more ships you have the less missile damage you take, so it's better to have less fleets all the time.
- Game handles late game very poorly, I am not sure if this is an optimisation issue but turns start taking a long time around the point where you get 60 planets. I would actually suggest against playing the massive galaxies.

I would recommend this game only if you are looking for a bit of nostalgia with the older series, the ships are quite neat too. If you are looking for a 4X game, I would definitely suggest looking elsewhere as this is a generic entry level type.",1606623492,1606623492,False,47,2,0.794786393642425537,1,True,False,False

Combat can be complex, easy, or super easy let the AI do an instant battle.  Letting the AI do the battles feels like you win according to the predictions, not like some RNG games.  Multiple win conditions (Military, Economic, Technological, Diplomatic via the galactic council, Eliminate the Antarrans (technology/military), or good old fashioned Points after a # of turns.  Great voice acting.  Great animation, racial specific fleet looks.  Diplomacy is midway between MoO and Civ, which feels good for the most part.  Ship building can be made very easy or pretty complex, even to the point of assigning ships different roles such as sniper or brawler.  AI recommends upgrades by roll and you are prompted to tweak blueprints every time you get an upgrade, so you can't forget.   Many buildings and technologies have changed in function, as have many racial abilities.  Have not played through all races, but the new racial abilities have still felt ""right"" so far.  Most of the base races are included in the base game, plus a second human race, a few are $DLC.  Planets and building feel mostly like MoO2, not the overcomplicated system of 3.  Evidently friendly to the MOD community (not a selling point for me, but maybe for others.  Very helpful community on the community page.  Developers still involved in game, which is mainly a plus.
Few downsides:  Buying some of the ""core"" races.  Help menu not in game.  Evidently can be found on Steam under launch options.  Just like Civ, some of the unfamiliar terms are never explained in game that I have found.  Tutorial needs polishing, there are times it hints at the next step, but it is unclear the next thing to do, so you have to click every interface, button, planet, ship until you get where the tutorial wanted you next.  Some of the buildings/technologies that have had their purpose changed feel wrong, some feel unnecessary.  If I colonize a mineral poor-ultra poor, I know it is going to be a weak industry, I shouldn't be able to ""fix"" the planet by just 'building' Crust Prospecting.  Pollution feels weird, but is relatively easy to figure out.  I suspect I will find the sweet spot in multiple play throughs.  Food system is not obvious once you go beyond the base needs of feeding planet.  Transporting colonists is a lot more annoying, but realistic.

If Wargming recreated Master of Orion 2 mechanics and added tactical combat, then maybe this would have worked.
Instead, the developers that gave us World of Tanks, World of Warships, and World of Warplanes have given us a Master of Orion game where tanks are infantry with a different icon, the starships 'fight' about as awkwardly as a teenage couple dancing at a Catholic School prom and the end result is about as clumsy as the aforementioned couple trying to deflower each other in the back of a car with a messy, cringey, and guilt-ridden shag, and starfighters are as useful as an ejection seat on a submarine. 

Now about 2 years after release, where do I even start... 
- AI doesn't build any warships. They s*** out nothing but troop transports that just orbit around their homeworld. No joke, don't be surprised to send your battlefleet over to the Bulrathi, Sakkra, and Klackon homeworlds without running into a single enemy vessel and then encounter a fleet of several hundred troop transports. I think the AI thinks they are playing Starship Troopers. YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE GALAXY WITH A HANDFUL OF FRIGATES.
- Even if the AI do build warships, the ship designs they use are so god awful that you can take out Titans with a few frigates in an auto-resolve battle. THE AI SHARE THE EXACT SAME SHIP BLUEPRINTS, BASED ON A SINGLE F***ING TEXT FILE. YEAH! THE SAKKRA, MRRSHAN, MEKLAR, ALKARI, HUMANS... ALL OF THESE EXTREMELY 'DIVERSE' CIVILZIATIONS OUTFIT THEIR SHIPS IN THE EXACT SAME WAY. YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE GALAXY WITH A HANDFUL OF FRIGATES.
- Diplomacy? What diplomacy? ""Would you be interested in a trade agrement with England?"" YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE GALAXY WITH A HANDFUL OF FRIGATES.
- Espionage involves more RNG than tabletop D&D and more nonsensical and unfair BS than XCOM aiming. YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE GALAXY WITH A HANDFUL OF FRIGATES.
- The AI in this game would have a hard time beating Halo Wars on normal. Wargaming took the AI algorithms from the AI the Galactic Empire used to run their wars. Or they stole it from the 12 Colonies of Man. Take your pick because it makes as many monumentally bad decisions as those two. I have seen Psilons (good thing WG is Belarusian so they can't be sued for trademark infringement) the super sciency types get their homeworld wiped out because they couldn't finish the research project to stop their sun from going Supernova... I managed this feat consistently with the KLACKONS just by moving some pops around. YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE GALAXY WITH A HANDFUL OF FRIGATES.

Now, go take over the galaxy with a handful of frigates. 2/10 don't buy this game. Go buy Endless Space 2 for a taste of Master of Orion.",1519357047,1604917544,False,14,12,0.545254647731781006,0,True,False,False

It's because it's extremely unbalanced with the Antares race appearing way too early and just obliterating you, especially if you decide to start pre-warp as a civilization. Strangely enough, the original had this same problem, which meant that if you were lucky and the Antares' race didn't decimate you early, you became overpowered and could devastate them. But it's one of those either/or balance things that really makes each game feel badly designed.

The rest of the game is done really well. If they could have set-up a system to where you could turn off Antares, or made them less likely to just start attacking you out of nowhere when you're still trying to figure out how to grow seeds (or whatever tech you're on), it might have been one of those games you'd play over and over.

The 'ascension' or victory by research feature addition means the AI always wins on a clock cycle and the game ends with the winner being the first race to reach the end of the tech tree.  Usually this occurs right in the middle of the most sophisticated endgame conquest and diplomacy portions of the game. It ruins the entire concept here. The Galactic council never votes, politics is near meaningless, conquest victory is impossible, the game ends before a deathstar can be constructed or used...  Just a big banner every match:

500 turns: AI WINS

Or you do, if you win the tech race.

The entire game reduces to this one algorithm. Fun maybe twice, zero replay.

Sadly the tactical combat is also completely bugged, the camera auto centers snapping back from the focus you scroll to, ships do not obey orders, ships do not fire on targets ordered to, ships forget the targets assigned, and at scale, the battles crash and lock.  Individual ships can't even be selected and commands just cannot be issued. It becomes impossible to fight protracted battles, use any kind of tactics or special ship equipment, and all the space battles are reduced to production pawn trades.

Want a babysitter / accountant simulator where you spend 80% of your time looking at numbers, and all you actually do is change those numbers? Then steer WAY clear of this one!

The game is complex enough to feel like a ""real"" 4X. Yet simple enough to allow me to concentrate on grand strategy, wich sectors to colonize, diplomacy, warfare, you know, 4X stuff! instead of spending 80% of the time burried in spreadsheets looking at numbers.
In other words, you feel like the leader of an empire, not an accountant.

Another aspect of the game i really like, is that every race/faction is really and [b]visually[/b] unique. With completely different looks, animations, voices (they actually talk here), behaviour, ships, etc. In contrast to other 4X games where besides the single picture of the race, you need to go look at a bunch of numbers to see how they are different.

The visuals are nice, voice acting in excellent, music is good, the map is nice. The UI is simple but functional.

I also adore the fact that here you can actually do whatever the hell you want. Wanna go to war? go for it! no need for hours of building pre-requisites. Want to design new ships? sure! no need for a level of ""experience"", etc. 
I also like that for me the game strikes a good balance between micro and macro management.

Another note: I used other reviewer recommendation and installed mods from the start (played half an hour unmodded): 
-5X - The Ultimate Balance Mod
-Unofficial Code Patch
-5X UCP Compatibility Mod (5XCPC)
Game is supported by the community, so keep track on mods update. They done pretty well. They do not change game noticeably, but just a lot of QoL, balance and stability.
(to install just find them in Steam Workshop, press ""subscribe"". also follow instructions for UCP. for reorder - in game go to mods section and press arrows (sadly no clear instructions on that)). 

So, main part now, what I found good compared to Moo2:
- Diplomacy I feel somewhat better. And AI have stronger demand, no just demanding system for nothing
- Spy system is much richier and deeper too. 
- Planets have more ""unique perks"" that gave little bonuses (strongly recommend taking look at DSMP mod which bring even more specials). 
- In tech tree you see technologies which require making choice, and tech that are granted by default. And choices is like 2 times less tha in MOO2 (sounds bad, but for balance sake I feel it like good decision)
- more Custom Race perks;
- More generation options for Galaxy; 
- Different win conditions (conquer, economy, science, Senate voting, etc), which are customiseable.
- Tactical combat is always on, and you could auto-combat any battle (without actually run in tactical view!). God bless this auto-combat. 


Questionable decisions (I'm ok with them, but MOO2 fan may find them annoying):
- You can't move between any star systems. Fuel system is removed. You move only between stars that connected by galaxy generator. You could travel between any stars if you build warp gates in controlled systems, and that is not one-turn either (same linear distance/drive power calc).
- You need to move fleet between planets and ""warp points"" of star system and that takes 1 turn.
- Tech tree now has partially interconnected branches instead of 8 independent. You can install mod which try to address that, but fix is not even close to MOO2 system. 
- Antarans feels for me annoying as a hell on Warp and Pre-warp.  Maybe with Progressive sciense start they will be ok. (played only twice with them so not placing ino annoying part - you could just disable them)
- Research overall feel waaay too slower (even with ""fastest researh"" on game start tuning). I felt like research speed comparable on fastest res game setting and race with 60% res bonus. Maybe because there more res. stages itself.

For some reason 4X space games these days tend to be in real-time, which doesn't make sense to me. A game like this should be turn-based, and unlike some of the other 4X games floating around you can actually control combat.

There are some issues with this though, and overall MoO 2 is a better game. What this game needed to do is make some small changes and update the graphics and interface, but a lot of what they changed feels kind of shallow. I can't quite put my finger on it but the game is just missing something.

The custom race options are a bit...off. One change they made I actually really like is to reduce the effectiveness of the Creative perk by having fewer either/or tech choices, but the price of a race being creative is still high. To be fair it also includes a high bonus to research, but since it's the same bonus you can purchase independently I'd rather have the option to JUST get all tech options.

They do that a lot in this game, many of the traits are just combinations of cheaper ones, it just feels weird. There are a few new, unique traits that definitely add something, but the government portion is gone and something valuable is lost as a result.

The game is visually appealing in general, not mind-blowing, but definitely not ugly. I wound up turning the sound off and don't really miss it.

To me this is a good 4X space game if you don't want the complexity of something like Galactic Civilizations 2/3 but still want to do some empire building. I would be really interested to see if they build on this.",1478498244,1599881808,True,0,0,0.539363503456115723,0,True,False,False

Master of Orion 2 forced hard choices on the player and made various strategies required, depending on your focus. The tech tree allowed only one choice per node, and while some were obvious, the benefits of the option not chosen couldn't be ignored; thus, stealing tech from your neighbors was encouraged to close the gap in power between you.

Ship design was a core mechanic of MoO2 where the choices you made dramatically affected your ships' performance in epic space combat. Both the epic space combat and the ship design are moot; most battles are resolved with auto battle, and the real time aspect makes control annoying, so you just hand it over to the AI anyway and watch as your ships make some bone-headed choices that could even cost you the battle. There's also a ""best"" ship design at each tier. Of course, the auto-upgrade variants sometimes decrease your ships' stats, which just doesn't make sense. It's like the numbers are pointless.

Colony management is a nuisance. It wasn't great in MoO2 but at least I could ship pops between planets without spending several turns worth of production! Now, you can't even build freighters to deal with food-poor planets, and need an early-ish tech to make your third colony survivable if it's not on a food bearing planet. Interplanetary administration isn't a valid replacement, since it only applies within a system.

There are plenty of other mechanics I disliked, but the biggest issues are those above. Stellaris, for all its faults, did it better. And I wasn't a huge fan of Stellaris' overly complicated mechanics.",1598720990,1598720990,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You get what I'm sayin? good.

Free-text fields in games is my favourtie type of text field. The systematic free-text-abuse in this game is why is has become a timeless classic. Classic cos its old, timeless cos the battleships have no clock installed as default. They were going to put an analogue clock in the bridge, but it didn't go well with the decor.

Being able to design your own ship is rather fascinating as one is able to put custom selected weaponary and....yup, you guessed it, there's a free-text field for the name of the ship too. ""Dildo"". My big new ship is literally a space travelling dildo.

I'm not a fan of the end game, mainly because I never get there. The early and mid game is where this game is at. It can be slow but if you get efficient at making informed decisions the game gets quicker.

Soundtrack is immersive. Yup. Space commanders always listen to space orchestra music. Gotta have that sound cranked. 5 hours later...yayyy...same sound.

I like to play this game with youtube streaming 'sea shanties'

I thought it was great and had never played such a game.  I was quickly a fan.  Three years later, its sequel came out.  Master of Orion 2: Battle at Antares was even better with improved gameplay and graphics.  There were over a dozen races to choose from with unique traits to determine your play style, or you could make your own race.  Needless to say, I logged hundreds if not thousands of hours playing this game.  Then there was nothing for several years until Master of Orion 3 came out in 2003.  We won’t talk about that game.  I feared the series was done until I stumbled upon Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars.  I did not know what to expect given how bad the 3rd installment was, so I was hesitant to give it a chance.  Whether you are a fan of the original series or new to the series/genre, you will not be disappointed.  

For fans of the original games, you will immediately see similarities to Master of Orion 2. All of the races from the second game are back.  The available technology is also similar with some additions.  You can expect many of the same features of MoO 2, with cleaner graphics and better AI for the races.  This means your allies won’t be as erratic as they could be in the original game.  The gameplay will also be familiar with some upgrades, such as the paths to victory.

The goal of the game is to win, obviously, but there are several ways to earn that victory.  Technologic, diplomatic, economic, conquest, or just being the best overall with the excellence victory.  Which path you choose will likely be determined by the race you choose, since each race has unique traits that will give them an edge on specific paths.  That does not mean that you can’t choose conquest victory as the Psilons.  After all, their technological advantage can just as easily be used to annihilate your enemies as it can be used to earn a technology win.

There are 14 races to choose from.  As I mentioned each one has different stats and traits.  Definitely consider these to give yourself an advantage in their strengths early.  The developers put a good amount of effort into making each one as unique as possible.  You will probably find yourself playing this game over and over as each of the races.  If you prefer, you can also make your own race.  You choose one of the existing races for the skin, and then select from a list of advantages and disadvantages.  You can also use the custom race option to ensure you don’t have deal with any race that is particularly troublesome.

I bought the super deluxe collectors edition with the original series of games, the digital artbook, the soundtrack, etc..  There were some vid problems at first, probably caused by my machine being 7 years old at the time of the games release.  But they did regular updates and this problem was greatly alleviated, though not eliminated.  In fact, I was playing it pretty steady from about early September, 2016 to mid-December, 2016.  At that point they had an update, and they made the last three races and the Antarans available as DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT.  I wouldn't have minded this, but they wanted me to pay for it.  WHAT THE FUCK?  I paid for the full deluxe edition of the game in pre-release and I have to pay MORE to get the finished version of the game?  No, I will NOT!!!!

I don't remember them well enough to say how this new MOO compares apples to apples, but in a way that doesn't matter.  Gaming has moved since MOO and MOO2 came out, and what was great back then would not necessarily be great if it were released now.

As it stands, this new MOO lacks content.  Having played through the game once, I feel like I've seen and experienced everything it has to offer.  There's no different path I saw that I thought, ""next time I could try that"".  No different abilities unique to other races that leave me thinking they would be interesting enough to try.  No different aspects of galactic exploration or exploitation that I noticed and could aim for on a new play through.  It will just be the same as my first play through, with slight tweaks.  I can already see what the game will be, how it will play out (and if I'm wrong, then the game did not communicate that at all).

To play all races you need DLCs.

Space combat - even when you click on ""no AI - 100% control"" your ships just do what they want, start firing here and there and move despite you saying hold position, very annoying.

Space news - make fun of the whole lore, diminishes the overall thrill of the game. You can turn them off but then you miss some useful information.

UI - several unnecessary repetitive clicks when micromanaging. Can I click on this planet as hyperlink to go there? No, first go to F1, Empire management, search the planet click on it.

When you click on ""fleet needs orders"" the camera always completely zooms in, so you have to zoom out to see where to send it EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Your ships can't do interstellar space travel outside of star lanes (what I wouldn't mind) EXCEPT for mini missions when they get a signal from somewhere out there, THEN THEY CAN and often get close to another star but can't do that one more inch to explore that star, what a dumb concept.

Overall this game is just a full priced beta, they simply didn't finish it. Play MoO2 instead, trust me. I mean even when you invade a colony with troops you don't see ANYTHING except of a message, so unrewarding.

I regret this purchase even though I just bought it to get the summer sale discount.

Review Update:

I decided to give Master of Orion 4 another go. 
Heh.. it's still hard to call it that, they should've given it another name.

This time I'm using a mod called ""5X - The Ultimate Balance Mod"" by Spud Dastardly.
The mod makes the game notably better.

The races are now more like in Master of Orion 2, and the custom race editor is much better now - It's fun to tinker with. 

There's also techs that make planetary specials better. (they were pretty useless before)


Now that I've tried it, I think the only ""real"" way to play this game is with this mod.

Too bad the biggest flaw of the game - namely the absolutely awful combat, is still there.
And the game is quite poorly optimized to be honest; it's not that good looking and it slows
down alot after you hit the 500 turn mark, and lategame combat also gets hiccups. 

It's a good game, but it's not great. (At least it's better than Master of Orion 3.. haha)

============

Old Review:

This game is [b]not[/b] Master of Orion.
It should not be called that. They changed the game so much that they should've just named it differently.
Yes, I am one of those who played the original games years ago.

Ok, so it is not Master of Orion, but it is an okay 4X space strategy.

This game feels more like a combination of Endless Space and Galactic Civilizations, with a very dull real-time combat where you cannot change the outcome much. Doesn't matter if you just watch the battle or command the ships yourself. 

Now, the real-time combat can be done right. For example StarDrive 2 has significantly better real-time combat where you can actually change the tide of battle by moving the ships smart. Even Endless Spaces' autocombat system feels better than this.

So yes, this is the biggest problem for me with the game. It lacks the turn-based combat that made the original two Master of Orions so great, and it does the real-time combat all wrong. I can handle the changes in the travel system (star lanes like Endless Space) or the (way too) slow game pace, and the tedious espionage system. But the combat system is just.. meh.

However, I do like the game. The poor combat system does not kill ALL the fun for me. I enjoy the colonizing & research phase of the game.

If you like Endless Space, then you should get this game on sale. I do not think this game is worth its full price, but on sale? Definitely.

It's OK, but it's not great. And it's definitely not Master of Orion.

They had the budget to hire well known voice actors; why didn't they hire Steve Barcia and Ken Burd to oversee the project? Maybe next time.

Summary:

The Good 👍
+ Great mods
+ Has all the old races (though they don't feel like it without mods)
+ Custom Race Editor (again with mods)

The Bad 👎
- Requires modding to feel like Master of Orion
- Poor combat

When I first played it the tutorial was completely broken by design, in that it wants you to follow a specific path, and won't let you even quit it until it's done. At one point when playing it I got completely confused as to what to do because it told me to settle a planet that the game told me not to settle.
No way I am playing through the tutorial again to confirm it's still broken though. It was horrible.
The entire time I was TRYING to play through the tutorial, and getting extremely aggravated, the voice of the tip adviser kept going off, saying things like ""Excuse me, Mr President."" There are even more of these alerts than during normal game play. If it was not possible to turn off voices, I may not have continued to play. I have not become so aggravated with a game for as long as I can remember.
It's not actually a tutorial, as you simply follow the instructions, with little or no choice in your actions. You're better watching a video. It's way less aggravating.

A few seem to want to forgive quite a bit for letting fans of the previous games down. I think that's a mistake. Many people bought this, and will buy it, due to the previous games. If they can make money off fans, they can deal with their dissatisfaction. It kind of does fulfill nostalgia at least, with better graphics, but it's not even really a good game. I think there are enough negative design decisions that many may hate it, whether or not they played the original games.

I myself was a big fan of Master of Orion 2, and MoO 3, to a lesser degree. I didn't dislike Master of Orion 3 because it didn't live up to the previous game. There were things in both games I disliked, but there were a few things I liked better about MoO 2.

This game not only doesn't live up to the previous installments, but it's buggy, and makes a few changes that make the game less enjoyable. The designers seem to have completely abandoned it as well, which I think was a huge mistake. This game is ripe for DLC & online play, IF they fixed it, and continued to work on it.

Pros:
Master of Orion
Awesome graphics
Cool voice-overs
Research suggestions
Research targets combine multiple
You can go into the tree and select something a few steps forward
You can turn off the voices

Cons:
Tutorial sucks
Voices get annoying fast
GNN is extremely kiddish and dumb (suggestion: replace with text news alerts)
Many characters seem cartoon-ish
Races too heavily influenced by animals
Not complex enough
AI extremely basic
Most time is spent micro-managing
Can't see or adjust population from Empire page
Can only move population one at a time
Battle UI sucks
Poorly designed status updates
Colony Base doesn't settle planets
No research queue
Not easy to start a new game
Buggy

This game is not all bad. If you have a kid that likes sci-fi and you want to introduce him to 4X games, this might be a good choice. The graphics are remarkable, and they have an all star cast of voice-overs. Because the game-play is a bit lacking though, all the fancy graphics and voices just felt like shine to me.

This game wasn't ready to come out of Early Access when it did, and they abandoned it. They have a very fancy start to a good game, with a few poor choices that nearly cripple it.

Even after years they haven't fixed anything it seems. It's really just boring and dull.

Most of your time will be spent choosing the next thing to build. The auto-build also disables itself any time you add something to the queue. It feels like you're micro-managing through much of the game. It gets really boring.

After years of owning the game, I have never played through an entire game. Rarely I'll open it again and try it out. Now I've simply uninstalled it to save the space.

The page to manage multiple colonies at once, the ""Empire"" tab, is crippled, so you're constantly going through every planet, which is annoying.

The research suggestions however, are one of the best changes they made, and really help speed up your choices in research.

The auto-turn is also very poorly designed, and it can blaze past important things, including hostile forces. It only stops when you NEED to do something, so you have to keep your mouse hovered over the button.

The ship combat AI is a pain. Trying to control a fleet with a mouse sucks, so you'll likely just click to auto resolve it most times.

One of the things that is very subjective that I disliked is the races. They're a bit too heavily modeled after real animals. Some of the choices seem straight out of a kids movie.

There's also DLC races available. I think their presentation was a mistake. I would have preferred a button to get additional races. As it is, it just makes the game look incomplete, unless you pay more.

The GNN news updates are just plain stupid. In previous games they were a little silly, but nowhere near as bad as they are now. At one point, when talking about a population boom, the male robot actually asks ""You do know where babies come from, don't you?"" Seriously? 

The whole game has a very cartoonie and kiddish feel to it.

The research tiers are almost exactly the same as from previous games. They likely just copied them and made some minor alterations. Some of the alterations are nice, others not so much. It would have been nice if they had further expansion, and not gotten rid of the previous colony base.

Not having a colony base that allows you to easily and cheaply settle colonies in the same star system makes the game far harder for no logical reason. You would not build a full colony ship that's capable of traveling to other stars to go to the moon.

It has a lot of things going for it: it's using the name of the series with the best 4x game ever made, it was made over twenty years after that title, and it doesn't call itself ""MoO 4"" out of respect that no one will acknowledge that the abortion of a game called MoO 3 even exists. But it isn't good. They reinvented every wheel, and it's poor.

They hired big-name sci-fi voice actors for this. That's cool and all; much love for Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, and John DeLancie, their characters are fond parts of my childhood. But no offense to them, this game just doesn't need them and doesn't use them properly. I'm certain they didn't do their work pro-bono (nor should they be expected to), so that's money that could have been used to buy the developers copies of MoO 2 and have them actually play it. 

The interface in MoO 2 was excellent in every regard; buttons and choices were unobstrusive and intuitive. And if you weren't certain, you could right-click on any button in MoO 2 and a detailed tooltip would pop up. The interface in this game feels like it was made for consoles; big blocky buttons with big ugly pictures on half of them, and the rest try to be minimalist and fail at their actual purpose. Rather than having a list of the names of buildings you can build on a planet like you did in MoO 2, now every building has a huge clunky 3d model under its name taking up most of the space in the list, and the buildings barely look like anything distinct or even related to what they are. 

Movement is restricted to hyperlanes, the same method that the developers of Stellaris eventually forced their players to use because they couldn't figure out how to make any other movement system work. It is lazy, it is boring, it is limiting, and - given the degree of freedom present in MoO 2 - it is insulting. 

I could go on and on about how bad this game is in comparison to MoO 2, but it's bad for my blood pressure. Luckily I still have my original MoO 2 disc, heck I played it just a few months ago before I even got the reboot. This game isn't so bad that the fans will deny its very existence like MoO 3, but it still has no reason to use the Master of Orion name.",1593103871,1593103871,False,74,3,0.781554460525512695,0,True,False,False

Dont get me wrong, as a MoO2 Player with hundreds of hours spending there, i must say that this game

I've run into 0 problems with the base game, and would definitely recommend it to those returning to the series, especially if you enjoyed Master of Orion II. For newcomers, there's plenty of settings and tutorial hints for you if needed. 

I think my only gripe with it is how difficult the Diplomacy system works, as AI will never accept a fair deal, but unless you're going for achievements specific to diplomatic victories- it's far more fun to glass the opposition.

Also you can have your leader be Mark Hamill (Alkari) or Robert Englund (Khanate).",1590647703,1590647990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I primarily do this because although this version is of the game is aproximately 1/2 way between MOO2 and MOO3.  If you've ever played MOO3, you remember that it was a colossal failure; whereas, its predecessor MOO2 was a smashing success.

This game kept the much of the battle system from MOO3, I preferred the tactical turn based style of MOO2 - it made more sense as far as weapon recharge time and range dissipation.  With the present system, it is very difficult to correlate what a weapon recharge rate of 2 will actually mean in combat.  The ability to assign ships to a role was present in MOO3, but also not that useful; so its appearance in this version, did not add to the game.

The return of the MOO2 races in this version is a great highlight.  I love the return to fun animations, as well as the back stories and the inclusion of how a races religious or ecological outlook affects their game choices.  Those who remember MOO3 will recall that an aspect like this was rumored to have originally been in the game, but removed prior to release.

The inclusion of space pirates, was a wonderful touch, as it brought back memories of the barbarians from the civilization series - pesky little annoyances that granted various rewards when you eliminated their home base.  I sincerely like this as it tied into other great game series.

The GNN has good humor and there are also fun jokes in the tech tree if you know were to look.

Colony management is more complicated then in MOO2, and honestly I don't like the diminishing returns for assigning multiple population units to a single task.  However, I do have to admit that, that aspect is probably more true to reality then people would like to admit.  That said, colony management is massively improved over MOO3.

I do like the idea that different races want a different planetary environment, this game touches on that without going into as much detail as MOO3.  MOO3 was just over the top on this point.  This game could have gone a little farther on this point and it would have been positive.  One thing that I don't like is the lack of description on what some racial traits mean, such as subterranean or grasslands.  What is the advantage of these if I am making a custom race?  MOO2 was simple in that subterranean meant twice the population limit for the planet.  I am unsure what it means in this game.

…. And now a few things make sense…

… And now I see where a lot of really annoying mechanics and overs simplifications actually came from! I found myself repeating myself with the words “ah so YOU are responsible for this idea are you??!?!?!?!” I did this several times over the last 2 weeks where I put just over 40 hours into this game.

My first play through was one empire, picked at random the Elerians; a psychic, gender split race that seemed quite interesting from the get go. After winning through an economic victory (although at the time I was no.1 for military, technology and antarian victory conditions), I decided to continue playing to see what else I could achieve. 

I found this race to be totally overpowered and broken in two ways: 
-	Firstly, being psychic… this race doesn’t need scouts. They can see literally the whole galaxy for the entirety of the game. NOTHING is hidden, you can see every base, ship and colony without exploring them. BOOM! Military strategies can be implemented at the most opportunistic time, you’ll never have a coloniser ambushed by unexpected fleet, you’ll know where all the best, most valuable choke points and planets for colonisation are. It is basically impossible to loose playing this race. 
-	Secondly, again because this species are psychic… they don’t need to invade enemy planets, garrison them to indoctrinate or pacify the citizens or use inefficient troop transports. You see, because of their psychic trait this species can simply initiate a “mind control” attack using any ship of battleship size of larger.  

But apart from inherent OP nature of some factions there are other issues with this game: 
- Un-Skippable voice overs and introductions: Picking a faction, starting a game, choosing research options, colonising a planet… OK I admit you can “skip” these, but there is no option to just not have to go through the whole process and just cut out the whole, “fade, load, skip, fade, load” process. 
- Annoying level of micro management. You can only que up 5 improvements to a planet at a time. In a game where the colonisation is a continual process (either because new tech makes a planet viable or because someone bombed a colony into dust). This is a nightmare, especially when the “automation/ auto build / colony focus” feature makes some bizarre and useless choices; such as when I told my 1 pop colony to focus on food and the first thing the AI built was a recyclotron….    
- No process for manufacturing entire fleets at a press of a button and having automation split the constructions between different ques, more micro! I’ve seen independent games have better functionality and automation, why couldn’t a triple A title do the same? 
- Space Combat is atrocious. Ships won’t use special abilities, the camera fly’s across the map regularly, when ordered to attack a target your ships will move up to range, come to a dead stop and shoot until they die… there is no consideration or visible representation of firing arcs, only guns mounted at the front or given full turret facing seem to count, it is quite frankly…  Retarded.       
- This game chugs like a bastard on late games with larger galaxies- which is odd because it is so dumbed down there should be too much calculation going on to slow things down. 
- The bugs, I’ve had pirate bases spawn on top of planets I’ve colonised and constantly die in waves to the space station, batteries and ships stationed there.
- The game freezing at odd moments after bombarding a colony, opening a construction menu or any other tab that needs a second to load. 
- The inability to rename individual planets. I mean at some point you’ll have over 50 colonies and they will merge into one, if you can’t rename them so as to better remember what each one does and what you want to do with it as you progress through the game, well you are going to be writing things down a lot.
- With the items you can rename- (ships and systems) naming function having a very limited number of characters, so best use short names or come up with some abbreviated terms “planet killer” is too many characters, but “plnt kllr” is just about ok. 
- Only one of each “improvement” allowed on a planet, why? These places are freaking huge, and one subterranean fungus farm isn’t going to be as space intensive as a space port or an orbital dock yard is it? Why wouldn’t you just spam out a couple of these things to keep a colony fed? 
- Pirate raiders spawning on a base, 2 turns after I bomb said base into scrap… 
-The constant notifications of “Threatening Fleet Detected”… which turns out to be a space monster sitting on a planet 3 systems over from me not doing anything at all… why waste my time like this? How easy could it be to code out neutral space monsters from the warning alert? 
-The Idiotic pirate fleets throwing raiders and marauders down a star lane singularly at my space station for 100 turns until they learn they can’t beat it…. Turns out they didn’t learn, another empire came from the opposite side of the system and wiped the pirate base. But how immersion breaking is that they have about 1/10 of the power of a simple station, yet continually throw themselves at it? 
- Trade deals last 20 turns and then have to be re started? Why not allow the empires to determine their own deal length? Why not permit a continuing deal? Why add in an extra layer of “click, click, click” where I lose any interest in the diplomatic text and avatar animations? 
- Ship design “upgrades” will actually replace the mathematically superior designs with new ones based on the newest technology you have no on DPS or effectiveness. Resulting in a lot of dicking about trying to fix things after the game has broken them. 
 - Diplomacy- when the AI takes their turn to make a diplomatic offer to you, there is no facility for you to make a counter offer or negotiate their offer- you have a binary agree /disagree choice- considering the AI is open to negotiate during your turn, it’s weird that you cannot do the same in return. 
- Recruitable “leaders” who have relatively minor powers/abilities have wage bills in the BILLIONS of credits… more than it takes to run a battle station… Why, in a setting where colonies contain literally billions of people (I’m presuming that each little pop carton is a billion people) is one particular individual worth so much, and why is it only that one individual has that level of skill? 
- Why do all these ships have infinite fuel and ammo and crew supplies? Why, if ammo is infinite do I have a limit in the number of bombs I can drop on an enemy colony per turn? 
- Why do transport ships last a total of one turn and then as soon as they are used to deliver troops or population do they then disappear? I mean couldn’t I take them back to the point of origin and fill them back up? 
- Why can’t I design the bases and space stations my empire uses? 

As you can see, I have “some issues” with this game, in fact I fucking hated playing it. Every mechanic, every rule or facet of the game seemed to be designed to just be as pretty, simple and easy to play as possible. The design philosophy seemed to be “give the fools the shiny pretty things… that should stop them from having to think about things…” 
I think my issues with the new MOO sort of encapsulate the issues with modern AAA games as a whole; shiny, pretty, fast game play. About mile wide and an inch deep no thought, no tactical or strategic planning- just keep clicking on things to hear the soft chime noises and get that dopamine hit. I appreciate this is an unpopular opinion, and as the saying goes- “opinions, they are like arse-holes, everyone has one, no one really wants to see someone else’s” but lo’ the number fucks I have to give is zero. I am sick of this over simplified crap.

The game now is written by folks that are completely clueless as to how to create an interface. There are tons of this problem that will give you carpel tunnel if your not careful. I will give one example.

Any one that knows anything about a 4X turned base game knows that there will probably only one user in the house. In order to re start a game with the same specs (in other words re generate a new map) you have to go all the way back through all of the menus from the start. About 15 clicks and 8 pages later you can start a new map. There are many places in the game that reveal total ignorance as to how an interface works easily instead of completely complicated. Hundred ship fleet? Need to click each ship to divide that up, up to a hundred clicks, and so on and so on.

So you young guys writing this stuff take a lesson.

First page you see says in this order.

CONTINUE; not go to choose single player or anything else and click 15 times, just continue.

RE START,  this means push one button and restart with a new map of the same game. Not click fifteen times and go through whole damn menu with 8 pages again.

NEW GAME or, CONFIGURE NEW GAME. This means start over and or do something different. It is that simple.

This games alongside witch real time battles introduced ridiculously long wait time before you could retreat so to actually retreat from battle you will have to survive A LOT of hits making this option practically useless.
2) Aggression outside of war. I know perfectly well that this ""feature"" come up directly form MOR and MOR2 but this is REALLY bad example of inheritance. What the point of declaring war if you could do full-scale space battles in ""peace-time"".  And this does nightmare combo with issue 1.

The new:
[list]
[*] Real time combat.  There's formations that give bonuses to attack & defense for certain weapons, or a speed boost.  In the end, taking control matters as I can win when outmatched by using tactics - aka running away at full speed & slinging missiles at ships that would otherwise pulverize me up close.  But my actions do make a difference, it's not quite total war but it's nice.  And beats the old MoO 2 end game battles that would take forever to try and manually control 100+ doomstars.
[*] Warp-lines.  No more going from star A to star B, now there's warp connections that your ships travel between which can lead to bottlenecks to expansion, more severe on certain galaxy shapes like spirals.  As a result you can now fortify choke points with defense fleets & outposts.  But the Antarans can show up anywhere - so don't neglect your heartland.  You can eventually build a network of jump gates to vastly increase travel speed along a far flung empire & respond to threats.

[*] Research

A very well made update of an older classic. Feels quite close to Master of Orion 2 meets Vanilla Civ 5.

Pros:
Nice visuals. Good music. Good atmosphere. Intuitive playstyle. Great voice acting. High replayability. High variety of playable races. Humor.

Cons:
1) Population growth mechanic slows the game down considerably, compared to previous iterations. Silicoid Race severly hampered due to this. This game lacks the Housing build of MoO2 or corressponding techs.
2) Slight imbalance with custon races, as the standard races have higher budgets for traits, which kind of makes custom races a mute point.",1588108081,1588108081,True,15,2,0.635461866855621338,0,True,False,False

So I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.

One Hour Reviews #64 - Master of Orion

I do remember the Master of Orion trilogy from years ago, and I had always heard good things about it, but I never did get around to playing any of them.  And now that I've played this reboot, I kind of regret that, as I definitely feel like I have missed out on something good here.

The game opens with a quick cutscene, after which I play around with the options a bit, mostly the usual cranking up the graphics options.  I looked at the gameplay options, but I ended up leaving everything as their defaults just because I wasn't clear on what many of the options actually did.   But it definitely left me with the impression that there was a lot you could tweak.

You get several options for starting a game, but since I'd never played any of these games before, I went with the Tutorial Match.   What this ends up doing is giving you a bit of a on-rails experience with the start of the game.  At first it was a little confusing because I would try to click things that wouldn't respond, but once I realized I was on-rails, it wasn't such a big deal.

You start out with a colony ship which you use to settle on a new planet, along with a couple of scout ships.  The scout ships you use to explore the current star system and beyond.   So far, this is pretty standard 4x style gameplay.  If you've played other games in this genre, then it will feel pretty comfortable. 

You start out with a single planet, but then the tutorial will have you use the colony ship to colonize a new planet.  It warns you at the same time that it's not a very good planet to colonize.   Each planet in the system is rated based on it's size, what biome it is, and what minerals are available.  Picking a bad planet means that you are limited in how far you can develop it.  This is why you also have the scout ships to start out with, so that you can uncover some better planets to colonize.

Next the game introduces you to research, which again, if you've ever played any of these kind of games before will be completely expected.   You select a technology to research, which unlocks various new benefits and opens up more technologies to unlock.    Some research items will take more time than others to unlock, but you can also influence this by how you distribute your population.  

Your population is distributed across 3 areas: research, food, and production.   Research influences the speed in which you can complete your current research task.   Food will impact your ability to grow the planet population.  Too little food and your planet will starve.  More food will decrease the time before your population can grow.   Production determines how quickly you can build new ships.  Right off the bat the tutorial has me build a Frigate, as the colony and scout ships are pretty defenseless.  

At this point, the tutorial starts introducing some of the other aspects of the game, like the Empire Management screen that gives you an overview of your empire.   Next is espionage, which apparently lets you train interstellar agents to spy on other empires.  But at this point in the game you lack the technology to do any of this, so the tutorial is just kind letting you know it's coming.  

Then comes fleet management, where you can get a view of all of the different fleets in your empire.  At this point I just have my 2 scout ships exploring the nearby star systems.  The Path To Victory screen shows you the different ways you can win the match, which I'm sure is influenced by the kind of match you choose to play.   This reminds me of the Civilization games which also give you multiple ways to win.

After introducing all of these screens, the tutorial lets me get back to playing.  I build my frigate, and not long after the tutorial introduces your first enemy, which is a pirate ship located in a nearby star system.   I'm directed to move my frigate into a position where it will guard the star system and be able to intercept the pirate ship should it come.   

You can set your scout ships to Auto Explore if you don't want to micro-manage them.  Doing this will allow the scout ships to continuously explore new areas.  The scouts will analyze each planet in a star system before picking a random unexplored system to move to next.  Another thing is that scouts can also uncover anomalies which are like random events.  In my case I found an abandoned container that gave me some credits.

You earn credits by taxing your population.  You can change the rate at which you tax your people, but the higher the tax, the unhappier your population.   You can spend credits to allow for something in-progress to finish early, such as a research project or ship you are building.

Not surprisingly, that pirate ship moved into my primary star system, where my frigate was waiting for it.   You get a few different options for the battle.  First is auto-resolve, which is the quickest option where it will immediately do some calculations to determine the outcome.   You can also take command to take a more hands-on role in the battle.  

At this point I'm about 30 minutes into my playthrough, and the tutorial is increasingly off the rails now, leaving me to explore and manage my systems.   When I ended one of my turns, I got this really strange interlude from the ""Galactic News Network"" where a couple of robots are giving the news.  This is done as a way of conveying random events which will have an impact on your empire, such as a population bonus.  I say it's strange because it's all very tongue-and-cheek, and up to this point the game has been very straight-faced, so it was kind of jarring.  I did notice though the game gives you the option to disable GNN if you find it annoying.

One nice feature, among the overview screens is a Planets screen which will list all of the known planets you've found that aren't colonized.  So that definitely makes it easier to find a good candidate to settle on.  I also discovered as I uncovered more planets that they will sometimes have a special feature that can give a bonus, such as increased production.

Besides ships, you can build other types of facilities.   You can build planetary buildings to speed up your ability to research, grow your population, or build other things.   You can also build space-bound items such as a star base, or a missile base for defense.  Or you can build a Space Factory, which you can setup somewhere in your system and use it to build other projects.  Unfortunately, this came at the tail end of my hour, so I didn't really get a good sense for what else you could build.

Overall, I thought the tutorial did a great job at introducing the game in a way that was not overwhelming right away.  It makes it very easy to pick up and overall a very accessible game.  I had a ton of fun playing this.  And that is the surest sign to me to give a game my recommendation, when all I want to do is keep playing it.  I was not ready to put this game down after an hour. Another good sign is when I spend more time writing the review than I did playing the game.  I came out of this not only with an appreciation for the game, but a renewed curiosity about the original trilogy.

I always include my disclaimer at the top that these reviews are a first impression.  But that's especially true for these types of games, as they tend to run pretty long, and I don't feel that I uncovered a whole lot in the first hour.   So do please check out some other reviews in case there are some later game annoyances that I did not come across.",1587934083,1587934673,True,4,0,0.489730596542358398,0,True,False,False

I think moo2 is still better (see below) but in general they made several improvement and good mechanic modifications. It's one of the best turn based 4x space opera game. For me, it surpass Galactic Civilization and Endless space 1 by far.

Surprisingly real time space battle are relatively interesting. I think the key element is to have some feedback about the efficiency of your ship design so that you can make proper adjustment. There is unfortunately not a lot of decisions to take during battle, and they are pretty complex to input. While moving the camera around is also very annoying. It might just be better to watch the battle and let the AI handle everything. (I would rarely say this for other games)

Now my main complaint is the game time. I know that a part of the problem is me as I also have problems with civilization which can take me 30 hours to play on a tiny map in civ 5. Here I started a new game where I put the production to the fastest speed, and after 6.5 hours of game play, I only have 3 planets. I used the smallest map, and personally, I find it too big. I know some modders are making maps bigger than the the biggest map. So the problem is probably me.

There is a lot of micro management in the game, which means a lot of meaning less decision by positioning workers, and selecting buildings to make. I don't know if aging made me more allergic to those kind of mechanics. Or if it's me who have less time than before to play long games and would prefer a game that plays completely within 5 hours. From my memory, master of orion 2 games too me probably a dozen of hours. So Moo2 might be faster to play.

If you like civilization like games, then this game is a no brainer. If you want a fast space strategy game that plays as fast as a 4x board game (ex: Twilight imperium, Eclipse) then you will not have what you are looking for.",1587304421,1587304421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The above camera view has been fixed since I last played.. much better. Pretty good game. I like the racial visuals better than Stellaris by far.  The ship combat and construction is enjoyable. Keeping track of so many planets gets tedious in the late game, but that is typical of this type of game. Only real complaint I can find is that there is no user friendly way to split fleets.. it must be carried out by setting one ship at a time to a new location and then attempting to regroup them.. if you were patient enough to split them that way in the first place.. it definitely pushes one to use more capital ships late game.

I played a bunch of it, and it can be fun, at times...but there are glaring problems, and I really can't recommend it at all.

Firstly: This game is incredibly buggy.  Let's run down some related problems, in order.

1: Single-threaded (it seems) game can only use one core to process all that happens in a turn.  This means turns take longer and longer to process, especially in a large galaxy, and it's absurdly slow.
2: If you keep colonizing and conquering as you get new technology, each, half-hour-long turn will be spent managing population, production queues, sending fleets out, etc., and that's before Antarans make you panic and have to shift everything around and lose a colony.
3: At some point, I'm not sure when, the game just...crashes when you try to load a game.  The turns come fine in order, but if you don't want to keep your computer on through a whole marathon game session (which may take multiple days, if your galaxy is big enough), you go from slowly trudging through the game to being unable to play it at all.  Guess you're starting over!

The original Master of Orion is the grand-daddy of all good 4x space games.  This game isn't the masterpiece Master of Orion 2 was, and even Master of Orion 1 was fantastic.  This new game is beautiful, but not worth your time.  If you get the right pack, comes with those two other games for DOSBox, but really, you'd be better served just buying those if you want a good Master of Orion experience.",1582981928,1584720343,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stellaris is probably the most notable one at the moment that'll offer you similar gameplay (minus the turn based) but does just about everything better.  I'd even go as far as to say Endless Space is a better game than this.  Now if this had come out 10+ years ago one might consider it passable.  But the 4x space games have come so far since then that when you try to clone the original MOO you just end up with a shallow experience.

As of 2/27/2016
Master of Orion it's like most modern remakes (Civ5, Beyond Earth, Supreme Commander 2, X-Rebirth, SimCity, Sacred 3) streamlined, simplified, and dumbed down to the point where it hardly makes for interesting gameplay.

Edit:
If you're looking for reviews as to whether to buy this game, consider this:

If you're looking for a 4X game like Sword of the Stars, Space Empires, Distant Worlds, to an extent Galactic Civ, Star Drive, Star Ruler:
Then no, this is nothing like the games above in it's current form.

If you're looking for Endless Space or similarily simplified versions:
Then maybe, this game is possibly most similar to Endless Space than anything else at the moment.

I had my fun but man the game in vanilla just eats at you after the first time you manage to complete a run, bout 7-10 hours on a medium galaxy with the default turn limit for score victory and without the Antaran raiders attacking you. The Antarans generally attack the race who is leading in one of the win conditions, empire management (score). They attack the race's world with the highest defense rating (if your fleet is there that's where they go). If you plan to aim for a conquest victory they will make the game quite hellish until around turn 250 up which is past the 5 hour mark where your ships assume enough mass, armor, and weaponry to do something. Often you'd need orbital defenses to be the meat shields they are in vanilla else your fleet would still be overwhelmed as the Antarans do indeed scale by turn rather than the leading race's military or score. They can and will swamp your ass with over 70 ships many of which may be destroyers and above. Without mods to make orbital defenses worth a damn, they will kick your ass allllll the way to end game when you finally get battleships upwards or manage to cheese the Orion world's guardian (essentially a battleship) for advanced weapons and armor and an uber planet.

More on ships, there is absolutely nothing in the vanilla game that can compete with just spamming an overwhelming amount of missiles. Just get bigger ships with big payloads of absurd numbers of missiles and there's any naval battle instantly ruined by cheese as the AI hybridizes their weapons and will RARELY build a ship rated above cruiser and just build up a bunch of low weight frigates, destroyers, and cruisers showing that their navy is braindead. This actually counters your spam as missiles do not inherently find new targets if their target has been destroyed meaning they fly and go boom in the void of nothing. However by end game your tonnage is so high that they cant possibly hurt your battleships upwards and your ships that are cruisers will always take 4 or more enemies down before they die due to the enemies' bad AI and game's horrible blueprint auto designer. Also there is a guidance system that completely removes one of the 2 weaknesses of missiles. The enemy will never use ECM so that might as well not even be a damn weakness. I mentioned this before but the only orbital defense worth a damn is the star base and its upgrades, not because it actually serves as a defense platform, but because it wields the health of a battleship and acts as aggro to the retarded enemy ai. Mod the ai and orbital defense to make both actually intimidating. 

From my 30 or so vanilla hours i haven not observed any distinction between racial ai. They all act the same and is displayed in the worst possible light when the silicoid, a race who does not eat, asks for food related research. No empire takes advantages of its traits nor acts in character, i.e. humans being diplomatic traders. Often no one does trade deals, research exchange until you go to them and they often request retarded demands like colony cessions for something like a trade deal a simple non aggression pact. A MUST MOD for any real enjoyment.

Management is fine for the most part. Taxing is the issue here as you lose out on a lot of money because taxes are empire wide rather than planet specific. This means some breeding world will mint a pretty penny while a production world will always get ungrateful striking cunts because production builds pollution (elaborated in a bit). Pollution in vanilla spirals UNBELIEVABLY out of control. If you find a godsend of a system with a ultra rich planet with sister planets that are abundant or even poor and manage to make it an industrial powerhouse of a system, you will ALWAYS reach near max pollution.

If you do reach max pollution, you degrade the planet's biome, and the side effects of pollution is increased need of food and decreased happiness of civilians (them getting miffed about your already low 3 currency per pop rate), which leads to striking, reassigning people to food, and having to stop building that flagship you wanted to clean up the pollution, You will do this twice or more for any ship above cruiser on the tech tree and also for terraforming a damned planet. This snowballs ridiculously and you waste enormous amounts of money per planet for pollution processing buildings that dont even solve the problem; it only applies a miniaturized stop gap bandaid. My advice there is to just get a mod that reduces the gain or just get the core waste dump mod which makes that building (it is an end game building so no worries about busting scaling there) just negate all pollution altogether. I dont even remember which mod does this but it makes it so terraforming a planet counts toward pollution cleanup instead of pollution creation. Modding alleviates most of the grievances aside of how long a game takes to play out which is something i'd rather never experience again thanks to Bethesda. This game takes quite a bit of modding to make the game replayable after the 1st playthrough.

I'm just gonna stop here as there is just too much more to say and i've been here for a half hour typing this already and tell you unless you're willing to visit the steam workshop for mods to make any run past the first enjoyable, Don't buy this. Also the multiplayer is very much dead, and it'll be a crazy day in hell before a friend on your friend's list decides to play this with you due to it being a less popular 4x game. Despite me enjoying the game a considerable amount, Bethesda has taught that you should most certainly should not require a modding community to make a game worth playing and this game certainly would not be worth touching if it didnt have mods.

The 4x community have been asking for a new MOO for a looong time, and we finally got it.  

What this game does well is stick to the old formula that made the original such a great game. It's a very simple 4x game compared to the more recent ""complex"" ones, and that's not a bad thing.   Depending on the player you are, you may love or hate this.   What it doesn't do is add much of anything new.  There are some minor changes and additions (added star-lanes, buildable ""starbases""), but nothing drastic that changes how the game was played, except for maybe combat.

 The one major thing they took out was turn-based combat.   Instead, they put in real-time combat when battles happen.  I personally love it, it allows you to just watch the AI battle, or if you want, you can take command (or have AI assist) of your units and have a say in what you want to do.  While MOOII turn-based combat was fun, it could really take a loooooong time to get thru one battle during mid-late game.  Having 30vs30 ship battles went horribly slow for turn-based combat.  Even if you let the AI take over it would take quite awhile.  This newer combat system works well, and it does it's purpose.  It's a much needed face-lift to an old classic.  

The one void here, that newer games do well, is exploration and story. There are anomalys to discover with little stories behind it, but nothing compared to something like Stellaris.  This game also doesn't feel as big.  You have games like Stellaris and Distant Worlds which really make you feel you're in this huge universe full of hundreds of stars.

This game is perfect for those who want to dip their toes in space 4x, nothing will overwhelm you like some of these newer, bigger, more complex 4x games.  You can sit down and easily learn how things work right off the bat.  This game is also good for veterans of the genre.  It's just a really solid 4x game.

Master of Orion is essentially an updated verion of MOOII with some minor improvements.  The graphics are great, the voice acting is fantastic, and it's still the same game I've always loved playing.

You can't go wrong with this game, it might not have all the bells and whistles as the newer 4x games, but it's still very solid.  Easily a 8/10.",1523234011,1583534926,True,3,0,0.518080532550811768,0,True,False,False

As far as gameplay is concerned - it hasn't changed all that much from the early access game I played a couple of years back, which is to say, it's an extremely perfunctory, phoned-in remake of MoO2. It's not dreadful, but nor is it terribly exciting, The gameplay is *very* slow, the AI is very passive (and often just plain irrational), it's unbalanced as all heck and generally lacking polish. Tons of minor UI bugs, unclear description text and misleading numbers - as an example, Elerians receive bonuses to beam weapons, however, it's impossible to discern in-game what exactly qualifies as a ""beam weapon"" and what doesn't. It also runs like an absolute dog on my modest Macbook Pro, even at lowest graphical settings - which for a turn based strategy game is very silly.

It's a real shame, because had the developers spent a few extra months doing QA testing, optimising, and refining - or even provided some decent post-release updates - this could have been the definitive entry in the MoO franchise. Instead it seems they've just grabbed the money and run. It's definitely not worth its exorbitant price tag; much better to grab the vastly superior Stellaris or reinstall MoO2.

It has a ton of polish put into it, and feels like a mostly faithful re-imagining of Masters of Orion 2 (the best of the original series). The game has some draw-backs and falls a little flat in areas compared to other 4X titles that have been around for quite some time. That said it's still a solid game, and worth the buy if you're looking for a new 4X experience.

Details:

The 4Xs:

eXploration - Exploration is the one X that feels like it falls the most flat. Even larger map sizes ultimately feel pretty small. This is likely to prevent overly long and uneventful games. I don't mean small as in ""it takes very little time to get from one side to the other"" I mean small as in ""there isn't a lot of interesting diversity among stellar objects"". Planets tend to fall into ""when will I colonize these"" tiers, and unless you're on a higher difficulty most races seem to want to just expand as much as possible because population is EVERYTHING in this game (I'm only 20hrs in, but also I've played a TON of 4X games so make of that what you will). 

eXpansion: The way that systems are constructed in the game makes expansion feel a little strange. In the early game you're mostly scouting out places to plop down, but good early game roosts are few and far between (at least for the races I've played). Late game it becomes an exercise in getting 3 pop ready for transport, and a bit of credits for the first few building buy outs. Wam, bam, new functional colony within a matter of turns. You can definitely start getting things going FAST if you've set yourself up to do so. The biggest issue with expansion in the game is that since the maps are fairly small you're more immediately thrown into conflict or diplomatic relations.

eXploit: Plenty of resources to exploit here, and its nice that there are a few juggling factors to it as well. Pollution feels like a great balancing mechanic for reaping to prep for war and recovering when its time for peace. I love the back and forth of it. That said I can see it becoming less engaging as I get better at that balancing pattern.

eXterminate: Combat in this game is enjoyable. Space battles are mostly smooth and share elements with combat from Sword of the Stars. Ship customization is a lot of fun, and weapons feel mostly well balanced against others in the same tech tier. The game doesn't feel the need to add a third pointless dimension to combat which is nice, but still allows you to exploit advantages like range properly. Once you engage your opponents in their range though it turns into Gratuitous Space Battles as ships fly around chaotically it becomes harder to perform meaningful tactics. If the developers had added a few more weapons (like mines) it would have been an amazing experience. As of right now its just ""pretty good"". Additional ship hulls would have also added a lot to the flexibility of combat. Instead you'll be playing a lot more with lay-out and saved ship designs. That all said the Auto-battle function works fairly predictably so while you may not have as good of results as you could achieve through manual control for those who don't wish to engage with the system, auto-battle seems mostly fine.

The Population Problem: So far my experience with this game has been that Population is one of the most important things. Its practically impossible to run an empire as a ""tall"" empire because planets have max pop limits that are reached fairly easily, and its also impossible to run low-pop empires because you just don't have the credits, production, or research of larger empires. So the game practically forces you to expand constantly. This also means that races with bonuses to population growth or food are REALLY good compared to the others. A racial bonus to research just doesn't compete well with an empire who grows much faster and therefore can compete just as well with you on research... but also crush you on every other front. Its quite possible that there are counter-strategies to this, or a draw-back to large pop-empires that I'm not yet aware of but after 20hrs of play I haven't found anything. 

A Lack of Racial Variety: This isn't a complaint about the number of races, its a complaint about meaningful gameplay differences between races. Across the races I've played most of them encourage similar strategies (partially because of the population issue). There also aren't significant tech differences between races. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the first Sword of the Stars, but I miss unique race-ships, technologies, travel styles, etc.",1581976562,1581976562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rife with glitches, this game does not crash per se (animations and sounds still work), but it does get stuck after performing certain actions, requiring users to force quit through Alt+F4 or the Task Manager.

I have encountered three of these glitches in the past few days: after closing negotiations with the Klackon, upon beginning a large battle with 20+ ships, and, most recently, upon retreating at the end of a battle with some Antarans. I've probably seen more glitches like these, but I just started playing again after an absence of about two years and can't remember any of them.

Furthermore, the game speed and framerate drop significantly as larger games progress. I understand that an old RTS like Supreme Commander (2007) has issues trying to render 2000+ units (plus projectiles, shadows, bloom, terrain, etc.) on one map, but a relatively light 4X from 2016 has no excuse.

Gameplay, on the other hand, is enjoyable. (I don't have a good reference point to which I can compare MoO, so your mileage may vary.) The graphics are good enough, the art style is fantastic, and Wargaming tapped some pretty big names for voice acting.

If you can tolerate a few game breaking bugs and enjoy a solid 4X, go right ahead and buy it. (Edit: Holy crap it's $30! I take it back: wait for a sale - at least 1/3 off.) Otherwise, steer clear of Master of Orion. It's not like Wargaming needs your money.

The game is terrible. The AI is nothing more than a series of pre-planned events by seed. If you don't like a map, just quit, generate a new one increasing the seed. Doing this you'll soon realize that it makes no difference and that everything is just planned to hurt, including the UI. You can no longer see the stats of your ships from the main screen. I don't know why. You can't plan anything unless you take extra note on the missing information. The way ship names is managed is fugly and should probably be left alone. Those 2 things together is enough to piss off anyone.

You want a diplomatic report on another race, nope. Not anymore, they removed it. Oh they did manage to make some things better like splitting some tech in a more coherent tree, but you never know what gives what without having to scroll the entire thing looking for a particular entry by hovering on icons.

Everything in this game is unbearable, buggy or badly designed. The game frequently crashes. On linux it is impossible to set the resolution in full screen mode to anything you select. It just reverts your changes for whatever it feels like. I wish these kind of releases were banned from Steam, unfortunately I can't refund this piece of crap.",1581125889,1581126295,False,3,0,0.460966944694519043,0,True,False,False

Game runs perfect natively  under Linux on PC with Nvidia  as well as on Laptop with intel HD 4000 (20 FPS on laptop which is OK).

In game  settings you can  switch to full  screen but also  use windowed mode (The latter displays in the  settings screen a resolution of 640 by 480 but  uses actually  the full  desktop except  for  he  taskbar).  No graphics issues noticeable, just perfect.

Using the UCP Mod.



About the Game

It produces the  one-more-turn feeling - I'm totally hooked,  I love it! Also it makes you really feeling like ruling a galaxy. All the mechanics of the  game which you  realize during learning  to play work  well with each  other. At  the moment  I'm only  using the  UCP mod  which changes mostly  convenience but  doesn't change  gameplay. Will  pick up  the 5X balance mod in the future.

The UI is done  really nice with soooo much love  for detail.  Watch the parallax scrolling of the stars  in the galaxy! The different characters you encounter on the diplomacy screen  are voiced nicely and are created with  a lot a devotion for detail.

Don't activate the timeline but instead save whenever you think a proper moment has come. Activating the timeline saves every turn of the history which leads to BIG save files.

Summary - if you love turn based strategy don't hesitate to pick up this one. The devs have put a lot of love in this one.",1580677076,1580677569,True,0,0,0.496837109327316284,0,True,False,False

This is 4X for the casuals. And I don't mean a casual play through, I mean the game is dumbed down to the point where it's aimed at toddlers to play. Everything is basic and simplified. There are a few excellent mods that add some missing features and fix a few of the broken UI issues but the core game is still a dumbed down baby X4 game. 

Ground combat is two numbers and who has the bigger number wins. 
You can rename systems but not planets which is a pain when a system has more than one planet and you need to swiftly check a production queue. 
You get 8 blueprints for ships and that's it. Meaning you can't build different fleets for different tasks, you can't create cool tactical plans using fast missile boats or fleet carriers flanked by tanks. You can't have that cloaked assassin ship to flank an enemy. You get one type of frigate, destroyer, battleship and so on. You have a total of two extra slots you can make a custom build and that's it! All because the designer didn't like a tab button or scroll bars on his nice clean UI! Minimalism and 4X don't mix well! 

The vanilla game lacks any variety in biomes, events, plot, races, ships. 

The game is still glitchy in late turns with random issues like the menu not loading or battles getting stuck or the bombardment screen not showing the outcome. These can all be fixed by closing the game and reloading, but it's still a pain. 

There is a distinct lack of customization in games. You can't pick to play against 5 human races or select what events you want to enable. You can't disable certain victory conditions. 

It's a very restrictive game with a lack of depth. 

But it's not terrible. There is some nice things and well done aspects of the game. The graphics in battles are great, the UI for the most part is pretty clean and easy to navigate, if just lacking a lot of details that should be in a 4X game. 

Overall it's not a patch on past MOO games or other 4X games and it doesn't even come close to Stellaris which is the best 4X game going right now. If you're a 4X fan and you want a really really basic 4X game for you kids to learn the basics on, or for a quick evening game then this might be just what you want. If you really want a X4 game you can be engrossed in then go for Stellaris. 

To date there are few decent 4X games on the market and most games in this genre come from indy Devs with a very poor track record for support and continuous updates. Cough cough Stardrive… 

So the fact MOO works and does have continued support from the Devs is another plus. It's just such a shame it was so dumbed down.

Masters of Orion (4?) Conquer The Stars is a remake of MOO2. It has some fairly decent basic Game Mechanics, and some pretty/amusing cut-scenes, but is difficult to enjoy, even though I really want to. Don't waste your time unless you're okay with all of the following. 
Key issues:
1) The game is incredibly slow. Not always a deal breaker, but you need maybe 40 turns before seeing if the randomly generated galaxy is worth playing 
2) The randomly generated galaxies spawn a lot of garbage planets but very few worth colonising - even with the settings amended to increase the number of planets
3) (edited) It took far too long to figure out how to upgrade ships. If the option appears at all, it says ""This action is not currently available"" instead of something useful like ""this action can only be performed at a starbase"".  Sadly, this is the sort of lazy unhelpful placeholder text that sunk MOO3
4) The diplomatic engine is outright lazy. Other races will only trade for your highest tech and won't settle for 2-3 lesser techs, even if it is technology they can't even use (e.g. Silicoids wanting Soil Enrichment and refusing all other options)
5) The game has been out for several years and is still buggy. I suddenly can't renegotiate research treaties as the AI says this will cost 135,473 BC (more than any race will earn the entire game)
6) As with the infamous MOO3 the information conveyed to the player is often nonsensical or non-existent. Leaders come with sparse nonsensical descriptions for their overpriced abilities. There really hasn't been  much effort put into conveying useful information to inform your decisions
7) Your peons start complaining the moment you hit 4 or 5 people on a new planet and then refuse to help build the stuff they need to survive. Unlike most 4X games, you can't adjust taxes for a specific colony. Either you bleed money from your entire galactic tax system or just carry some deadbeats on your new planets until you build the right buildings, thus slowing the game down even further
8) You can only carry 4 Blueprint designs. One for each  size of ship. There does not appear to be any way of seeing what specs your existing ships have, which again, seems like another pointless gap in the basic information you need and another basic fail in 4X game design
9) It's a lot harder to move populations around than it used to be. You need the right tech to build transports and they disappear and can't be reused for some reason. Because I guess the grateful peasants you ship use them to build a giant statue of you when they get where they are going?? This slows things down a lot.
10) The game takes forever. Largely because of pointless game limitations mentioned above. If you liked the largescale battles from the original, expect about 200 turns before that's going to happen.
11) The combat AI is comically bad. Usually the ships just walk in a straight line and then wait at the opposite of the map until the END OF TIME. If there's a starbase in the way, they won't even finish it off. Worse yet, if you exit the battle midway (e.g. because the enemy are nowhere near your station and have no intention of attacking it) the auto-resolve is based on the ships from the START of the battle. Which means that ships will magically pop back into existence even though you already blew them apart.  
12) Most of the game mechanics are simply ripped off from the Civ series. (the diplomacy engine, the respawning barbarian/pirate bases, the neutral races, the spacefactory/engineers, the population based happyness, etc, etc) That's not really a complaint, but Civilization did it a lot better. 
13) The alien AI are passive. So to spice things up, someone decided that the mongol hoardes should come rampaging across the map at turn 90. At that point in the game it will take about 10 turns to get your ships from one side of your territory to the other, so it will suck when the mongols (sorry Antaran) teleport in 3 turns away from a randomly selected world of yours. Expect to reload to muster your forces for a fair fight.
.
All that being said, the updated MOO2 graphics are cute, particularly the new msshran/psilon planets management mini-people.
 
If you do want to play this game, you'll save yourself 30 hours of trial-and-error by following a few basic game requirements that should have been a lot more obvious: 
1)  Send your ships back to a starbase often to update them to match your blueprint designs. 
2) It's not obvious, but you can also do this with your scouts and factories when you get better engines, so they can move around faster.  
3) When you start, immediately update your frigate blueprint design to include a nuke and then update your frigate at your homeworld - so you can take out pirate bases, otherwise they will eat your scouts. 
4)The game-mechanics do not permit your scouts to retreat from battle. They are required to drive themselves into a bezerker frenzy and then immediately kamikaze their way into Valhalla or something (only option is ""auto""). However they are cheaper and faster than frigates so....... 
5) Stack your ship designs with missiles that will out-range the enemy ships that are sitting on the edge of the map updating their tinder profiles. You can win most battles using the genius art of sending your ships slightly to the left (or swipe right - your call).
6) Start with a big homeworld. Your homeworld is less affected by morale/loyalty than any other planet. Which is weird, because for most empires your stinking dickensian metropolis is the reason people want to relocate to the colonies in the first place... 

Lastly: The primary source of dramatic tension is something you can't easily anticipate. From turn 90, every 20 turns, the mongols hordes will attack a random base with a large fleet and only 3 turns warning. The target is decided 2 turns before they appear, so save often.

BUT...
There's just not enough of it, or it falls short.
Ship design is cool, but not all that in-depth.  Most modules just have straight up upgrades, no interesting trade-offs to consider.
Colonisation and expansion has some great ideas, but takes an age, micromanagement is a pain and falls short of what is offered by other games.
Real time combat, this game's prime selling point to me... There was basically nothing meaningfully tactical about it.  Aside from maybe moving a damaged ship out of the fight, there was no real benefit to me taking direct control.

In short, it's really pretty.  Has a lot of cool ideas, but there are frankly just other games that do everything it tries to do better.  Endless Space 2 and Stellaris would be my suggestions.",1577624887,1577624887,False,0,0,0.481919467449188232,0,True,False,False

Sadly, with so many alternatives out there, I just can't recommend this one, as it would take away from play time that could be better spent on other games that do everything this one does and more.

I 'just' recommend it without mods--with mods, it's solid.

- Graphics are decent
- polished/not buggy
- By having starlanes, allows the introduction of some defensive and other constructions
- mod community has done some amazing stuff--I think absolutely necessary for an excellent game play experience
- still fun, and if MOO2 didn't exist it would be harder to criticise
- low barrier to entry (not complex like Stellaris or Distant Worlds: Universe)


[u]Cons[/u]
- Limited ship models
- Starlanes . . .  annoying and slow the game down.
- Random space events/space creatures seem nerfed to before.
- No Antaran attack? (I might have missed out on a setting here)

I don't mind change as long as it makes sense, if serves a purpose to make the game better, in fact I'm glad they managed to keep the successful formula of ""Familiar but fresh"" approach.

Oh one last thing also this game has a couple of weird bugs in it where sometimes it doesn't show the ship firing the stellar converter so a beam shoots out of nothing, or has a hard time quitting when you select quit game.
I hope this helps.

Awhile ago this game was low reviews because people didn't know what they were doing. I don't know how, its not that hard. Maybe they just didn't like how it wasn't an exact copy of past MoO games.

What differs for the most part is use of star lanes instead of traveling to anywhere. So systems have entrances you can put bases at, so you don't need to worry about ships crossing from nowhere to attack whatever they want. I like this change for the most part.

The voice acting is amazing, all star cast almost. Though some complain about annoying voices on some advisors, I feel thats whining just to whine. Mark Hamill is the alkari leader, I still don't believe it. The terran leader has the best personality imo, and is voice by the guy who was Freddy Kruegar!

The combat has a few options. Ranging from full control of units to cinematic fights. Other than some jerky movement I do cinematic fights (when I don't autocalculate). Unfortunately multiplayer has no battle options other than autocalculate, but I can understand why (games would be forever, and would take forever to do a turn unless it was 2 people fighting each other.

There are mods out there. I personally use UCP mod, it basically fixes some things with stuff the game had in it anyways (or so I think that's the purpose). People talk about how the game is better with a mod which I think is called 5x, but I really didn't like it. A mod to balance the meklar would be nice, but I didn't search for it.

Overall, the game is great. DLC I think makes game better (variety is good). I'm only saddened that you can tell the devs put effort into this, yet in the beginning they had subpar reviews. So stupid reviewers could have ended the series. I'm not sure though. For now I'm hoping thats not the case.

Get the game.

What's so unfortunate about this game is that it's ""almost there,"" which is better than a lot of space 4X games.  It has all of the pieces and some aesthetic aspects are surprisingly well-done.

But my GOD the pacing!  It's such an important aspect of 4X, and even though it's obvious, I never would have understood *how* essential it is to the experience until slogging through this mindless purgatory.  I spent two days of my life on that stupid 20-hour match, and I can never have them back.  I went 3 hours at a time with nothing of interest happening.  Place a building, pick a tech, wait for 50 turns.  They even have the option to tweak the pacing, but the slog-fest is hardcoded and the tweaking is an illusion.  Sure, you can change the literal pacing of tech, building, and population growth, but this is a problem with the base gameplay cycle and tweaking the actual turns involved doesn't change the fundamentals.  Unfortunately, this feeling can't be well described and you will be *well* beyond the 2-hour refund period.

It's almost exactly like MOO2 - except that it's boring as hell!  I don't know exactly how you suck the fun out of a game while barely changing it, but they managed to.  MOO2 + good graphics - all fun-factor.  And I'm going to play it again, because it *is* still addictive.

Starting in the late 80's going into the early 90's 4X games became one of the most successful genres in PC gaming, beginning with games like Armada and Spaceword Ho, followed by Sid Meyers Civilization.

Like many strategy games of its kind, MOO has a very straight forward approach to the user.  Settle on some planets, build, find more planets, build more ships, meet your neighbors and either make peace or conquer them.  Unlike most of the 4X Space games, MOO had some hallmark features including upgrading your ships after a research advance and diplomacy that impacted your overall gameplay.  2 sequels (the best of which is still MOO2), came out and while MOO3 was not considered a great game, it was still one of my favorite games.

For veterans, its a bit of a let down. Surely you get modern (although a bit dull) graphics, decent one time play through experience and nostalgia points but that's about it for the positive sides. Problems/lacking list is long but you can decide yourself how each of them matters to you, if at all.

First, the pacing of the game is very slow, especially at the beginning. Starlane system creates huge bottlenecks and stalls the game. The idea is probably more realistic than ""fuel cells"" but it kills game dynamics, exploration and element of surprise. Game also generates lots of dead end systems for the galaxy. It makes defending systems easier but attacks (rare occasion) become from predictable direction. Population growth of planets is snail pace even on terrain planets which adds to the slowness. AI is also quite passive and pacifist. After around 100-150 turns, something interesting, perhaps your first combat, might happen. 

Overall, there is far too few combat scenarios. Just micromanaging your colonies is not great fun. Passive AI doesn't bring much spark to the game: races pretty much keep to themselves and they have same boring tactics. Diplomatic event system is worse than MOO2. Races won't contact much and if they do, they mostly request attacking another race just to get your hands dirty since they don't fight much for themselves. I think even MOO1 had more realistic AI behavior in regards to diplomacy. AI mostly refuses to trade tech at all and always wants 100% better deals. At least audio-visually races in diplomacy screen are excellent with their animations and voice acting.

Next one is a biggie: space combats are gaming-wise boring. There is pretty much no means to strategize. What you do is pick your targets and press play and see how it goes. There is really nothing much you can do in that real time hassle besides sit back and watch. If you have stronger fleet, you win. As for visual aspects, combat looks okay but the arena is large, so your camera needs to be set far apart to can see everything. Thus, the ships will be tiny and visual treat (also audio) is not good. Battles are the salt of MOO and failure in that area is considerable. Also, designing ships is tedious process, one that used to be fun. Full screen modal makes it hard to compare selections total effect (pops up for choosing each slot), design view ui-elements waste screen estate and going through the whole process requires lots of clicks. Weapons and specials don't show proper damage stats but instead some abstract power number which makes different weapons generic. ""Beam B makes 25% more damage than beam A, yay"". Another miss there. And what about ground combat? Lets just say MOO1 had more thrilling ground combat. Next I'd consider music and sfx which are forgettable and quite lame. The only good track is the combat victory music, which should be in the place of actual battle music theme (theme is from MOO1). If you are doing a remake then at least copy the good parts. 

Spying system is improved from previous installment (comparing to MOO2 since third one is turd) and now you have ""hero"" like spies with experience stats. Only problem is that they cost too much to maintain and you can't have many of them. But you can do more with them, like assassinate leaders and halt research (""hack""), albeit slowly. Game only supports maximum of seven leaders (colony AND ship) which is not enough. I had six ship leaders and only one colony leader. Makes no sense. Leaders themselves are, yet again, generic, having only two different bonus powers and their icons are boring. MOO2 leaders had more ""personality"".

Clearly some corners have been cut to finish the game. Galaxy council with voting system is no more - if you are powerful enough after 500 turns, you win the game. And they even didn't bother to make ending cut scene and the game just jumps back to main menu after accepting the victory from the glorious modal popup window. The intro at the beginning is the only cut scene you'll get. Not even defeating Orion's Guardian gives you anything special. There is a voice over when you free planet held hostage by space pirates but that's all the extra you get. Lack of polish is apparent in technical level too: save games start taking 250MB per slot, GPU runs 100% even when nothing happens on main screen,...

Not everything is bad though. With all of its flaws, game is fine for one play trough but next time I'd rather pick MOO2 (or even the original) again if I need my dose of Orion.

I am enjoying it immensely, and can recommend it if you are a lover of the classic pieces wanting to see how they might have been were they done in present days. It does *not* innovate a lot, but I don't think it should: it keeps to the spirit of the originals.

Master of Orion and its sequel Master of Orion 2: Battle at Antares were genre-defining titles. They stablished many things we now take for granted, and have a huge weight in many gamers' nostalgic memories — including myself: I have played steadily MOO2 (and, to a lesser degree, MOO1 and even Star Lords) for over two decades. MOO3 was something of a disappointment (although I liked the starlanes and the politics / diplomacy route it took).

Like me, many people have strong feelings for the series, and living up for those expectations is an impossible task. What do you do? Recreate faithfully the past or innovate and take risks exploring towards the future? The latter might turn out well, but it wouldn't be the MOO we grew up with. This is what happened, to a degree, with MOO3, and one of the reasons why it had a poor reception.

I think the developers here took the right choice. They have recreated a blend of MOO and MOO2 with a few newer elements (the aforementioned starlanes, for example) which have been tested in other games and even the third installment and work well and don't disturbe the basics. 

About 99% of the game you will see is a present-day recreation of the original spirit, down to the cheesy Galactic News Network take on events. The original MOO games wer never *too* hard-line science-fiction. They had an adequate rooting on the tropes of the genre and incorporated pulp fiction elements as necessary, and that works well as part of the mix. In this rendition the races are more humanoid than in other variants (silicoid used to be less like stone golems, for example), which is a bit of a turn down but at the same time allows them to have recognizable expressions like becoming happy or sad when they win a vote in the galactic council or diplomacy screens.

As said, the original content is there, and then some. We have the basic races, we have the space monsters, the antarans and the Orion guardian. We have the galactic council and the micromanagement of planets. We have the classic technology trees with phasors and structural analyzers and battle pods and titan construction. We have diplomatic treaties with peace and non agression pacts and war and trade options which actually work, and research investments expensive but which turn out well. We have new, interesting non-spacefaring civilizations with which you can interact too. 

I genuinely feel happy for this version of MOO. It basically brings back to life mostly the better parts of very dear pieces from my gaming past.

If I have a criticism, it is perhaps that the interface could be better designed. Not only by modern standards, but by the original games' too. For example, the «planets» screen in MOO2 allowed you to browse known empty planets and send colony ships to them directly from that screen, whereas I can't find a way to do that in this new interace. Likewise, navigating fleets can sometimes be confusing — it was never easy, mind you, because it is frequent that you will have to tend to lots of different fronts at the same time, but I feel it could be improved somehow. Perhaps allowing to create  fixed fleets with assigned names or symbols to locate them easily?

It is also... not too fast. Both hardware-wise (the graphics are cool and I understand that takes up CPU and GPU cycles, but I feel this is a bit unoptimized) and gamepace-wise. In this latter aspect I think MOO2 or MOO played a bit faster, with «empty» turns being skipped more easily, enemy actions happening quicker, and getting you to the meat of the action and decision-making faster. I have found that playing this MOO version is not something for a quick break: you'll play for a few hours at a time. This is fine with me, but I think it should be noted. The turn-based nature already means you can control pace, so having the game add a degree of slowness to it can turn off some people.

The ship design screen could also be improved. I liked the way it worked in MOO2 — the main screen was focused on which weapons you loaded, which systems, the statistics of them all, and this allowed to create truly specific designs. I used to create ships based around the gyro destabilizer, for example, to damage the structural integrity of opponents, or ships solely for bombing or boarding. Often I had very specific fleets with one-of-a-kind ships in them for very specific purposes, like defeating the Orion Guardian or boarding and adding to my fleet ships from other races. I haven't been able to do this yet with this version of MOO, and it is a bit of a disappointment, but I am still exploring the larger aspects of the game before I delve too deep into that kind of micromanagement.

I could go on, but this is long enough as it is. Just let me stress it again: I can understand why people find it slow-paced for nowadays standards, and I can see why some people find it not original. I don't think it is trying to be imaginative either. It is what it is: a faithful as possible recreation of the original titles with a few actualisations and variations. For that, it works quite well, and I'm really glad to have it.

Having put in over 300 hours I think I can provide my honest opinion on the game.  I have been a fan since I played the first Master of Orion back in the dos days, and can say I'm fairly happy with the direction this game took.

First, the cons:

I know this is a personal preference kind of thing, but I dislike the starlanes.  It does change the strategic nature of empire building, by allowing you to create a secure place with defensible choke points, but a major part of the MOO1 and 2 (We don't talk about 3....) was having to take into consideration the fact that any colony could be attacked, and to have to juggle fleet positioning accordingly.  I know it's kind of a nitpick, but it does play a role when I'm trying to decide if I want to play this or Galactic Civilizations.

Camera controls during combat.  They're a bit difficult to get into the right position and zoom rapidly.  While you have full freedom to pause combat, it's primarily real time and fighting with the camera to see what you need can be frustrating.

Turn based combat. I know this was kind of an afterthought put in after fan response, and it feels like it.  It's really nothing more than the game auto-pausing ever few seconds.  An option to have it instead pause whenever one of your ships had an action ready, or just when a weapon was ready to fire, I think, would have made it feel at least a little more turn-based and control-able.

Ship design.  While the visual design of the ships are creative, and each race having a design aesthetic is also cool, having more options in the visual department would have been nice, or at the very least, providing mod support for new ship visual designs I feel would have improved things considerably.  Also, limiting ship slots for smaller ships seems unnecessary, as there is already a limitation with the space available, it feels like an unneeded constraint.  This one however can be addressed by mods, so it's not a huge complaint.

Racial characteristics.  Some of the racial bonuses and weaknesses felt like they didn't effect gameplay as much as they should have.  For the most part, it felt like you could basically follow the same formula to build your empire no matter which race you played, while in 1 and 2, you really had to focus on your strengths, because your weaknesses would cripple you otherwise.

Now the Pros:

Visual design.  This looks like a proper upgrade from Master of Orion 1 and 2.  While I felt there could be more ship designs available, those that are there look great, and tie in nicely with the philosophy of the races they represent.

Empire management I feel is a step forward.  I feel it's a good balance between the simplified abstraction of MOO1 and the sometimes overwhelming micromanagement of MOO2.  You still have to construct buildings for specific purposes, like in 2, but the autobuild AI is greatly improved, so you don't necessarily have to focus on what each planet is doing.  I found, especially in late game, just setting a plan and turning on autobuild was more than sufficient to keep a large empire manageable, allowing me to focus on building fleets.

Voice acting.  The cast is great, and give some fun life to the races and advisors, you definitely feel the personality of each race more than ever.

Mod support.  This is probably the biggest pro in my book, and supporting modders and allowing them into most aspects of the game is what keeps me coming back to this one more than MOO1 or 2.  There are mods that address nearly every part of the game, allowing you to tailor it more into what you want.   My only gripe here is the lack of support for a very few aspects of the game: starlanes, which I can understand as that may be an essential part of the code that might break the game if changed, and ship visuals, which I mentioned before I feel mod support would have greatly improved the game by allowing more visual options.


All said, I can say I was not disappointed with Master of Orion.  It did a fairly good job of taking the best parts of the previous games and crafting an enjoyable experience that really did feel like a Master of Orion sequel.  Admittedly, it doesn't break any new ground, and some gameplay choices do have me dividing my time between it and Galactic Civilizations 3 for my space conquest fix, but it does feel like the sequel Master of Orion 3 should have been, and hopefully now that they've got the franchise back in production, maybe we'll see some new stuff if they go forward with a sequel.

Overall, if you're a fan of the series, I recommend giving this reboot a try.

The game itself is a really streamlined masterpiece, however it also means its a really simplified version of the genre.

As 4x goes, MOO is simple, although it does hit all the basics. Economic control with planet buildings, Espionage with spies, basic exploration and combat expectations. You have some modular freedom with ship design, however it remains restricted enough that you can't really get that creative with it. It works, but it has its faults - graphics hits me allot with how the animation of the ships are all basically copy-paste for the models and the weapons just emit from the center of it making it almost all look the same.

Where it falls short in my opinion is where you'd expect more complexities, it really is simplified down. The AI support is helpful to the point where you almost run on autopilot short of ship designs - and those can almost be ignored thanks to the larger numbers game. Ship design itself is limited to being modular, while it said it as a good point, it only makes it so far as a good idea for newer players - you have very limited options on the ship design and weapon loadouts thanks to limitations with its real time combat style. You have some freedom with weapon arcs, but the mixture of AI function with real-time speed on combat you loose out on some turn-based control you could have had. It does make the fights look nice however.

The largest drawback in my opinion is in the race customization. It feels extremely limited, and unless I missed it somewhere, you can't save the custom race creations.

In general, the streamlined nature and relatively simple feel lends itself to be a good version of 4x, however veterans of the genre will be left wanting more somewhere in it.",1564690482,1564690666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The diplomacy is probably OK although predictable.

Overall the game plays very much like a MoO game but is far more accessible and the pacing of the game is probably better than most other 4x games.

Original Early Access Review
---------------------------

In its current form the game is a bit frustrating to play, there a numerous UI elements that dont appear, for example on the ship design screen. The AI will immediately try to kill you so it doesn't look like diplomacy is an option. Auto upgrades are really stupid and will break your ship designs, for example removing all your pd and replacing it with missiles.

That said I can see it becoming a great game, once its out of alpha. its aesthetically nice and reminds me of star trek. Some reviews are excessively negative, I think it generally retains the things I liked in MoO2, except I dont think the combat system is that good when compared to MoO2/SotS. Its basically auto combat where the stronger side will win but that seems to be the case in most space 4x games these days.",1463873232,1564097457,True,0,0,0.45766836404800415,0,True,False,True

Gameplay wise, I enjoy the unique and varied races with their different traits which, despite having the same structures and ship classes, make their race standout. The ship designs are cool and the ship builder is cool, allowing you to make your own loadouts for each ship. Unfortunately, unlike Galactic Civilizations 3, you can't design ships piece by piece to make some unique designs. You just have 2 base models and a few themes (paint patterns). Also, you only have 8 blueprint slots once you unlock the doom star. you unlock a new slot each time you unlock a new ship, however this leaves you with only enough room for 2 unique blueprints to design from scratch. HOWEVER I grew to not mind this as much because this does force you to give each ship a ROLL, besides just varying amounts of damage dealing. There is more then enough tech in the game to equip each ship type with different builds. I've go a battleship that focuses on energy damage and also releases repair drones to help my fleet stay in the fight longer, You could also make a ship an evasive cloaked craft with a short range teleport to escape from harm during emergencies. You can do alot, but you have to pick and choose. I would like the OPTION to change the number of blueprints a player is allowed as custom rules, but I don't hate this limitation as much as I thought I would. It allows you to make a fleet that feels distinct, instead of just having anything and everything available at any given time, making your fleets ""identity"" become faded.

The map is very ""customizable"" during a match. When you unlock terraforming it allows you to turn low quality planets into valuable, hospitable planets. One of the end-game weapons allows you to blow up planets and turn them into asteroids, which then can be transformed into a large or huge barren planet! this could be great for getting rid of small planets with extremely hostile conditions like toxic and radiated! Just make a new planet, that'll solve it! (haven't tried it yet.) 
One minor complaint though is how there is a player limit of 9. I'd like a map just big enough to include one of every race so you can experience dealing with ALL of them. Not a deal breaker, and more then 9 could make this game a chaotic and crowded.

Diplomacy is cool, forming alliances with other races, signing treaties which grant mutual benefits, getting tech early, etc. Also spies and espionage is cool. You can steal starcharts, slow their research progress, and more! Allies are surprisingly valuable in this game. The fact that you can't unlock ALL the tech in the game by research alone,  makes it so you are seeking out other races to acquire the tech that you didn't pick during research.  

Compared to what I've seen of other 4X strategy games, this is probably the most user-friendly and accesable I've seen. Others were obnoxiously complicated and felt like the dragged on during gameplay. 

Combat features include real time combat which can be sped up or slowed down, however it feels a tad inconsistant. start of a battle may be paused, so you take the time to issue orders individually (because ordering a cluster sends the movement lines freak out sime times.) and they move where you tell them to, but sometimes they go somewhere else. Also, the ""hold position button"" doesn't seem to work while time is paused. The response time and more may need to be addressed.

Overall, this was a fun game and I enjoy listening to the cast react when you are in diplomatic talks with at least one, the tech variety is great, though the option of more blueprints would be nice. 

I do recommend this game, it has a great sound track, cool ships, customizable map, and an awesome cast!",1562486091,1562486091,True,2,1,0.522315800189971924,0,True,False,False

PROS: This game is a great trip into the land of nostalgia for those of us who have played the originals! Much more like Master of Orion 2 than M.O.O. 3, containing the familiar races and traditional MOO gameplay, but obviously with updated graphics and a few tweaked game mechanics. The cinematic style battles are fairly nice to watch and command too, if you aren't the type to just auto-resolve every encounter. The game didn't feel as dry and clunky as M.O.O. 3, and all victory styles are plausible.

CONS: No new ground broken here, just a rehash of MOO2 with a new skin and cinematics, with some updated mechanics. The game's auto-update feature for ship technology is basically useless, and provides some fairly wasteful and unstrategic ship builds in my opinion. I also find Normal difficulty to be too easy, and hard to be bit too difficult, but that's probably just me. Some of the achievements are super hard, but then again, I claimed to enjoy the game, not be that I was any good at it. ;)

Diplomacy and trade is pretty much broken with the AI.  You end up having to build your economy strong enough to be able to afford to give the AI enough BC to sign trade agreements with you.

Even with the questionable choice of switching to real time combat, and the diplomacy let down, it's still worth playing if you really liked the classic or never played it and would like to try this modernized proxy.

This is not necessarily a flaw however. It comes down to what kind of experience you want personally from your strategy game as a player. Master of Orion reminds me heavily of Civilization. You build colony ships like settler units and colonize parts of the map, you manage your population in your planets (cities) to produce either production, food or science. You produce science every turn to advance technology in a vast tech tree. You can upgrade your ships and units constantly, and make your own designs. Although the cosmetic portion of the ship designer is quite limited. You seek to unite the galaxy either by conquest or diplomacy. This all is very familiar stuff, but it has it's fans.

What the game design of Master of Orion lacks in originality, it gains in quirky personality. There is something undeniably cute in every race. This is due to cartoonish visuals and design with decent voice acting to boot. Every race has their unique personality and character. The races are familiar from the classic Master of Orion games, so the fans of the originals will find their home here.

So far I have not encountered many bugs. Due to simplistic presentation, the performance is excellent too. Unlike the processor power gulping Civilization games, in Master of Orion the turns are processed quite fast in the largest maps up to the late game, in both single and multiplayer games. Multiplayer works superbly well too. The game is at it's best at 5 am with your friend anyway. Rather than the usual ""one more turn"" -formula, Master of Orion has become more like ""one more war"" for me and my friends.

So, if you're looking for a simplistic, yet charming 4X space opera strategy game with superb multiplayer capabilities and great performance, look no further. Orion is waiting for your colony ship.",1561805431,1561805463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can select the weapons etc for your ships but this is largely a waste of time due to attack rating, which is a totally meaningless

You can go into battle with the highest attack rating & similar defence rating & get slaughtered. while you do have control of your ships in battle you have to either turn AI assist off and micromanage every action or deal with a suicidal AI that puts all your ships in short range combat.

Attempting to cater to the old school gaming community doesn't work, it never works, it never WILL work. because of this, the comments are of a much lower quality than the game itself

This is a remastered Master of Orion, and it's FANTASTIC. There is a lot of love put into this game, and one of the few games not plagued by bugs.

Like the original franchise, you have all the original races, except they have beautiful 3D models whose reactions change based on your actions. Just a couple examples - I was playing Terran as a warmongering star empire, whenever I engaged in relations with the other races they had a look of hopelessness about them, you could really feel what they were thinking. ""Are we next in line for destruction?"" - I ran a peaceful diplomatic human empire, and the ai were eager to speak to me in interest of mutual technology or alliance. They are very realistic responses. It remains faithful to the turn-based 4x spirit, and it feels very clean and polished. To top it all off, we have famous voice actors like Alan Tudyk (Firefly, Knight's Tale, Zootopia), John Delancy (Q, Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: DS9, etc.) and Mark Hamill (Star Citizen, Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope [1977], Etc.) voicing the characters, and if you thought that was badass, MICHAEL DORN (Worf, Star Trek: TNG / Star Trek: DS9) narrarates what is happening as the events unfold, he also reads off the races' biographies to you.

This is more than just a callback to the first master of orion games, this is a callback to the golden age of sci-fi. The love, dedication, and effort put into this game is obvious, and I for one choose to be excited and embrace the fact that here are game developers working hard to give us that same feeling of awe and wonder we felt the first time we saw Picard as captain of the Enterprise, or Luke Skywalker as he traveled to Dagobah to learn the mysteriums of the force, rather than complaining like a spoiled child because daddy didn't get him THAT toy.

If you don't like it, fine, but complaining that it's not your perfect game is not a valid review, sorry kiddo. Unfortunately, like very much of today's society, most reviewers just want to bitch about the surface of the game - none of them consider the difficulties that comes with coding a game, the tedious hours spent fixing a bug whose cause you have zero insight on, and the difficulties in working around the busy schedules of famous actors.

In fact, 90% of steam reviews come from people who have never coded before or worked a day in their life - games despite actual quality are subject to even the slightest inconvenience if a freshman in high school would much rather complain about a black-screen (which only they seem to have) instead of figuring out how to fix their own system.

Overall, this is a beautiful labor of love - the quality, polish and dedication is obvious. Despite the competition from Stellaris and Civilization, as well as the bloated expectations of ye olde MOO players - this is a blue diamond that shines brightly even in the darkest regions of abyssal caverns.

Feel free to get angry at me kiddos, this won't affect how I feel for this great game.",1559926830,1559927533,True,119,4,0.739036679267883301,6,True,False,False

First Glance nothing special, and to be honest it sort of wants to charge for extras that you should get already.  But play past those and see what you get and the good things really shine.

1- Continued support means this version I have had zero crashes.  So some of the early issues seems to be worked out. 600 turns for one game no issues.

2- This is the best thing that I can say for the game,  EASY TO MOD.  Something you don't like, fix it.  So simple.  The only reason you will not like the game is you can't be pleased no matter what,  Or you want something for nothing.

So the real issue now is value  to you personally,  What is it worth to you.  And how long can you wait.

I played the original, I played 2, I played 3, this is a good mix of the concept of the original game and the very very few good things about 2.  I know I am going to get a lot of hate for that.
MoO was a great game in it's time, great game play up to the mid part of a game, after that you either lost or you were so far ahead of the AI factions it was a cakewalk.
MoO2 was all about micromanage and tried to correct the massive stacks of ships in mid/late game of the original- it failed IMO, it became a borefest and made for long drawn out games that should have ended/restarted long before
MoO3 tried to stay with the original concept while trying to reinvent the wheel with combat, the only fail part was the combat was to constrained.
now we come to this remake of the game, it's been abandoned and there are a lot of mods out there for it trying to make it like each persons favorite version of the game series. MODS are nice when they enhance game play or add a few new things to a game. When you use mods to make one game look and play like another just go play the other game.
This version of MoO is a good game, it has some slowdown issues with late game between turns as it processes a lot of information, it could have been optimized in that area better, but people are jaded and used to MMO style games that run on what amounts to supercomputers and distributed servers, there is no noticeable time lag for their computation and they also employ people to keep that system working and optimized, you don't get that on a single player game especially when the game was basically 90% finished then abandoned.
this game has a lot going for it, but those who are rabid fanboi's of MoO2 will always scream and yell unless it is a remake with modern GFX of that. Ignore those reviews that compare it to or call it a poor remake of 2.

Master of Orion is enjoyable in the early game, fantastic even. I really enjoy the warp point system, the AI seems less random, and the UI is pretty intuitive. I also appreciate that it's a lighter and more accessible 4X game.

Later on things get sluggish, and the AI seems to kinda slow down and stop expanding at a certain point. I typically play small maps because huge ones really bog down. Mega battles are prone to freezing. I don't personally love the switch to RTS combat but that may just be me.

I seriously haven't seen lag between turns this bad since I was running Civ 1 on a 286 with greyscale EGA graphics. How do they even manage that shit? It's not like the logic behind the game or AI is particularly advanced. MOO2 seems like it had more going on in that department than this new MOO.

If you must have some MOO, I'd suggest going back to MOO2. If any decent modern 4x in space will do, Stellaris is probably a better option, if more expensive after all the DLCs.

Oh yeah, this is the real third game. It has a lot in common with the second game, so if you liked moo2, this will look familiar.

What's different?

UI is streamlined, you don't have to micromanage so much any more.

There are lines connecting systems and you can build guard stations to defend choke points. You can thus wall yourself off.

The ship-to-ship combat is real time with pause. Yes, I miss the second game's turn-based approach, it was good times. This is different, but it's tricky different, not dumbed-down different. A lot of abilities and ship design work together to allow the player to create interesting units - like broad side battleships that focus on strafing enemies, smaller craft perhaps that can kite the enemy and teleport behind them, and then run away with backward-facing guns pummeling the whole time. 

You can ignore all that and just focus on building the bigger fleet with more guns and auto-resolve fights with brute force approach, but there's depth and nuance if you care to explore it.

Also, the spy system here is really interesting, and far more involved than in moo2. You can trade captured spies for ransom. The stealth suit tech is OP, even if your species aren't the Darloks.

Also I should compare this to Stellaris. Stellaris is a more modern game, it has quest text and events and a ton of stars and planets and ships: there's a lot going on and there is a lot of real estate for it to go on. This is a smaller scale game, where there's less stuff to conquer, but also every ship matters, because you have a lot fewer of them. Likewise, fewer enemies, and thus diplomacy is more intimate and thus more dangerous. Stellaris doesn't allow you to micromanage a ship battle, it's just a game of numbers and a big ol' retreat button. Here, the fights can be won on a technicality of a better ship design and clever positioning.

Late game doesn't suffer from micromanagement nightmare thanks to the new shiny UI, but it can get stale once you realize you're winning but still go through the motions of conquering everything. There are no world-shattering events the way Stellaris throws them at you.

In Stellaris, warfare has rules, meant to prevent wholesale slaughter and early steamroll positive feedback effect. Wars get forcibly shut down if they drag on too long (your people are tired, have a forced truce). No such hand-holding in this game. You can try diplomacy but your mileage may vary.

as a long time hard core 4x turn based strat gamer fan all I can say
from the bottom of my heart wargamer is thank you, thank you, thank you. 

its perfect (for early access).
truly a worthy successor of MOOII. 
from what I have seen so far its like the producers plucked 
my dreams from my head and made it reality. I have always wished 
that what to me was the most perfect 4x game ever created-MOOII- 
was brought up to date graphicaly and fleshed out for todays computers. 
looks like you guys did it. in spades.

you captured what to me made MOO 1 and 2 special, the perfect intersection of easy to access and engage UI and the deep balanced tech tree with rich diplomacy and espionage combined with nice and easy but deep ship design,for the perfect just one more turn addicting effect. THEN you added beautifull rich graphics and race specific intros, great voice work, everything i can imagine the original programers wished they wanted to do but could not because of tech limits. Then you stoped meddeling ""briliant because then you avoided loosing the magic alchemy of MOO and MOO2 and instead would have become the disapointing MOO3.  perfect.  

Its christmas times 1000.

great job!!! now the only problem remaining is how i justify
taking the next week off work lol.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ok seriously if you were a fan of the original legend MOO and MOOII
just get this game. I wont say anymore other than bring a lot of tissue paper
to mop up all the tears of joy you will be crying.

again to the producers of the game.
thank you from the bottom of my heart
thanks for showing the gameing world
its not all about DLC and micro transactions.
I can feel the love that was put into the game.
for me it makes all the difference. Bravo job well done guys.

Main problem of ""Master of Orion"" is... its name. ""Master of Orion"" has a huge community of so-called oldschool gamers, and this game got caught into inevitable trap... developers tried to mimic successful previous parts so fans claimed that game is boring and brings nothing new. Still, if developers tried to actually create something new, same fans would claim that game does not continues traditions and so it is bad. Well, I still remember ""Master of Orion 3"", where developers tried to invent something different... and I still remember how it ended.

So. ""Master of Orion"" tries to be similar to old classic games. Almost all gaming mechanics are copied from ""Master of Orion 2"", and developers did it quite carefully. You may play as one of pre-generated races or create your own specie with its own strengths and weaknesses. You will colonise and develop planets, design ships, contact with other space powers and - almost inevitably - fight with them. In my opinion, ""Master of Orion"" is designed as a game about war. Maps are fairly small and borders are tight so neighbours are quickly turn into rivals. There is a diplomatic way to victory, but diplomacy is very simple and not too effective, so eliminating all opposition seems much easier for me.

And there comes main issue that prevented me from finishing this game. Wars are very easy, when you created a good fleet able to defeat neighbours - you won. Final part of game turns into tedious and boring process of cleaning map from rival factions and they just can not stop you. Even on high difficulty. While first part of game seems interesting and early wars may be even challenging, final part of game is... just boring. 

For example, in late game you do not need to wory abot economic, just set all new planets on optimal path and forget about them. You do not need to worry about fleet battles either, just launch auto-combat and forget. You may try to command your ships manually but results will be same anyway. And ground combat is just auto-calculation anyway, just bring some dropships with troops to the orbit of enemy planet and... that is it. Thanks to ""classic gameplay"", for more or less experienced player game quickly becomes very predictable. So... I dropped it.

I do not want to say that ""Master of Orion"" is a bad game. It is a good game, developers did a very good job. Unfortunately, it just can not compete with other representatives of genre, such as ""Galactic Civilizations"", ""Space Empires"" or ""Distant Worlds"".

I may recommend you to purchase ""Master of Orion"" if you are not very experienced with 4X strategic genre. This game can be an excellent introduction into genre, it offers classic gameplay, provides good introduction into basic conceptions of 4X and looks quite pretty. For your first 4X strategic game - ""Master of Orion"" is an excellent choice. By other side, if you are familiar with genre, ""Master of Orion"" is not the best choice as it is fairly simple; so, I guess, experienced player will find this game not very entertaining.

Finally, I must bring some compliments to visual part of game. ""Master of Orion"" looks great, it is a beautiful game, especially when it comes to diplomatic screen - every faction is animated and voiced, it looks really good. Still... visuals are not the most important part of any strategic game.",1552406161,1552407008,True,41,0,0.775309562683105469,6,True,False,False

Star lanes are here to stay, and they make the game more positional/allow chokepoints, which people seem to love or hate. They also have specific star lanes that can only be crossed after research. Combat is real time again. The extreme accuracy drop off of beam weapons makes it a bit screwy and takes some getting used to. On the other hand, that means missiles and torpedoes are actually a thing.

Graphics look nice, ships are in 3d and look way better than MOO3, Races are better animated and feel just a little more alive. Custom races are still a thing. Preset races get more in terms of trait points than you can get with custom, but custom is still better, of course. And, as always, they aren't exactly balanced. Think of them as a difficulty adjustment. The Galactic News robots that periodically comment on the state of things are either fun or annoying, depending on your personality, and they can be disabled. Pirates and pirate bases are a thing, but you quickly become so much more powerful, they might as well not exist.

One more thing, the Antarians/Orions/whatever they are are back, and meaner than ever. They are intentionally scaled to be more powerful than all your ships combined and attack the most powerful player periodically. They destroy a planet and then leave, but usually keep attacking the same planet. Just think of it as you're going to sacrifice that planet into being forever near barren unless you have the foresight to disable the gimmick.

To be fair, the remake has couple of interesting ideas/changes like limited number of slots for economy of planets (can't suddenly switch a scientific site into a industrial planet) or introduction of jump points/routes with fortifications.

Sure, some features are poorly implemented, there isn't any tactical combat in multiplayer, nobody ever really plays multiplayer at all, and the stock races are severely unbalanced (looking at you Meklars), but that doesn't really matter.

The 5X mod and UCP fix most of the game's flaws (fixing the bugs and balancing the game, as well as giving it more depth than ever before), and I personally don't care about the lack of multiplayer options. For me, it's about the single-player experience. The graphics are great, the real-time combat is an interesting twist on the systems of past titles, and it's so good to see that people still care about this series.

The whole game seems terribly stock and generic. There's nothing remarkable or standing out about the mechanics, tech tree or the visual design. Some months after playing the new MOO I can't remember much about it, except the fact that using production points was resulting in increased pollution. 

It seems like the devs really wanted to play it safe and not take any risks by making something new or out of the ordinary. The end result is a game that can be best described as a very nonspecific, hazy, shapeless ball of something. Really big shame - it was a chance to reboot this old, classic series.

Multiplayer: Yes, online
Completion: 8 hrs
Cards: Yes
Cloud: Yes

Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars is a turn-based 4x space strategy game that is essentially a 3D remake of the classic Master of Orion II (1996). As a fan of MoOII, I have some bias here, and many comparisons will be made. While MoO:CTS offers some improvements to the series, it also comes with questionable design decisions. 

Gameplay is your usual randomly generated galaxy map where you issue commands to expand your empire and research technologies. What differentiates MoO from most strategy titles is that combat is handled in a separate tactical screen, allowing greater control of how battles play out. Combat is this game is in real time, and in many cases, is handled on autopilot. While I appreciate that is resolved quickly, it's unfortunate that it's far less engaging and simplified. Ground combat is a severe downgrade as well, and there's no ship boarding at all. While MoOII offered a myriad of options to win a battle, here it's greatly stripped down.

Somewhat unusual is the implementation of star lanes. Ships may only travel between star systems using these star lanes without special tech, and thus it becomes possible to create choke points and see when enemy fleets approach several turns in advance. I don't hate the star lanes, but I also think the game would have been better off without them.

Race creation makes a return, and as with all games that allow it, I spent hours playing with it. Most picks are the same as MoOII, but there are noteworthy changes, mostly for the sake of balance. There's a few bizarre picks though, most notable being the biome options which despite costing points, may actually be harmful to pick.

The game offers several win conditions, which allows for varied gameplay styles... sort of. Typically, rushing through opponents seems to be the best way to win, but I found it more fun to go for other victory types such as defeating the Antarans. The ending cinematics could stand to be more grand though. Every time I beat the game it just felt like ""meh.""

For the most part the graphics and aesthetics are great. I love the ships, the planets, cinematic combat, and... some of the races. The user interface felt like a downgrade though, going for a rather simplistic scheme. I feel like there's a lot of wasted assets. For example, all advisor tips are voiced and unique to each race, but I can't imagine wanting to hear everything multiple times when they could have just gone with one. GNN also has a lot of animations, but I shut that off fairly early. The music is all right - not quite as melodic or immserive as MoOII, but never grating. Does any one else feel that the title music sounds oddly similar to Galactic Civilization II's title theme? 

Performance is an issue with this game, and for me the biggest thing holding it back. Anything larger than a medium galaxy takes ages. If I had a computer that could calculate turns in mere seconds, I'd probably be playing this game a bunch more. The game is generally bugless as far as I can tell, which is good.

Overall I rate Master of Orion a B. I had fun with it, enough to replay quite a few times. But at the same time, I occasionally felt I would rather be playing MoOII. The game supports Steam Workshop, and there are some excellent mods that add some of what is missing in the core game.",1547548324,1547548324,True,12,0,0.623862385749816895,0,True,False,False

With UCP, 5x, fewer nebulas, and some slight tweaks of my own to the travel speeds mid to late game, it's actually a pretty decent 4x. I am now tentatively recommending this game with heavy reservations.[/b]

I was an avid fan of the MOO series years back so I was excited to see this one, however I waited a long time to pick it up because of the very mixed reviews and other comments I'd seen for it. Generally speaking it's got really high production values but I just can't recommend this one. I'm reviewing this having played with the final patch and UCP as well as a game with the 5x mod.

Good:
[list]
[*]High production values and polish
[*]Good Diplomancy system with lots of options
[*]Information is clearly indicated
[*]Expionage system is really nice
[*]A lot of options to finetune gameplay
[*]Auto turn feature so you don't incessantly click next turn
[*]Good modding support
[/list]
Meh.
[list]
[*]Default game speeds are excruciatingly slow
[*]Ship design was rather bland. 
[*]Tactical combat was pretty bland
[*]Tactical combat mechanics are poorly explained
[*]No capability to modify and present counter offers in diplomacy.
[*]Ground combat mechanics aren't indicated.
[/list]
Bad
[list]
[*]Very poor turn performance late game. 
[*]Galaxy wide travel way too slow late game. With jumpgates, over 10 turns to get across my empire.
[*]Stupid slow menu animation that can't be skipped. 
[*]Base game feels thin on content. Not a lot of variety in planets, not a lot of variety in combat.
[*]Awkward way to combine fleets
[*]Can't determine fleet placement prior to combat start.
[*]Tactical map celestial phenonomena like nebulas are entirely random in placement, not inicated prior to combat, and can completely unbalance combat.
[/list]

I almost forgave the misteps because of the mods for this game, but I can't recommend this for two reasons. First of all, despite having options to tweak the speed of production, research, and pop growth and having 5x to fill out the game content, you can't get around the abysmal turn performance later in the game. It makes you sit around and waste play time waiting for the game to finish processing and just saps the fun. 

[i]The second reason I can't recommend the game is that even if you run a smaller game to improve the turn processing speed, travel time just kills things. It's not fun to wait 40 turns as reinforcements are built or do nothing for 10 turns while you're ships traverse a jump gate. The net result is you wait most of the game to fight a battle that takes five minutes and requires another 50 turns to rebuild. Maybe if jumpgates or another late game tech allowed for wormhole like travel it would be fine, but as is it just doesn't give you an incentive to continue.[/i] (this section is no longer valid as it can be fixed via mods.)",1546037569,1546386964,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Master of Orion II was a more serious game, where alien races and dialogue showed more the realpolitik that you would expect from space civilizations. Additionally, the pollution mechanic continues to be a frustrating and delaying mechanic. In prior versions, there was a way to basically over-produce your planet and accidentally stagnate yourself. This has been moderated, but the game just makes pollution brutal still.

Exploration is no longer macro-level but now micro-level and the over-complication of space structures one can build (while not properly explaining why I can or cannot build the structure) leaves exploration boring, and leaving you with an overall feeling that you cannot exploit your exploration. In fact, it feels like in an attempt to modernize Master of Orion, it has lost its 4X nature (Explore, Exploit, Expand, Exterminate). Explore feels overly complicated ""to add content"" when it doesn't, and exploitation feels very limited. Expansion is penalized visciously, and extermination is something the AI constantly chooses.

Diplomacy, Military, Economics, all are inferior to predecessor games and equivalent games such as Endless Space or Stellaris.

And only with that.

Still, one of the centerpieces of MOO2 was the turn based tactical battle, and this one 
has a shitty real time repalcement that Sins of a Solar Empire has done better.

I remember an interview with on of the Devs, who was trying to excuse that with ""it would be too much work and we have to set priorities"".
I wonder where those was set, considering the abysmal state the game came out.

Well, an Indie Dev has managed a almost 1:1 setup of the old MOO2 battlesystem in a modern skirt.
Few things are more satisfying than to tinker together your ship-build, lead it into a battle and rip apart an enemy precisly with the weapons and tactics you build your vessels for.
Stars in Shadows is able to do this.
Maybe because they didn't wasted so much money for actors like Mark Hamill vor their fucking voiceacting (which is good, but often so repetitive and pungent that you turn it off anyway).

This game looks pretty, it is an mediocre 4x game (modded), but i won't recommend a wasted chance to revive the best space 4X game of all times caused by the ignorance of the developers and/or publishers.

And this is only one aspect.
Hyperlines, freigthers, a bollocks research system (this is fixed by mods), etc, etc.
They didn't wanted to make a modern MOO, they used the MOO licence and name too melk the francise with a half-butt made Spacegame.

The strategical play afforded in Masters of Orion 2 (the 1990s title) has been limited by the base race traits which are skewed in implementation in this version.  For example: 
   1. Electing -25% population growth results in a significantly larger penalty, the calculation for population growth is skewed.
   2. Electing -25% food production results in a signficantly larger penalty, the calculation for population growth is skewed.
   3. Electing positive growth does not extend the full benefit either.
And those are just a few of the racial traits which are ignored or skewed by the game.  

The game does not count torpedos in the offensive capability of the ships, excessively values missiles, and electing a negative firing solution results in missed targets most of the time.  Upgrading your ships with new computers and the battle scanner does not overcome the racial negative until very late in the game.  

The game is heavily balanced towards the first 60% of the research tree, and last 40% of the research tree is achieved so rapidly by comparison that something like a Doomstar is a pointless build unless you choose to drag the game out just for that.  Your active front line ships will always be 2 versions behind the new models, because technology gains for the last 40% of the tech chart are too fast.  

I'm annoyed that they changed the Telepathic (conquer planets with mind control) from the original cruiser to a battleship, and then made it difficult to get a battleship until late in the mid-game.  The only good reason to be telepathic is to avoid making a nearly endless supply of troop transports.  

Also.. The game extends itself to static fleets with a one shot battle finale, ie. you lose 1 battle and you lose the game because it is impossible to replace the fleet if its lost. If you play with the advanced settings it is possible to push the engine to very fast production, which still isn't enough of a push to make disposable fleets although you can lose one if you have a couple of ship building planets and not immediately lose the game on extreme. The game should be better balanced, the 1990s version MOO II was.

And finally, the game is buggy, the new updates to windows 10 cause some of the wording to fail to load the correct windows fonts.  It would be nice if they issued a patch for this.  

I only play extreme, win often, and find the game fun.. with a few exceptions noted above.  If there is one feature I would like to have fixed, perhaps more than any other it would be the telepathic cruiser and the initial starting configuration for the first frigate (theirs is the worst design ever... can't bomb a pirate base without a bomb).",1546295924,1546296488,True,8,1,0.601294100284576416,0,True,False,False

Because of the fixed and predictable tech tree each game tends to unfolds the same way.
Your opponets don't have any unique and destinctive tech, they have what you have, or will have or use to have. Hardly makes it woth spying on them.

Combat is dull:
You start over here, they start over there and you charge one another. As there is very little input from the player you end up being a spectator in your own game. yay
You don't decide what to shoot or who to shoot at, the AI does that for you. 
You select a squad and the AI makes the fire decisions, usually badly.
eg A cruiser shooting at a group of frigates, it will shoot up one, take a bit off it shields then switch targets to an undamaged frigate. Nothing ever gets killed, meanwhile the frigates eventually wear you down. You will find yourself muttering ""Just pick one and KILL IT"" 
eg Battleship with multiple weapon batteries vs frigates. Each battery can easily vaporise a single frigate but the AI will shoot ALL batteries at one frigate vapourizing it multiple times over while the other frigates keep comming. (That when it isnt shooting up asteroids) (and I thought these gunners were supose to be professional.

Missiles no longer have ammo restaints so become just another damage X weapon.

Weapons are dull:
In Moo2 you had shield piercing weapons, armour piercing weapons, weapons which did extra crew damage and other which did extra structural damage. Different capabilities made things interesting. Thats mostly all gone
Every weapon tend to be like every other weapon, just different damage levels 
Laser Dmg 5, Rng 50
Neutron Blaster Dmg 9, Rng 50
Gravaton Cannons Dmg 25, Rng 50
same special effect, same ranges, dull

Ground combat:
Not even sure if its implemented. You can have Neutronium armour, barrier shields and plasma guns and the cave men with spears and animal skins will kill you dead. 
Invading planets is such a pain 4 men at a time.

Multiplayer
All comkbat is simulated, you  dont even get a chance to watch.
You have no idea of your opponents ship designs or weapon choices, say goodbye to intelligent ship design


Planetary governors are idiots. 
You tell them to focus on research. Yep they will do that to such an extent everyone will starve to death. When a planet maxes out population they wont scale back food production. The excess just gets dumped, Its not like you can even send it to other worlds to help them grow as every polanet is essentially independant. Your not an empire, you just a bunch of independant worlds sharing the same flag.
Even moving people between planets is such a pain as it now requires you to build one man non-reusable ship to move a single person.

Planetary growth 
Planetary growth depends on food production and not on population.
Does this mean that your people are canabels? How else to you explain why population growth depends on surpluss food.

Fleet overview: 
You will have ships and you will have no idea what there armed with as the only time it lets you inspect your ships is when you're in combat. 
The Fleet Screen is somewhat useless. Need to find out where your lost ship is, you have to go through every ship one at a time, they use unique symbols which don't mean a lot and even when you find your ship you don't know what there armed with. 
You can't even find out what the ship your currently building is armed with.

Diplomacy:
Remember when you could always rely on the Psilons accepting research treaties or Gnomorions  accepting trade treaties, not any more. Each race now has the same diplomatic personality and that personality is 'jerk' 
The AI offers you 62 credits for your star maps and gets progressivly hostile if you refuse them.
You offer them 1000 credits for their maps and they feel insulted.
Trade and research treaties now require cash and lots of it but since all the AI's tend to be broke you can never entice one into a treaty. 
Your ally will progressivly become less happy with you each time you refuse to accept a tech exchange with them.
Ally: Give us Stellar Converters we will give you Atmospheric Renewers.
You: No thanks we already have Core Waste Dumps and don't need your backward tech.
Ally: Your a meanie, -1 to approval rating. 
Ally: Give us Stellar Converters we will give you Atmospheric Renewers.
You: No thanks we already have Core Waste Dumps and don't need your backward tech.
Ally: Your a meanie, -1 to approval rating. 
You: Shut up and go away I will give you Core Waste Dumps if you give me your #$%^ Atmospherics Renewers.
Ally: Don't insult us with your pathetic trade offers.
You: Argh, please let me demonstrate the fully functional Stellar Converter on your homeworld.

Exploration:
There are worlds out there with different biomes, desert, volcanic, swamp, toxic, radioactive, etc
So what, you can settle them all, you don't need any special tech to cope with hostile conditions
they just give you less food. 

Espionage; 
I actually think the new espionage system is quite good.
You can choose different types of missions you wish to undertake.
The only downside if so can the AI. One moment your world is happy, next moment their rioting in the streets and have left the empire. No warning, no build up, pow it just is.

Game play:
I start on my own little subsector with one AI opponent and dont get to interact with the rest of the universe untill I develop a special tech which lets me travel unstable starlanes .
It's awefully contrived. 
What about starlanes that can only accomodate small ships, that way I can explore and meet new races but my ability to wage war on them is limited untill some future tech advance.
Or what about giving me the option to have unstable starelanes at all.
The AI has no clue how strategically valuable  the Multyistate Insulator or Jump gates are and often get left behind to die slowly.

Empire screen
When your sort the not so compact spreadsheet it would be nice if it remembered your sort and actually moved your scroll bar to the top of the new list.
As for sorting via production I have no idea what there actually sorting, its not alphbetical, its not production time remaining, its not buyout cost, its not planet name, I have no idea but just trying to findout when the next battle ship is due to roll off the production line and save you in your hour of need takes Sherlock Holmes to work out.

Planet screen:
Need to be able to set a Range limit when seaching for new planets to colonize. ie sort by Biomes all planets within 10 turns of travel.
It would also be nice to know that a prospective planet is actually reachable or if another faction already has claims to the solar system by colonizing another planet in that system.

Fuel:
There is none. Another piece of strategic play taken from me.

Crew XP:
Doesnt exist. It may be on its way but not yet.

Reverse engineering capture ships:
Not implemented 
Hell, you can't even capture ships anymore.

Finding tech on captured worlds 
Not implemented 

Research:
When picking between technologies it would be nice to be able to review the tech tree to see when a similar tech is available in the future.

Production
When I finish building something it would be nice to know what I was building before asking me what new item I want to build, especially when terraforming. 

Upgrades:
It would be nice to know what the AI has in mind before I select upgrade.

Bases:
It would be nice to be allowed to design your own bases.
Do I get to play this game or just observe?

Upgrading Ships is too easy, you can do it literally anywhere, build a listening post and you can magically reconfigure your ships instantly just prior to a battle with no down time. Customisen your ship at the last momement.
Why plan when you can instantly turn a defeat into victory?

It just feels so dumbed down as so many options and choices have been taken away from me.

I sincerly hope the developers reflect on what there doing.

HOWEVER, the Development Teams Leaders have made a gross Error. Just go online and see, no one is playing. The reason, simple, very very simple. Since 2016 people have been begging to be able to play with their friends and have a nice healthy tacticcal space battle. a huge part of the fun is tweaking our ships and if we cannot see how they perform, how will we make them better or improve. SO, once again, is anyone playing online, no. Will they, no.

The worst thing about never listening to anyone, sooner or later they'll not care.

Make the multiplayer Tactical combat available. you can set limits ie 30 seconds per turn or 60,90 wtv. But most of us play which voip connected. so, make it happen. I would still invest in this game but not now. Rather go back to MOO II

Its a nice game, I recommend if on sale, but while the replayability is there, not multiplayer, very frustrating for no reason.

- Unabalanced, your success depends highly on starting planets and how lucky you get

After having some time to play around with the mechanics and try to enjoy the game... I can't. It's just not a very good game, and not a competitive 4X experience. It is not a bad game - but there are far better at the same or lesser price. Get Stellaris if you want a very intense long-form strategic experience, or Endless Space if you want a great modern version of a classic 4X. Even go and get the old Master of Orion 2 before trying this one.

The Good: The game has good basic mechanics, excellent aesthetics, and a lot of heart and character.

The Bad: Much of the game is spent tediously waiting for things to complete. Battles look good but have numerous weird bugs and quirks, and are largely non-interactive. Colonization rapidly becomes an agonizing slog of micromanagement - a serious issue because your biggest advantage is making numerous small optimizations. The AI is more annoying to deal with.

Yeah, I don't know why they did that, but the game is still fun. It's still MOO at heart. Simplified? Sure, but so was MOO2 from the original.

A little wish. The planets are stationary in their orbits. I think they're pretty, but would look so much better if they actually moved a bit turn to turn. Oh well, fun game anyway.

Pros:
--Choke points on systems.
--Modern graphics.
--Better Diplomacy.
--More like MOO2 the good one, not like MOO3.
--Updated colony management screen. I like how the more workers you put in the less effective each one is.
--New ship design screen that is easier to use.

Cons:
--Real Time Combat.  I thought I was playing a Turn Based Game!  I feel like it is more of a cinema.  Also I miss not being able to board or capture ships.
--Large maps, even the small one is a very long game.  I wish they had a tiny or duel size.

The good:
- Turn-Based civ management, allowing micromanagement, but not requiring it.
- Custom race creation
- Interesting spy system
- Military outposts blocking space lanes (if you prepare, those not at war with you can't colonize your claimed region)
- Ship design
- Worf

The bad:
- Not turn-based combat
- Slow ships, even with jump gates and highest drive tech. It takes so long to get anywhere, if the Antarrans attack, better hope you had a fleet in the area.
- Painfully slow turns in late game. When I click next turn, I stand up and go walk around. I have a nice computer, though it's a couple of years old. Far beyond recommended specs.
- No victory movie. You just get a crummy text popup. Even MOO2 had a fun victory movie.

The ugly:
- 64 GB save file. This was the easiest uninstall I've ever done.",1542856429,1542856429,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It is already a good game.  With the addition of harder AI, spies, and custom races (and the 4 missing ones), this game will be 10/10.

Update 4/25
They made the AI harder, added spies, and added custom races.  They also improved random events and improved the news reports.  It really is a good game at this point.  They are rapidly improving it.  This should be a buy for any fan of 4x.

Update 7/4
The latest update inproved the AI further but they removed food and science production from startup colonies so they mostly start in a starving state.  This slows down the game tremendously and will need to be reversed.

Update 8/13 EA7
I do not understand why they made some very poor decisions on changes.  Planets now grow very slowly and the AI (on normal difficulty) has 20 planets and a 2000 point fleet when I have 10 planets and a 58 point fleet.  You read that right, 58 to 2000 on normal difficulty.  I have over 130 hours played now and over 1000 hours in moo2.  I am not a neophite.  The game has taken a major step backward in fun.   I'm hoping they reverse course and are still balancing the game.

Update 8/31 Retail release
Well they fixed the colony growth problems, rebalanced the AI so it is a fair fight, added several animations and an intro and a ton of other fixes.  It isn't perfect yet but it is a good game and a definite buy at this point if you want a 4x.  They have promised to add independent colonies and other upgrades for free.  Antarians will probably be a DLC.

Update 11/21/18

I was very skeptical at first, especially seeing all the negative reviews. 171 hours of game time later, here is my review.
Up front: This is a review for the [b] Linux version [/b].
I bought the game on sale with all the DLC. The concept of splitting the original content into DLCs...well, let's say I would not have bought the game full price AND payed for the DLC. But I did not have to, so moving on.
[b] Performance [/b]: I'm playing on a 2.6GHz, 8GB RAM, HDD machine with an old intel graphics card since the NVIDIA burned out. This game runs rather smooth most of the time, just large fleet action seems to bring the system to it's limits. 
[b] Look&Feel [/b]: This game does feel like Master of Orion. I'll get to space battle later, but story, looks etc. work very well.
[b] Game Elements [/b]: The game is more diverse than MOO2 and adding workshop content really blows this to the extreme. They added a lot of cool stuff that makes the game more fun, like Space Pirates wit ships and bases or anomalies which hide treasure.
[b] Space Battle [/b]: I don't really get the nostalgia for moving ships from left to right. The new system is cool. Really, it is.
You now have asteroids, floating banks of nebula and they have an impact the battle. You can hide behind asteroids!
Also things like maneuverability suddenly have a huge impact. A small, out-gunned ship might outmaneuver a larger vessel by keeping behind it and things like that. From a tactical viewpoint this game offers way more than the old games. 
Though, this works best with small numbers of ships. Large-scale battles I usually auto-solve or use the cinematic mode. It's just not fun.
However, I remember how boring moving 25 ships in MOO2 was, so no improvement for me, but also not worse. 
[b] Sounds and Music [/b]: I'm a sucker for a good soundtrack and this game does not disappoint. 
Music is swell and the voice actors for the Leaders and assistants are great.
All in all the Galaxies feel way more special and individual in this game than in MOO2 (especially with the right workshop content) and at least for me I found workshop conent to change everything I did not like. 
[b] Bugs [/b]? Sure, there are some. Like the strange thing where you have to scroll the spy list just right to be allowed to click a spy. Annoying, but no game breaker. 
[b] Replay value [/b]: The different people groups (Humans, Alkari etc. I'm German, I don't use the r-word) are very different and I've played almost all by now and found you need a completely different approach to the game depending on who you play. Which is what I want.
171 hours in and I have unlocked 38% of all achievements. There still is a lot to explore in this game and I am still finding new, better ways to do things.

better graphics
good englisch voice acting

plays itself in terms of complexity alot like MoO 2 for people who dont know what MoO 2 is its not complex at all

it got released too early i guess becouse the marketing worried about stellaris what the game earned by that is most likely harsh critisim the dislikes got up and the sales did go down
the game did not get an update in like a year most people call it abonden since fair words please a conversation at least the game crashing bugs got fixed

bugs:
the game doesnt crash anymore after turn 250 (or 200 dont remeber what it was) all i did encounter in my playtime were minor bugs like win chance -1 i guess its supposed to say something above awesome and the secound bug i saw was when i hit export normaly 1 colonie feeds a other colony in its system there workforce and this gets visualy improved by an animation of ships flying over to the other colony but when i put export in a building row the building get finished export happens but is visualy not triggered

the real time combat you see on yt is only in the singleplayer and wont be implemented 

if you want this game try to get it for less then the full price since its not worth the full price if the development is halfway stopped its only fair you pay half the price ;)

there is alot of dlc for an unfinished bugged game they should make them free at least then i maybe consider changing my downvote

People seem to fault the game for being both too similar to too dissimilar from Master of Orion II, as a veteran of that game and 4X games in general I feel qualifed to speak at length about its strengths and weaknesses.

PRESENTATION
Master of Orion knocks it out of the park here. The in game animations, the models of the different races, the short CGI movies, voice acting, the pleasant empire interface, menus, — all of it — is extremely well polished. I had no glitches, crashes, slow downs, it was a beautiful seemless experience. The real-time battles look terrific, with laser beams and missiles hurtling towards other ships. It's on a 2D plane which while less strategic is a lot simpler to navigate. This is the prettiest 4X Space Game I have ever played.

GAMEPLAY
This is where some crticism is going to show up. Master of Orion is very similar to civilization here. You have 3 main resources - Production (hammers), Food, and Science. Gold/Money/Credits are also present. Functional this behaves very similar to Master of Orion 2 and Civilization. Each population unit can be moved to focus on either of the 3 resources, and each population unit generates income passively. It's a little too simplistic and is LESS interesting in many ways than MoO2.

DIFFERENCES MOO2 and Master of Orion
1. Growth is determined by how much food y ou are producing. In MoO2 growth was fixed once you fed enough people and extra food was either sold/exported.
2. No importing/exporting of food. Well, you can do this later but in MoO2 you could build Freighters to ship your extra food. This let some planets specialize into bread baskets and letting barren but mineral rich planets focus on indutry - but this no long works here. 
3. Without a Freighter system moving population units around is a bit more cumbersome as you have to build Civil Transports which are single use ships, similar to colony ships.
4. No more Colony Bases, only Colony Ships
5. In game Combat is real time BUT you can pause and fast forward. This IS a better system regardless of what many detractors think. Functionally an RTS where you can pause slow things down is very similar to a turn base game (think Baldur's Gate). It makes more for a more cinematic fight as well. 
6. More routes to victory - outside of Conquest, Diplomatic, & Antarans, there is now Economic, Science, and Score (after a set time).
7. More granular customization of game speed. You can adjust research, growth, and production speeds. I highly recommend slowing down research speed on bigger galaxies or you'll never have time to do much else.
8. Pollution instead of being a penalty to production, now will start hampering food growth and eventually deterraforming your planet. It is a lot harder to combat now even requiring your planet to simply stop producing for a time
9. Spying is both better and worse. You now build individual spies than level up independently and are sent on specific missions, each taking time. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much point. Stealing tech is always nice but because you research 'baskets' of individual techs, you still need to research a broad category even if you've stolen some of the individual techs in that basket, so it doesn't save you beakers. You can still sabotage buildings, or cause revolts, but these tend to fail, and being unable to target key things like Star Bases/Missile Bases makes it fairly pointless.
10. Diplomacy is as uncomplicated as it was in MoO2 - except the AI frequently doesn't have enough money to even enter a trade agreement. Exchange Technology is worthwhile however.
11. Autobuild still exists and it's... just as terrible. The Auto-build governor loves building pollution lowering buildings - even when you have no pollution! It's infuriating this can either be better controlled or customized.
12. There's now a 'worker' unit that improves the star system you are in, but other than building some sensors and improving some asteroids it's kind of a throw away.
13. System and Ship Leaders/Captains make a return, but they are far worse than in MoO2. Their effects are just very mild for their cost.
14. Star Lanes now exist. Highly controversial these do limit player freedom but do enable you to create choke points.
15. All the original races are here including the new ""Terran"" race (not Human).
16. Government is gone. No reason to leave this out as it was one of the key ways races were different. As it stands there isn't enough distinguishing the individual races. Really key attributes like Repulsive, Creative, and Subterranean have been neutered to be less impactful than they were.
17. Antarans still attack but are much weaker. Before they would zip in and obliterate any colony they attacked. Now while still difficult to beat in ship-to-ship combat, they hardly damage a planet once they reach, then promptly leave. 
18. Combat mechanics are exactly the same, including nebulous terms like ""+50 to Beam attack"" (+50% to hit? +50 Damage? +50 Accuracy?)

Overall this is better than what Master of Orion could have been (see MoO3!). There have been some improvements but some poor choices and things that could have been improved that weren't. With better Macro control, more differentiated races, better food management options, it would be just about perfect. It's still good, but the developer has stopped patching the game, and we'll have to accept it as is.",1537119166,1537119166,True,17,0,0.655796468257904053,0,True,False,False

I loved Moo3 as the best strategy game of all time.  Massive depth, maps, battles, tech... and modable.  No other tsrategy game has ever come close.  Turn based game with real time combat.

Master of Orion is pretty good.  I've run games on colossal & huge maps into 600+ turns.  Tech devleopment is interetsing & deep, plus real diplomacy, spies, ship customization.  It isn't as in depth as Moo3 (which many will actually like that it is not that way) yet has a lot of depth and replayability.  More in depth and yet fluid than most space strategy games. And modable.

Enjoying it.

If you did not played MOO2 it is a good chance that you will like this game a lot. Unfortunately I played it and have bunch of things that I miss. Most of all Antarans, dreaded ancient race, are a complete joke. Their fleets will cause such minor damage to your colonies that it's not worth mentioning. Even worse your fleets will have no problems dispatching their raid parties. Second issue is the AI. Again, complete joke on any difficulty level. I only played vanilla game so probably some mods can help with this. Also upgrading ships (entire fleet) for credits in single turn is pure blasphemy! That really kills fun for me. Diplomacy? Really, who needs diplomacy when you have all those wonderfull Battleships? Spying? Again, you can completely ignore it and still win game on hardest difficulty.

On the good side I really liked Space factories and their abilities to build useful space objects. Game pace is much better than MOO2. Now a fleet of destroyers with nuclear missiles can wage a war! This means you can have real action after 10 mins of playing! Well done! Animations are wonderful. There is many heroes that will join your faction but their abilities are sometimes not that helpful. Battles are easy to fight and interesting. Some of the MOO2 spirit is still present in them. 

Overall game is OK. It has solid fun factor. Main gameplay problem is that after you crush first oposing race you already know you will win this game because you have enough resources to push all others. I tried to start war with all other races at once and won. That really should not be possible even on normal difficulty. Also, Game went too far with simplification of all actions. Sometimes it went OK but in the end it caused to be a bit boring.

It's basically streamlined version of MOO2 with better production values.

I have to criticise the developer for forcing a starlane galaxy map in a turn based space 4x based on MOO.  I'd be more forgiving if it was not MOO or if it were an RTS (albeit still disappointed) because the idea of a naturally occuring transit system in the galaxy that is the ONLY way to get around is stupid.  It makes it feel like your exploring a weird space dungeon, complete with corridors and doors, instead of a the frickin galaxy. Also war now becomes all about bottlenecks. Very disappointing.

I don't hate the real time combat, but would have preffered the turn-based one from previous titles.

It's a difficult situation, and I do sympathise a little with the developers as they were walkng a tight rope from the beginning and it is very much a case of 'damned if you do, damned if you don't'.  Without doubt it is well polished with high production values and despite my previous criticism is a pretty solid game.
Nevertheless, it is regretabble that I find it impossible to recommend it to anyone because if you've never played MOO/MOO2, then i'd advise you to play them instead, and if you have you probably won't be very interested in this remake, so there isn't really anyone left after that to recommend it to.

- Diplomacy is shit. Options the opponent has with you cannot be initialised back.
- Planetary UI gets slow beyond turn 60 / 70. A restart of the game fixes this for almost 3 turns.
- Game gets serously slow beyond point 170. Hitting ""end turn"" gives you the Win10 flickering cursor wheel. When lucky it will resolve itself. If unlucky, your game gets terminated instantly.

[list]
[*]The graphics are gorgeous and a shining example of what a 4x game should look like.
[*]I keep playing it (over 330 hours so far), so ""just one more turn"" has become a thing with it.
[*]The UI is an absolute treat to use. Other 4x devs take note, this is how it's done. No diving into sub-pages and menus to find what you want. Everything is a click and one screen away and clearly presented.
[*]Enough options to set up gameplay to your liking.
[*]The ship designer is fun to play with, though not particularly necesssary.
[*]Crushing your enemy and hearing the lamentations of their... wait, they're all dead.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]As of March 2017 the devs went quiet and there have been no official patches since then so read the reviews carefully before purchasing.
[*]The AI isn't terribly challenging at normal level.
[*]Tactical combat isn't all that interesting, then again, I just use the auto battle result the vast majority of the time unless the odds are against me.
[*]There's been a lack of bug fixes for the really blindingly obvious bugs in the vanilla version, but they've been fixed with the 5x mod.
[*]I suspect large numbers of the development team have been abducted by the Antarans and gone missing.
[*]Graphically, too many races have spacehips that look like flying bricks when more sleek, sexy SR71 type ships are needed as well as completely bizarre looking ones.
[*]The tech tree is linear and the same for all races, bar some options not being available. I'd much prefer differing research trees and also having the meta game of being able to allocate research between shield tech, missile tech, beam tech, ecology etc.
[*]Lack of a ship battle simulator so you can test various designs.
[*]It was released from early access 6 months too soon, though the DLC and 5x mod has matured the game nicely.
[*]This is not a game for in-depth micromanagers.

[b]Meh[/b]

[*]The sound is average. It's not bad but it's not Mass Effect either.
[*]Mid game is slow with lots of pressing of the end turn button.
[*]The manual. It covers the basics but doesn't really explain the mechanics behind some of the game systems.

If you're a fan of micromanaging massive empires with extreme depth and games that last many days, then look elswhere. This game is a 4/10 in terms of complexity compared to others in the genre. But if you like being able to jump into a game with an easy learning curve and knocking a game out over a couples of days, then take a look at MOO:CTS.

- As is not so complex like Stellaris, during mid/late game there is no much things to do.
- All starships (Frigate to Titan) looks all same size, only during the battle you see them in real scale.

It's a shame steam doesn't allow neutral reviews, as i like the game, unfortunately wargaming seem to have cut a few corners when making it. So overall the review has to be negative, despit the game being good.

Unfortunately i have multiple graphics cards in my machine and the game seems unable to identify one from the other so no longer works. This is a wargiaming issue not simply restricted to Master of Orion. My world of Tanks now also no longer works. It's been about two months since i reported the issue and they've now stopped sending me mails to clarify the situation. The last message was over a month ago saying they need more time.

Whilst it's probably not the best 4X game out there, it has a simplicity and I am a fan having owned and played all the previous incarnations. It suffers from the normal extended turns towards the end of the game.. All in it's not overly complicated and is cool.

Just don't bother buying it if you have multiple parallel graphics cards and monitors. As it wont load.
Personally i'm torn as to if i should get my money back or if i should stick with it... I think wargaming is more mobile focused.

I've played the original MoO I and II, and even dabbled in the rather disappointing MoO III. Of these, MoO II still reigns supreme, but after a bunch of updates and balance patches, the Master of Orion reboot (i.e. the game I'm reviewing right now) is nearly identical to MoO II in terms of gameplay, with two exceptions:

Ships battles are real-time (vs. the old turn-based battles), but pausable. Very little difference in reality, and not a solid reason to rate this game much worse than the original MoO II.

Balancing in the latest version of this game actually tends to be /better/ than the old MoO II. There's still plenty of cheese tactics possible, but less so.

I personally think the main reason for the negative reviews here is that current 4X games (e.g. Stellaris, Endless Space, Endless Legend) are vastly more complex than the original MoO games. While I understand that this is desirable to some, maybe even most hardcore players, I was hoping for something between ""casual"" and ""mind-bogglingly complex"". The MoO reboot hits that sweet spot.

The closest analog of modern games I can think of is Endless Space (part 1, I mean). Comparably simple planet management, comparably simple battle decisions, some complexity in how you design/fit your ships -- and that's it.

Exactly what I was hoping for, so for me at least, the game is an unconditional recommendation (if you're not into the deep complexity of games like Stellaris of Endless Space II).",1530894287,1530894287,True,3,0,0.522149264812469482,0,True,False,False

the adding of mods here is pretty good, adds more fun to the game but, its way too buggy, sometimes mods don't fucking work, its really irritating, I tried a lot of times trying for them to load, but 80% of it is to no avail

>UI
the UI of this game is good n all, but sometimes when you start a new game, all the races are gone, LIKE LITERALLY GONE, you can't select any race except the random race, and this can also happen IN game, its really irritating as well

thats all, this game seriously need some work, and this game is in full release? I don't think so, its more like back to early access, if the game is still early access, sure its understandable, but its a full game, why would the developers not fix this issue during alpha test or something...

The problem with this game is basically that everything it even attempts to be good at is done better by other things. For spaceship customization, you have...okay this one isn't even attempting to compete there, the ship design part of the game doesn't seem to have any depth at all. For touchy feely stuff like aesthetics, which definitely seems like it's what they were trying to make the selling point, it's just...an inferior offering. The aesthetics of the ships and the planets and all of the art bits you can find are just blown out of the water by Endless Space 2, there's just no competition at all.

The tactical combat is not worth bothering with at all. I don't understand how it's possible to make a bad RTS interface nearly ten years after Brood War was released, but they did it.

The Bad: 
[olist]
[*] You took old school races and put them behind an additional paywall to your already obnoxiously overpriced game.    
[*] Hyperlanes, lazy designers/programmers solution to robust A.I.
[*] Ship design was drastically paired back, there was so many things that could have been improved upon.  Just lazy design
[*] Ship Combat, again lazy.  If you'd simply followed Moo2s design you would have had a much better ship to ship system..  Instead you basically lifted StarDrive2s combat..  but without the robust ship design capability.
[*] Planet management tools....  get some.. even in Moo2 you could select more than one colonist at a time..   painful.
[*] I can't mix up the ship sets or colors..  I can't play a Klackon race with Human ship set and Alkari color.. Boo!!!!
[*] Hyperlanes..  because they just need to die.
[/olist]
The Good:
[olist]
[*] Diplomacy, it was one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game.  Nothing really special here, about what I'd expect of a 4x
[*] Planet View, exploration.  It looks good, the start systems feel good and are pleasing to the eye..  but the scale is a bit off, and star system counts are abysmal.  you could have done better here.
[*] Espionage system was probably the best one I've seen in a Moo Game..  I don't consider Moo3 a real Moo game.. Quicksilver made something and slapped Moo on it..  
[*] Voice acting, it was nice to hear all those actors I am so familiar with.  It gave credibility where none of the rest of game carried it..

This game at full price is an insult, go buy StarDrive2..  It's buggy and the developer abandond it for a real job, but its' just straight up better than this.

(SIDENOTE: From what I can tell, most of the negative reviews here on steam are either related to old problems now patched, or are people complaining that combat in this game isn't turn-based, but real-time. While I can understand that complaint to a degree, since the OG MoO games are turn-based in their combat systems and if you prefer that, you prefer that, the actual combat system present in the new MoO (remake? reboot?) is actually completely decent on its own, if a bit no frills. Moreover, it's real-time ***with pause*** (as well as speed options when un-paused) much like a lot of classic CRPGs, which is . . . . well, it's almost turn based in a lot of ways. You just have to set your own turns. I get it, as I like TBS tactics games too, but it's really a personal taste thing in my opinion, not a mark against this game's battle system.)

Anyway, that out of the way, this is a great Space-based 4X. The gameplay is very much Master of Orion in terms of its roots and does things in several slightly different ways compared to others in the genre out there. You have starlanes instead of a big open grid or hexagon tile map for example, which makes map movement and traversal much more restrictive, but more strategic (as you now have natural chokepoints to defend, or that you have to take). You have (now better balanced) pollution systems that limit development on planets you colonize to make settlement management a little more interesting. You have the invading Antarans, who act as raiders that are everyone's enemies and are a constant threat, but which make pure peace runs a lot harder. 

It does things just a bit differently enough from most in the genre that it's definitely carved out a nice unique place in the the space 4X genre. It's all fairly simple to understand, but there's also enough depth to the systems that they remain fairly interesting over the course of a game.

The main thing that makes this game easy to recommend is its presentation. This is probably the highest fidelity 4X game on the market at the moment, with incredibly well animated and polished visuals (especially the leader screens, which are somewhere between Civilzation 5 and 6 in quality) and great voice over work by a pretty amazing cast of recognizable sci-fi actors from a bunch of shows and movies including Star Wars, Star Trek and Firefly. The music is really grand and well executed as well, and I'm a big fan of the cheeky news reporter robots that are used to notify the player of major events in the galaxy.

All of this combines into a package that might not be what you're looking for if you're a big fan of the space 4X genre and already have your favorites in it, but which makes it a very approachable game for people who might not have ever played a game in the genre before. Every individual system in the game I think has been done better or with more depth by another game out there, but all of them present in this reboot of MoO are done well enough and are simple enough to grasp that I think they'd be great starting points to build off of for new players (GalCiv 3 for example, has a far more robust, but also far more obtuse ship builder). 

There are still some flaws though. The ""tutorial"" is an absolute piece of trash. You're better off just starting a game at a normal difficulty or easier. As a result, there are several features that are not very well explained to the player (like that you can use CTRL + left click to move multiple workers around on a planet's production menu), but for the most part things are intuitive enough (and there are enough tooltips) that you can figure out how to use them. The Trilarians (the fish guys) are also a bit underwhelming compared to other races - they should probably get the ability to build warp gates early and in neutral territory or something. The diplomacy system works but it's pretty basic and has little depth (and the whole ability for other leaders to ignore you for long periods without any way of even knowing how long you're on a time-out with them for is just a bad idea). There's not nearly enough event variety with anomalies and pirate base destruction (which makes pirates fairly farmable for free population). If you use an alternate hulll design for custom ship, it shows the base hull as an icon . . . but these are getting into nitpick territory.

Overall, this is a really, really solid space 4X that's easy enough to pick up and play (even with the crap tutorial) and it with enough meat on its bones that you can get One-More-Turnitis pretty quickly, and should be great for newbies. I'd recommend getting the extra races DLC though, as they add a lot more variety.",1530210113,1530210113,True,39,0,0.798910856246948242,0,True,False,False

Many of which made me not want to buy this game.  Since it was on sale and it came with MoO2, i figured 10 bucks for MoO2 is worth it if nothing else.

This game is pretty good.  Its not perfect but it is a good successor to MoO2.   I feel like most of the hate comes from the non-turned based combat.  Though i would really like to see something like that, what they did was still neat.  My bet is that most of the people don't understand how the combat and weapon directions/range works.  They did it a few times and gave up in disgust.   The rest of the game is a sort of combined copy of the better parts of Endless Space, Civ 4, Stelaris, and maybe others i haven't played.  Which in turn probably copied alot of their stuff from MoO2 to begin with.  I don't really care much about graphics, as i am excited to play MoO2 still, but these are Really good.

LIked:
[list]
[*]  The tech tree was solid, though as always i'd like so see a bit more options
[*]  Combat is fairly fun
[*]  The races are great, ship design top notch
[*]  The base game and mechanics are taken straight from MoO2
[*]  Graphics
[/list]

Want changed:
[list]
[*]  Would still like a turn based combat option, but unless they stack all like ships like in MoO2 it would be tedious.
[*]  A few more options in tech and the revival of the Megabolt Cannon.
[*]  More ship designs so i can tell ships apart of same size but different design.
[*]  The extra Perks on planets quite literally make no impact.
[*]  Can't board and take over ships to steal tech and get cash, sad panda.
[*]  No sorting options while making ships.
[*]  Biggest complaint is the star lanes.  I like the idea, just not how it was implemented.
[/list]

Starlanes are a good addition to the game imo.  They make choke points you can defend and build battle bases at.  The bad part of them is they stop normal flow of movement.  Each time you enter a star system, you have to stop.  Then you have to fly to the edge of the star system and stop, then you can move on.  FYI the whole map is COVERED in star systems.  Unless there is something there preventing movement like a battle base, there is no reason that it should impede the normal travel speed of a ship.  Want to travel to somewhere around 7 turns away with 3 planets in between?  13 turns. 
 If anything is gonna make me hate this game, its that.  

Though i would like to see the game continued to be worked on, its still a great game well worth the sale price.

However, it gets bogged down in micro-management. You need to explicitly build specific buildings on your planets, and that just becomes a hassle when you have many. You got to click like 50 times for trivial stuff that doesn't matter. 

Each ship you want to build, you need to click 4 times. There is no ""keep building ship X and relocate to Y"". And then zoom and scroll, and slow-populating menus.

The time a round takes really goes up by the number of turns too.

I have done several playthroughs and honestly if you aren't careful, you can get your tail kicked on harder difficulties.  It does feel like the story treats 3 as though it never happened, which is not so bad honestly.  It feels like a newer verision of the 2nd one, which frankly was my favorite.

This game lets you modify ships to suit your play style, you can even customize existing races.  My only complaint is when you customize you seem to have fewer points to purchase abilities with, but honestly it is more fun sometimes to play at a disadvantage.  So this part evens out for me.  It is turn based and the diplomacy system is worth learning how to utilize.  I have saved my empire more than a few times, but you will get boned if you have tons of tech they don't have and you want an alliance.  

There is one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.  We even have some well known actors of sci fi shows that we all love, and they do the voices for the characters, this only adds to the greatness of this game.  I highly recommend it.  It has a very good steam workshop community with some very interesting mods.  It would probably be even more fun if you had people you enjoyed playing with who were turn based enthusiasts.  As a fan of the Master of Orion trilogy, someone who has frequently said, ""I wish to God they would make another one of these,"" I am not disappointed in the least.  

Now to the stuff that I didn't like:  
1.  I loved that certain technological devices could give you a decisive victory over overwhelming odds if you knew how to use them right in MoO two.  The fleet battles in this game are mostly you overpowering the other fleet, most of the strategy comes in the form of how you build your ship and picking the right weapon to overpower the enemy.  In the old MoO2 game, the blackhole generator w/ a time distortion type device along w/ phase cloaking could help you stave off attacks with a subtantially smaller force while being invaded from exponentially larger forces if your gameplay style was not warlike.  It was more satisfying to play like that sometimes.  Just overpowering your enemies in this game is fun but I feel like it limits game play.  In 2 you could even utilize onboard marines to board enemy ships for tech and victory.  This is just ""pew pew pew I hope you die before I do"".  An expansion could improve this but most games like this don't do expansions.  
 2.  If you want to play certain alien empires like the Trilarians, Gnolams or Elerians, you will have to pay for them.  I bought them, I really do like them, they make nice additions to the gameplay, but it seemed somewhat random to pick these 3.  The trilarians are not particularly special perse, but the other 2 are pretty powerful although require a specific gameplay style to make use of their abilities.  Also if you want the Terrans (alternate human empire), you get them in the collector's edition.  This isn't a complaint, just noting it.  There are 4 races you will have to pay extra for.  I didn't mind overly much, but it was weird.  I felt like if I was going to have to pay for a race, they should have at least gave us the Ithkul from MoO3 and the Nommo, even the Gas Giant inhabiting races as well.  These were strange races and altered gameplay style a bit.  Those were my favorite of the entire franchise and I don't forsee an official release for these.  :(

I somehow missed this release, and just bought it.  (March 2018)  I play any Space strategy sim.  Love Stellaris, and Endless space, Planetbase, etc.  They all have their shining strengths.  I was a bit put off by the reviews on this, but I have to say after giving it  15 hours, it is charming, simpler take on the 4X space genre.  I really like the COmbat system, and of course customizing the ships to experiment with tactical roles in battle.  The quality of the voice acting makes me actually want to keep the volume on, (WIth the exception of the robot news anchors, but it's obviouos why they did that, it is so they can have audio descriptions of a WIDE variety of possible news stories, they can mix and match copy that way.)
It is not as grand as Stellaris, It is not as Elegant as Endless space 2, but it is fun.
It feels more like I'm playing a board game than any other 4x but I find that a refreshing take.
If you like space genre, and 4X in particular it's definitely worth the purchase, and the cost of the DLC.  Plenty of well reviewed mods, too, that I installed right off also, to fine tune the gameplay experience.
Quite happy with this game.

I'll leave my initial review at the end, but I just finished a game.
I had decided to try the current gen of 4x games again after awhile, in my my mind the top contenders are this, Stars in Shadow, Galciv 3, and Stellaris.  Some of the things I liked of this, were because they contrasted Stellaris.

In short, I liked the diplomacy (the races felt concrete and acted rationally) and that you could strategize and defend planets.  I still don't like that they went with an RTS combat design.... except for one move (my Advanced Transports were fighting and getting killed stupidly) I watched the AI lead my fleets and didn't think I could do better.  I felt the same way about ship design, the AI could do a better job than me.  These are things I miss from Moo2 -- still the oldest game I am able to install and play.  I did appreciate the elegance of the design, they kept it elegantly simple -- and that the production values were so good -- the best for a 4x game.  Sure, there were minor gripes still -- no end custscene or score page, no big reward really for being the MoO.... but I enjoyed the game and I may play it again.  The designers did fix some of my initial gripes with quality of life patches (for awhile, apparently), including not being able to rename planets and not having leaders (though you can't rename leaders, annoying).  And Elerians and Moo2 races....

Anyway, it wasn't awesome.... but if I have to pick between postive and negative it NOW gets a positive.  There isn't any perfect 4x game out that I've seen.  Steam workshop is a nice touch.  I reckon the series is dead again, but I wish they'd keep it going -- with a turn based combat model next time.  

(2016 review below)

Not liking it. 
I bought it at full price, rare for me, but Moo2 is one of my favorite games of all time.  
Way back when I sold Moo2 as soon as Moo3 came out -- clearly a mistake in hindsight.
I was more cautious with this one, but somewhat hopeful.  I played a game up until someone got to Orion, I'm uninstalling for now.  I may try it again later 'cause I'm stupidly hopeful.  

Dealbreakers for me: 

1) Real-time combat.  They gave some lame explanation of you cant do fun turn based in space.  I only had small battles, but they were completely on autopilot.  Galciv 3 space battles are more interesting.  
Moo2 was one of the best TBS games of all time, this design point I knew would probably ruin it.  It did.  

2) You can't rename planets.  A feature the series always had, and helped me remember which system was specialized in what.  Now it's the battle of Ceti Alpha 6 or whatever every time.  Kills the immersion.

3) There are no heroes, like Moo2 had.  That added alot of flavor (though stupidly in Moo2 you couldn't rename the heroes, either).  They are missing.

I mention these 3, because otherwise it is a revamped version of Moo2.  The overall production values are really nice... so close to breathing fresh life into the series.  I was hoping they would pull off what a revival like happened with Xcom.",1473517612,1520815664,True,0,0,0.513393938541412354,18,True,False,False

Then my mood darkens due to the complete break MoO3 did with the series. The question now is: Is this a worthy sucessor to MoO2? The answer isn't as easy as it seems.

Do you want a game with the races from the first two MoO games, the techs, the ""feeling"" and the micromanagement of the colonies? Then yes, this is your game. Those aspects are very well done and feel like the old games.

Did you hate the real-time combat of MoO3 and want the great deepth of MoO2s Tactical combat back? Then you'll be disappointed. While the combat isn't all bad and you can pause it at any time, it has a rather simple real-time combat system with not even roughly comparable deepth to MoO2.

So depending on what you want from am MoO game, this might or might not be for you.

It was bland and small, in spite of the top-notch graphics and voice acting. Well, I re-installed a few weeks ago with 5x and the UCP mods and I have to say it's a very nice reprieve from GalCiv III and Stellaris' huge complexity. These mods add a huge amount of depth and scope to the game, yet the game mechanics remain fairly straightforward. It's a simpler game than these two other colossi, but it's still a lot of fun when you want to conquer a galaxy but don't want to have to open a spreadsheet to keep track of a thousand moving parts and how they affect each other. The game is colorful and has a lot of personality, and once you get an empire going, the combination of star lanes and warp gates makes war quite strategic. Ship customization is a quite deep and can make a huge difference in battles. I've found diplomacy to be competent -- have yet to see an AI do something utterly stupid or out of character. Finally, 400 turns into my current game, I've yet to experience any crashes or even significant bugs.

- Missiles and beam weapons don't actually miss you, they hit your ship, show a shield block effect, and have a ""miss"" text effect. That's the strangest and most lazy development logic, which also breaks the game. Having a +50 missile evasion shows 100 missiles hit your ship, with a big ""miss"" text, but when facing more advanced missiles, they do an area damage and always damage your ship by exploding at point blank range. That's not how a missile works. 

- Ships can't hit the broadside of a titan class barn, no matter which weapon or what computer they are using. A +150 computer ship with 6 disruptor cannons missed the 12 first shots onto a space station, from a medium range. The whole combat is confusing, showing a ""miss"" effect on a target that you'd hit with a rock. That leads to you installing torpedoes in all of your ships and destroying fleets 10 times bigger than you. In fact, I manage to beat the game twice and I still don't know how ship combat works...


- The whole combat control is flawed. while attacking a specific ship, your ship will auto fire on any other ship that is in range. Most often, the ""dreadful"" Frigate class AI will hover around your ship, and no matter what you do your ship will target that frigate with heavy weapons and miss, while your actual target will casually fire at you.

- Most systems are either bugged or not balanced, with or without modding. The pulsar is automatic and only works on the first missile, the cloaking/phase cloak is non-intuitive, the displacement device doesn't work if you exceded the range, under attack or in a nebula but you have to guess if it will work or not. Spent tons of hours saving, placing a system, attacking something, then trying to figure out how to create the ""best of the best"" ship design. turns out none of these systems work, and all you need is defense and lots of torpedoes.

- Speaking of saves, today I found each game save is 450Mb (??!!) large. I actually started this review a moment after finding out that this game clogged my drive with 150GB

- Most buildings are ""System Unique"" but they don't give any bonuses to the other planets in that system. I know, it's confusing, but the simple analogy would be that if Texas has built a university, no other state in can build a university in the entire USA. BTW most buildings in the game are not balanced, and it takes literrally 150 years to build a proper economy. 

- Building a colony ship on a captured silicoid by me the Psylon, actually creates a Psylon colony ship. sending a civic transport does send Silicoid, unless you have a mixed colony, at which point you can't send control who you send. the whole civic management, and having to drag citizens one at a time, is both counters productive and full of design flaws

- And yes, they managed to ruin the Silicoids. you can't play them as their population doesn't grow. You literally can't invest in the growth of Lithvore or cybernetic races, while you can in any other race that relies on food. That's practically punishing you for investing 12 points on a race ability without doing internet research. Did I mention the word design flaw yet?

- tech tree doesn't make any sense. there are 5 major technologies that will give you tons of bonus, while the rest are just a ""you can now spend 20 turns to build something that gives you 10% bonus in something"" techs.

- Espionage is broken. I'm not sure if it was tested. I gradually sent multiple spies to an inferior race to steal that specific tech. they all stole a technology that I already owned, and they did that turn after turn. I wasn't surprised, by now it was the 20th or so time that I spent resources and time on a master plan, just to find that it's broken by the game's design

- space travel is broken. you need to go sector to sector jump-game style, but it takes you an extra turn to go to the other side of the sector. A ship with a mega-hyper-drive can actually reach the same time as one with the basic jump drive. I could think up of a half-dozen better ways to reward you when you get a better drive, one of which is the original fuel and warp dissipator based design from the original game

Wow, I can keep going and going with this. To sum it up, the devs did not play the original game, or they misinterpreted the gameplay, or just didn't have a budget to fully develop its predecessor. These things happen, but Master of Orion is considered one of the best 4X turn-based game, and its name is now ruined by a new version with better graphics and much worse gameplay, and I'm not even mentioning the bugs and crashes I experienced

I mean, it's a game from the 90's. How hard is it to copy and improve it it ? Devs could have just used the original design and tweak it, instead of creating a worse game.

Is it enjoyable. Yes, is it as good as the first 2 games? Sadly no, the first games simplisticity belied the subtlety of its diplomacy system and the 2nd had better grasp on tech and the balnces of going creative vs production heavy.
That said...
Thanks to the workshp and some of the mods (especially the 5x balancing mod) it does have the FEEL of orion which ultimately is why I bought this game

3 things I feel would be icing on the cake
1) Customisable opponents. The idea of making the puny Psilons bad asses at ground combat just makes my smile everytime i think about it
2)Diplomacy victory condition. I dont know if its me but Ive been no option to vote for me or my opponents cos the council NEVER MEET IN ANY OF MY GAMES! But with my mods on, I dont know why but its how it is
3)Science. Should you finish ALL research, the your scientists do nothing from now on to help your empire. It even stops further minitirazation

Master of Orion has the same problem that a taco product called ""Big Mac II"" has. In that it hoped to sell copies and maintain a playerbase using a particular brandname while doing fairly little to honor the substance of what its named after.

It's not that it's a buggy mess--though there are things that could be improved. It's not that the game is too short (I'm in a 500 turn game right now...I am still only 3/4 of the way through the tech tree and realistically, I couldn't have ended the game before now either...there's still content for me to explore even after that many turns in just one game).

The one thing the game is absolutely missing for me, and its a real shame, is that Real-Time battles are absent in multiplayer...you can still play a full multiplayer game and use the game's autoresolve function, but it really sucks the fun out of it for me, personally. So I play SP and just like any SP strategy game...once you figure out the AI's tricks, you can't really lose unless you are going to mod it or enable cheats for it or something.

Anyway, about purchasing the game:

If you are someone who has never played a Master of Orion game before, you are going to have a great time. Especially if you like or are interested in Stellaris and Sins of a Solar Empire. However, if you played Master of Orion (the original from the early days of computer gaming) or its actual sequel Master of Orion II, then you will probably hate this game. It's not turn-based like the originals, its combat, for better or worse is real-time and certain decisions about how to place your ships, for example, aren't as important as they used to be. The decisions you make in battle are really about which ship should fire at what enemy ship. 

You still have enough influence to say, take a battle you were ""supposed"" to lose according to the little victory probability bar, and then through good management, win that battle. BUT it's not as significant as in previous Master of Orion titles. There are just some engagements you cannot win, and from what I remember about the originals that was rarely the case--you could win as an underdog, and even against the AI a technological advantage didn't guarantee victory. This made battles exciting, even against less developed AI empires. To a certain degree that's missing here in this title. Yes, you have influence over battles that you're commanding...no, you aren't going to defeat the Antarans with anything less than the end tier weapon and defense tech...there's just no way mathematically for your ships to do it.

Some people saw that as a major regression and not a real advantage of Real-Time battles and abandoned the title.

TL;DR:

So in summary: Good game if you come from it with a clean slate. It has AAA graphics and voice acting, and despite a few examples is bug free and performs well on a technical level. The real time battles suffer from the same issues as Total War: you have influence over the outcome if you command them BUT there are just some units you can create (or face off against) that WILL beat you no matter what because of their stats. Even so, it's definitely a good game for 2016/2017 and has no major drawbacks that aren't drawbacks in any of the other Turn-Based/Real Time hybrid strategy games.

That said, it's a bad Master of Orion game, much like a taco is a bad hamburger. If you are buying it for nostalgic purposes, you are going to be disappointed. There are probably other games that are better spiritual successors, ironically enough.",1512774058,1512774058,True,1,1,0.524793386459350586,0,True,False,False

I really think this game is for those who are beginners to moderate strategy players. I'd even recommend this game for younger (tween) players. Those who want much more advanced controls may not go for this type of game. 

First: play the regular game to get used to it. Once you do THEN I highly recommend the Revenge of Antares DLC. The newer races included in that are outstanding as well as the types of strategies you'll have to adjust yourself to when playing them. If you especially like economic strategies, there is a good race for that in this DLC.

Review disclaimer 2 : Have only played the Humans, Psilons, Alkari and Darloks so far.

Pros :
Interesting races with different characteristics making them feel unqiue and different to the other races.
Clean and crisp graphics
Warp Lanes (some people might have this in a 'Con' colume) - can be strategically and tactically used in various ways, especially used in conjuction with warp gateways (tech you can research)
Ability to design and custom fit your layouts / blueprints for your ships - always fun doing this :)
Civilisation type feel to the game with multiple ways to win, with the game being turned based generally (excluding rts combat).
GNN can be funny at times (some ppls might find them annoying - but thankfully there's a option to turn off GNN) and provides some niffy updates / random events
Ability to customise games, with different galaxy sizes, galaxy age, galaxy types, number of AI / human opponents, change game speeds and difficulty levels.

Cons :
Tutorial is not fleshed out enough and doesnt do enough to explain all the key concepts needed to play the game succesfully
At the time of writing this review, the rts combat is simple and lacking a bit of depth. Currently i dont believe its available for MP (simulation only) though this could change or be patched in.
Pirates were under used. No diplomatic, mercenary or bounty hunting options with them. Pirates dont really level / tech up to much as far as im aware so far (though i haven't played the harder difficulty levels so i could be wrong!)
Occasional bugs / glitches with AI for some races and they might act ""OOC"" in their dealings with the player(s).
Lack of a proper story / campaign mode.

Overall i've enjoyed this game so far, and hope to play the other races soon to find out how they play / what they are capable of. Some of the races that i've played are fun to play, but honestly i belive they might need some tweaking in terms of balancing. The Psilons are probably just a bit o.p. when it comes to technology, where as the Darloks are weak in comparison and their spying (while strong) isn't that strong to make up the difference. Haven't played the rest of the other races yet so please bear that in mind. Very little ground combat, all of it being simulated so if you're looking for a game where you can fight space and ground battles (ala Star Wars : Empire At War / Forces of Corruption) you will be disappointed.

Not too bad a game and has the potential to be great, but definately will need some work in terms of balancing and content patched in, alongside a full tutorial to help us MoO newbies learn the game better. At the risk of annoying long term fans of the series, i currently rate this game :

6.8 / 10
Above Average, with alot of potential :) 

UPDATE : Have played the Mrrshan Pride. This race seems best geared for an early conquest victory, with the race starting with destroyers and better marines. They do have an advanage in terms of other races accepting deals, though this is useful later in game, not at the start.

Their tech seems inefficient however, so if a game drags on, then the Mrrshan Pride could find themselves at a serious disadvantage tech wise, especially if they're up against the Psilons. Theres very little ground combat so far in game, so the""advantage"" of better marines isnt that useful. Best bet is to build an early fleet and ""Zerg Rush"" opponents before they can build / tech up to much.

UPDATE 2 : Have now played a little bit of the Klackon hive. This race seems to be the Zerg / Tyranids of this game (whatever your preference is lol). They are an insect race, controlled by a hive mind, led by a queen (sounding familar yet? ROFL).

They have an insane production rate for ships and buildings, and grow and insane amount of food, which in turn increases their numbers to acheive higher production values. If their tech and research wasn't so poor / slow i would say they're o.p but i'm assuming this is the game's natural balance to their overall high production / population advantages. Note : they also have a beginning disadvantage diplomatically as well, but no where near as pronounced as the tech disadvantage.

UPDATE 3 : Have played the Sakkara race. This race is kind of a reptilian / dinosaur race and has been in previous versions of MoO (not that i have played them!). They are an aggressive and highly reproductive race (holy hell does this race have a big advantage over others in terms of population growth rate!).

Because of their high reproductive rate, this race is an expansionist race, especially since they get the biology tech straight off the bat! They do suffer a disadvantage in terms of diplomacy, and their technology/research is uncreative, which might hurt their cause late game. A race it seems best suited to be aggressive early before the other races can catch up in numbers or tech.

UPDATE 4 : The terrans is the dlc race unlocked intially when i bought the collectors edition. This may have changed in the following months so i will review the race and how they play, rather than get into the 'politics' of BS dlc, mircotransactions etc :p

The Terrans are considered to be an 'evil' faction, mainly being an aggressive, militant race. They get extra command points, start with destroyers and have a bonus to moral which make them an ideal race to be an aggressive player early on. Properly played, the terran race can be quite a handful, especially with their moral bonus you can set their tax rate to maximum without having to worry too much about moral drops and striking workers. From what i've played so far, they are best at attacking early though they can be decent late game with their tax rate / moral advantages.
Dont' seem to have too many weaknesses, so the Terrans might seem OP at first.

UPDATE 5 : Have played the Meklars now and they seem to be one of the most powerful races in the game. This race is the 'borg' race of Master of Orion. Have ships that are powerful, bonus to both food consumption, production from population and their ships have the nasty habit of self repairing! All this race needs to do in game is to say ""Resistance is futile"" and boom instant law suit lol just kidding XD",1474885144,1511516672,True,5,0,0.559322059154510498,0,True,False,False

1. Need DLC to have more the races, without DLC, there's very few races in the game, that's feels like I've been had.

2. The tech advancement is good and well-planned and there's a logical development path.

3. The planet development is good and well-thought out.

4. The UI is easy to use, a plus for sure. 

5. Several paths to victory is good.

6. Using stellar converters to completely destroy the planets of your rival is fun, wish there was multiple cutscenes to show the destruction though, as after seeing it for the 100th time, it does finally get old. 

7. The space battles are great, with a movie mode or tactical command, watching the movie mode is simply cool with fighter or missile views as they're inbound to their target. Tatical decisions in the battle make a difference between winning and losing, usually the auto-resolve will cause you to lose when you would otherwise wipe them out when commanding yourself, making you having to nearly command every battle yourself. 

8. Galaxy can feel small unless again you buy the DLC and have more races in the game, as the game will eventually be 3-4 civilizations vying for control and slugging it out with stellar converters.

Graphics: 7  (+1 Mini-cutscenes are a huge plus) : 8
Sound(Effects and Music): 8
AI: logical and makes sense; however, not easy to make allies even if you just declared war on their enemy and give them lots of tech to try to make friends : 7

Bottomline: Buy if it's on sale 50% or more off and the DLC's are too, otherwise wait.

From what I can tell, 3 had many features that were poorly implemented, and a UI that battled the player in bloody conflict in whatever you wished to do.

I say this implying that I am familiar with the franchise and it's gameplay, even though it was many years ago. Interestingly I turn 20 in just a few days, it has been 20 years since the release of Master of Orion 2: Battle at Antares.

But with all that aside, I shall turn to what you desire to know. The game is overall decent, although a bit different from the franchise' 1997 entry. But that is to be expected and it is not necessarily entirely a bad thing. The gameplay works well although some features need a bit of ironing out as is unfortunately the norm for games today. The new developers took cues from Master of Orion 3 and have designed a UI so clean it could be comparitive to a Windex commercial. Everything I need to know is displayed in front of me, and anything else is a click away. There are a few things that should be clarified, i.e. espionage missions. ""Hacking"" does not stop all research as it tells you, it halves the output of a faction. Or ""Destablize"", it does not actually reduce relations with all other factions, only with one, and by small amounts.

I am in my third playthrough on ""Very Hard"" after finding ""Hard"" to be a cakewalk. I remember struggling with great challenge even on ""Average"" in Master of Orion 2. I have yet to experiment with commanding the battles, I leave them to an AI commander. But I have read from other players that they are dissapointing and poorly implemented overall. They are real-time instead of the traditional turn-based of the franchise, and were so buggy that they disallowed them in multiplayer altogether. That action is pretty sad considering I would think a large aspect of versus gameplay would be pitting your fleets against eachother to see who is the better commander. 

Regarding the AI, I find it pathetic and hopeless. It is not hard for me to amass military strength so intimidating that all races feel ""Threatened"" by me, and bow down at my feet in worship. Also they handle finances without any intelligence at all. They are bad at making investments in the financial victory, just handing it to you every time. I always have to pay their part of the trade treaty, and I get the impression that they spend their money on things that are not very beneficial, wasting it.

The game is relatively enjoyable but needs some serious work here and there. I do find their move to add three of the classic races in 2 as DLC quite distasteful.

Pros:
- Extremely clean and intuitive UI
- Indepth but not complicated gameplay
- Customizable game experience, research speed, growth speed, etc.
- Interesting universe
- Ability to customize race

Cons:
- Information sometimes incorrect ingame
- Some bugs
- Three of the original factions from Master of Orion 2 have been chopped into a DLC
- Not challenging whatsoever

1- Turn based space combat, the lack of it is a huge negitive for replayablility and being willing to shell out extra money for the extra player races. 

2- This is not a game that should have downloadable content, and not DLC's that are so minimal in game impact.

3- Space lanes. That was one of the major turn offs for me for Master of Orion 3. The ablity to go to any planet and the worry about being attacked from any direction at any time was enjoyable.

Now keep in mind, I did play this game off and on for several months and did enjoy it when I played it untill I got bored as will happen eventually when playing any game. It is just that it should be considered a sequal and not a remake, of course if they marketed it as a sequal I might not have purchased it considering the Master of Orion 3 fail. Good game but it is not in any real way a remake of the original Master of orion.

From automatic auto-saving to the streamlined Empire management screen, playing MO is an absolute breeze. Having said that, the game brings little innovation to the series, beyond improved graphics. Not to say there's nothing new, just that it all feels a little shallow. The diplomacy system is good, compared to civ titles. The AI seems hopelessly outmatched as a match goes on, but maybe that's just the cave-dwelling gamer in me talking. The difference between races is noticeable, but feels largely cosmetic. Every match basically boils down to frantic expansion, cutting off the AI's attempts at expanding and a mad rush to bigger and better ships. This is true regardless of race and, maybe, regardless of game.

Anyway, it's alright, but I wouldn't pay full price for it.

P.S. Oh, how could I forget! Also, this game suffers from the epidemic of terrible endings. Since the devs (rightfully) assume few people will make it to the actual end of a match, since it's so frigging boring, there was exactly zero humor or CGI invested into the ending cutscenes. Excuse me, did I say cutscenes? I meant text pop-ups. As someone who grew up with Red Alert's amazing stories, being rewarded for dozens of hours of gameplay with a ""you win, congrats"" is just short of insulting. Seriously, splurging on five million trailers and zero ending cinematics isn't capitalism, it's alienating your hardcore customer base. Screw that.

No major updates ever came out. Most major bugs remain. AI is still terrible. They still have the nerve to sell this game and its DLC at its original full price. Stay away from this and any other titles by this company! I originally didn't recommend this game because of issues I stated in my original review below. At this rate, I'd tell you it's not worth playing unless the company PAYS YOU to play it. The perfect example of a cash grab using a famous series. Not sure if Master of Orion series will ever recover from this one, sadly. 

Original Review 3/1/2017 :

I'm going to have to go ahead and say I don't recommend the game at its current price. While it is an honorable start to being a glorious 4x space stategy game, and it does feel a lot more like MOO to me than MOO 3 did.... overall the experience just kind of peeters out after an unsatisfactory amount of time.

Pros :
- Most of the UI functions smoothly
- A good deal of MOO lore is included
- FPS is good and stable on a mid-range machine, even with all graphics options turned up
- The graphics are acceptable, but nothing special
- MUCH less buggy than 1 year ago, but still very buggy

Cons :
- I think ""terrible"" is actually a poor word to use to describe the AI. The right word is ""ridiculous."" Nothing they do makes sense
- AI uses cheats instead of tactics at higher difficulty levels to become harder
- The opening video seems to lag for me, not sure what that's all about
- Turn length increases far too quickly
- Workshop community, as always, is trying its best... but the game has design limitations currently which are severely limiting the depth, functionability, and compatibility of the mods.
- Community agrees that game is only about 1/2 done, at most, but updates have screeched to a halt in the last few months. Furthermore the devs have been in much less communication with the community than they had been.
- The pirates function way too shallow fo my taste. They essentially just attack as soon as their ships are spawned. They do not at all feel like their own hybrid civilization. No way to form diplomacy with them either. I know this is uncommon in 4x games anyway, but it really is a feature that would add depth... if you could have a back-door way of getting on the good side of pirates, but bad side of everyone else in doing so.
- Random pauses between screens at time, especially when entering a battle.
- Tech tree is too short, too shallow, too streamlined, too everything that makes a tech tree unexciting
- Very limited customization options for galaxies. Even with mods.
- The largest galaxy type that comes with the game would be considered medium in most 4x games.
- Can't rename planets/star systems
- Quite possibly some of the most underwhelming paid DLC I've ever seen for this genre of game
- They made all the leaders/species look way too cartoony in most instances. I think using these graphics but sticking to MOO 1 and 2 lore (it seemed like a rather rustic, raw, and Babylon 5-ish universe did it not? Now it feels like Shrek in Space)

The game felt like it was progressing quickly until the fall so perhaps the devs are just working on something big, let's hope so. But until then, thumbs down.

It felt restricting in the galaxy overview.

So, my recomendation, wait for it to go on sale, then buy/play it.

However, I like the decision of removing the turn based combat with the more real time combats. 
I think also that the game is in the right path and I am sure the developers will do their best to improve it before the release date. 

There are only a couple of things that really disappointed me. 

1- The star system really contains few planets. I would have liked more planets in each star systems and a larger variety of events.
2 - I think the developer should make their best to make the universe more kind of living (e.g. Antarans, autoctones civilazations... in summary  more events  and maybe a story line about the Antarans).

It's a good ENTRY POINT for people just getting into the 4x genre.

It seems that we can all forget about Master of Orion 3 now, right? But the question is: should we? The game didn't turn out well, but the things it tried to do were important to the 4x genre. It tried to eliminate micro-management and allow players to control a truly massive empire. It tried to focus most of the challenge and intrigue on the second half of the game, rather than it all being front-loaded into the early stages. These are valiant goals for a 4x to strive for. It's a shame that they didn't work out.

This rebooted Master of Orion is forgetting all of that and simply hitting the reset button. Though I had some fun, I don't see myself coming back to Master of Orion once I'm done with it.

Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars doesn't have any fatal flaws. It looks slick and has a lot of nice bells and whistles. It just doesn't do anything particularly well, and some of the systems and mechanics have annoying nagging flaws and feel a bit shallow. If anything, Master of Orion works well as a fairly gentle introduction to 4x strategy. It's easy to jump into, and games play pretty quickly. I actually completed an entire game in a single afternoon -- something that's nigh impossible in a game of Civilization VI. If you're new to the genre, then this is a great introduction. It has enough going for it to be interesting, but isn't going to overwhelm you in the way that a bigger 4x game like Endless Space or Europa Universalis or Stellaris might.

This is a solid successor to the classic Master of Orion games, and it's a great entry-point if you're interested in the genre. For experienced 4x players, there's bigger, better games on the market right now.

On the one side, hey, it's not MOO3! THe game is certainly enjoyable, and you can have a lot of hours of fun with it. The campiness is back, all the races are there, fleshed out for everyone to see, graphics look good and there are no obvious setbacks.

On the other hand, IT seems like a missed oportunity at many junctures. While it's great to have MOO for our generation, it fails to be as memorable as the first two, because it's just not innovative. Everything you do here you probably already did in moo1 and moo2. 

Also, some of the design choices are just odd. I mean, you can say yeah to starlanes or nay to starlantes, but once you decide to go with them, you have to own them, and i think they really missed the spot on this one. 

Antarans are fun, but they fail to be a ""Galactic scale"" threat and just turn into the new pirates V2.0, And If starlanes and choke points are going to be that important, then why not make the star-system scale as engaging as the galaxy map fleet movement ? Having moving from one planet to the next be as time consuming as moving from one star to the next just doesn't feel all that right. I don't presume to know how to fix it, but i can certainly spot there's some parts of the magic that are not as shinny as they should.

It's hard to fail at that but then it won't be anything revolutionary.   The most significant difference is that the map is a bit more like MOO3 with choke points - requiring more strategic selection of systems.  That's an upgrade.  

The style and artwork of the game is great.  

The game is much better balanced than MOO2 - but still stays true to the nature of each race (making some very OP - *cough* Elerian *cough*).  It's for the better IMO.  Where balance fails is with the fast pace of science (then you're greeted with science points contributing to nothing but score once completing the tree) and the slow pace of population growth.  Fortunately these can be tweeked in settings.  Set growth to fast and tech to very slow.

The biggest and most significant negative is how brain dead the AI is.  It is by far the most predictable and utterly ineffective AI I have come across.   It's at least better than the impossibly brutal AI of MOO3.. 

In the end it's good enough to be the MOO game to play for the modern gamer.  MOO2 is still amazing and you should play it but MOO CTS will probably get much more play time.

If you wouldn't need to buy the DLC to make it a good remake This is alos the biggest problem of the game. It quite obviously was split in two parts, one whole product served as an inferior product with an expensive fix. I don't like this practice!

BUT with the Antares DLC it is the complete Master of Orion 2 remake. Those who liked MoO2 will at once feel at home. For everyone else, MoO is a 4X strategy game on the light side of the genre, a good point to start roundbased 4X strategy. AI is mildly acceptable and you have enough choice in difficulty. Races are plenty and well fleshed out, and play really differently. GNN-News get old quite fast, but you can disable them. All in all I love it. But I am a huge fan of the old MoO2 so 33% of my excitement originate in nostalgia.

The bright spots: The voice actors do a bueatiful job and were worth every penny. You may get tired of them after a while, but they are enjoyable, and it's worth the price of admission to experience them all. 

The game hybrids between MOO 1 and 2 Economic model. You got population you can specialize in development and it has planetary surface development, but it does feel a lot like the Moo1 Sliders. None of this is a bad thing, and it feels nice wihtout having to micromanage too heavily.

Visuals are wonderful, and I tend to enjoy the colonization sequences. This might be a downside for others, but for me it doesn't get boring. At least not yet.

If you want to finish a game in a day or two, it is possible. Not a lot of strategy games lately can say this.

Downsides

Space Combat. OMG, you just have no control, it's almost worse than Moo3. It just is not servicable. I recommend skipping it. It's pretty, but not enjoyable at all.

Tech Tree : They get rid of the older system trees, and replace it with a singular development Civilization Style Tree. It's... okay. It has a few obvious paths through it. It's not as fun as Moo2's tree, but it serves welll.

Diplomacy - Yeah... it's... Well, it's not like they go to war at a drop of a hat, and the computer will work against itself, but if there is tech to trade, they'll trade it between itself before they'll trade it with you. 

Overall, if you are new to the genre, and if you are an old fan, or if you just like space opera, this is a servicabe 4X game that honors it's sources well. If you are already a master of the genre and more complex space sims, you probably want to give this a pass.

Returned to the game since and -- it's GREAT.

It's not the most elaborate 4X game out there, but this game really manages to capture a perfect compromise between the original three Master of Orion games and comes up with a great niche spot in the current state of the genre.

Basically it has the simple elegence of MOO1 (and I mean this as a massive compliment), the colony building of MOO2 and the starlanes of MOO3.

I feel the starlanes are the most controversial feature of this game. I personally love them. To me they're a great way of keeping fleets sane, meaningful, and manageable. I like that you have fronts limited to a selection of systems. They make bases more meaningful too.

Overall simplicity -- I love games like Stellaris, but they're ""big"". I like that Master of Orion has everything on a boardgame-like board and I can understand what's going on in the big picture with generally understanded mechanics.

I still play Galactic Civilizations III and Stellaris regularly (and Civ 6), but Master of Orion definitely has a place in that echelon and I appreciate I can have a good solid campaign in 5-10 hours as opposed to 2-5x that...",1503858032,1503858032,True,8,1,0.574917972087860107,0,True,False,False

The most common argument against the new Master of Orion is the simplicity of the gameplay, but actually I see it as a huge advantage compared to other 4x games. I play sci-fi programs to experience the joy of mere exploration, to meet unique alien races, to participate in galactic parley or to conquer and crush ""lesser"" beings - withouth the burden of endless micromanagement. I like sci-fi games for the athmosphere, but too much detail can kill the fun, at least for me.

And this is why MoO caught my attention, as it does not want to burden me with details in every corner, instead it offers a smooth ride across the galaxy every time I play it. Do I want to oversee and control each of my colonies, or do I want just to gather a fleet and wage war against others? It is totally up to me, as the game can offer pretty much support in every aspect, including colony management, ship design, research etc. Even if we wish to go without the help of the game, the mechanics are still easy to understand and master, and for me this is a pro and not a con.

So if you seek a 4x game with serious micromanagement and weeks-long gameplay for every single run, in which you can put the pants on every single colonist by yourself, than you will probably find MoO a bit simple for your taste. However MoO can and will give you unique races, fancy-looking fleets, detailed galaxies and huge space battles, not to mention the athmosphere I really like in this game - this is where MoO truly excels.

Of course this game also has some drawbacks: the rather basic spy system, sometimes inbalanced racial traits and the simplicity of the AI, but if we look the big picture, the final verdict is definitely positive.

As most of the discussion about the game takes place on steam, i have been present in the forums here. As the game was on sale on steam this summer (2017) i decided to get it here as well.

I've been a huge fan of the original MOO since 1993 and have got every sequel. While they said that they wanted to make a reboot of the original game, this is actually a full reboot of MOO2. The main difference is the presence of starlanes. While i would have very much preferred not to have starlanes (as i don't think it belongs to the core mechanics of the first two games), i find the implementation ok. It does however slow the gameplay a lot and, while, it doesn't had anything valuable imho, it does make the game a more relaxed experience as you can take your time to build up an empire and defend it. The changes made to the original games make it closer to the Civilization games. Actually, it could very well have been done by the same team who made Civilization 5.

Conquer the Stars (CTS) redelivers the formula with some great innovations that eliminate or contextualise some of the more annoying aspects of MOO2 (speaking as someone who has sunk... *ahem*... some time into MOO).

The default game is great but the ""[b]5X - The Ultimate Balance Mod[/b]"" is better - definitely a lot better than MOO2.

[h1]The Feels[/h1]

This game has good assets, if ya know what I mean  ;)

I enjoyed the music a lot when I started playing as it has a great drifting-above-it-all-in-space sort of vibe.

The game art and UI are iconic rather than detailed. Personally I think this is a great move if the game is going to be your re-playable 4X go-to.

Useability is king in 4X and many good titles have been subtly aggravating due to an overabundance of detail in a UI already laden with icons and numbers to interpret. The simple lines, contrast and typography of CTS make it accessible enough for new 4Xers and fast enough for veterans.

That being said, the leaders, planets, backdrops and cut-scenes are all great and deal up the atmosphere at the right time in contexts where it rewards an achievement or adds a dose of flavour to what would otherwise be a workflow diagram (ah 4X, we love you).

[h1]The Strats[/h1]

Well I've lost my last two games and I wasn't even on the highest difficulty or trying to challenge myself so there must be something there  :)

MOO2 and CTS both have an unusual talent for making the mid-game of a 4X playable. In almost all 4Xes, the winning strategy is to gear up for the AI's first assault, win it on favourable ground and then conquer them while they're rebuilding their armies. Then you have 2 players worth of resources and the game is more or less won.
For extreme difficulties, this is usually achieved by exploiting particular glitches of the AI (for example, stealing workers in Civ).

In MOO, the glitches are part of the gameplay and evolve as the game progresses. In the early game diplomatic relations take time to worsen so wars (usually) don't kick off immediately and a bit of compromise can help you eke out a small empire with a weak early game race. And mid game allows ship designs that can use the player's RTS skills to out-manouver opponents and gain marginal advantages against a superior foe, allowing your strat to play out.

Where this differs from MOO2 is that espionage sucks ass and is completely pointless. Where once a game with Darlocks in it would mean a bunch of unexpected wars as they framed you for their misdeads, they're a free conquest in CTS. I haven't played the balance mod enough yet to see if they've fixed it but there are some obvious improvements so maybe.

[h1]Tactical Combat[/h1]

Before I start, I think I need to mention that I play twitch games like MOBAs and FPS so I don't have a mechanical challenge to overcome with realtime combat.

I like the tactical combat and the sense of needing to micro properly with some kinds of ship designs is really welcome, as is the faster pace for larger battles.

That being said, I probably like Endless Space's approach of more cinematic battles with a surprisingly deep poker-ish card game over the top of it more. Star Drive 1 & 2 definitely get the prize for having the most intelligent system but also having computational complexity issues that really hurt the quality of the game a lot. Stellaris's combat is just boring and the ships look awful.

My criticism is in the lack of numbers. Why can't there be numbers and rule text flying everywhere!??! IMHO, that's what people are actually missing from the original experience - there's no feedback that your design is actually working.

[h1]OMG, is this still going[/h1]

I have no idea why I'm writing a review for a Steam game. I think I'm procrastinating... I definitely have better things to be doing.  :)

I, and others, were very disappointed with a lot of what Wargaming initially released and it was hard to understand where they were coming from (seriously, some of it was pretty dumb).

The same races are still there and all of the tech plus much more tech, but the game play is completely different. The graphics are excellent. The sound is great, the game play is excellent. It is just a different game where you need a few different strategies than you used in MOO2. Every turn there is something to do. The game actually tells you about every bulid, every ship move, every spy. In MOO2 there were dozens of turns where nothing happens as you try to build buildings and units, which I did not care for.

This biggest change is ""no fuel limits"". That allows you to move all over the galaxy freely. To balance that change, there are now space lanes (ala Sins of the Solar Empire). Space lanes can be defended and blocked and fought over. This does restrict free movement to ""any"" planet but with no fuel requirements there is always a way around.

Also, no food freighters. There are techs that allow you to settle on any planet and not starve though, which allows you to colonize more freely.

Spying is completely different. You create a spy and then give him a mission. He may or may not succeed but if he does he gains spy levels which makes it easier to succeed. Spies now cost maintenance (higher level, higher cost) so no more 40+ spies.

I have played through this game several times now and have not felt the least bit disappointed or bored.

There is one item that is missing that should be in the game. When marines attack a planet there is no fight simulation. The units just disappear from the screen as they die. They also left out the view of the enemy marine armor, which was very helpful in MOO2.

3) Diplomacy isn't up to what we can have in other games.

But I'll be playing this game for quite some time, mainly because it manages to get the pacing right. Many space 4x games don't get the pacing right between expansion and tech progression, leading to technologies that feel useless, and military upgrades that feel pointless. None of that here. Each tech feels important, and the order of reserach is often a very difficult decision. This was probably the single greatest aspect that made me enjoy this game over other similar titles.

I did not play MOO1 but spent hundreds of hours with MOO2 and MOO3 back in the day and can say that this remake is very close to the MOO2 experience. Should you want an even closer recreation: there's mods already available that make the game ""More like MOO2"" (actual name of the mod). I didn't try this, since I'm quite happy with the new technology tree (mostly MMO2 techs, with slightly different arrangement).

AI diplomacy actually works and makes sense, which wasn't the case with the originals.


The only nitpick I currently have is that space combat and ship mechanics do not have feature-parity with MOO2. Most notably: there is no ship boarding, which was a major machanic I used a lot in MOO2, especially when playing races that did not have ""creative"" trait, as a means of getting more technology from the enemy (by scrapping stolen ships). It was also a good way to get all of the Antaran tech, since taking Orion only gave you a random subset.


I would like to see a DLC/expansion that would introduce boarding, crew experience, fleet controls and a bit more detail and control to ship mechanics - to cover this last gap and bring the new MOO to feture-parity with MOO2.",1500197121,1500197121,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The second part has been a titan for a long time (and still is btw, so if you do not mind low resolution and do not have it already...). The 3rd part was so different in the planetary management that many players refused to accept it as a successor and some even lost trust in the frenchise. And for a long time a lot of what made the 2nd part so superior was still missing (character creation missing at all, then without MoO-essential traits like ""creative""). But, with the last patches, the developers did everything of importance correctly.

The graphics are good, ships look quite nice (except the Meklar ones), the battles are auto-resolved or in pausable realtime (like in Baldurs Gate or Lords of Magic, which differs greatly from the turn-based battles in MoO2, but the mechanics are well adjusted and absolutely fine to play), the tech-tree is huge and the preconditions are well set, the race creation has everything it needs and there are even mods for that, the diplomacy is well done, the behaviour of the AI fits their traits, the travelling between solar systems now works with lanes (in MoO2 your movement was only limited by your engines/warp drives), so you can only travel to systems that are connected to your location now, which requires less strategy, but makes more fun for players who prefer the turtling-strategy in some way.

The only two downsides are that the buildings on the planets look oversized and are so scattered that it does not quite fit the detailed and nice style of the game, and that you have to buy the DLCs to have all races.

Was aiming for a technological victory, and I spot my oldest and dearest ally (little grey men) is closer to transcending this plane of existence than I, Humanity. This would not do.

1. Instigated a war between space cats and robots, so that little grey's military ally was preoccupied.
2. Massaged relations on my own borders with a bunch of lizards and birdmen so that Humanity could be left in peace for a while.
3. Solidified my own military fleet, kept far away from prying eyes, and maintained good relations with neighbours.
4. Gently rebuffed advances from the little grey men who were asking for free movement through my territory.
5. Gave away nearly all of my technology to a race of backstabbing shapeshifters so that they would start a war with the little grey men.
6. Waited until the little grey men had sent their deathstar away to deal with the shapeshifters before I opened up a warpway to their frontier, and piled every available ship I had through to attack grey systems.

As I shelled the very last member of their race out of existence and out of history, Humanity became a race of light-travellers, and got away to explore plains new - far away from the primitives. Humanity had been an entirely peaceful race up until that point - I debated with myself whether or not to get stuck into the action; the war was a drain on research resources for both the grey men and humanity. I could have kept our noses clean right until the very end, but I felt like the grey men were humanity's sick pet - it was our duty to put them down ourselves rather than leave it to the vet. Blasting their home planet from space with nukes was the equivalent of pulling the plunger. 

See you in the next life, entire race of sentient creatures.

It took 15 hours or so to complete that one match. I still smile at the memory of how it ended.

Prepare to say ""Just one more turn and I'll go to bed"" and then look up to see the sun rising through your window. Fifteen hours goes *fast*.

I'm looking forward to playing it again with a new race, but I know I'll have to set a week aside to actually do it. Difficult to pick up and play, you really want to go at it for hours at a time instead of piecemeal. Thoroughly recommend it though. Excellent music and voiceover work, made me feel inspired in the way that space orchestra really should do - to put forth your most noble effort to expand your race's horizon. The mood shifted significantly when I declared war, and it had a feel of DEFCON to it; nobody truly wins. It was perfect.

The antarians started to attack, but I got spared for quite some time.
To the point that I reached the end of the research tree (with all modules unlocked) befor the antarians came to me.
Their first fleet was 3 ships that got crushed on one of my planets defenses (not even one of my ships there to help).

Because I was at war with another race, I built ~50 ships (doomstar, titans and battleships, nothing smaller) within 25 turns.

On its own this game is actually quite good. Its very well presented, has an intuitive and simple UI and its very fun to play.
Its a great entry point into a genre thats traditionally a brick wall of confusing mechanics and spreadsheets. 
If you are a 4x vet though maybe look elsewhere since this one is very much streamlined for quick playabilty as opposed to in depth micromanagement.

So yeah take any negative review with a grain of salt, alot of 4x gamers are either elitist (MOAR spreadsheets!) or they grew up playing the original games and are disappointed that they didnt get those with modern graphics/ui.

3's only good parts were an intensely more longer tech tree than 2, a more interesting galactic senate, a bit more options for racial picks, more factions, more starting empires in any single game, terraforming's increased complexity that's wholly ignorable, which I liked, fleet creation, designing starbases and the New Orions.
Otherwise it never happened, there's a reason why there's no officially titled Moo4, even if this game is THAT exactly.

First off, it's a remake, what I'm going ot say is already irrelevant due to that.

I've however played Moo 2 since it came out and I've never really stopped playing it for anymore than a week at any one time. I will be reviewing it as a remake of Moo 2, so the following will be a Pros and Cons list of simplified bullet points.

Pros:
- Most of the factions look really good versus how they were in 2. Save the Klackons, and (in my opinion) the Psilons. Klackons shouldn't have pupils and Psilons really don't need 4 arms.
- Voice work is great, save for the Klackons after a bit. 6 hours of playing as them, and now I want to burn them alive.
- System structuring is just fine. Not complex, which is good. Up until starbases.
- Trade Goods and Housing is here, though you gotta research Housing for literally no good reason. Gotta learn how to build houses in the age of space travel. Okay. Might be confusing it, however, for Trade goods, which makes just as little sense.

Cons:
- The Mrrshans are for no reason, entirely a female race. Who's idea was this?
- No Racial Specials.
- Less non-specials for Racial Picks, making this and the above point result in making custom factions almost totally pointless in a way.
- Real time combat with as much control if not a bit less so than Moo 3, which people often hated the most about it. People want control, and to be able ot walk away from combat to get water/food or do chores, or they want time ot think, hence why people kept asking for Turn-based combat.

- How you build starbases is just arbitrary, construction ship has no real point for that when the colony itself could just handle that directly.
- Freighters are a thing you can physically destroy, which sort of makes them a pain in the butt.

- Star Lanes. In short: They make Combat stupidly simplified, when it's simplicity, yet depth in MOO2 was it's main strength IMO. Oh and it's just lazy. Endless Space and Moo3 are not good games, mostly because of Star Lanes. Though ES's combat system makes that game worse than Moo3.

- Race pack DLC. Just why man. You can make your money, just make a good game FFS. World of Tanks probly pays enough to make a DLC-less game FFS. Worst part is, they aren't the Terran Khanate, but the Elerians, Gnolams, and Trilarians, which should be free, since those are base game races in Moo2.

- Morale is too hard to keep up. Moo 2 didn't have that and it was good due to it. Civ's design isn't strong and hasn't been since the very first game in it's series, irregardless of what ""critics"" say about it. It shouldn't scale off of population numbers, otherwise it gets too hard to manage, or harder than it really should be.

- 30 dollar price point. Moo2 is 7 dollars normally. I'm a firm believer that the age of a game should never deteriorate it's pricing if the price is good for what you get. Realisticlaly, this is more a 20 dollar game. Moo2 is a good 30 dollar game if not 35 or 40 for what it is.

- Ship design is just worse than in other games, including 1 and 3. It's not any better either.
- No miniturization from researching tech tree branches.
- You can't design starbases. The only weak point of Master of Orion 2 is this and only this. So what's the point of this remake's existence if not to just cash in on nostalgia?

All in all, versus Master of Orion 2, which is a superior game, still being patched (look up Master of Orion 2 1.50.8, it come with a launcher that allows online play without port forwarding, even if you are hosting), and on steam for literally 25% of the normal cost of this game.

For those that think ratings are a good idea, my rating for tihs game is a 2/10. You may think I'm judging it too harshly and comparing it entirely against Moo 2, but I'm a firm believer that remakes for video games is as pointless as ""how to Breathe"" seminars. Remasters? Sure, those make sense entirely, but Remakes, unless they do the same stuff as what was the best in the remade series, and do either as much, or even more better stuff, they justify their existence.

This game doesn't justify it's eistence, what it instead shows, is how absolutely lazy and terrible gaming has gotten in the last 20 years.

If you can't make a game in the same vein, and the same style and formula of a game series that is literally legendary, then you should just quit your job or not even bother.

Wargaming wasted their time and apparently the old MOO2 devs have no idea what made MOO2 so great and what made MOO3 so terrible.

After reading this, now you'll know more of why MOO2 was so great.

Would've rather we got a remastered version of MOO2 1.50.8 with star base designing and massively improved mod tools. Would've been easier for them to pull off in hte long run and the game wouldn't be at Mixed twice over for ratings.",1498605826,1498605864,False,10,1,0.551842987537384033,4,True,False,False

First thing, this game is not all bad. It's just not spectacular or really different in any areas. It has sharp menus and some good (and some not so good), voice acting. Everything else is just plain and done several times over, sometimes better, in other games. 

They even removed minor races from the early access and they never returned. They claim they return at ""some point"". Space battles could be way better. It feels like you have limited control and are always fighting to get your ships just to do what you want them to do.
(edit: minor races are back in, however, they play a very limited role)

Many of the reviews put me off of trying this, stating that Stellaris (which I also have) or  Endless space 2 are better. 

That is where I disagree.

Stellaris is a very different game. In that, just like in MoO, you research and micromanage your empire, sure, but it has a completely different feel to it. Stellaris is a very slow affair and the AI cheats like you wouldn't believe. Great game regardless, but they are different games entirely.

MoO is much more like Endless Space 2, if only mechanically. Endless space 2, however, I feel is a let down. Combat is cinematic and the AI in battles is stupid to the point of frustration. In Master of Orion, you get full control. If you want full control that is. Then you have the trianglar textures, no doubt done for artistic purposes which make everything look like they are origami creations. You have the droning, depressing atmosphere of ES2, where the soundtrack was basically ripped out of Songs of Praise (google it if unsure what that is - choir singing. Horrible).

MoO is a worthy addition to the 4x genre and by no means the worst. If anything, it's standard. It doesn't add anything new, but that's hardly a crime if you go into it expecting a solid 4x and not a revolution in the genre. If you want something different, go for Stellaris.

Master of Orion is a bargain on sale. So is Stellaris. You could get both and have a very different experience. Just don't listen to the critics who praise ES2 and it's trianglar, choirboy cutscenes.

Master of Orion is also abbreviated as MoO. So when your friends ask what you are playing, you can just make cow noises like an immature man child. That alone makes it worth it.",1498315110,1498315315,True,36,5,0.735756933689117432,1,True,False,False

That being said, I was very apprehensive about buying this one due to all of the negative reviews, but I decided to buy it since it was on sale. I honestly do not regret buying it, and I am willing to go as far as saying that it's as good as MoO 2, if not better. As much as I love MoO 2, I think it really is time to move on from it. This game has nearly all of the features of the original MoO games, and gives them a proper makeover.

Truth be told, I actually really like what they've done with the MoO universe. They made it a bit more light-hearted, and just made it seem a bit more vibrant. The GNN is much more fun to watch, the alien civilizations are much more dynamic and exciting to talk to, the terraforming is still there (and is even cooler), and you can still build doom stars. Another thing is  I used to kind of dislike the diplomacy in the original MoO series, but they managed to make it a bit more fun with this new game. 

Really, I can only think of one flaw, and that's the fact that there're no turn-based spaceship battles. I'm fine with either real time or turn based, but I know there are people out there who prefer the old turn-based battles of MoO 1 & 2. Besides that, I can't really think of much that makes this game a negative experience.

This isn't MoO 2 or MoO 1, and it sure as hell isn't MoO 3. It is its own game, and another wonderful addition to the MoO universe.

I love the atmosphere created by GNN, and the voiced advisers. It looks beautiful, sounds better than average.

I miss the strategy in battles, I understand turn based is slow, possibly too slow for multiplayer, but choice is king, and if I want to micro-manage my fleets... 
Custom races are... dissapointing. I understand that making them fundamentally weaker than core races means potent combinations are de-fused. Again. Choice! 
4X is all about choices and in some fundamental places those choices are lacking. If the strategy of designing a race, and of battles is (largely) removed the game looses a lot.

I reccomend this game, 4x and MOO fans will enjoy it, especially if it comes packaged with the other MoO games. Just dont expect the grand strategy of the past, just a healthy dose of it.

This 4X strategy game has you pick one of several interstellar species for galactic dominance. If you've played any of the Civilization games, you know the goal already. The game starts off pretty good but in late-game, things tend to drag. I haven't had any heart-pounding moments where this could be the point that makes or break my civilization. Not to mention how some species are clearly better than the rest, which can lead to some pretty imbalanced games if you're playing without mods.

It's not as deep or challenging as Civilization, but it was still a good time. Simply put, it's a decent game if you want a modern, sci-fi 4X game or simply want something familiar to Civilization but not the same. It's definitely worth at least checking out, but I would recommend taking a look at some YouTube vids of it (Totalbiscuit did a video on it and pretty much hits the nail on the head with this game).

I'm not sure how old any of you were when the original Master of Orion came out in 1994, many probably weren't even born yet, but this new overhaul of that game is basically the same.   I think that for us older gamers, we put a lot of nostalgic value on older games, often remembering them as being far greater than they actually were or are.  

This game is a great overhaul of the original.  The graphics are smooth and beautiful.  The space battles are fun to watch.  

As far as game play, it is basically the same.  You have colonies, three major categories (production, research, food), and you have to manage your empire through a simple diplomacy system and espionage mechanic.  

While it is very true that since 1994 many other 4x space games have come a long that have done all of these things better, this version of Master of Orion is faithful to the original and contrary to popular belief, plays the same.  If you find this version boring  then I challenge you to go back and play MoO 1 and I am confident you'll find that just as boring.  

We all know that MoO 2 was the pinnacle of the franchise and MoO has always been a lengthy game (I'd argue the same average length of game as any Civlization game).   It does take awhile to get your empire up and running and even longer if you start pre-warp, but it still is at its core a very solid 4x game with tons of customization in regards to races and ships, which is why we probably loved it so much back in the day.  

DLC is a given nowadays, so no need to complain about it as is knowingly releasing broken games which they fix in a patch a week later, if we're lucky.  None of that is going away any time soon.  

I think this version of the game is getting a lot of unwarranted flack.  Point is, if you loved the original MoO, then you'll love this game too with its updated graphics and look.

This entry captures the spirit - if not the essence - of the timeless classic MoO2 without breaking many traditions but also without crossing many thresholds. It retains the simplicity of style and interface with the original two in the series and avoids the unapproachable complexity of the third, and it brings back the ""cutesy"" nostalgia feeling with the species' animations and voice-acting. Yet despite a familiar sense of nostalgia, it somehow does not compel me to stay up playing until 3am as I would have with the originals. (Of course, the originals were genre-defining in a day where there weren’t 10,000 gaming titles to choose from…)

The gameplay is solid - most things work and function as expected, and I've encountered no glaring bugs or crashes. Performance is great in saving, loading, and through turns even in the 400 to 500+ turn range. There are camera-focusing transitions that get annoying - zooming the camera for you when you click to change a ""production finished"" event - but sometimes that is actually useful (it does center the system, so you don't, for instance, blindly build a colony ship 25 turns away from your frontier where you need it.) Empire-management gets cumbersome by the mid-game, especially on larger maps, but I don't know many 4X games where this isn't true anyway. When you've got 20+ systems and 60+ planets with evolving technologies that improve what were once-worthless planets into impressive colonies, there's going to be some micro.

There is also an assortment of customizing options for how a game can play out; speed of research, growth, galaxy sizes and shapes, inclusion of pirates, random events, the traditional ""Antaran"" invasion, and various victory conditions. Standard fare while keeping with the MoO theme. These go along with the race options, where the game has the traditional races from the original series (although some are available only through DLC) and of course the ability to customize a race. Unfortunately the vanilla customize race option is weaker in terms of both variety of choices and overall points (default races have higher base points than possible with custom), but the choice is there to define your own style.

The graphics are good - I would say ""great"" but, let's face it, in 2017 how many space-based games don't look ""great""? The galaxy map is solid with useful icon information, and zoom functions quite well to get a ""god's eye"" view or zoom into a system level. Planet screens are equally useful and enjoyable, although I do sometimes notice some input lag clicking-and-dragging population icons from different plots. The UI, overall, seems on the surface ""simple"" but is more than functional enough with only a few occasions of what I consider ""excess clicking"". It could use some improvement, especially with the leader screen (managing colony and fleet ""heroes"" and where they are assigned) but I haven't yet checked the Workshop to see if UI management improvements exist yet.

Audio is also fine - actually pretty solid. No glaringly obnoxious sounds, noises, or voices, and the music is a low-key ambient that fits right in with a relaxing gaming experience. Actually one of the few games I've played where I don't end up turning the music off after the first few minutes/hours. The fleet combat audio is also good - flowing in volume and special effect sounds based on where the camera is focused and/or how far in/out it's zoomed. 

Strategically, my experience and from reading is that any degree of depth or difficulty is dependent on game-start settings, race options, and of course the random starting dice-rolls inherent to 4X games. I've played a few games on huge maps and I'm finding it's not too stressful, but not strategically ""deep"" except insofar as how to position my fleets to cover my increasing territory size while managing an ever-increasing system and planet sprawl. It feels tedious at times, but it satisfies that ""relaxing, turtle-til-I-kick-your-ass"" mood. A smaller map, with faster ""game pace"" settings, is what I'll try next, and I should think it will be much more engaging.

Tactically, the combat system is - surprisingly - not the simple ""watch it play out"" cinematic of so many space 4X games, but, as this is not a sim, you are also not in complete micro-control. You can play it automatically, but with manual play you can still maneuver your ships individually or in groups and designate their targets. Designing ships gives you access to a variety of tactical choices - weapon types and focuses, specials and defenses, and even ""roles"" for general AI control - but, as with many 4X games, toward the end of the tech tree these choices mostly go away in favor of ""the biggest gun"". This is why I like to play with reduced tech development speed in the game start - so each tech advance feels ""useful"" for awhile instead of upgrading ships every 10 turns.

Overall, I've been really enjoying this game, but I will add the caveat that I am now playing using the 5X - Ultimate Balance Mod (by Spud Dastardly). The vanilla version, as I played the first time, felt not very polished or even unfinished/untested, and after my first game I set it aside for many months. Coming back to it with the 5X mod has made a world of difference. And the developers are still active in content updates, bug fixes, and perhaps more DLCs (not sure what could be added, though.)

It is not as deep (i.e., grand strategy) as other recent and popular titles, but the MoO series was never about that - it's a fun and engaging game that doesn't take itself too seriously while still providing the core elements of a solid 4X space strategy game. I heartily recommend it if you're a fan of the series or the genre.",1496244603,1496244652,True,49,0,0.698557436466217041,0,True,False,False

That said: If you enjoyed the first game in the series, this is a must buy.
Some things have changed in the past 20+ years since the original MoO was released.
Some things haven't.
Gone are several (sub)races introduced in MoO3.
Back is an updated version of the pollution system from the first game.
The star lanes introduced in #3 are back, so keeping an eye on the warp lanes at the edge of your terrirtory is needed, and allows you and the AI to funnel enemies into choke-points.
There is actually a lot to love about this game as it does a decent job of trying to mix the simplicity of the first game with a little bit of the additions and micromanagement of 2 and 3.

Be warned though, the community surrounding the game seems to be pretty split on the direction this addition to the franchise went.
Some like myself are fine with it for bein what it is and thoroughly enjoy it.
A fairly vocal number of players are anywhere from being disappointed to being totally outraged that in their opinions it isn't as good or better than another game in the series.

Then again, as I said to start with, I love the whole series so my opinion is just as biased as their's is.

I have only won once in every attempt.

I may not be the brightest buIb in the room and while I have played a number of the these type of sims before, I have won at least once.

Moo4??? Don't buy it. Don't buy Stellaris either. Reinvest in GalCiv III DLCs

Moo4's front end is gorgeous. And the voices and acting are supurb with believable 
   and multiple responses in deplomacy.
But that's it.
The engine does not work.
Most of the techs are there but all the functionality and verifyablity is missing!

ie. I can only see what weapons I have on my ship when I go into battle.
It's really confusing when ships need to be upgraded. Have to rely on AI to do it....let's not go there.

Much of the ""control"" your given in battle doesn't work. 
   Try using the displacement engine while battling an Amoeba
   No documention at all on battle. Only what someone who isn't speaking shows you on youtube.

It's you Real Time freaks who came up with, ""Command Points"" in ""Sins of Solar"" so the programmers
   didn't have to deal with too many ships in 3d battle.

Get this.... you are only allowed enough command points for one cruiser and a frigate per planet until late game.
Any marching army of ants always comes with at least half there command points in ships.
It's that Star Wars logic again that allows you to think this is ok.

Sheesh. GalCiv has limits on fleet numbers that progress throughout the game but will let you have as many
   ships or fleets around as you want.

But here's the big thing that goes back to Moo2 and real programmers. 
I went back since years past and started playing GalCiv III again  and quite pleased
   to get accurate and understandable relults from my battle. 
   I can see what damage my new laser did against their new shield.
   I can verify that what I spent all that time researching actually did pay off.

MOO2 players are addicted to complex battle and something very special ....
         It's called, ""FEEDBACK"" 
And I thank moo4 for getting me back into GalCiv III.
GalCiv has Real Time Battle  with NO control but will let you analyze every detail of the battle
   during the battle and after with detailed stats...  what weapon did how much damage.
It was just a relief to have a full database at my dispoal to siphen through and figure out what
   I was doing wrong. Same is true about the Diplomacy screen. You can compare the opponent's
   planet stat to yours to figure out why there so far ahead in production or research.

I think Moo4 might be good if they could pay the GalCiv people to do there engine for them.
Just a thought.

GalCiv people remain champions once again after I gave all my money to the billionaires.

Life sucks and then you die. 
Get over it.

'Endless Space 2' is a stunningly original and polished game with tons of depth and I strongly recommend it to 4X fans.  But know what?   Sometimes I prefer playing MOO.   I love the music, the art-work, the GUI, the really high production values. 

And most importantly the gameplay is solid.  Every thing you want (pretty much) is there and it all works the way you think it should.    It's a relaxing game to play.   It's nice sometime to play a game that doesn't have a crazy high learning curve.  It's fun to play and what's wrong with that? 

I like the Galaxy map, the research tree, the exploration, combat, ship design - it's all solid.   My first game I was in a big war with the Meklars.   I offered a truce and return of two of their planets if they voted for me.   They accepted and I ended up with a diplomatic victory.    It's nice to not 'be on a roadmap' you have to follow.   

Strongly recommend you try this new MOO.   If you're a hard-core grognard who wants insane complexity this might seem slight to you.

- PC Gamer basically knocked it for not doing anything to ""shake it up"" from MOO1 & MOO2. I consider that a good thing not a bad thing. I basically wanted to play MOO1 but not in VGA graphics (uggg), and this game does that no question.

- Some of the criticism of the AI or of dealing with pollution....MOO1 had that exactly. You ask the computer-controlled race to declare war on someone else, and they do, but they don't do anything for a lot of turns, maybe never. Pollution - yes, you need to think ahead especially on rich planets or certain races like Meklar. In MOO1 you had to divert a lot of resources to Ecology later in the game, and with technology you can do that more efficiently. Same here.

- Comparing an upgraded classic to the other 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) style games that followed is bit unfair. If your expectation is to build on all 4X games that came before it, then yeah, you will be underwelmed. If you want to experience the classic that started the genre but beautifully upgraded with great personality (see the voice actors), fun but not overwelming, then you will enjoy this game. 

- I like it as much as MOO1 and a bit better than MOO2 (I was not a huge fan of MOO2 but I enjoyed it). The only thing I miss so far, is that in MOO1 I could build a fleet of thousands of ships. This version is like MOO2 in that the fleet size is more limited. It's big, but not the thousands I used to use (e.g., 1000 small ships with shields, mass drivers mid-game....just decimate everything. Or each holding one or two bombs will elimintate a colony in one turn....)

The reviews seemed biased negative due to mismatched expectations. Also, I started playing May 2017, quite a few patches later, so if there were serious issues on release, I didn't experience them. So maybe I'm biased positive :)

I still enjoy playing this game, for what it is, a streamlined, rapid-fire galactic chess game rather than a fully-developed 4X title. The AI could still benefit from improvement; added depth would make this title a little more replayable. However, after purchasing and playing Stellaris, I have to say Stellaris is the superior 4X game by a light year, particularly with the new Utopia expansion features. The interface and graphics of MoO:CtS are more polished, but for pure galactic game-play joy, I recommend Stellaris.


Original Review:

As another big fan of the original MOO games, 1&2, I've been struggling whether to recommend this remake. It was in pretty rough shape when the first Early Access edition was released (realeased too soon, if you ask me.)  However, since then the developers have really listened to the playerss feedback, and they have dramatically improved the game experience. Overall, I am very happy with the game. It perfectly captures the Master of Orion experience. The graphics, sound design, and control architecture are flawless. The most important feature - the AI has significantly improved. Diplomacy has significantly improved. Ultimately, I find the game to be just as addictive as the original title.

I do have a few caveats. I'm not a fan of the mostly linear tech tree. I wish combat were a little more interactive. (I don't mind that it's not turn-based.)  I wish the game had a little more depth, with more developed trade, economy, governors, heros, land assults, greater depth with Orion technology and the missing Antarans. However, minor races will eventually be added, and the developers are planning to open the game for mods. Yay!!!

Ultimately, I have to say the game is exactly what I wanted it to be - an addictive, streamlined, intergalactic MOO chess game with a modern face-lift.

Pros:
1. Nice graphic, map.
2. Good tech tree. Choose 1 from 2 - is good. Look also Tech cost progression like in Endless Space 2.
3. Nice idea with space engineer, gas stations e.t.c.
4. Good pollution mechanic.
5. Ship designer is OK.
6. Tax system and morale - is OK.
7. Engine mostly stable and good.
8. Decreasing efficiency per pop of production and food - nice idea.
9. Good turn events system.
10. It's mostly working and OK, but very unfinished (see What to fix).

What to fix:
1. Planets inside systems. It's difficult to manage so many of them. There is no cheap colony ships without warp drive. No transports.
2. Battles are buggy. Torpedoes sometimes fire in back direction from target and possible arc! Buttons not working properly.
3. Cannot alt tab on MacOS X
4. Cannot attack pirates colony with troop ship.
5. I'm not sure, but probably there is overflow in production. For example if you have 20 production per turn on planet and build ship costing 42 production, it will take 3 turns and you loose 18 production for air!
6. AI is very stupid. Also AI cheating
7. Races are not so interesting like in Endless Space / Legend. Only cyborgs (need 1/2 food per pop), psyonics, stones (race without food, but also bugs - build new colony and get building +1 food with 2 coins maintance. cannot sell it). What about unique techs, buildngs, actions?
8. Heroes are primitive. 1-2 basic abilities. And you can only increase them.
9. Resources are primitive. No strategic and luxury resources. +2 science. Not even +2 science per pop.
10. Planets are very similiar. No unique effects.
11. Exploration is boring. No events. Looks also on Probes in Ednless Space 2.
12. Morale of pop don't depend of planet quality
13. Building when colonize new system (gives +1 food). Why I cannot build it? Sell it? For cyborgs it's important building very.
14. What about altternative ship moves?
15. Culture and influence?
16. Minor civs. +3 to science on planet in their system. It's very nice, especialy when in their system there is only 1 planet: tiny lava.
17. Quests?

First, there is much time wasted in this version as you watch things you don't care about. MOO II, for the most part, never slowed the game down for pointless reasons. This incarnation has sector exploring, which really slows the game down without adding anything. Maneuvering in sectors, watching EM messages. Second, the game develops much slower than MOO II. In MOO II, you would start skirmishes in half an hour of play. Nothing interesting (except getting crushed by space monsters) happens in the 2017 version for much longer.

Since the first game, followed by the huge success of MOO2 (Master of Orion 2) and the mess the 3rd game was, this new one, is a modern copy of MOO2. Is that bad? Not really. While all the core concepts that made MOO2 the best 4X space game, Master of Orion is a gem. I played the old games to exaustion and do not let the low hours of play I have here on Steam foul you. I know this game very well. 

Pros: 
- A totally redesign of the old concept that works with new graphics and improved gameplay and new concepts that work.

- Total freedom of customization. You can setup your game in difficulty and the galaxy at your own taste. 
- Many different types of victories 
- Great implementation of Steam workshop and multiplayer. 
- Great graphics effects and colors make the galaxy feel alive.
- Relaxing gameplay
- Real time battles, control your ships, give orders and let the AI take over but always ready for you to take control
- It's Master of Orion!

Cons:
- Game still needs some tweaking, since in late turns it takes some time to end a turn even on high end systems.
- DLC with extra 3 races that always were present in the franchise.
- Can be a bit repetitive in easy levels of difficulty.

About the DLC's I cannot recommend buying this game with all DLC's for full price. In particular the one that adds the extra 3 races since they were always present in the franchise.
If you really want to buy it now, go without the dlc's or wait for a sale and buy it all.

It is a great game with many different types of gameplay, the same tactics might not always work. 

If you already know the franchise and still wondering if this is worthy, It is! imaging MOO2 with today technology.
If you never played the franchise and know some titles like galactic civilizations or Stellaris or even Sins of Solar Empire, then you really must have this game.

In other words, It is the epic Civilization in space!

Till I found out that there is no tactical combat, and only auto-resolve for battles in multiplayer. Until that changes I can't possibly recommend this game. If you want to play a MOO with autoresolve, just play FreeOrion, which is, yes, a free game. You'll be better off than playing this game in the current state. Or simply play one of the classics.

Again, there is plenty of good things in this MOO, and it's ok to play a few times in single. But with a multi without tactical combat, or at least the ability to watch the battles in spectator way. The game just isn't worth the price tag. It's a good start. A base of a game to start from and add to it, perhaps in an expansion. BUT, the fact that there is autoresolve only in multiplayer makes it targeting a much narrower group of players who have many other titles to choose from if they wanted an autoresolve driven experience.

So I have to sadly add MOO to the list of failed space 4X games that didn't live up to their full potential. If you want an actual 4X in space done right. Check out:
Sword of the Stars
Endless Space
MOO 3 (Strawberry/Vanilla/Tropical modded), MOO 2

(Galciv 3 could be a great choice too, but since I haven’t played it yet I can’t really recommend it)

Otherwise today's 4X games, keep being released either with no multiplayer at all, or with this kind of crippling decisions to make it autoresolve only. This niche of players, who want to enjoy what was a standard 20 years ago - space 4X games with multiplayer and tactical combat. Before this “less is more” ideology came about and ruined franchises like Command and Conquer. Must just bite the bullet, and realize that today making games like Sims is more profitable than actually making good space 4X games. Or so it seems. This is not just the problem of this MOO. It's the problem of whole industry as you can list all good space 4X games on the fingers of both hands if not just one hand on Steam. Sadly.

EDIT:
In addition to the above. This MOO's community is very toxic. Filled with 12yos and trolls. People on the LoL and CS level. Yes, it's that bad. You post a review, or you write a suggestion on forums and get trolls attacking you ad hominem, insulting you, saying f you. Maybe it's because it's done by Wargaming, and people from World of Tanks are here? Or is it because all the adults and actual MOO franchise fans left this failure long time ago after the end of EA? I don't know. But this new Orion's community is nothing I'd recommend anyone getting into. Best avoid it and go to places where you can actually spend quality time with adults instead.

EDIT2:
Some UI related things also make you cringe. There is no sitrep. Instead we get icons above end turn button. That you can't filter with the priority of important and less important stuff, they are all displayed in line. And you then ""dismiss"" each one of these. And since there's no sitrep list, you can't bring them up again, unless you reload the game.
GNN news can't be paused and when skipped they don't give any summary of what they were about. You can turn them off completely. But that's all you can do about it. So if you happen to be busy or get a phone calll at the time the GNN news plays... well, there's no DVR option to repeat it and no summary, no sitrep. Which again is an example of lazy design of the UI that might be ok for a mobile game but not really for a PC game.

EDIT3:
Might be because I'm playing not on the highest difficulty setting at this point. But so far the AI is very dumb (so some people keep saying this is a single player oriented game... well, then it sux even more because AI is very dumb). Example that you can always replicate. Fly with your fleet to the enemy system. What will the AI do? Instead of putting their fleet in a stronger position, say, to defend the homeworld. The AI will move ALL the forces from the homeworld, to meet you at the warp point. Where you can first take out the fleet, then move on to the homeworld and take out the space station and other defenses without their fleet around. Yes, it's that bad. I also remember in previous MOOs, especially MOO3 AI was pretty aggressive from the get go. While here AI is camping, sitting idly and attacking you only if they randomly get a cue for it. So the game feels way too easy and with no pressure put on you.

EDIT4:
Found more balance issues today. So turns out that when you get a truce with an AI faction, you guys can't have any battles for the duration, right? So how about all the fleets and outposts blocking the warp points during the truce? Simple it's very one sided favoring the dumb AI. During the truce:
AI can pass your blockades (outposts, fleets stationed and guarding the warp point). BUT you can NOT pass the said AI's blockades yourself. Making a ""truce"" with AI simply ""Give AI some space"" deal. Ridiculous.",1482348356,1491520441,False,46,1,0.586785018444061279,11,True,False,False

Gameplay
ease of play (you don't need a degree and 6manuals to sort what your doing)

Cons

the thematic attempts of some of the voice actors can be a bit tiresome on a long game
multiplayer (its turn based.. if you and your friends aren't planning a weeklong gaming session look elsewhere)
Ship based combat... this is not a issue that is unique to MoO... it seems more and more that RTS and TBS games are dumming down the combat to sit back and watch the rock paper scissors simulation... tbh I hate it but thats the new norm.

To summarize
is it worth 30usd?  well thats up to you but I found it so yes.  Is the game dead? not hardly just finished.  Would I recomend it?  Yes I would... its not the MoO it might have been, but you will get your moneys worth in game time and in the end thats what really matters.

Since then, I've always had a copy of MOO & MOO2 on every computer I've owned.  I still have the original manuals as well.    I, like almost everyone else, experienced the extreme disappointment that was MOO3.   So, I wasn't overly optimistic for a reboot.  

That being said, I must say that overall I am pleasantly surprised by this game.  Yes, it does have some flaws which I'll get into later, but what struck me the most is that it feels like I'm playing Master of Orion.  You can tell the developers put a lot of love into this game and tried to recapture the magic of the originals, and I think they succeeded.  The iconic races are all there, and have their own unique flavor.  The soundtrack is a delightful remake of the original's.   And the technology tree contains the advancements we all know and love.

Outside of that, they've also managed to improve the managementment aspects of the game without overly simplifying them.  Planet management is smooth and easy, the sitrep updates let you know what's going on, and my favorite aspect is the game will warn you if you have any outstanding actions to address or ships that need to be moved when you click the End Turn button.   It reminds me of the simplicity of MOO1 where you can just sit down and enjoy playing the game.  

The game however, is not without some flaws.   It still has balance issues and bugs that need to be fixed by the development team.  The combat, while enjoyable to watch the first few times, quickly becomes repetitive - as you lack a lot of fine control on the 3d battle map.   Many die hard fans (myself included) had hoped NGD would include a turn-based tactical combat option, similar to the originals.  But alas, that was not the case.    

Another complaint is that the game uses star lanes, where MOO1 & 2 did not.  This doesn't bother me as much as I like the idea of choke points. However, I wish they did include an option to turn them off and play without them for those that  want it to feel more like the originals.   

Lack of race customization is another complaint I hear often about the game.   On the surface, you get similar customization to Master of Orion 2 where you're able to take any race in the game and tweak them as you see fit.    What you don't get is the ability to create an entirely new custom race.    This seems to be because each race is tied to its associated ship models.  Ideally, I'd like to see you be able to create a new race and choose the ship model family you'd like to use for it.   

So, to sum up - I feel this is a fine successor to Master of Orion 1 & 2.   If you're looking for deep strategy and tons of options - check out a different game, like Stellaris.   But if you're looking to curl up with a relaxing game on a Sunday afternoon and just have a good time - I'd highly recommend this game.   Especially if you're a fan of the originals.

After today's update I'm glad to see the developers haven't given up hope and are still working on fixing and improving this game.  I hope they continue to improve and add new (desirable) features to the game in the years to come.  With a bit of work and polish this game has the ability to (one day) become THE Master of Orion game.

To be fair, I think the theming is excellent.  I like the stupid robot news anchors.  I love the voice acting.  The graphics are wonderful.  The space combat LOOKS really interesting and fun (gameplay wise it is atrocious though).  The music fits really well.  Each of the alien races have a leader and an advisor, all of which are very interesting and fun (though don't play the bird people, because the advisor is unbearable).  Every race has a set of spies and leaders you can recruit which give you that XCOM feeling of attachment.  I love that each race has its own feel to it, sadly the GAMEPLAY of each race plays almost identical.

The first wrong step for the game was not doing Turn Based combat, every other decision from then on was totally botched.  Trying to fit a real time combat system into a game that was ENTIRELY designed around having turn based combat just didnt work.  Every tech upgrade you could get just felt like getting a +1 to the end of the last technology (or a -1 if you don't pick missles, which are the only worthwhile weapon).  Nothing that you research/trade/steal signficantly changes the way you play the game.  Nothing that your opponents do significantly changes the way you play your game.  Essentially, once you have defeated your first neighbor, the game is over, as its just a repeat of defeating each neighbor until they are all dead.

Another huge misstep was going away from an open universe design with fuel restrictions to limit your ship travel distance.  In this game you are able to map out nearly the entire universe with your very first scout.  There wasn't any mystery as to where something important might be hiding, or what interesting thing you might find on the other side of that alien territory once you defeated them.  After about turn 100 you've seen everything (in a 500ish turn game, depending on universe size).

If only they had hired someone who knows how to make actual turn based games.  Perhaps even hiring someone from the board game industry to iron out some of these obvious problems.  The GAME part of this game is bad.  They tried, they really did - but they either didn't have enough time, or simply didn't have the talent to pull it off.

I would give this game a 3/10.  Wouldn't recommend anyone buy it, even on sale.  I think, if you can stand the oldschool graphics, just buy MOO2 - you won't regret it.",1489794573,1489794573,False,8,0,0.508787333965301514,2,True,False,False

The developers abandoned a relatively big name title that I think everyone was hoping would slowly be patched back to life. Maybe we can hope they're working on a DLC? I'd buy it, strategy games are still mostly niche so I'd rather support them and see if they can fix this game even if it costs more.

Does the game stall for long times between turns? Yes. Are some parts completely broken? Eh, yeah kinda I suppose. Is the realtime combat part a piece of utter shit? YES YES YES IT'S LIKE SOMEONE'S FIRST GAME THEY EVER MADE. It's bizarre and jarring since the rest of the game is so polished visually, and then you have this early access looking thing for ship combat. You have to nurse it as if you're playing League of Legends, constantly clicking the mouse and repeating orders. It sucks because even though you can skip the realtime parts entirely, the automatic calculations aren't in your favor even when you should win a battle, so it's better to do it the realtime way.

One of the complaints I hear the most that is more subtle, is that the game just isn't very strategic. Funny for a strategy game. Well, this is VERY TRUE. It's much more like an arcade game in a strategy game's clothes. The planning and thinking are as shallow as dish water, it's mostly just about gathering up the strength to throw all you can at the enemies, and with mind control letting you steal a planet instantly with one click, a retarded monkey smoking a hookah could beat this game.

BUT ... it's a pretty dang fun arcade game. The news broadcasts are funny, the lines the characters say are filled with cute geek references and stuff like that, and the visual polish feels like watching an animated movie at its best moments. I think the problem is that too many hardcore strategy fans bought this and thought it was bad, but it's more for someone who wants a relatively simple stress-relief game that they don't have to think too hard about when they're playing. It's cheetos, not filet mignon.

So, uh... honestly, for that, I recommend it. It's great to blow off some steam and play something that has the dance moves of a more complicated game but goes easy on you even at the highest difficulty levels. Hah, I just realized something while writing this - you know what it's like? One of those clicker games, like Cookie Clicker and all of those! Just with a bit more structure. You click your way to victory meeting funny characters along the way. Is it worth $30? For the amazing animation quality and beautiful music I say yes, yes it actually is.

Insanely high production values black-sheep game that everyone hated, would play it any time I need something simple and stupid. 10/10 for what it actually is (instead of what it was hyped to be, mostly by the fans). If you can stand the idea without getting angry that someone turned a venerable strategy franchise into a shiny glorified version of Galcon/Dyson/other casual smartphone-style games, yeah, you'll have a nice time.

I truly believe the developers had a vision, but it wasn't one that most people wanted, and so people just labeled it bad because of that. But it's not that they made Master of Orion ""wrong"" to me, it's that they made their own game that does its own thing. Things get reinvented all the time, and I feel like maybe the developers felt there were enough dry and deep 4X games out there, and made a more lighthearted Cartoon Network style one on purpose. The performance issues on computers with slower CPUs probably didn't help either, but if you keep it down to 5 opponents or so and have a recent i7, it's fine. If it's okay for a chess simulator to take a while to decide on a move, it ought to be okay here too.",1489594128,1489594792,True,4,0,0.568634748458862305,1,True,False,False

Sadly, that's not the case. 

As I explored the races and played the game quite thoroughly I found that in the combat aspect, most play pretty much the same as the others. On the economic scale, there are differences. On the colonization aspect, there are differences. But in warfare, which ends up being a significant portion of the gameplay? Almost none.

I began to realize that the given assistants you have aren't as charismatic as the race leaders, and some are down right so annoying with their overly cartoonish actions that I began to avoid specific races.

After trying almost every race, I began to realize the game felt essentially the same. The long campaigns often ended similarly. There was nothing guiding me to different victories. Win or lose, it always happened in the same way.

I thought the game would have new life with its expansion, but I realized after its release that it was essentially content that SHOULD have been in the game from the start, and this might be another case being fed an unfinished game in order to get you to buy the rest of it later.

The initial bundle pack wants you to pay quite a bit for very old previous games and a new race which is even more ""more of the same"" in that it's just humans with a meaner leader and no new ships, technology, etc.

Then I looked to multiplayer. My friends enjoy games similar to this. It could be fun working together or against each other!

The multiplayer is completely gutted, for reasons I don't really understand. Although the team tried to fix some of the issues with the game, this was never anything more than numbers fiddling, and resulted in many people on the forums reporting that the game was virtrually unplayable.

I want to note that I never had an issue monitoring pollution, and thought it was an interesting aspect. But I may not have played it since the last patch.

The multiplayer also lacks actual combat. Your fleets autoresolve their battles off screen.

The combination of poor AI (reportedly going from offering no challenge, as I often experienced, all the way up to utterly unbeatable, with little to no middle ground), lack of combat, and generally poor management pushed me slowly from being super excited about this game to realizing that I was offered something shiny.. but that was just the wrapping, and underneath was a rusted hunk of junk.

I can not strongly enough push the importance of this to you. They made it look good, but only enough to sell the game and keep you playing just long enough that you can't get a refund. By the time you've explored the game, it's too late. They have your money.

IT IS LITERALLY A TRAP.

I held out. I hoped. But it's been 3 months now since the Devs left with out a word. This game is dead and despite its real potential, it will never be allowed to become what it should have been. I'm not angry just at my money lost, but at the potential tossed to the ground. It COULD be SO GOOD. You can see it while you play it... but they won't let it be. And that disrespect to both the customer and the product they themselves created is why they don't deserve your money.

IMO, it is a good buy and game for fans of space-strategy games.  IT is NOT a must play though.

First off, I like that the team pulled on the best parts of MoO 2. Colony management, Galactic diplomacy etc. I really like the new relations bar. far better than the old Cassus beilli in MOO 2. In fact the over all experience was so simmiliar to moo 1 and 2 that i didn't take the tutorial. Yaay! Though I  know that There were new systems that i probably would have a better understanding of if i had. 
Now the stuff that I didn't much care for. If you have played MOO 3. well.. they kept the warp points. I am not a fan of these. I liked how your freedom of movement was limited by your ships' fuel tank tecknology in MOO 1 and 2. (maybe a mod?)

First of all, there's not a lot of information on how the mechanics work.  I guess I'm just used to civ games spoiling me with the civilopedia.  There is nothing like that in this game.  Confused about how pollution works?  Too bad, figure it out yourself.  Want to know what a leader's Disposition skill affects?  Time to Google it!  

There is also no way to broker a peace agreement between two other warring races.  Basically, once they're at war, they will always be at war.  And therefore if you're trying to be nice to everybody, you'll keep getting diplomacy penalties with each of them for deals with the other.  

That's not the only problem with diplomacy.  To trade multiple technologies, you have to use the dropdown menu multiple times to select them.  And it doesn't tell you anything about those technologies, like what they do or how much they cost to research (and therefore how valuable they are).  So you either have to do it blind; or write down what they have and you have on a piece of paper so you can exit out of diplomacy, go consult the tech tree, calculate what you need and what you think is a fair trade, go back to diplomacy, talk to the other leader again and try to work out a deal.  Far too much work and screen switching.  

A similar problem arises with espionage.  Not enough information about the empire you're trying to spy on.  You can try to steal a technology, but why bother if the target race doesn't have a technology you don't have?  How do you find out?  Back to the diplomacy screen again to go through the several steps to reach the trade screen to see if they have any technologies listed for trade.  There's also only a few options available for spies to take.  You can't steal money, only technology.  I found most of my spies to be pretty useless.  I either let them sit at home doing counterepsionage, or sent them off to another race and just let them sit there and hide.  Also, when you detect a foreign spy, you have the options of capture, deport, or kill.  Why would you deport them when you can capture them?  I don't know, there doesn't seem to be any negative diplomatic consequences for one over the other.  Another case where having an in-game lookup for information would have been helpful.  

I personally had a problem with pop-up tooltips.  As in, they wouldn't always show up and I'd have to keep moving my mouse back and forth hoping that they would pop. 

Even if you get them to pop-up, there are places where there is no information that there should be.  Like over the size/biome/resources for a planet.  What are they, how do they affect things?  Can I at least click on them to learn more?  No?  Well, I guess I'm flying blind again.

I didn't really play a military-type game, so I can't comment on the combat.  I tried it out and it seemed stupid and boring, (and, again, suffered from lack of information) so I just used Auto-Resolve for any other battles.  

Planetary management was mildly interesting, but it mostly just involved choosing whether citizens worked on research, food or production; and what the colony was going to build.  

And how about a timer that lets you know when the galactic council is going to meet again?  Don't they schedule these things in advance?  

So to sum up, this game would be a lot better if the developers had spent more time on making sure the player had easy access to the information they need at any given time on any given screen.  The bones of a great game are here, but that's about it.  I was just never able to find the fun.

Edit: Oh, I almost forgot how annoying and unfunny GNN is.  The news scroll at the bottom seems like it might be funny but it scrolls by too fast to read so I have no way to tell.  And most of the time it just pops up to give you useless ""State of the Galaxy"" reports, which show which three races are leading in a particular victory option.  Why is that useless?  Because there is a management page that lists all of the victory conditions and all of the civilizations progress in them all the time.  So...  yeah.

here are the problems: 

1. real time combat just doesn't feel right. You never really know what is going on or if you're going to win.

2. The game gets REALLY slow late game. I'm talking, hit the 'next turn' button and go get a coffee slow. Games literally take  tens of hours where really nothing is happening. It's hard to understand why this is so bad, except that it has to be a complete lack of optimization by the devs. I actually like playing moo2 over this simply because you can play a game in a few hours intead of days. (I have a core i7 with SSD and fast GPU). 

3. Slightly watered down gameplay. Moo2 had a level of randomness that made games really play out differently. This version has some of that but not enough. Pirates are a weak mechanic and not very interesting.

4. The AI. The scourge of modern gaming. It's not good. It can't fight, it has no strategy in terms of fleet positions, it doesn't even seem optimized much on the planet dev side, which is where you'd think some math and perfect knowledge would help. :\

It's really a shame too, so many things in this effort done right. The art direction is a massive leap forward over what's been done on MOO before now. The sounds and vocalizations are enteraining. I'd be willing to overlook all the other problems if it just played faster.

Master of Orion Version 42.6


Game is simple but getting more complex. It is clear on how to progress and upgrade both ships and planets. It is fun building up a empire and crushing a enemys with it. An this game does it well, with out all the head ache of a few other titles.

My previous complaint of the diplomat system has been vastly improved.  As were before the AI refused to back down from a war, even when there was no hope of winning is fixed.  Empires will often bow down and agree to vote for you if you are dominating them.  Tho they do tend to pick a fight over not giving them credits, even if you are the strongest military in the galaxy.  

I was able to maintain a few alliances since patch as well, which is a huge step in the right direction.  My only complaint about the allys is more often than not they don't support you if your attacked.  They break alliance and stay friendly with you, but avoid fighting other enemys.  Atleast until your serval times stronger than the enemy.  Thats when they fall back to the old logic of better not piss the player off our he may very will use my empire to wipe his ass with.

Also with the launch of the new races, I find the new races struggling to match the old races that get a science buff.  Sure you get manufacturing bonus, but its only helpful early on and late game.  Mid game any race with science bonus tends to be vastly supiour to you in tech, which makes your fleets hard press to beat them.  You literally have to friend them or kill them in the first 100 turns our your in for a painful time.

Over all this latest patch has been great.  Diplomat system got a lot better and gameplay became more dynamic with the new races and the creat your own race option.  But game does need some mad race bonus tweaks.

Update: 29 March 2016

Noticed AI now builds ships to counter your designs.  I tend to love rocket boats, but since recent patch they seem to be less effective.  An noticed AI is guarding against missles a lot more with point defense builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cons:

Would definitely be the AI.  Its actions could be improved, and  a better way to barter them down to a agreement would be nice.  Right now it feels like its their way or the highway if they ask for somthing.

Would be nice to be able to make a race a slave race as well instead of just killing them off and loosing thier vote.

An the other problem would be balance of the classes.  I feel the races with science bonus diffently has the advanage past turn 100.

Anyways thats my 2 cents on the game. Differently recommend it in its current state.  Especially if the improvements keep rolling out like this lastest patch.",1458943423,1488572873,True,26,0,0.516410410404205322,0,True,False,False

I also consider MOO3 to be one of the worst PC games ever made.  That said, I find this newest iteration to be a good, but not great game.  I bought it on sale for $14.99 and am quite happy with my purchase.

The Good:

The graphics, soundtrack, and general atmosphere of the game are great.  The dev spent alot of money on the voiceover work and it shows.  The game is quite pretty, and really has a lot of polish.  The game mechanics are solid and fun, and the UI is very functional without getting in the way.  Combat can be underwhelming, but unlike alot of RTS space combat, ship design actually matters quite a bit - which was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, designing ships.  The tech tree is well thought out, and the way the Creative/Uncreative racial trait works is fun and IMHO, better than MOO2.

The Bad:

I had to restart several times in the beginning to get to know what I was doing.  There is a tutorial, but it locked up on me the first time I tried it, and I prefer jumping in with both feet anyway.  There are nagging little bugs also, the UI does funny things sometimes, and late-game the time between turns can get a little long.  Combat is pretty, but the camera needs a couple more modes and some tweaks.  The ""tactical"" side of the tactical combat is a bit weak.  My favorite race, the Elerians were, locked behind DLC which I bought on sale, but those 3 races should have been in the base game  Also a race (the Terrans) and a couple of features are DLC-locked for the collectors edition only - which I didn't buy because I already owned MOO1-3.  

Other:

Be sure to download the manual for the game, I didn't realize it was an option at first and was annoyed at the lack of in-game help.  The game also seems to have a little more of a MOO3 influence than I'd like - starlanes are back, and the Antaran victory condition has a MOO3 feel to it.  However, the classic races are back, including the Mrrshan, and the MOO3-specific races are gone (thank goodness).  

Verdict:

All told, I'm pretty happy with this game.  It's fun, it's pretty, and it's MOO.  There are things that could be better, sure, but it's fairly solid in its own right.  At 14.99 I feel like I got a pretty good deal, and even at full price I think I'd still be happy with it (except the DLC - $5 was ok, but $10 is too much imo).  I'd give the game a 7/10 overall.

However this game is horribly optimized, I have to wait a long time between turns, sometimes minutes.  

I’m very disappointed with the developers taking some of the original races and making them dlc only.  

This game suffers from so many balance issues I had to rely on a community balance mod to fix everything. 

One thing that really makes me hate this game though is that each empire starts out in their own little star cluster/sector gated by worm holes that require a tech really deep into the tree to unlock so you basically spend 100+ turns all by yourself. 

The pollution system that everyone is complaining about would be kind of tolerable if the way new population units are allocated would make sure that they don’t get placed where they would make a ton of pollution.  As it stands if you are using a food rich planet to create a lot of civ transports you will constantly have to micro manage where new population get allocated to keep the planet clean.

The first rush is now gone after roundabout 8 hours of more or less fun (I had to start several times again because there was nearly no introduction, and the advisors suggestions were not really useful) and the errors became more and more substantial arguments to stop playing. 
It's a pitty that the greatest part of the original game (the tactical two-dimensonal round based battle action) is now totally missing.
The idea that this battle goes in real time and in three-dimensonalty doesn't work in the way it was designed here:
The control is silly/buggy, the KI too (another player explained it very good): shooting not the target you advised but all ships on this way. 
And the auto solve is not clever - cause of the bad control I let the PC solve the battle. Nevertheless even with overwhelming forces I lose ships- and the whole rest was unharmed.... not very realistic.


Even if you are attacking an planet with your troops: there isn't any possibility to give commands or even have a animation about the attack. You just see on your or the opponents side how the soldiers disappear.... -Really? Is that all you are able to?!? In the old original game I saw at least little pixle soldiers and tanks running from the left to the right, shooting little projectiles and fighting against the defenders.
Furthermore it isn't possible anymore to transport food from a fertile planet to a mining planet. 
So if I want to get fast enough some population there, I have to build  population carrier in turn. But the turns are getting slower and slower... and my hardware a 1 year old high end gaming laptop, so I was really surprised.

Anyway, this new MOO somehow just works for me. It copies a lot of things from MOO2, but that's not a bad thing. I don't know what the exact reason is, but MOO2 was always more FUN than other space 4X games. For me, at least. I have not played a whole lot yet, but so far it's been a very fun experience.

Also, they didn't just copy the game, they made lots of little changes too. For instance, they switched to star lanes, which I like, because you can no longer just attack the inner planets of an empire, without going through the outer ring first.

If you put too much population into one field, you get diminishing returns, which is a change I especially like. When you take all your nerdy researchers, give them a pickace and tell them to slave away at the new spaceport, it's not exactly efficient. :)

One thing which they both kept and improved is the research system of MOO2. You still have to pick between technologies, which is probably why MOO2 was so awesome in the first place. In this game, there's a baseline of technologies you always get, which is a bit sad, but I guess also makes things easier to balance. Anyway, you still have to make lots of tricky decisions.

On the technical side, I have not had any difficulties , but I've only played a few hours so far. Anyway, it ran for 6 hours without ever crashing, which is a plus. ^^

I've only bought this game now because I read mixed reviews and was burned by MOO3, but now I bought it on a sale and am definitely not regretting it.

I cant recommend this game anymore as looks It has been abandoned by wg and NGD. And its not finished yet. Shameful.


First: It's early access. This is the main consideration if you're going to buy. Its not done yet.

My opinion in short

Very polished and with great future if the devs give the game some love (it's EA, remember). Nice visuals, nice and clear UI and pleasant screens. Combat its Rts. Not done yet, now looks like a placeholder. But with potential.
I liked MOO, MOO2.

This game has a lot of potential.  I think anyone that likes a 4xer will have some fun with this.  Needs a fair bit of polish, but thats what EA is all about.  

-some of the best graphics I've seen in a 4x game (love to see the combat intro of my bada** fleet rolling in).
-35 hrs and I haven't felt the need to turn down the music yet.
-fairly bug free except for ship builder save often while building :)
-get a kick out of the races good look and voice.
-Worf does the narration how sweet is that?
-devs post info on ea phases and plans for the game.  Seems to have the peeps and a plan that will lead to a good finished game.
-loved Moo1 and 2 feels familiar still hate the Darlok:)
-Just one more turn or maybe two...

Wish list 

-more depth in tactical combat (better range control, control over when you fire,  control over special systems) not a movie but felt more like an observer then a fleet commander.
-more info everywhere (biome type stats, weapon mod stats, etc).
-fix broken relationships like equip high energy focus to increase beam weapon dmg but dmg doesn't increase in ship stat pannel.
- more events in the galaxy Antarians anyone? maybe a hyperspace beast?
-AI improvements

Looks like game has been abandoned in a bugy unbalanced state can not recommend.  Very sad.  Better then the mess that was MOO 3 but once again peeps that didn't understand the game tried to improve it.",1462935435,1487634062,False,1,0,0.501510560512542725,0,True,False,False
298050,30059487,76561198106962215,434,7,5096,0,2711,1558788864,"I thought I'd recommend this game in spite of its problems. It does have some, but it's worth getting anyway. If it were 60 dollars, no, but at its current price, it's good value. I'll spend this review going over what's wrong with the game (IMO), and in some cases, how to get around those problems.

Firstly, one issue is how the pollution system works. It IS a problem. Pollution is tied to both production AND population. Larger planets can handle larger populations. But larger planets dont seem to handle higher levels of pollution. The pollution problem doesn't scale with the planet, but the population does. As a result, larger planets become utterly useless for production. Some of my 20 pop planets could only handle 2 pop units on production. The rest had to be placed on research or food. Counter-intuitively, this means that having LESS than max population on a planet actually makes it BETTER for production in some cases.

There are a few solutions to this problem the devs should consider, and one solution already in game. Firstly, one of two things should happen. First, the devs could make pollution not tied to population. Second, and something I like the most, is they could actually make putting pop units on food production REDUCE pollution levels. If your planet is producing pollution because you've maxed out production, you could put some of your research pop units on food to compensate.

I struggled for a long time to get any meaningful ship production out of my empire, particularly because i was researching new buildings faster than I could build them. But with the pollution system the way it was, my bigger planets, which rightfully should be the production powerhouses, couldn't produce much. I made the mistake of choosing the core drill research when I came to it in the tech tree. This made a lot of pollution, and limited me to just 2 pop units on production on most of my fully populated planets, even with all pollution countermeasures built. I later made a trade for the core dump research with another empire... This was a god send. CHOOSE THAT INSTEAD. Even with all the production buildings researched (core drill included), and even with maximum population on production, so long as you build a core dump and the other pollution reducing structures, it ELIMINATES pollution from being a problem. I was pumping out fleets at incredible rate end-game.

Secondly, I'm not a huge fan of the way end-game works. Basically, when you fulfill a certain criteria, the game ends. You can keep playing if you want, but then it feels like there's no point. You can't continue to win in another area (with the exception of domination, where you eradicate all other species). I won my first game on the galactic counsel. I was looking forward to moving on to fighting the Antarens, but once you win in one area (such as the counsel), the antarens dissappear.

This is a missed opprotunity. The counsel president is just an empty title. I was hoping that being elected would give some sort of special power in the galaxy, such as influencing the actions of other empires. I was hoping to use it as a weapon against the Antarens, by unifying the 5 other species against this greater common threat. THAT would've been an epic way to end the game.

I get that the ""criteria"" method is how most games like these judge who ""wins""... But honestly, I think that should be changed, particularly in Master Of Orion's case.

Thirdly, the AI has issues. I discovered one of these issues when I made the mistake of destabilizing an enemy with espionage. I destabalized them a few times, and then asked my ally to go to war with them. A few turns later, after I'd gotten rid of their colonies in my territory (my end goal there), they offered peace, which I took... My ally continued to fight them because they had been so destabilized.

This was at the beginning of the game... By the end, they were STILL FIGHTING. My ally was bent on exterminating an entire species just because I destabilized them over a few colonies. A third species started fighting them too for NO REASON, simply because I had made the mistake of lowering their galactic standing with espionage several hundred turns before that. It made relations and alliances really difficult. My relations with that ally kept dropping because they'd give me an offer to go to war with that species, and I'd refuse. It also hurt my alliance every time I had diplomacy with the species they were at war with... Which was unavoidable since I was trying to get enough votes for the galactic counsel.

By the end of the game, that species was nearly extinct, unintentionally, over a spat about colonies at the very beginning of the game. I was left dumbfounded. There really needs to be a way in the game to broker peace between 2 species. I basically used espionage to break the game, and it made diplomacy a pain all the way till the end. This is just one example of how the AI needs work (though to be fair, this is true of a lot of games like this. Gandhi, anyone?)

Fourthly, I've read that multiplayer doesn't allow tactical combat... Why? I would love for nothing more than to try out the tactical interface against a human opponent. I'd vastly prefer doing that than using auto resolve vs human opponents. That's when tactics could actually matter in the game. In fact, I think the whole tactical interface needs love. There should be more ways in the game, using cunning tactics to defeat bigger opponents.

There's also a method of simultaneous turn taking in multiplayer, which is cool (and would be perfect for the tactical interface). What's uncool about it though is that, if any single player clicks ""next turn"", all other players get a 60 second timer to finish what they're doing before the game finishes their turn.

It seems like a lot of their decisions about multiplayer are driven by wanting to move the game as long as fast as possible... I think wargaming fails to realize that unlike with WOT, strategy players LIKE to take their time, and manage their empire... Or at least, I do. I don't like pressing ""next turn"" without knowing that I've done everything I possibly can in that turn. There should at least be the option to turn on tactical interface (rather than auto resolve), and turn off the 60 second timer in game options.

Fifthly, there's an issue with performance. AI players take a while to take turns, and I've noticed my character desyncing with their audio a lot when talking, because the animation gets stuck. I have a good computer, so I doubt the issue is my end. I hope they work on optimization in future updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know that sounds like a lot of negatives. The reason I recommend it anyway is because despite all of that, I found it very enjoyable. Furthermore, this game supports mods... And if you can name a problem, odds are, someone's made a mod to fix it. Steam workshop does a lot to massively improve the games on steam, and I fully support any game that takes part in that program. It's vital to beta testing and inspiring potential changes, allows players to customize their experience, fix things they see as problems, and makes it easy for the community to interact with a game through mods.

If it weren't for Master of Orion being a part of the workshop, Id hesitate to recommend the game, because of it's problems... But where the price is at, and with the game being extremely customizable with the workshop, it's WELL worth the 30-40 dollars. I never played the original games, so bare that in mind.

The AI gets rather predictable quickly so you do find your self playing the very hard to impossible levels pretty soon. All in all a great strategy game.

Two issues. Why are all the windows incomplete with info that you need? If you are going to choose a planet for a leader, then why can't you see the planet names in the window????  Many windows in the game show only part of the info that you need to make decisions based on the missing info. Just doesnt make sense.

Now the biggy. Terrible planning or forsight makes for triple or more the clicking that you need to use if it was actually thought out.

I would like to point out, however that this is very typical of most software I have used in the 23 years that I have been gaming. Namely the inter face is woefully bad. I find it amazing that you have to constantly click from one side of the screen to the other, back and forth back and forth.

Why can't developers see that if you right click a menu and make choices it is soooo much easier than clicking the upper left, then the next window the lower right and so on and so on through out the entire interface. You wind up opening 3 or 4 windows to do a simple task and all of them require clicking some where else on the screen one time. Very poor planning and probably all in the name of making it colorful and bright. I just don't know why it would be that way.

Also down to the level of deleting saved games for a half hour, clicking on the one save you are allowed to erase at a time, and then to the other side and,.............. well you get it. Never heard of shift buttons?

Besides several bugs ( for example a freeze in the space battle screen, you have to abandon the battle as a solution), the performance makes it unplayable for me. After several turns, of course in a large galaxy with maxed out numbers of NPCs, the time between turns grows up to ten minutes. If you want to change the profession of your population, it often takes up to one minute, to change one unit.
I tried it on two PCs, one is more powerful and has a SSD, and the problems stay the same. ( I didn't use a stop watch so I can't say if it gets like 10% faster. But it's still tediously slow)
I doubt that a real high end PC could handle it, it seems to be a problem of the optimization.

There are also balance issue, especially concerning the AI, but that's partly subjective and a lot got balanced out by the 5x mod.

When the game works this is a noble and fantastic remake of Master of Orion 2. Unfortunately,  the problems I have experienced have occurred many, many hours into the game. The problems have  made completing any game I start impossible so far. From reading the forums the game appears to have other bugs that appear at unpredictable times. 
In my first game, after 400+ turns, I still could not travel through unstable star lanes. This after researching the technology to traverse the lanes. I did report this is a bug but I did not have the time to keep following up with tech support on the issue. In my second game I installed a mod that did not have unstable star lanes. That game was going well although  some turns were taking half an hour to complete. My laptop would also sometimes overheat and freeze between turns. However, my desktop did not lock up. Unfortunately, the mod creator updated the mod this week and now I receive an error trying to load my save games. I manually loaded the old version of the mod and unsubscribed to the newest version of the mod. However, I still cannot load my save games. After 153 hours of play time I have been unable to finish a game due to bugs.  
I see that many others are not having these problems. Maybe I received a bad copy or something else is buggy or not configured on my end. I hope that is the case because the creators did a really great job of modernizing MOO2. However, again, just browsing through the comments there appear to be many bugs that pop up. 
Bugs aside, I stress this is a MOO2 remake. I spent probably over a year of my life playing MOO1 and I have conceded that no one will ever make true remake.  MOO1 had a simple interface using sliders from the main screen that controlled almost everything.  I found that interface much easier for controlling an empire than having to open up each planet individually. This remake does help in that regard by allowing the user to click through planet to planet without going back to the main screen. That is a time saver but I still wish the planets could be controlled in a way similar to Moo1. 
I can nitpick a small book for everything I want to see in the game but I think they did a good job overall recreating MOO2 minus the bugs.  Unfortunately, I do not have the time in my life right now to keep trouble shooting my games.  The really frustrating part is spending two weeks, dozens of hours with several hundred turns getting into the game I cannot complete. Feels like a huge waste of time. 
I am going to wait a few months and to see if any of the upcoming updates solve these issues. My recommendation is not to buy this right now unless you enjoy the possibility of becoming a beta tester.

And in a way it delivers, however a lot of the mechanics feel... unfinished I guess, and the UI at times feels clunky, uncomfortable. 

For example, let's talk starbases. The UI issue was that I had no idea what the attack/defense scores of my starbase was, I had no way to check it until I made it in a battle that the starbase participated in. The mechanics related issue of the starbase was that it was not getting upgraded with my latest (or any for that matter) weaponry that my research had made available to me. Finally, it would also be nice to be able to customize it the way one can customize the (combat only, this is another issue imo) ships.

It kind of fees like it never really left the early access stage. Dont get me wrong, it's a nice game and undeneath all that is a potential classic, but at this moment, it needs work.",1486528293,1486528293,False,3,0,0.495432198047637939,0,True,False,False

Unfotunately for this game it isn't finished and clearly wasn't finished when it was released and there has been MAJOR patches but even then still seeing huge issues and it is primarly optimization.

Turns take too long to calculate - optimization problem.
Beam weapons are trash.  You might as well take them all out of the game as missles are always going to be better.  If you play, look for the ""MIRV"" adjustment on your missle and add that to any missle you're shooting and add the Dauntless missle system + fast Missle Racks to your system adjustments.  It makes for easy conquests.
The game randomly crashes for me.  Not sure why - but it is either on the boot up of the movie if I don't hit ""ESC"" fast enough or it randomly crashes as I start the match.  No idea what is causing that.
Battles begin to take too long as ship sizes increase.  Optimzation problem.
Steam achievements appear to be broken.  You'll notice the 1% global achievement process on all the ""master of orion"" win ""victory types"" - this isn't because people aren't acquiring each version of win.  Why the disconnect?
Antaran homeworld battle is vastly more difficult to acheive a win with than conquest, economic, technology, turns, and diplomacy.  Is that how it is suppose to be?
What does ""Disposition"" do for leader status?  I can't find it anywhere.  There should be a drop down explaining each of the things that leaders offer as to why you want to hire them. 
Leaders need more traits - why only one?  Everyone should have a minimum of two except maybe Klackon (heehee). [ It is because they are uncreative -.-; ]
I think I am done for now playing this.  I'll maybe come back in a half a year and re-review but for now - I'd recommend on ""sale"" for 10 dollars or less but not full price.

I picked it up the day it was released, liked it okay, but was slightly let down as an old time fan of the original series. Then Stellaris happened and I forgot all about this game. Which turned out to work in favor of this reboot for me. Master of Orion operates in a different space than Stellaris for many reasons. Presentation is top notch, and I often find myself lost in the environment. While the game is much more simple than others in the genre, it still presents quite a challenge. Some reviews mention the game crashing at ~500 turns, but i've never experienced anything more than a couple of extra seconds. I enjoy the pace, espeically if you decide to crank up the game speed. All in all i would give it an 8/10. If you enjoy 4x space games, and want something new, I would recommend.

Couple this with incredible voice acting and a diverse race roster and you have a really really fun game.

There are problems though, some of the stronger ships really aren't worth the cost. In a game like Stellaris or Endless Space, the largest ship classes in those games can EASILY destoy several dozen of the smaller weaker ships if they are built correctly, with good upgrades whereas in Master of Orion the stronger ships are only better because they have more slots, they don't have that much more HP than smaller ships to justify the cost, so it's generally better to just mass an absolute shitload of smaller ships with good upgrades, than rush your tech for the ""powerful"" large ships.

For example I built a Doomstar (A thinly veiled Deathstar reference), the largest ship in the game, and even with all of the  most incredibly expensive upgrades I had, with technology that was FAR superior to the enemy, I still lost a battle against only 24 frigates (the second smallest ship class).
That is fucking stupid. And this isn't Star Wars where your Deathstar has a critical weakness butthole that only a small ship could exploit, it's just massive wall of health, and it doesn't do nearly enough damage to justify it's INSANE cost.
Other than the balance issues listed above the game is great, It's only 30 bucks and it's essentially CIV in space. So If you like strategy games with a very streamlined, easy to pickup style, then look no further.

But if your looking for more in depth gameplay, with complex systems and a clusterfuck of a UI, then go play Stellaris or Endless Space(both excellent games).",1486014828,1486014828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The original races are there, with a promise of more to come, but I do wish one could customize a race like Orion 2. Seeing this is an early release, there are surprisingly few issues with it, A few things that need work is that I've not been able to terraform a volcanic planet yet, I hope this comes in future updates. Also, the Guardian is too weak, I beat it with just 4 battleships, losing only one. The guardian should be a lot more powerful. Another thing that would add to the game (and be true to the original if I remember correctly, if that wasn't MoO2) is that once you grow more powerful Orion may launch surprise attacks at any race unbalancing the universe too much. But I really miss the turn-based combats, I hope they will be next to be included.

As of the latest update, if you choose a larger planet than normal you get the gravity penalty to all production, halving food, production and science. The penalty is too big to compensate for the late game profit of having a large or huge planet. This is reason enough to change the rating from positive to negative, since the starting planet (even by biologial reasoning) should always be considered normal gravity, with no exceptions; after all that is the gravity the race you choose is used to.

Another update is that custom races are available, but cannot be saved, still a miss from the developers. And finally, older games cannot be replayed or continued, so there's no backward compatibility between game versions.

With the laterst updates I'm starting to question de competence of the game designers, and whether they should be replaced... after all the last updates made the game so much worse that the rating changed from positive to negative, and I'm considering a refund. In any case, I will change my review on other sites to ""do not buy"" now.

After going commercial there are some improvements, however, the perks ""huge starting planet"" and ""heavy gravity"" still need to be merged. This is a very stupid thought that these are separate, I cannot think of one reason a race with a huge home world would have a grvity penalty; huge world=high gravity, no discussion possible, so that still needs fixing. Whomever had these two separated should be fired for an utter lack of intelligence and understanding of physics. There are a lot of better ways to fix that imbvalance that causes, and it is more efficient as well, just contact me for details (and credits of course)

Then there is another issue, which is actually a big fail on the side of the devs: if defending your planets, all ships should have a possibility to place, at any point on the map. No auto-placement, but ANY point. After all, yau are defending, and can deploy forces wherever you see fit. Especially with Antaran attacks, you have 5 turns warning, so REMOVE the FCKN aout-placement, and allow full tactical deployment of ships on the map. This is evidence of hiding poor AI programming, and that the devs are essentially incompetent to provide proper AI.

Later updates of the game have corrected the gravity issue, however it is now most useful to start with a low gravity small homeworld with a 50% production boost and more points wherever you need. These devs seem to utterly fail to grasp the concept of balance, even in a relatively simple game like this, and I am sorry to say my negative review remains negative. What I fail to grasp is that a (presumably) intelligent team can come up with this type of poor balance of the game. Perhaps they should fire some game designers and hire some from Blizzard. At least they get balance a lot better done than these clowns. And I HATE clowns.",1457215686,1485477971,False,1,0,0.520905971527099609,0,True,False,False

I've been a long time fans of the Master of Orion series. Imagine my excitement when I read about a remake ([i]reboot[/i] ?) of the first game of the series.

After playing the game for a while, here are some things I like or dislike about this game (at least so far):


Likes:

- MUCH better graphics than the original game. :D 
- Still have the same feelings of the original game's game play, despite some bugs and improvements.
- Mods! Updates! DLCs! Oh my.. (Etherians and/or Harvesters, anyone?)
- Have I mentioned better graphics?


Dislikes:

- Terran Khanates [i]must[/i] be bought as a DLC, if you want to play them.. :( Then again, they're just a variant of the human race anyway, so for me it's a minor inconvenience than a major setback.
- Bugs? Nothing major that I have encountered so far though.. can't say the same about others though..
- No tactical ship battles like in the original game.. :( oh well.. I suppose I can live with it..
- Can't think of anything else at the mo.. hopefully nothing more will come up.. :/

After first buying the game it wouldn't run for me.. everytime, after like 20 turns the game would freeze for good, same with a loaded save game. A month later, this has been fixed. I can now play the game overall, but it remains glitchy:
- ships in combat don't react to commands
- combat map view jumps eratic and randomly (flickers)
- combat freezes and is impossible to continue
- tactical combat freezes and own ships turn invulnerable (nice but... uhm...a bit boring?)
- CPU overheats, coolers run at 100%, PC shuts down (never got above 30% even current top 3D games like Star Citizen)
- random crashes to desktop.
- autosave failing

also i don't like some very basic usability choices such as not being able to save a custom race and having to redo it, or not being able to select your race color. Ships looks not being reflected in build menu is a bit irritating. 

I won't go much into the good aspects that are there, as I've been a fan of the original MOO - and while a lot of that spirit is still here, I fail to see great new ideas. I'm afraid the original is actually better than this one. This too might be an enjoyable game eventually - but it feels simplified as compared to the original and there's a lot of work on stability yet to be done.

However, at least in this current patch, the game is numerically slightly imbalanced. The rate at which enemy civilizations can accrue vast armies whilst maintaining strong infrastructure is simply too fast even at low difficulties such as Easy and Normal. At its heart, I believe the reason for this to be that population is weighted too heavily in terms of its utility in the early game. Because a fast population growth is essential for Research, Production and Expansion, civilizations that should be able to go aggressive early are hamstrung into playing extremely conservative, base-building strategies because their homeworld has a biome unfit for growth (looking at you, Mrrshan...). Despite this, the game has enough positive qualities that I would happily recommend it to a friend. I'd just advise staying clear of playing Mrrshan as a new player until the game has undergone some balance adjustments.

And yet...  not quite.
The ship graphics are lacking.  Each ship class only has two choices for it's appearance.  (standard and optional).
And.. if you sellect the optional version - most of the time it still shows as the standard (icon / map)

Most of the advisors are intentionally aweful.  This is cute the first time - but grows weary.

Antarans attack the same planet repeatedly, and are always a match for your biggest fleet - so there is NEVER any getting ahead.  It should be possible to out pace them - but the game is set up so that is impossible.  I find myself just turning them off.  (then.. I use to do that for MOOII as well).

And moving fleets takes forever and a day.  You can't ever really have good fleet battles because it takes half a bleeding game just to move your ships into place.

Monsters use to protect great planets - worth the effort.  Now they haunt random systems, and most of the time just get in the way.

It's no Homeworld when it comes to tactical real-time combat, but at least they tried instead of shoving in autoresolve and calling it a day.
It's no MoO 2 when it comes to be the untarnished, shining image of literal perfection that will absolutely never be surpassed, but not being perfect doesn't equal being a bad game.

It has a certain charm of its own, the late game tedium is kept to a minimum and, somewhat unusually for a Wargaming title, there seems to have been some actual, rational thought put into the UI this time around.
Most importantly, its developers [i]care[/i]. Patches are rolled out at regular intervals and include new content in addition to bug fixes. Community feedback is considered and acted upon - many of the early grievances, such as spies, pollution and leaders were corrected. The DLC, while priced perhaps a little too steeply, does not contain anything essential to enjoying the core gameplay to its fullest extent.

It could still use some polish. Tactical combat needs to be introduced into MP first and heavily rebalanced second, as the current go-to strategy is ""MIRV missiles, loads of 'em"". Racial traits could use some work. The manual needs to be updated to account for new mechanics. A little more variety in anomalies and random events wouldn't hurt.

Still, as of now, MoO 2k16 is a perfectly adequate, enjoyable and accessible game well worth its price.

I still recommend this to new fans of the series as well as fans of the classics.  If I had to rank them, 1st place goes to MOO2, 2nd - MOO1, 3rd, MOO (this title) and lastly MOO3.  No shame in coming in 3rd to 2 titles that made PC Gamer's Hall of Fame ages ago. 
After a few updates, MOO has heroes, as well as Gnolam, Elerian, and Trilarian (sp?...I've been playing the series for more than 20 years and I can't spell for beans).  It's beginning to remind me of MOO2, which is one of my all time favorite games, period (Where have you gone, Steve Barcia?!  Any chance Agents of Justice will ever get done?)

I played MOO1 back around....94?  And loved MOO2.  This is neither, but, still very fun!
I got this early access, and have played through the present build and liked the character that has been added to the game, but, the repetition wears a little thin.  A little.  There is still something very gratifying about amassing a huge fleet and wiping the Galaxy clean of your enemies.
Ship design was much simpler and intuitive in the original titles, and I think it could use some more polish as the auto-updating gets a little cross-eyed when you get a new tech.  The auto-design doesn't know how to use specials, particular the space-saving ones that can really make for a powerful, albeit slightly longer to produce, ship.
So, you'll want to get in the habit of micromanaging this.
Tactical combat is simple...not bad.  I tend not to interfere with auto-combat too often except when it's an advantage to take out harder hitting/high value targets first. 
That being said, graphics are decent, and gameplay is fun.
I think a little more polish with the UI and UX.  

Here's what I liked:
-Graphics aren't world-renowned, nor is the voice acting, but....they're good!  There are a finite amount of lines of spoken dialogue so that does kinda wear thin after a while (see 'What I didn't like').
-The races really have a lot of personallity.  I am going to do a bad job describing this, but it's a jes ne se qua.  Every game I play I always seem to step on the toes of a different race, but become very close allies with other races; this has kept it very interesting for me!
-Ship Design (I'll put this one in both categories for different reasons).  It's easy, it's intuitive, it can and probably should be time-consuming and full of micromanagement.  It can make a difference depending on which race, or which space monster, or what *type* of warfare you are conducting (swarms of lots of little ships, massive machines of war, or, my favorite, Interdictor type ""Hunter-Killers"" geared at chasing my prey like Hounds of Hell throughout the galaxy.)

Here's what I didn't like so much:
-Things do get repetative.  The dialogue from your advisor and AI races.  The gameplay.  The colony micromanagement.  You learn to tune some of it out.  And, I might be deranged, but I actually enjoy micromanaging my colonies, but I'm aware that others probably will not enjoy this.
-Ship Design.  As mentioned above, the simplest solution would be to let the game mechanism add new tech automatically, auto-upgrade your fleet, Upgrade, or Scrap-and-rebuild to newer designs.  That's fine and dandy, but the auto-upgrade skips some very important Special Techs.

Master of Orion is the turn based strategy game that has you up light murmuring, ""just one more turn."" The interface is simple and most commands are intuitive, making it easy to govern your space faring civiliation. Where graphics is the most obvious improvement over the originals, the primary innovation rests in three areas: research, espionage, and combat. 

Research is simple and not nearly as punishing as in the past. In former games, you would research only a single tech from a category and then move on (unless you had the creative trait). Now you ae only occasionally faced with that choice (thus curbing creative). Instead you are choosing research based both on what it gives you now, but also what it may unlock in the branching and twining tech tree.

Espionage now feels like its own minigame, where spies gain experience and go on specific missions to help you achieve your goals, rather than just charging into the enemy state and flipping desks for enemy research or propaganda. It at least feels like a vital part of the game now instead of something bolted on.

Combat is not as user friendly as the game's namesake. It is closer to MOO3 with a three dimensional map that has shipps rushing towards each other in defiance of logic and tactics. It sure looks pretty though.",1484022759,1484066425,True,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

People speak of the original MOO like it was some kind of videogame Messiah and many game mechanics that 4X games take for granted these days can supposedly be traced back to this series in some way. So does this remake hold up?

The gameplay is your usual space 4X. You start off with a single planet and a few ships and from those humble beginnings you must forge an empire and then decide how you want to conquer the galaxy. This can be through peaceful means like science and diplomacy or you can just decide to blow everyone up with space lasers. The presentation is great with the stars, planets and fleets all beautiful and shiny. The alien leaders look great too with some well known voice actors. Ever wanted to be shouted at by a birdman voiced by Mark Hamill? Your wish is granted.

Many have criticised the game for oversimplified mechanics and they're not entirely wrong. The game seems to lack depth compared to other games like Civilization and never quite pulls off the 'Oh crap it's 3am' kind of immersion you usually get with a 4X. It's still entertaining however and I'll play it when I want a more relaxed strategy game, and it could be perfect for introducing someone to the genre.

After playing 80+ hours in this game I'm changing my review from positive to negative. Since many people are complaining about DLC is not given for free, game not that ""good"" as original MOO1 or 2, or some minor things most players are do not care about... to those I just want to say: You guys making things even worse. By killing game with worthless negative reviews you won't do any good except stop or slowdown development process. No one in the right mind will continue to invest money in development of the game that continuously rated negative by gamers community. Any game is a product and any product created to get a profit. 
However, despite my attempt to shield the game from negative reviews I have to give negative rating to this game myself. Unfortunately 80 hours of in-game experience reveled overwhelmed number of issues. I just can not recommend something that simply does not work and annoy me instead of helping relax and enjoy spent time. From top of my memory:
[list]
    [*] After 500+ turns game simply becomes unplayable. There is untold rule that most players seems to be aware of: more time spent slower game becomes. In my experience after 650 turns game starting crashing every next dozen turns.
    [*] On macOS there is no way to switch back to the Desktop without quitting game first. This leads to another problem: If game becomes non responsive (happens quite often) user has only one option - hard reboot of the system.
    [*] I personally see no difference of enemy AI behaviour between Normal and Hard game difficulty levels. But generally everything what AI controls is source of annoyance. Your scouts on auto-explore will fly right to the system with pirate/enemy ships. While your empire has negative income auto-build on your planets will build structures that requires maintenance fee instead of concentrating on producing income or build structures that generates income, so you just go and manually change production on every planet you control. I think everything that ""auto-"" do something should be designed in the way to help user avoid repeatable actions and let concentrate on the fun part only correcting ""autopilot"" in rare cases. For those who likes to tune everything manually ""autopilot"" is not needed at all.
    [*] Game mechanics very similar to game called Civilization specially in parts where you deal with other races. But if you copy other's game mechanics why not get everything right? There is no option to counteroffer proposal. You or accept nonsense offer AI proposing, or decline and worsen your relations. You can trade with AI while being in war through contacting race by offering to exchange captured spy. Why you actually can't trade all the captured enemy spies from same race at once? 
    [*] Oh, and most annoying thing: In some cases your ships just being attacked by AI without declaring war to you before and after the attack. You can also do the same thing and sometimes it work sometimes it doesn't, but if this is by design why not to sent some explanation to the player in form of notification e.g. ""Your ship just being destroyed because you're on other race territory, relations with race just gotten worse"". Being Engineer myself I can give advice: if something needs additional explanation it's not that good.
    [*] There is so much more and so much more to come, probably due to game releases not being properly tested or wrong priories are set.
[/list]
...and give one or two DLCs for free for those who paid for this game 60 bucks or something, you can send them redemption code to settle everything right.",1483838754,1483919172,False,14,0,0.489527285099029541,0,True,False,False
298050,28887512,76561198030998467,0,2,1569,0,1569,1483378745,"About the bad reviews:
[olist]
[*] Many bad reviews are from persons who wanted this game to give them the same feelings they had playing the orginal Master of Orion twenty-three years ago and/or Master of Orion 2 twenty years ago.  If you are wise, you know trying to relive the past is a fool's errand.
[*] Some complaints in old reviews have been subsequently been addressed by the developer.  For example, the addition of leaders and minor civilizations, and updated espionage and polution management.
[*] Complaints about publisher funding continued development of the game through DLC are just plain foolish as they ignore the question: Does the base game provide a complete experience without any DLC?  Yes, it does.
[/olist]
The leader animations and voice acting are outstanding - some of the best in any 4x game released to date.  The other visuals, music, sound effects are excellent.

The user interface is well designed and easy to navigate with mouse and keyboard.  Most icons have tooltips and it's rare you have to drill down for the information you need.

Gameplay (the important stuff):
[list]
[*] Overall gameplay is a little simpler on average than 4x games such as Galactic Civilizations 2, Endless Space, Civilization 5, and Endless Legend. This allows Master of Orion to be more approachable, but there is depth for vetern players who choose to micromanage and min/max certain aspects of the game.  More on this below.
[*] Races: You can build a custom race superior to the built-in races if you design it to fit your playstyle.
[*] Reserach: The tech tree is laid out in a traditional horizontal scolling Civilization format, except that many nodes force a choice between two advancments.  While not ground breaking, it's satisfying and allows for different choices on each play through.  Too many nodes focus on military, and not enough advance infrastructure.
[*] Colony: You can micromanage population assignments and build queues in each colony or automate it by setting a colony focus and turning on autobuild.
[*] Ships: As you research new military techs you can choose to automatically update ship blueprints or completely customize the weapon, defense, engine and special equipment loadouts of each design.
[*] Battle: You decide how involved you want to be in battles and how fast you want them to resolve.  For the best result in a close match, you can take control RTS style and command each ship individually.  If you like to enter battle with overwhelming force, you can let the computer call the shots and watch the carnage play out or simply auto-resolve and go back to managing your empire.
[*] AI/Diplomacy: No 4x game has satisfying AI opponents, and Master of Orion is no exception.  But the AI is not erratic - most decisions fit the goals they are pursuing - and there is transparency in that mousing over an opponent's disposition bar shows the factors contributing to their relations with you.  One exception - the Meklar - can be erratic; however, since the word is part of their race description, it may be by design.
[*] Minor Civilizations can have a significant impact.  They don't spread from their home planet, but offer bonuses to other planets you colonize in their system if you pay to influence them.  For example, I colonized two planets in a system with a minor civilization specializing in farming.  These planets quickly became my fastest growing as the minor civ provided all the food they needed while they focused on resesarch and production.
[*] Trade: Sadly, almost non-existant.  You can establish highly profitable trade treaties with other civiliations, but there are no trade ships plying the star lines.
[*] Random events, such as space monsters, and periods of research or economic boom or bust, seem to be direct copies from MOO2.  Artifacts spread through the galaxy can be investiaged by your ships, but so far these have mundane results, earning a few credits or a random ship.
[*] The timeline graph found in many 4x games, to show your progress in comparison to other civilizations, has a very cool feature in Master of Orion.  You can use it to go back to any turn in the game.  Made a huge mistake and forgot to save?  No problem, click any turn on the timeline to start again from that point.
[/list]
For almost a year now, the developer has deployed patches every two weeks on average, including fixes, balance changes, and free new content.  That is an outstanding level of continued support and development.

I read the reviews and stayed away from this game for the longest time because of peoples' complaints. However, after playing through a few rounds I feel that some of the negative reviews were completely unjustified.

One of the common complaints was the addition of warp points, since the old games allowed you to fly around the map at will. In some ways I miss the old system, but seeing how other games have gone this way I can understand it. If you’re looking for examples look at Sins of a Solar Empire and Endless Space. Both games are fantastic and they use warp points, jump points, hyper points, whatever you want to call them. A lot of hard military science fiction uses jump points in them, usually because it’s suggested that gravity plays a role in how ships are able to move between star systems (see The Lost Fleet books) or there’s gravitic waves between them (see the Honor Harrington books).

The ship design system can be a little annoying at times. Namely the auto-upgrade for your blueprints can oftentimes take a weapon off that you really want to keep and replace it with a newer one that sometimes reduces your DPS! You have to be mindful of this as you’re designing your ships. Yes, I know, this seems like an unnecessary step but you could just skip the auto-upgrade and use your best judgment.

One thing I will agree with other reviewers on here is the need for DLC. I simply can’t believe how the gaming industry is going this way. Everything is coming down to micro transactions nowadays. It’s horrible. In order to experience the “full” game you have to pay additional money for something that should’ve been included to begin with? Bull****! The developers did this with the Elerians, Gnolams, Trilarians, and the Terran Khanate. In addition the developers made an unforgivable sin in my book, packaging the Khanate into a “Collector’s Edition” that included Master of Orion I, II and III for an exclusive price.

I can’t justify paying that. Not when I was able to download Master of Orion I and II from www.gog.com for a lot cheaper and both still play on Windows 10 through their system! Although, to be fair, Master of Orion I looks absolutely terrible when stacked against Master of Orion II.

The industry is going this way with DLC and will continue to do so as long as we the People are willing to go along with their shenanigans. It’s either they nickel and dime us that way or they get us with “early release” versions (see beta versions) or pre-ordering.  I for one won’t pre-order most games because I know that buyer’s remorse may be just around the bend. I’ll wait until reviews come out before I buy a game. The only company that has my trust for pre-ordering is Blizzard, and that’s because they consistently make a good product every time.  Say what you will about Diablo III or World of Warcraft, but both have been solid products since their beginnings and I trust Blizzard to continue delivering solid products.

It will take we the People to stand up and say, ""No more DLC!"" for the industry to change their ways. But as long as gamers (who are supposed to be the most unforgiving people on the planet) are will to go along with the industry's ways they'll keep right on doing it.",1483848419,1483848419,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The major difference is that combat is real-time rather than turn-based (though through strategic pausing and direction of ships this can be somewhat simulated).  Gameplay and ship design also have been steamlined a bit so you don't have to spead so much time micro-managing things (which could be a plus or minus depending on whether you you enjoy complexity or not).  Mostly the overall game experience is very much like playing MOO2, which is also an excellent game despite it's age.

Overall I don't have any major complaints about what overall is a really good game. The worst thing I can think of is that ""Heavy Gravity Homeworld"" is a 4 point ""advantage"" when it no longer allows you to settle the much more numerous normal gravity planets without a penalty (For obvious reasons, the Bulrathi are one of the worst races to play because of this), which all things considered is a fairly minor complaint.",1483824503,1483824503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is actually a rather plesant slimed down Turn-Based Strat game, so for those who want a Sci-Fi version of Tottal War, but with a more basic aproach then this is an ideal game for you. If you want something intensely complicated and in-depth then this is a game to make a pass on and take a look at Stelaris instead.

I found myself drawn into the more minor characteristics of the game rather than the main mechanics. For one, I have to say the character visualizations in diplomacy is extremely well done, and the All-Star voice acting cast is much more of a draw for me than I anticipted. Combined, this made the diplomacy/narritive more engaging than typical games. With that said, this is the RARE strategy game that has a half-decent diplomacy system! Negociations are in general what one can expect, but I wish they would use my captured spies as bargining chips rather than just kill them. On that note, the spycraft for the game is somewhat basic, but still functional enough to make it a valid component of the game, but spycraft is a hard fit for this genra to balance out appropriately.

The combat system is one of the best parts of the game I find. I love the aspect that you can have a hybrid system where the AI takes over the multitasking functions while you can focus on a single task (or stack tasks via pause function). The combat visualizations are somewhat generic, but the gameplay itself is very solid. I find myself confident in my ability to command, but there is always still that edge of if I developed my fleet for the right task (where as some games its so imbalanced you can spam 1-2 units and call it a day).

Lastly, for those who are running a less than top-teir computers, this game is more lightweight (at least from my perspective) than other high-CPU demanding games.

All in all, this is a very good buy for the sci-fi gamer or the TBS type gamer. A must have for those who love both.",1483499701,1483499701,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I have played this game for a bit now and I can honostly say, I got bored quite quick.. I love 4x games, from CiV to Sins of a Solar Empire to Gal 3  and of course Stellaris.

When I play this game I am waiting more then I am doing things, exploring, the fun of it goes away quite quick because there is barely any random events going, you just go by planet to planet, checking if a nice one is in there to settle on and then move on to the next.

The AI, I don't know if it is good or bad, I honostly dont have much interraction with them, the trading and stuff is okay, they dont demand insane things, but hey arent very intersting either, dont seem to have much of a personallity going.

While the races all have perks, they still dont really change the way I play them, I can't really put my finger on it but it seems like its just very lineair, one dimensional ? 

The music, voice over and UI are good though, for sure. 

Overall, for 4x, with depth and challenge and random generated events, this is not the 4x game to choose from, there are a lot better ones out there.

Pros:

-Good voice acting (even so, money spent on better things..)
-Feels like master of orion universe.
-UI not terrible.
-*Space combat looks good (needs to be fleshed out)
-Multiplayer
-Ship design and upgrade system. (needs to be able to upgrade with production not just money.)

Cons:

-Races dont seem to be too unique. (customization to come?)
-Starlanes. Give me free movnment. (Why? just why? Even with endgame tech galaxy movnment is slow and a chore.)
-AI too easy, Should be improved later in EA. Better in Release but not great.
-Turn limit (500 Turns really? I dont want game to end before I meet victory conditions or exterminate everyone.) *fixed in latest patch with victory condition additions.
-*Space Combat need to be improved. The realtime combat is not that bad but the need to actuallty control your ships needs to be included. Currently a ""Disable AI"" button is not functional so you ships just charge in and do what they want. *Was improved but still feels off.

Wells thats my limited take on MOO so far. Hopefully improvnments will be made in before the full release. Should you buy it? Only if you go in not expected a MOO1 or MOO2.

On the other hand I loved the atmosphere, the voiceacting and the music are great, graphics are nice, so overall, it was a nice game and I played for the sake of my memories of the good old games of my young adulthood.

Then I saw three new races and wanted to give this another go - maybe the game would be ""ready"" now and the combat would feel like I have an actual impact on the outcome?

But NO! I Have to pay for it! I already payed 40 Euros for an unfinished game, because I loved the old Games, but I wont support this stupid milking policies the gaming industries are constantly doing any more. And I recommed You and every other customer out there should do the same.

While there are differences, the game does re-kindle my enjoyment of MOO 1 & 2. Fortunately with the new support system, there are no more 100+ ship battles to drag on for ever... I'm happy about that but, I understand if others are not.

HOWEVER... Do not buy this game...  It is very buggy. For that reason alone I can not recommend it., If that ever changes I will update this.

There are some major bugs in this game. And the ones affecting me are not apparent until mid to late game. Somewhere around turn 300-350 I will get a game crash after none in the early turns. I restart the game, load up a save and play... then I will get another crash in 5-20 turns later and they start increasing in frequency. Eventually, I will get a crash somewhere that repeats itself even after a fresh start/load game. I rarely make it past turn 400... and I have not been able to play a single game to turn 500... ever. IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO SPEND THE TIME BUILDING UP A GAME ONLY TO NOT BE ABLE TO FINISH IT. Only 2 games out of at least 2 dozen have I been able to actually win... 1 economic, and 1 scientific., But I turned those options of so that I can win by domination and it always bugs out before I can finish.

The crash either goes straight to desktop or it builds up memory usage to 12GB slowing down my system before the inevitable crash. Sometimes it is on the diplomacy screen, or the system map... its random... (Though I have save games that will constantly crash in the same exact spot.) I have reported it through the in-game interface, but no real acknowledgement. I have tried running smaller galaxies and lowering my graphics to the minimum and neither help at all,

I had to stop playing because the game ending crashes were too frustrating... Hopefully they will fix it in the future... but I am not holding my breath. Until then I wasted my $30 already... hopefully this review will stop others from wasting their hard earned cash as well.

UPDATE Dec 31, 2016...  
Well the bug that was causing me problems *might* have been fixed... There was a buffer overflow bug fixed in patch 51.2 released on Nov 1st. However that same patch introduced a new bug that wouldn't even let me load the main menu; the game crashed constantly before the menu would load.

The main menu bug was finally fixed for me in release 54.7; 6 weeks later on Dec 7th. However, the graphics glitch was worse and the UI makes it unplayable. (example here: http://imgur.com/a/PWrhO )

The worse thing is that they seem to never read the forums here... not even support... even on topics they start. The main menu bug in particular was reported by multiple users many times and they never even acknowledged the problem. (even though it made the game unplayable for over a month.) People commented in the release notification thread, there were 2 main threads in the support area, a ""known issues"" thread had comments about it, and a few in the general discussion area. As I said... not a single acknowledgement that the bug even existed until over a month later when it was fixed.

People have complained about them still changing the gameplay now since release... I wish I could even comment... with all the bugs I have not been able to play a single game in over 2 months, and I still only won the 2 initial games despite trying many times.

And for the record... this is the vanilla game, I have not used any mods. With all the problems I have had, I have used steam to check the integrity of the game files as well, and they have always been verified.

They are now selling DLC packs... It would be nice if they fixed their game before they try to grab more money.

At this point, with all the bugs (and there are a lot of them), when every update changes the mechanics and adds brand new bugs, the lack of developer response, or anyone in the forums, (even a simple acknowledgement from someone in the company... doesn't need to be an actual dev,) I can not and will not ever change my recommendation to avoid this game.

TLDR, still no tactical combat option, the whole pollution mechanic is a major fun-killer, and the 'warp lanes' choice has really made it less than satisfying experience overall.  My EA recommendation is being changed now to a NO.  It's not a bad game.  It's just not MoO w/o at least a turn-based tactical combat option.  And, it's a simplistic 4x compared w/ so many others today.  The graphics and voices were great.  I'm not even upset about DLC races.  But, it's NOT MoO.  It's a MoO-basic.  I'll pass at this point.

EA Review:

So many good things about this game so far.  It is definitely early access--reduced races, weak AI (only average is available at this point), typical diplomacy issues for civ games (not clear there's the threat of war if you don't accept an offer, etc.), and similar minor issues.  But the game plays well so far and is true to the genre.  It's GalCiv w/ better graphics and smoother gameplay--but warp points and paths instead of freeform movement.  It's a different approach.  You can certainly better limit access to your homeworlds--but, you don't have the constant feel of threat either.

I haven't found a ship design feature--and that's good, b/c the game is more 4x, less tweaking your loadout on each vessel.  Again, it's a different approach, and this one I prefer b/c the races that exist and ship designs are very cool and just as I pictured from the MOO past.

The voice overs are fabulous.  The graphics are very nice.  Sound is nice.

My only real complaint at this point is an RTS approach to combat instead of Turnbased as in MOO2.  For me, this is a real disappointment.  It isn't a 'No' at this point--there is still hope they'll add it before release, or promise it as an expansion option or dlc.  But, it isn't MOO2.  It isn't even a good RTS--even w/ a pause feature.  I find myself auto-resolving all combats b/c of it (i.e., 'Simulate' instead of 'Tactical').  That really makes it a different take on GalCiv III instead of MOO.

Good game so far.  But, wait for 3 months until it releases if Turn-based combat is a big deal to you.

I would have to say that the combat isn't very intuitive. I spent the first game thinking the combat was always automatic.

Cons:
-split tech choice descisions can be vague

This is a more straightfoward 4x compared to most 4x games, but i like it because its not overwelmingly complex. I unfortunately missed the original MOO 1-3, but i like the base game enough to get the collectors edition upgrade so i can enjoy the orignals. the only thing im not too impressed about the CE is the Terrans ships are just reskinned red of the human faction ship models.  Tactical combat is fun, but at first it feels way too fast but there are speed options and pause if needed. I really wish there was more than 2 variations of ship models per frigate, destroyer, etc. as there isnt a actual ship builder like GalCiv 3, but mods can fill the lack of variations. 

there are some tactical options in combat, such as dodging enemy missiles/fire by hidding behind asteroids, but for the most part fleet engagements are really determined by the quality of your weapos/defenses and a combination of ship numbers or higher quality ships. Starllanes are cool in that they help funnel fleet engaements, which can be very helpful for the AI because there is only a few directions where they can attack you, which in turn forces head on battles and really cuts out the cat and mouse other unrestricted 4x games have.

Empire/colony management is very easy, and so is the pollution and gravity mechanics; you can leave it on autopilot, but you really should manage all pop assignments and production choices to get the most out of it. There are some UI annoyances, like when adding a modification to a weapon, such as making your missiles hardened to resist point defense. The tooltip says the weapon will take 50% more of its base space on your hull, but the weapon card will only show the base vanilla space cost; forcing you to do the calculations your self. Some tech descriptions on the tech tree were cut off on the top of my screen, its little UI stuff like that that can be annoying, but its all minor.

I definety recommend this as a rts and a 4x fan.

Got this game a few days ago at a christmas discount and had good fun with it, making my own little space empires but in the end the AI can't put up a fight, which ultimately gives the game little challenge. 

My playthroughs:
I first went into the tutorial and got the game explained to me, but the game was so easy I thought it must be set to a low difficulty setting for the tutorial. I restarted on normal difficulty, but after easily bumrushing my nearest neighbour I restarted on the very hard difficulty and downloaded a balance mod (yay modding!). While the other races put up a bit of a fight in the opening moves of the game, by the mid-game I had a fleet that could crush anything thrown against it, mostly because I had super-large ships, while the enemy was still toying around with flea-sized ships. By then I realised that the game is wonderfully worked out and a good fun space empire sim, but the AI is simply too weak to keep up with an intelligent human player, even if the difficulty setting gives them a resource advantage. This is a pity and ultimately what turns me away from the game, but before I got there I spent a decent amount of hours playing. Looking back, I got value for my money, so this game gets a thumbs up from me.

The good:
Good voiceacting (they really went all-in on the famous actors).
Distinct races.
Lots of empire-building fun.
Active devs (so there's hope for the future!)

The bad:
Poor AI: This is what cripples the game currently for me. The AI can't put up a decent fight, spitting out little ships and measly fleets mid-endgame while my fleet has multiple titans, each of which is capable of wiping out the enemy single-handedly. But it also extends into diplomacy (really bad trades), ship customization and empire expansion. The AI is just not up to the task.

Verdict:
I enjoyed my little space-empire building frenzy. Sure, the AI couldn't put up much of a fight, but I had fun exploring and empire-building and fighting huge space-monsters. I got value for my money (game was discounted) and if you have run out of games to play and nothing new is on the horizon, you can pick up this game to fill the gap. It's not the best, but it's good fun for a while.

===============================

Master of Orion benefits from good game setup options, a clean, useable interface, automation options to reduce micromanagement, and a turn-by-turn notification system that helps in keeping track of colony development. The new 'Timeline' system enables you to review your progress and reload previous turns to change strategy and rectify missteps. For the most part, the interface on every menu screen is sharp, clean, and efficient, giving you all the info you need with no clutter. Diplomacy is clear and intuitive, providing clear, real-time feedback on how each response affects your relationships. The designs for each race have been updated perfectly, while mirroring the original Master of Orion aesthetics, and each has a distinct and engaging personality, enhanced by top-notch voice acting. Espionage mirrors the classic Master of Orion setup, giving you complete control over how to use your agents. Revenge of Antares switches agent recruitment from auto to manual, adding hiring and maintenance costs for each spy. The expansion adds the three races added in Master of Orion II - Elerians, Trilarians, and Gnolams, all of which have been well-updated to match the quality of the rest of the species in the game. Ship design and real-time combat work well, though there are still only a few options for modifying your ships' appearance. 

The game still suffers from the same clunky economic model, expensive short-term trade treaties, impossibly expensive research treaties, lack of freighters, and high facility maintenance costs. Random events are more often annoying than helpful, and the game's exploration still suffers from lack of range limitations and sparseness of anomalies. Pollution can no longer be removed manually, instead decreasing gradually over time based on each planet's threshold, which can be raised by building pollution control facilities. 

Leaders have made a return appearance, though they're generated in specific quanities according to each race present in the game. Gone are the colorful characters of MOO2, instead replaced by a fixed roster of generic, fairly forgettable race-specific commanders and administrators. Most are often lacking more than a single ability, giving them less bang for the BC despite their fairly low hiring cost. This is the one addition where the interface is not quite up to par, as the system seems tacked-on and clunky compared to the rest of the game's menus. Still, having them is a bonus, though it could stand some improvement. 

The inclusion of the Antarans is the most significant change to the game. Their periodic appearances are much less randomized than they were in Master of Orion II; they seem to fixate on the same handful of systems, refusing to attack alternate planets until the first target is obliterated. Their fleet strength seems to skyrocket on a very steep curve as well, making it nearly impossible to fight them off ship to ship, even in the late game. Overall it feels like their mechanics could use some fine-tuning.

Master of Orion, with or without the Revenge of Antares expansion, is a very well-designed, well-balanced, challenging strategy game; though not without its flaws, I don't feel that any of them are so glaring as to affect the overall quality of the experience. The changes made by the expansion are all welcome additions, albeit imperfectly-implemented ones. The game is still being updated according to player feedback, and thanks to the community, there are a variety of mods available to fine-tune things.",1473005019,1482731102,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

I downloaded the game due to the half off Steam Sale. I finished the download, clicked ""play"" and instant crash to desktop. Frustrating, but not the end of the world. I used my Google Fu to find out possible fixes and it said to try verifying the game cache. Ok, not a bit deal. Did that and tried to play it again. I clicked ""play"" again and it crashed again.

 I decided that maybe I got a borked install and that it did not work. So I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Annoying as hell, but I did it anyway. After the reinstall, I went to click Play and guess what? IT CRASHED AGAIN.

After some more investigation and a tip from someone who had the same issue, I updated my graphics drivers. They weren't all that old, but apparently it wants the newest drivers. So I did that, restarted my machine and got ready to conquer the galaxy. I clicked ""Play"" yet again and YET ANOTHER CRASH ON LAUNCH.

The game has clearly been lovingly crafted to be faithful to the original trilogy games but where it falls off is in the level of simplicity that has been incorporated into the game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. 

So what is the bad? Well when your game is sequel to another you usually expect some kind of innovation to the game's mechanics to make it new and exciting, not just a reskin. Master of Orion is at it's bare bones a reskin of Master of Orion 2 and doesn't seem to try anything new mechanically. The good though is that this game has clearly been a labour of love, from the effort put into getting iconic sci-fi voice voice actors to the universe itself constantly and enthusiastically encouraging you to expand and explore this game is very much, a good game. Unfortunately though it may fall short of your expectations of a 4x grand strategy or of a sequel.

With all that said though Master of Orion is truly made for new players and makes for a great introductory point to 4x strategy. The user interface is easy to understand, doesn't clog up the display and is very elegant, the galaxy and worlds look amazing, colourful and alive, and there is exceptional voice acting to help make even the most mundane tasks enjoyable.

This game is worth trying out, if you find it's too simple you can easily just ask for a Steam refund but if you do end up liking it you will find yourself engrossed in this game for hours at a time.

As someone who has been playing Master of Orion for 22 years (I mostly bought into this just to get a steam copy of the original series), let me tell you, this game is a lot of fun, and a true successor to the original series.  The art is great, the game play is exactly what the extraordinarily high standards of nostalgia demand...

That said, even after the game was ""released"" it feels unfinished.  And after paying a *really high price* for a game while it was in beta (I never do that) I'm disappointed that they immediately turn to paid DLC to add races.

However, it is more or less the same game as its predecessors with updated graphics.  It could make for a fun multipler 4x skirmish game, because it is light on micromanagement and the play is fast.

I have to give this a BIG THUMBS DOWN.  (1) The game includes nothing new or promising for the series.  The ship to ship combat could introduce a heavy layer of tactics into the game, instead it plays like Homeworld I. (2) Without mods, the game mechanics are absolutely broken.  The Antares are too powerful, and you feel like you have to use an exploit to just sruvive (on normal).  

PRO
- Streamlined interface
- Excellent AI opponents; Civ series should take some pointers here. *COUGH*
- Pretty graphics, except in fleet combat.
- Good longevity with the tech tree.

CONS
- It's like the developers did not play their own game: major mechanics problems.
- Nothing new.  (I suppose if you are traditional, then maybe that's good.)
- DLC is new playable races, which basically is a graphics/sound pack.

Well then, currently this is Civilization in space. With starlanes. And a loss of immersion by all races being very much alike. 10 months ago I thought the game was on a good track to become a worthy successor, but so far it didn't manage to become that - well, hope dies last. 
The way that game is at this moment, I'd recommend it to newbies in the 4x genre but pretty much to noone else. It lacks depth, becomes monotonous rather fast and imho the only way to play it is snowballing faster than everyone else - most races are suited for that.

Still not sad to have bought it, as early access gave me copies of MoO 1 and 2 (and the lamentable third part which noone like to speak of), but as a game it does not hold the thrill of the originals nor their depth nor their complexity. Therefore I spend my time in Stellaris and MoO2, letting this game slowly rot in my library.

So, current oppinion: Nice 4x starter with obnoxious advisors, low complexity and nice artwork. Not a game recommended for anyone who liked the gameplay of the old series though.

old Review from February 2016: 
Well, after a playthrough of one game of Master of Orion 2 and this new iteration of the series, I feel it is prudent to write a review ;)

First of all, it is NOT a real remake, but a reinterpretation. Secondly, this reinterpretation is done as faithful as can be (within reason). You'll  find lots of techs, buildings and modules that are basically the same in both games. At the time of this review, there are only 6 playable races, all of which have the flair of their counterparts of old. No, Psilons might not be creative any more, but their research boost is gargantuan if you tend to expand a lot like me.

All in all, this is the first game that might really be a successor to the heritage of Moo and Moo2. Keep up the good work!",1456563304,1482426527,True,30,0,0.503871381282806396,0,True,False,True

I am still encountering some bugs, but usually a reboot will fix them. 

Some things to note: 
[b]Combat is in real time rather than turn based[/b]
You can pause at any time to issue orders to move/attack, which are then carried out all at the same time when you hit 'play'. I think this is great, and gets around the issue in MoO2 where a large fleet would take forever to command. This also opens up options like having a horde of small expendable vessles rather than a few of the biggest ships available.

[b]Original races as DLC[/b]
You will need to purchase DLC to play as the Elerian, Gnolam, or Trilarian races. I dont like that these races were excluded from the original game. A more palatable move would have been to have all the original races playable, and to invent some brand new races/traits as paid DLC

[b]Mods are essential[/b]
Some silly decisions by the devs are made moot with mods. e.g. having only 10 points to spend on your custom race, not being able to see/select all perks when making a custom race, Anarans being stupidly strong, ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=821884360]Mods a collection here[/url])

[b]Voiceovers get annoying[/b]
The voice acting is great in my experience, but overused. Your advisor pops up all the time, and says one of about 5 lines every time you choose a technology to research. Thankfully there is an option to mute the advisor.

[b]Starlane travel[/b]
Unlike prior games, travel between the stars takes place via 'starlanes'. Each system has one or more point from which you can travel to another system. These points are the only place to enter or exit a system, and so become chokepoints you can block or defend with military instalations.

[b]Fuel[/b]
A major part of previous Orion games was researching fuel tech, to enable you to explore further. In Master of Orion there is no limit to the distance you are able to venture from your colonies. To make up for this, you must now explore each planet within a system to determine the size/biome/mineral/bonuses, meaning exploration is a more involved task.


Overall a very enjoyable game with mods, and getting better all the time.

Some of the decisions made by the devs didn't sit well with me at all, but I finally decided to give the game a fair go.

Before I start - I'm reviewing MOO + the Antares DLC, and I'm running the 5X mod. These both impact my overall impression of the game.

I'm happy to say that my experiences with the game so far have been mostly positive. I loved the turn-based combat of the original MOO series, but I have to admit that running battles in real-time allows for a fairer outcome, rather than the ""wipe-the-opposite-fleet-off-the-map-before-they-get-a-chance-to-shoot"" scenarios I quite often had in MOO2, and was almost always able to take advantage of in the late-game.

The overhaul of the espionage system with the DLC was a definite step in the right direction.

This might not be the MOO that hard-core fans wanted, but this is definitely the most fun I've had in a space-based 4X game since the days of MOO2. There are aspects I'm not entirely fond of, such as star-lanes, the Antaran's obesession with me in every game, the mod menu working whenever it decides it wants to, and the fact that I have to make use of a mod to get a decent balanced game.

There are bugs that crop up from time to time, and the game tends to slow down pretty drastically as you get closer to your turn-limit. I tend to let the AI take care of space battles because once there are enough ships on the screen managing all of them becomes a massive pain.

If you had to ask me whether I would recommend the game - I would say yes. It's not everything I hoped for, but it ticks most of the right boxes for me, personally. There are still many areas in which the game can improve, and hopefully the devs will work on some of these.

If reading this review still doesn't make you decide one way or another, I'd recommend waiting for the next sale, and grabbing it then.",1482044232,1482044385,True,3,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False

The game is pretty much a copy-paste of mechanics from MOO2 (and MOO1 by inference) with pretty graphics (which is undisputably good). The issue I see is that superior mechanics from MOO3 were not even partially implemented here. Don't get me wrong - MOO3 was far from being perfect, but it contained some of the very novelty and complex mechanics that improved the immerssion of empire management and gave feeling that you must explore the game also allowing one to use new features quite intuitively. The only poorly executed part of MOO3 - real time combat was in fact introduced to MOO(4), but so far it is as plain and boring as it was in the infamous precedessor (although with correct 3D field and perspective this time).

It amazes me that having access to all code and IP for all 3 MOOs, developers decided to create Master of Orion 2.5 all over again. Instead of taking on the vision of an ultimate 4X game that this game could be, they apparently decided to lower the ceiling and gave us same old stuff that everyone knows and which cannot possibly fail...

The game is growing, alpha access is just that. The devs have a vision, its to stay true to the original concept and develop a MOO that pays homage to the original. They arent there but they are well on thier way. The game does play close to a civ type game, its relaxing, its fun, its engaging.

this game is a beatiful tribute to 4x and the MOO franchise. it has the nostagia and has depth but still accessible to newcomers, graphics are very nice,and have a nice modern feel. im glad they came out with this dlc i was feeling like it needed a few more classic races i know alot of people dont like paying more than 50 or 60 for a game but as long as you keep coming with patches and support its totally justified in my opinion, personally ive loved MOO since i played the original on dosshell floppy drive pc when i was 11 and that may make me a little biased and nostalgic but thats why i think its great,because it rings true to its predeccessors success while infusing some modern-(ness?) into the game.",1481188590,1481188590,True,3,0,0.459195226430892944,1,True,False,False

PROS:
*The game looks pretty
*Voice acting is top notch

CONS:
*The games good graphics largely go to waste.  Other entertaining features (e.g. the GNN) are under-utilized
*Combat has zero tactical depth.  Similar to MoO 3 with pixels shooting at pixels (i.e. boring)
*Good ideas like biome diversity wasted by not actually making them diverse
*Certain mechanics (e.g. Pollution) dominate gameplay requiring constant micromanagment of workers on every planet (a larger issue on larger galaxy sizes) which, in turn, requires inordinate amounts of game time compared to other fatures
*AI is rock stupid even on highst difficulty settings.  Game seems to have no knowledge of the pros and cons of the race(s) it's controlling
*Devs not listening to community.  Ignoring features that have existed since early access while inserting features that no one asked for

This could still be a great game but would require a big shift in dev strategy to make it happen.  Ultimately, certain mechanics (like Pollution) make you spend too much time managing it.  Managing pollution should not be half of my gameplay time.  It's 2016 - space battles should be more interesting than multi-colored Pong.  Those pictures of space battles on the store page?

+ Oozes charisma and charm.  Some of the best voice work for aliens ever done for a game.
+ Animation and graphics for the aliens is superb.
+ Good tutorial to get you started (a bit too basic though).
+ Great game for new players to cut their teeth on a 4x game.
+ Interface for managing your empire is great.
+ Warp gates and choke points are a fun secondary 4x gameplay option that gives 4x space games some variety.  I'm glad we have this method for MOO, yet traditional hexes in Gal Civ 3.  Makes each game feel special.
+ Game plays quick.  
+ I think I'm going to like the real-time combat aspect but I need to spend more time in it to formulate a better opinion.
+ Easy to manage your colonies.
+ Love GNN News!  I'd even pay DLC prices to have more GNN events added.  Same goes for more voice overs for more diplomatic options.

-  Music for some parts of the game are annoying.  The research screen in particular makes you want to gouge your ears out. It's disruptive and and loops too quickly.  Likewise in main game, the basic music that loops majes a huge mistake you should never put in a game.  It uses a *ding* that closely resembles one used for messaging in Apple devices and error messages in Windows.  It is distracting and annoying.  Rest of music feels uninspired.
-  Graphics for planets and stars on the main screen are bland and too small.   Can't zoom in much.  This make it hard to ""immerse"" yourself in the galaxy as you feel a bit distant from it all.  Galactic Civilizations 3 does this better.
- Ship Combat - I'm just not getting it yet.  I think it's because camera control and the options in the combat zone are not good yet.  Maybe I need to look at how some other people manage combat.

Pro:
Nice graphic
Excellent voice acting
It's MoO :(

Cons:
Really dull and shallow combat model. Tactical combat was almost the major part of the original MoO2
Ship constructor is almost useless due to shallow combats
Stupid AI. Some challenge only at Very Hard mode and mostly due to AI cheats.
Exploring is dull too. To little possible and unique bonuses. 
No experience for ships and spies.
[strike] No governers. There is almost no sense to colonise system with a lot of planets. 
 No fleet commanders[/strike] <--added with patch. Though in Endless Space its made better
Lags...
Just one autosave....
No quick save
Can't skip turns without giving orders

Neutral:
Lanes. I liked the idea of lanes and blockades. It may add some depth
[strike]Pollution system. Well, it make some sense. But it adds more pain than fun cause it's very hard to prognose what pollution effect will be in next 20 turns. [/strike] -- patched

Shallow and worse copy of MoO2. After 20+ YEARS of gamedev evolution what we have.... better graphics and voice acting? Really? Endless space is much better. Even with dull combats",1479300213,1481118170,False,131,4,0.698052346706390381,9,True,False,False

The game is a lot better after this latest patch, a lot more fleshed out.  There are still issues that need addressed though.

Pros:

Voice work is amazing
Graphics are incredible
The technology tree is quite good.

Here are the remaining issues and some are quite significant.

1.  Limited tactical combat.  You cannot disable engines and shields, board vessels and steal tech.  This creates a huge disadvantage for races that have marine improvement perks over other things - it essentially removes a significant source of tech aquisition.  Races like the Myrshan and the Bulrathi in particular.  It also really removes an important dimension of the original game.  
2.  The antarans are game breaking - the way they attack is insane.  They simply create a massive fleet of small ships that essentially crashes the computer eventually.  Small ships are more efficient than larger capitol ships so mostly you die unless you do the same.  But you can control where they go because they will attack the planet that has most of your fleet.  Honestly it's nonsense.  if you get to the Antaran homeworld there are 61 ships - yet they can field a fleet of hundreds just to match a stodgy game mechanic.  Utter non-sense.  I guess random attacks of reasonable size was too difficult.
3.  There doesn't seem to be a way to look at the specs of a ship after it is built.  Or to manually retrofit a ship once it is created.  You just apply a new build and that is it - cookie cutter style.
4.  There is no way to set a rally point - this is just silly.  
5.  There seem to be nebulas and astroids everywhere - regardless of where combat takes place.  I attack a planet and there are nebulas and astroids in front of it.  Thats isn't a thing - stop that!
6.  The victory conditions win screen is a huge letdown most of the time.  I was thinking of modding in the one from MOO2 because it was great.  
7.  The races are terribly unbalanced.  Thankfully you can do custom but still..
8.  Finally anythign that makes marines stronger is essentially a pointless tech or perk.  The solution to your fancy marines is to just ""use more bombs"" - and since marines only get play in ground invasions this makes it a lot of investment for very little advantage.  Maybe you get a few extra turns while your litle marines get thier faces bombed in...

Anyway - less of a crap sandwich but still very frustrating.  It just feels like the devs take too much for granted- and this more than anything bothers me - because the original makers were some detail oriented uber-nerds and these guys just isn't.

That said,  some of my finest gaming memories are playing the original MOO and MOO2 back in my misspent youth, so I'm a bit more of a grizzled stellar emperor, and my standards are demanding.

We've had a bit of an abundance of riches after a decade long drought-- one thinks immediately of Stellaris-- which layers on substantially more complexity and depth.   

There's also the absolutely amazing Endless Space series, which is crafted amazingly well.  

So MOO has some rather stiff competition these days.

By those standards, is this title a success?   

Well-- yes, and no.   The production values are absolutely first rate.   The game looks gorgerous.   The sound design and voice acting is also first rate.   Which is something you normally do not associate with a 4X title.

The no comes from the depth of gameplay-- I won a 10 hour campaign on Hard with basically one hand tied behind my back.   There were no surprises-- which was very disappointing-- the Klackon did not, for example-- seem to prefer smaller swarm strategies, as before-- and the Bulrathi did not lean towards larger, Battleship-type fleets.   Every race basically was super nice to me until I wiped the galactic floor with them.

The tech tree is almost unchanged from earlier games.   

The antareans show up-- but their AI seems weird.   They sometimes start to bomb your colonies, but then change their mind and leave.   This makes them vastly less of a horrifying threat.

Taken holistically, this is a satisfying nostalgia purchase at its price point.  I'm happy another generation will get to enjoy some MOOOOOOOOO addiction.

IF you are going to do a reboot of an old game DO THAT. 

The point of doing a beta release is to test and build on your games development untill its a finished product.

The obvious comparison is to Master of Orion 2. And now I start to wonder WTF happened. Few of the gameplay elements feel like they are better or more polished than MoO2. Has nothing happened in 20 years of game development? Graphics and sound are definitely better, but you get the same buildings and races, a worse tech tree (copied from Civ?), duller exploration and it just feels like there's been no real improvements to the gameplay. The UI is a step back from the ease of MoO2, and ship designs have become static - instead of the total freedom from MoO2, you have a fixed amount of blueprints to alter, and all your ships are locked to that blueprint and it's upgrades.

So while I do recommend the game, I still rank MoO2 as a better game. And it was released in 1996.",1480768942,1480768942,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

There is only one reason you'd be interested in this game: You liked Masters of Orion 2!

Now the question: Is this MoO2 with modern tech?
Answer: No!

Space travel is completely different, since you travel by hyperlanes only. Combat is completely different, because it's in real time with no meaningful ability to interact. 
The original races and abilities are not all there, because it's more profitable to sell them as DLC!!

In short: It's a different game that merely share's the name.

In fact, you might as well take a look at this game: Stellaris
It's also not MoO2 but better in about every way.

I have tried many of the newer 4X clones, and while they are enjoyable, none were as much fun as MOO2.  So far, I have enjoyed this new iteration of the game, though not quite as much as I hoped.  

I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys 4X games.  I know it's caught a lot of flak from some users (some of it deserved), it's still worth the money.  I like the new movement system even though many people seem to dislike it.  The graphics are very nice, the tech tree dynamics work OK, but it often doesn't seem to affect the game that much in regards to the order you research items.  Diplomacy seems to work well and the AI seems to act in its own best interest most of the time.  I have not experienced any of the bugs other players seem to have experienced, so maybe that would have changed my opinion.  The other thing I really enjoy is the fact that it supports mods through the Workshop.  Those community designed changes really help with certain aspects of the stock gameplay.

A couple of things I wish they had changed are the combat system and races.  Commanding the RTS combat system seems to make no difference in the outcome of the battles and is just boring.  I enjoyed the older turn based system where specialized ships really made a difference.  Now there is very little advantage in using anything but the stock designs.  Also, making the complete roster of races (including the Antarens) part of a paid DLC seems like a cheap decision.  They really should have been included in the original package to flesh out the game, not charged for to keep people playing.

Still, even with the negatives, it is a fun game and worth the money if you enjoy this type of game.

Problems:
1. The most glaring - lack of tactical combat. Half of MoO is the combat. I do not care for glamorous graphics if I can't properly control the combat. In it's current form only AI combat can be used. Fook the camera, fook the graphics. Make it 2D even, but make it a proper tactical combat.
2. Badly inefficient economics - always lacking income even with just the basic buildings built.
3. Lack of freighters and general food abundance makes all races feel the same. Rock-eating silicoids are not too  different from any other race. Just spam colony ships and get each and every planet you can get. Races just don't feel unique.
4. Minor, but annoying - combat evaluation vs monsters - it's just missing. I've built a fleet of 10 ships to attack amoeba - combat evaluation tells me I have 100% chances to win. Attack! Not a scratch on the amoeba, my fleet is annihilated. 100 turns later with quite significant tech updates - same fleet, same result. 100 more turns later - yet again. I'm voting for strong monsters, it makes it more interesting, but evaluator should be fixed, particularly to account for shield damage reduction.
5. Many additional modules is nearly impossible to evaluate (like modules, disrupting rockets) - they do not change stats of the ship, take up precious space, increase cost, and without tactical combat - I can't see their result. Either make a tactical combat, or make modules change ship stats, or remove them. 
6. Same as #5 but towards point defense / antimissiles.
7. Overally, gameplay feels sluggish and slow. Like a simple thing - population management - it cannot be done from colonies overview (empire). Like too many notifications (dangerous fleet for every move of enemy factory, population rised for every colony of 100+ colonies empire, etc), like showing every move of a monster in nearby star system. It all takes precious seconds, that build up into wasted hours.
8. Tech tree feels soo civ-like that it's annoying.",1480706886,1480706886,False,9,0,0.530773580074310303,2,True,False,False

They dumbed down ship design and combat, made it boring and pointless (two of the biggest factors that made the previous one's so great).  

They implemented a space lanes only model, which I'm not againts space lanes, but they should have done something to allow for other ways to play the game.  Look at Stellaris as an example where you choose your FTL method which then determines your method of travel through the galaxy.  MoO 1&2 did not even have space lanes either, so not sure why thats the only option in this game.

Graphics are nice overall, a bit on the cartoony side for my tastes, but not something that would prevent me from buying and/or enjoying the game.  Voice acting is very good as well.

Strategy seems pretty shallow as well.  Just doesn't have that strategic magic or challenge that makes me want to come back over and over again.

Now it seems like they are rapid firing DLC out for the game as well.  Not something I will be investing in.

Now if you were looking for a clone of MOO II then you are going to be disappointed.  This is its own game but it does continue the tradition of the MOO series.  

Most of the races you remember from MOO II return for this latest installment though some are not exactly as you might remember.  The same goes for technology.  A lot of it looks the same but don't assume any of it is an exact copy.  For me it is a nice blend of nostalgia and new features.  

One feature that has some people irked is the inclusion of starlanes.  Personaly I don't see the problem but I also enjoyed Space Empires and they used starlanes too.  Once you get jump gates you will hardly notice starlanes anyway.  

Another issue to keep in mind is that tatical combat is real time as opposed to turn based as it was in MOO II.  In smaller battles you still have a lot of control though in the larger fights there are just too many ships to effectively control in that environment.  The mouse controls are still a little clunky in that regard too.  There is a pause button so you can stop the battle as much as you like to give orders for movement and firing.

I do enjoy this game but why did I not recommend this game you wonder?
Because for all the things they did to improve, the designers left out quite a bit that made this game unique and a loving title.

The new Master of Orion title is clearly built for a more ""theatrical"" experience. Plenty of cutscenes, camera angles in fighting (much like the much maligned MOO 3, but improved honestly), and a plentiful voice cast list.
However for all that multimedia spectacle, the game itself is rather shallow compared to earlier MOO titles and even 4x games that came after (i.e. Stellaris).

The Terran Khanate, a new faction, is only available if you purchase the Collectors Edition. Other races that were in the second title won't be in game until DLCs. These can be forgiven if they're recreating the first, but the game's ability to play should have been updated. 

The games ability to keep track of ships is rather clunky, so is the ability to track colonies. Though you CAN rename systems that's pretty much it for customization.

Customizing races consists of picking a ""gene"" (one of the player template names) and picking your traits. So less creating your own race and more just tweaking an existing one.

Despite all of this I could see someone new to the 4x genre cutting their teeth on this, but then either putting it down later or picking up more polished games (i.e. Stellaris).

This game is no means a travesty like Master of Orion 3, but it clearly is built more for the cutscenes and presentation more than gameplay. Which is why, though I might enjoy it in small spurts, I cannot recommend for players.

Truth be told this revamp of the original title, complete with setbacks the original had, only highlight how things evolved after it (the original) was released. This title had the chance to take some of the original components and bring them into a design fit for the modern 4x experience, but rather adhered to both the old charm and limitations of the original.

As a single-player experience I'd rate it 4/5 stars. The graphics are gorgeous, it captures the spirit of the original game perfectly, and goes a long way to reclaimin the title of King of the Turn-Based Strat games. I do have to deduct a half star for not being able to set up custom-defined autobuild ques for extended planet development (beyond the 4 slots you're allowed). being able to set up a custom auto-build command for late game development would be invaluable. I also deducted a half point for the controls of the battle interface. Commanding your fleets hands-on can be tricky at best.

As a multi-player game though, I'd only rate it 2/5. There's no easy way for a disconnected player to jump back into a game, and the hands-on battle interface is just gone. you're only allowed the auto-resolve battle option. In my book, these are two huge hits to the quality of that side of the game.

This reboot did so before I even had a copy however, happening when an old friend sent me an article about it before release.

MoO - the little acronym belies the epic galactic spanning game within, a game I spent many, many hours engrossed in as a young gamerling. And then came MoO2, and I was able to expand to conquering my friends - which brought many laughs and also a few almost Risk level arguments (and subsequent self imposed 'Geneva Conventions' on our sessions). MoO3 was a bit of a let down for most (and I can see why, it was by far the weakest of the three (now four)...however, I did see what they were trying to do and I did (unlike anyone I know) finish the game. I have conquered and colonized Orion in each and every title (doing so for this one just last night).

The new game draws on the strengths of each previous title, absorbing and melding each into a game that feels like the first one in flavour (especially with the races currently available, though the brand new Terran Khanate faction included as DLC hints at the possible inclusion of missing races from MoO2 and MoO3 - bring back my psychic Elerian babes! EDIT - Coming soon it seems!). However much of the colony mechanics, a good portion of the UI and the accessibility of the second is core to the gameplay. A few pieces of the UI - such as the galactic map, including the starlanes idea - and a much improved version of the combat style of the third have come along for the ride too...all in all, a solid choice on most aspects, and the game feels complete at launch unlike many other 'smaller' titles.

There are a few things that I would say warrant another go at (such as a better 'Empire Management' screen) and a few tweaks to the UI in places (moving multiple population from one job to another on the Colony/Planet Screen) but these aren't core gameplay issues, and could probably be fixed easily enough with a mod-patch ala 'SkyUI' for Skyrim, though hopefully the developer will follow them up in time. This would add another 0.5 to my score below.

I've found it pretty fun. A little bit of the standard 4x 'clickclickclick' problem when starting up, but, well, when you only have nuclear drives, that's a pretty standard problem for any MoO game. xD

It's pretty. I like the individualized advisors for each faction.

I'm fairly happy with the auto-ship designer. I mean, you could probably make Super Awesome Custom Ships and stomp everyone, but the general ones seem to work alright.

Controlled combat is a little confusing for me. I honestly just tend to use auto-calculate or let the AI handle the fleet, and things seem to go alright. It's very odds based, depending on ship strength and the like, but other than some space monsters (which are nasty usually), I haven't had any 'oh, I have overwhelming odds of victory!' 'Oh, I see, I just lost 90 percen tof my fleet. Awesome.'

all-in-all, I'm pretty happy with this, and looking forwards to the Battle for Antares DLC. Because, well...

That day is finally here!  And wouldn't you know it, it's a reboot of the original!!!  If you love the original Master Of Orion, and have been waiting for years like me for a game that is just as great, and better, than the original, that wait is over!

Master Of Orion (reboot) is an amazing game in every aspect!  Graphics, Sound and Presentation are the cream of the crop and AAA!  But where this successor really shines is in the Gameplay!  The original game is unrivaled and the reboot doesn't disappoint.  It fixes the two small niggles that stunted the first game, slow start of each game, and some late game micromanagement.  The original Master Of Orion was the first of its kind (4x space sim) and of course there would be things to improve on.  After playing the original MOO, the only improvements I wished for was an up in graphics (of course) and to fix the two aforementioned items.  Well the reboot fixes just that!  The reboot flows amazingly from start to finish with no lag/grind time, and the management (sans micro) is so streamline that there is no problem controlling your empire as it grows.  Every aspect of the game fits neatly with every other aspect making the game perfectly seamless!  And with every turn showing everything you need to manage at the time you need to manage it at the bottom right hand corner of the screen every turn, you don't even have to go into any menus manually if you don't want to!  THIS IS GAME CHANGING!  This makes the game accessible to ANYONE AND EVERY TYPE OF PLAYER OUT THERE!!!  This is so major that if every other 4x space sim adopted this, every game could be this AMAZING!  And for those who still want to have more hands on and dig deep into management systems, IT'S ALL STILL THERE!  This game is extensive enough for veterans while also being simple enough for newbie's!  How many games get this right?  It's EXTREMELY RARE!  This kind of rarity should be, and is, appreciated!

So you may be wondering, many fans claim that the sequel, the original Master Of Orion 2 (MOO 2), is actually the best game in the series.  I never understood that, or comprehended why.  Yes, it expanded on the original Master Of Orion, and it looked like the original Master Of Orion, but it didn't feel like Master Of Orion.  This is when the series started going more down the ""micromanagement rabbit hole"" that most 4x space sims build themselves on today.  MOO 2 lost the ""pick up and play"" aspect that made the original Master Of Orion so great, and at its heart, what it was.  MOO 2 was prettier (and that's all that needed to be updated) but its predecessor was about giving players a choice of being as simple, or as complex as desired.  With MOO 2's unnecessary large amount of micromanaging, it pushed all simplicity aside.  It became a numbers game and sacrificed its simple fun making it feel more like a job rather than a game.  One only has to look at the horrible Master Of Orion 3 to see how they built upon micromanaging at its worst.  This is why the series lay dormant for so many years.

The original Master Of Orion spoiled me to the point that I expected better of any game that tried to do what it did.  I waited so many years for a true successor, and it brings a tear to my eye to finally have that.  The new Master of Orion is perfect in almost every way, but like its predecessor, it too has one minor niggle; not game breaking in anyway.  The game introduces a cinematic camera view during battles, that is great in concept, but doesn't work as well in practice, or as well as I'd like.  The camera doesn't show the best of the action most of the time and often you miss the best parts of a fight.  If they fix this (and this is the only thing they need to fix about the game in a patch or even a sequel) then this series will stay in the top spot of 4x space sim perfection!  

Go buy this!  We need to show developers that we want more games like this.  Though I got it on sale, I believe it's well worth full price!

-----

Updated 11/24/16 - Steam does it again!  They created an Award celebration where we get to nominate games we think are the best of the best!  I'm giving Master Of Orion what I think is Steam's most prestigious award, since they don't have a ""Best of the Year"" category, I'm giving it the “Just 5 More Minutes” Award!  You can't stop playing!

It's a shame to not see Master of Orion on any ""best of"" 2016 award lists this year.  This by far is now the best 4x Space Sim you can play!  I hope you decide to pick it up, sale or no, because it's an experience you simply can't miss!  This is my pick for game of the year 2016!

So now that Master Of Orion has rebooted so successfully, there is a HUGE opportunity to grow this franchise right, avoiding the pitfalls of the past.  So what do I want to see as an evolution to Master Of Orion, either as an extension to the existing game, or its possible sequel?  I would love to see random story missions/events.  The kind you find in the side stories of games like Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect.  And make many of them!  So many that you won't be able see all of them in a single play through.  This way, multiple play through's will be unique, and things you do will make you feel more connected to the experience like no other 4x Space Sim before!  Sure there have been other games that have made linear story lines in 4x Space Sims, like Galactic Civilizations, and although they can be quite good, they are still too constraint, and people end up skipping them and just jumping into what makes these games so desirable in the first place, the random sandbox experience.  But if someone could program story elements, that don't force you into a predetermined end, or handful of endings, that would be amazing!   And since this is Steam, why not workshop it!  Make a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" interface and make it easy enough that people can come up with their own stories on the fly to share, and you could continually have more and more events all the time!  The possibilities are endless!

So yeah, Master Of Orion, Game of the Year 2016, and best 4x Space Sim of all time!",1479079068,1480023371,True,2,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

If you played Civilisation V for example you will recognize some mechanics and stuff they used as well. But thats not necesasarily bad. You don't always have to reinvent a whole genre. Sometimes taking good things from other games can upgrade your own. That's what MoO did pretty well. 

Allthough it is diffrent from the original games from like 15 years ago it plays pretty good. Several things are still the same which makes it a bit nostalgic, but a lot has obviously changed - for the better imo.

In the game itself the start always seems a bit slow. You basicly just fly around discovering the galaxy, but as round-based games usually progress at that rate roundtimes will begin to slow down. You need to manage a lot of things. Not caring for your planets for a few rounds can leave your planet enviromentally heavily damaged. Reversing that usually takes a bit longer than damaging it. That's just one of the basic mechanics the game brings.
The fighting system between battleships sometimes seems a bit clunky. Even with potentially favorable outcome you sometimes just flatout loose the fight. Maybe this part still needs some love / updates, but I'm positive that this will change in the near future.

That is due in fact to the incredible star studded voice acting! The colorful UI and ease of management are big wins. Diplomacy is well done but sometimes I wish there was a bit more dialog. When its this good you can't help but want more. Space combat can be a lot of fun as well, but once you learn to equip your ships well the AI has a bit of a challenge keeping up and builds lots of smaller ships. 

If you are expecting a classic 4x experience you won't be disappointed. But if you want something very involved you may want to play Stellaris. Personally I prefer Master of Orion because you can get your strategy fix in 8 hours or less and space combat is more hands on with races that have lots of personality.

I'd absolutely get it again.

Great UI
Super Voice Acting (ie. Michael Dorn)

When i played a while back, it was to casual for me. Stellares is to ""nerdy"" for me, but IOS stuff is to easy. So i really liked MoO2 because it sits right in the middle. Don't get me wrong Stellares is a great game in its own rights, but you have to love micromanagement to play it. This Game (after a casual start) moves with big steps toward this sweet spot MoO2 and Civ Games are in. So what you do really matters and changes stuff, but you don't need to make a degree in it first to be able to play. ;)
So for me it is now getting in this:"" just one more round""-territory. 
Better then in MoO2 is that the races, news people, scientists,... now really have character and voices.
The combat was one of my biggest problems (to casual) but now i can move my ships around from top view (like i should in a MoO).
But you must play one difficulty lvl above what you think you should because medium is casual, hard is normal, ... and so on.

It really gets a handle on bringing along what was good in the old games, and make it nice to control with new UI techniques and better looks.

1) Diplomacy = AI's proposals are ridiculous, and it almost never agrees to yours:
E.g,Neutral AI gives 10 gold + their map, and for that generous proposal I should start war against their enemy. If I refuse, AI gots massive relationship hit with me. Funny? Not at all.
Another example, AI asks to open borders, but refuses not to settle colonies near you, and then gets mad when you close your borders.

2) Ship Design = cool at first sight; but much worse when you get into it, resulting in ""more guns = win"".
Almost all modules are horribly worse compared to additional weapons.

3) Warfare = waiting game if you want to conquer:
just wait for midgame massive ships...
 and wait again for AI to get into another war and then declare on it...
  and then wait again to build your troop-ships who will sieze planets...
   and then wait again and again to gather all them in one sector, so that you can destroy any enemy fleet...
    and after that wait again to build your troop-ships who will sieze planets (they are disposable)...
     and after that wait again some more time to gather all in one sector, so that troop-ships won't be destroyed...
      and even after this and that wait some more time again...

4) Economy = two ways: rush to +5 population // +2 additional gold per population; OR conquer (not colonize!) more planets.
Otherwise, buildings, including defensive ones, will eat all your surplus.

5) Assistant voices = female voices are nice, but other squeezy 'alien' voices are a way to harsh for my ears.

6) Technology = you need to frequently choose one of two/three bonuses; although, you can still trade the other bonus with an AI, but it is dumb and dully stubborn in its considerations.

7) Polution = the more you have workers and the better is your planet, the more polution you produce.
This means that a dump with -150 polution is the only reasonable choice in technology tree.

8) Warfare 2 = loosing a massive battle is a disaster, especially for AI. They never have even a ghostly chance to get back on their feet, so they are eventually conquered.

9) Espionage = you can easily play without any of them.

Pros:
1) Graphics = A+ for 4x space game.

2) General gameplay = despite all the cons, this is still a good game to play for several days (it becomes too bo-o-oring early).",1479523054,1479523763,False,34,1,0.610414683818817139,2,True,False,False

The devs are really quick to respond and I enjoyed the game overall, I would say it's a worthy successor of the MoO2 classic. I haven't played MoO3 so I can't compare to that.

Pros:
- Great support from the devs;
- Nice graphics;
- Has almost everything from MoO2;
- Has better diplomacy and spy features;
- Military outposts: you don't need a fleet to guard your borders.

Minor cons:
- No hero units;
- No colony bases (in MoO2 you could colonize a planet in the same system without colony ship, here you always need to have a colony ship);
- No freighters for the galaxy food delivery. On the other hand, the food isn't such a big issue as it was in MoO2;

Cons:
- No antares. The biggest military challenge is the Orion guardian, and once you can beat that you don't have much left to do unless you're into conquering the whole galaxy. Of course you can beat them economically or technologically but it would be great to have that ultimate goal to wipe the bad guys.


===================== My original review =============================


TL;DR: Great game, too bugged. Don't waste your money.

I've read those negative reviews, but I thought ""what the heck, it's MoO successor and everyone deserves a chance"" and there was the steam sale. At start the game was great, I know that everyone was expecting something on the MoO2 grade but though noone can beat the classic this game was ok. I really enjoyed the first steps, setting up your home system, spy network that works, the auto-scouts, the warp entrance military posts - it all sounded great. But once I hit a certain point the game just froze on the ""stuck on processing turn"".
Ok, I started a new game, bla-bla, once I encountered Mrr'shan (or what's their name) ambassador it froze.
Ok, third time's a charm, another ambassador, froze again.

So no, despite the fact that this game has a lot of potential and I did love it when it didn't freeze I just can't play it because of it getting randomly frozen. And since it's not like a ""reload and it goes away"" freeze but the ""reload and freeze on the same spot"" freeze it's just unplayable.",1478216072,1479490640,True,0,0,0.506843268871307373,5,True,False,False

As a long time fan of the original MOO 1&2 and, with sufficient community patches/modifications even MOO 3(to a point), I find that this latest installment of the ""franchise"" sits squarely as MOO 1.5.

Overall colony management et al. is decent. Graphics are above average. Core races are present (though lacking relative to MOO 2 and MOO 3 in quantity and variation/backstory). Music and sound effects are typical of a strategy title. The UI is viable with most areas being reasonably intuitive for a 4x design.

I find the lack of backstory to be a great detriment to this iteration of MOO. Other titles, even MOO 3, had a greater atmosphere in terms of racial distinctiveness--there was a feel of something more vs. a generic 4x that's founded on an excellent series.

Though I have never been a hard set fan of leaders, certainly their absense from this product is clearly a detriment--as previous titles in the series and many modern competitors (Stellaris) have such implemented.

Space battles are a very curious beast. They lack the hands on control and tactics of MOO 1 & 2, but are more fluid than the system utilised in MOO 3. The bias towards long ranged weaponry, ala MOO 3, remains and the lack of tight hands on tactical control (to the degree of MOO 2) has me often gearing fleets for autoresolution rather than for any sort of finesse (which makes me think of combat in Spaceward Ho!).

Overall, however, development has continued. Additional content has been added and many bugs have been fixed. Though this title is far from complete/polished, continued improvements are clearly evident. This, with the nostalgia of the MOO universe/franchise, makes me optimistic as to the true ""end product"" that will be generated.

I recommend this title to anyone who is a fan of the MOO franchise--there is enough here, and the promise of more, to afford fans of the MOO series and enjoyable experience. 

For others who are not veterans of the franchise I would advise waiting to see if the new DLC content is enough to flush out the core options to make this, functionally, more on par with Stellaris (which is curently a more complete 4x experience without MOO nostalgia).",1479178337,1479178337,True,5,0,0.559462964534759521,0,True,False,False

As a casual gamer who often play 4x genre, I love this game and GalCiv3. Here's what I think.

Pros
- nice graphic, UI have modern designs

- Space maps looks lively, you always see many things happen on the screen (Endless Space's maps feels like a spreadsheet, that's why I never like the game although people praise it a lot) 

- Real-time combat like Total War!

- AI opponents often communicate with player, they're not quiet like AI in Endless Legend

- Pirate faction and monster, so you have something to fight in early game
- quite complex game mechanics
- espionage system
- managing planets is more fun than GalCiv 3
- fair amount of random events (still less than GalCiv3)

- Easy too keep track of ship updates
- The Dev even put their effort on unimportant aspects like Space News, Council voting scenes, Planets colonizing animations. This make me trust them more, because if someone spend their time to make minor detail more interesting, it mean that they dedicate to their game a lot.


Cons
- player cannot create custom ship appearances like GalCiv3 (But you can choose alternate ship models, however there are only few of them)

-  ship cannot travel freely in space because star lanes mechanics  (but it doesn't make the space maps look boring like Endless Space, so I'm fine with it)

- there's no way to remove grid lines on background in tactical combat views ( http://imgur.com/a/2FZKY ), I want my space fight to look more cinematic could you add an option to turn it off?

- the game should take more advantage of pirate and Monster, I want to see them become more threatening (like pirate era in Distant World: Universe)

- still need more random events

- Terran race dlc is expensive because they are included in Collector Edition. Can't we have a cheaper way to get a race that have a hot chick as an advisor!?

- ship models in main maps looks very ugly and have little details, GalCiv3 did a better job on this aspect.

- no option for adjusting map panning speed, edge scrolling spped",1479109041,1479109832,True,0,0,0.492495298385620117,0,True,False,False

1) find one
2) Research troop ships
3) build a fleet able to defeat any nominal defenses erected
4) Build troop ships
5) invade
6) If there is more than one planet in a system then rinse and repeat...

Boring.  And forget about rushing your opponent.   Do you want to out-tech their ground units?  Good luck.   The tech tree is horrendously complex and not very transparent.

It just takes too long to do anything.   I don't want to spend two hours before I can attack even one system.

I'm not really a Review person, yet when I saw a remake of this fantastic gem made in the 90s, I thought I simply had to try my hand at writing a review. Not to mention that -honestly- I don't know why there are so many unfavourable reviews that I just have to write this one.

So is the modern version of Master of Orion any good and worth a try? In my opinion it is. It's a good game. It's a great game! It's Master of Orion at its best, so what else do you people want? :)

The new game has got the same planets colonization system as the original game from the 90s, the same good folks like Darlocks, Mrrshan, Sakkra, Alkari etc. (folks that we all love so much!), the same galaxies to conquer, the same GNN robot (well with a female-robot colleague this time) and so on. All of the good elements of MoO plus the amazing graphics, animations, music and visuals a modern game must have.

The major comment I hear is that the modern gaming can offer much more than just a neat-looking clone of an old game. I haven't really played the other space civ games these days, games like Stellaris, so I can't compare to them. Yet the concept of the old MoO is an immortal one and a well thought-out one. So why complicate it, add to it or change it?

The new game resembles the old Master of Orion quite colsely in my opinion. Game mechanics are similar. Just the graphics are of high quality.

Throughout several matches which I played, it became obvious that there were some minor bugs here and there, but nothing too serious. Nothing that would spoil a good match. Although I agree, the devs should take some time to fine-tune the game.

I found the difficulty levels to be a bit out-of-balance, something that was very well established in the DOS game. I started off with a ""very easy"" difficulty level and that occured to be quite difficult actually. The major problem was the 'upkeep' costs, which really made it impossible for one race to speed up the growth. That is because if you buy too many assets, you will run into a deficit and that's not good (your money supply will run out and then the game will auto-sell your goodies). As I watched the charts, my race grew in line with the others over time and only in the mid or even late game I was finally able to get a better hand.

The voiced-over advisor is really annoying and does not suit there at all. They should have provided a ""fire the advisor"" button. :)

I imagine that any new player will find the game confusing at first. Someone who doesn't know the old Master of Orion or doesn't know the civ games. The learning curve is rather steep and the game is not intuitive at all at the beginning. You need to delve into it and be patient, learn and you will get a hang of it after a while.

I found the music to be great as well as the graphics. The themes are exactly the same as in the DOS game, but of course improved in qulity. The sound when you have a new discovery, for instance, is just fantastic.

Population grows slowly and it takes a lot of time to fully populate a planet, but that was exactly like this in the old game as well.

The interface is made in such a way that you need to patiently move all of the single units and click on every single planet to adjust production. Sure, there are shortcuts and improvements, but it still takes time and it's a tedious routine. However in my opinion, that's what it is, it defines Master of Orion really. If moving patiently every single unit is not ""your cup of tea"" than don't bother.

Also what I really liked in the new game is the emphasise on the races. They are unique and presented in a great way. Let's say, when you first meet Sakkra, they are big, monstrous creatures and that is impressive. Darlocks are mysterious, dark and malicious. Every race is very well presented and introduced. That was also a big thing regarding the old game.

I hear that people complain that the battles are real-time rather than turn-based. I didn't find that to be a big problem, although yes... it's different compared to the old game.

Regarding Diplomacy I found out that in the new game, the races seem to be less sensitive to the changes, which is good. It was always too unpredictible in the DOS game.

Overall, I was plesently surprised to find out that Master of Orion got its 2016 remake. I was more surprised to find out that the remake is good actually. If you're a fan of Master of Orion, you will enjoy the matches with the good-old enemies, which the new remake offers.",1478644217,1478644217,True,2,0,0.517857193946838379,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is exactly like other turn based 4Xs; expand, manage, bide your time and plot your enemies demise. 

Pros: 
- I've never found a space 4X that you can conveinently terraform gas giants into usable planets with worker units. 
- Those same workers, Space Factories they are called, can construct planets out of asteroids. That is just cool as hell! 
- The voice acting and diplomacy screens are beautiful! Top drawer!

- YOU CAN DESTROY FUCKING PLANETS WITH YOUR OWN DEATH STAR! Ah hem! I mean ""Doom Star"". It's very late tech tree but oh man is it satisfying. Suddenly the colony ships I had following my armada weren't even going to be used.... I made the Jedi weeep as I literally shattered the remaining planets my enemies held. 

Cons:
-The AI to autobuild in your dozens of colonies is terrible. It kept pushing me into a deficit on the imperial level! It was unusable until the endgame as a race that doesn't use food when the autobuild decided to build each farming upgrade.

2: Space 4E players waiting patiently for a title that innovates.

Regarding Group 1  

This game lacks the majority of MOO's features, does not recreate the feeling of that game, and generally should not be considered as MOO HD.  

Regarding Group 2

Space empire games' downfall is that they all basically clone MOO with their own twist.  If you're waiting for one to finally advance the genre beyond that basic, stale foundation, then getting the one named after MOO probably isn't the best bet.

Regarding Group 3

It's not balanced at all, and the AI is so cheated that it's obvious from the beginning of the game, onward.  Absolutely any other space empire game would make a better introduction to the genre.

Regarding Group 4

The voice actors read description cards and greetings.  The rest is poorly-written sophomoric humor from intrusive cinematics offering little useful information.

I wanted so badly for the MOO reboot to be good. What they released was a nice clean foundation for a 4X strategy game that looks and sounds great, but gameplay comes first, and in gameplay it barely competes with 4X games from the 90s, much less games from today.

I'm not complaining because I have nostalgia blinders for MOO2. I kinda like the introduction of starlanes, for example. But here's where this game falls short, starting with the worst flaws:

1. shallow gameplay mechanics -- actually fewer mechanics than MOO2. Races are nearly uniform. Planets are nearly uniform. Ships and weapons are nearly uniform. There's no government or empire policies to choose, no dampening effect to make forming new colonies a tradeoff. The only innovative mechanic I can think of is pollution from production requiring periods of cleanup, which requires thoughtful tradeoffs. (To my surprise, of this writing, a patch JUST came out that revamped pollution! This feels like ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"")

2. Tedious, repetitive management of colonies, spies, and population transports.

3. Overstuffed, bland tech tree -- the same old tech tree mechanic straight out of 1991's Civilization. And the tech tree is WAY TOO LONG considering how few interesting techs there are. The ""choose X or Y"" tech mechanic is reminiscent of MOO2, and sounds good in theory, but it doesn't play out as interestingly as you'd hope. The choices are often super lame, like, ""Choose between a free global +15% growth -OR- a structure you can build that gives +25% growth."" Whoop dee doo. It's a step back from MOO2, which had some gut-wrenching tech choices, such as a much better targeting computer or a building that gave a huge bonus to research.

4. Too many flat, bland bonuses. Most of the buildings are just +1/+2/+3 to some yield. Building structures on asteroids and gas giants should be exciting, but again they're just +2 to some yield. The resources on planets are just +1/+2 to some yield. (A typical small colony of 3 population already produces about 9 credits per turn; am I supposed to be excited that this planet has ""gold"" which adds 1 credit per turn?!) It's like the worst aspect of Civilization: Beyond Earth, which also had boring buildings giving + flat yields.

5. Combat is fun to watch, but it's built around a realtime, cinematic view with illegible small damage numbers popping up at unpredictable intervals. I can't connect what I'm seeing to the weapons and systems of the ships, so I feel no motivation to design my ships. This is a FATAL FLAW in a game all about decking out big bad warships with lasers and shields and running your design through the gauntlet of combat.

6. It makes my MacBook Pro overheat and drain battery like crazy, which is surprising for a game that doesn't look like it should need such performance.

Note that one issue that detracted from my enjoyment of this game is being addressed by the developer (the tedium of the polution mechanics). This is a step in the right direction. I'll have to stand by my experience with this game up to now which was overall mediocre. But if the game looks interesting to you, I would consider it a safe bet. Even if it's not quite there at the moment, it's definitely heading that way. Moreover, the developers are making radical changes to imrpove the *base game*. That means a lot to me. Many other, less admirable developers would make these improvements an excuse to release paid DLC for their game. But not this one. This developer is doing right by their customers. Support them.

8/27/2016

I've updated my review online with the first Let's Play video for the release version of the game. I outline my concerns and my hopes going forward with this game. I conditionally recommend this game, but overall (until I've spent some time playing it in its current form) will remain a thumbs down for the average consumer. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzkDpvhn4IY

8/11/2016

I'm still on the fence with the current state of the game, but I will say this: between MOO and its primary alternative: Stellaris, MOO shows much more promise as far as becoming a great game. I look forward to enjoying MOO. Alas, I think Stellaris is no longer interested in become better than it is now, which is not really any better or worse than MOO as it is now. See the difference, though? MOO has growth potential.

3/27/2016

The game is much more enjoyable than initial release. Before, I could barely play an hour before getting bored. I'm still overall a ""no"" on the game but I hope it continues along the current path. If so, I expect to change this review to a ""yes"". But my criticism below still stand. Tactical combat is better now and actually is interesting and allows me more controls and choices. Before it really seemed rather arbitrary. Regardless, I STILL WANT FUEL RANGES. This would pace expansion and make it scale with research priorities.

2/28/2016

At this point, I don't recommend MOO. The graphics and asthetic are great and go a LONG way to make me like this game. It's very lovingly crafted. But there are some things that keep me from really being interested beyond playing 1 hour.

First, the game lacks the range limitation that came from fuel tank technology in MOO2. Apparently, as long as it doesn't get destroyed, your scout ship can move from one side of the galaxy to the other. Logistical range really added a great element of balance and decision making in MOO2. If you needed to prioritize expansion, you had to research it to reach new stars. If you needed to turtle, you'd postpone it. I'm really missing this element. Instead it has been replaced with ""unstable warp points"". That's ok, but it's definitely not the same.

Next, I can't see any situation where you don't research all the lowest techs first before moving to the next teir. You would never want to ignore lesser research to go to higher research because if you do, the AI will outpace you militarily while you're saving up for something else. Anyway, especially in the early game, it feels pointless to skip a tier 1 tech to rush a teir 2. Later down the line maybe you can...

The research tree as it is now is also rather uninspiring. CIV:BE and Polaris Sector both innovated the CIV style research tree in a way that feels much more appropriate to a science fiction setting.

I'm still waiting to see how alien assimilation and race bonuses work. I would like to see meaningful reasons for both purging an alien population and assimilating one depending on a player's overall global strategy. Enslavement (not killing but not allowing to reproduce) would also be a welcome option. And of course, the ability to change one's mind throughout the course of the game.

There are a few minor issues I won't mention because surely they will be fixed. The one I will mention is that you have different ship models you can use as well as patterns. That's great, but in the build queue they all look the same. In MOO2 you could see at a glance the different ship designs in the build menu. It's a minor thing, but it *always* throws me off.

I really want to like this game. But *as of this moment* it's not very fun and definitely not worth the price.",1456700623,1478041859,False,33,1,0.492853671312332153,0,True,False,False

I purchased this game roughly two weeks ago, and loved it. There were some frustrating moments, like AI opponents all being warlike and wanting to invade my territory within ten turns of first contact unless my military capability was larger than theirs. But today's update has changed this dramatically. The update removed the ability to actively remove pollution from a world. It also increased the amount of pollution that buildings and people produce, while the buildings that are supposed to passively remove pollution haven't changed. The net effect is that developed/developing colonies WILL destroy their ecosystems with pollution and there is now nothing you can do to change that. You will be stuck periodically re-terraforming every world you inhabit.

To make matters worse, today's ""update"" has changed the gravity tolerances of all races that have a gravity tolerance that isn't total. It used to be that all races in the game could handle normal gravity. One race could handle low, one could handle high, and one could handle all gravity conditions. Now, if your race has a gravity tolerance other than normal that's the ONLY gravity level your race can handle. To make matters worse, normal gravity worlds seem to be roughly half the worlds in any map seed. Low gravity SEEM to be 25%, and high gravity SEEMS to be the other 25%. The nail in the coffin is that  the one and only building in the whole game that can change a world's gravity level will ONLY change the gravity level to normal. Net effect here? Two races in this game have been rendered essentially unplayable. There is no possible that you can ever be competitive playing either.

It grieves me to say that I can no longer recommend this game. I find myself in the position where I have to apologize to two people that I bought the game for as a gift, as well as the others I've recommended it to. DO NOT buy this game. Run.

I enjoyed this game so far and continue to do so. But I cannot, with good conscience, recommend this game in its current state. If it were possible, I would give a neutral rating. Since it isn't, I'll go with ""Not recommended"" for now.

My first impression was positive throughout: Great visuals. Animations are smooth and pleasant to look at. The interface is clean and intuitive. Not so impressed with the music (repetitive), but in general sound is well done.

For me, the biggest nitpicks started to show up, once I was well into the game (500+ turns). Most of them are minor, but they add up and leave a bad impression.

# Performance / Responsiveness

Specs:
- 16 GB RAM
- Core i5 3570K @ 3.4 GHz
- RX 480 8GB VRAM
- 500 GB SSD

Turns at this stage (500+) can take anywhere from 60 to 90 seconds. This in itself is not an issue and quite as expected. But, during most turns the game will often freeze for 10 seconds or more. Complete standstill. Animations (e.g. CPU bombing a planet) will often lag or freeze. I've even had cases of Windows offering to kill the app before it continued running.

Even after a turn completes, the game continues to be slow for some time. I estimate it takes about 30 seconds before responsiveness is ""back to normal"". Even then, CPU load varies between 40-60%. Yes, planets rotate, moons orbit, routes animate, etc., but it still feels a tad too high.

This may feel like a RAM issue, but this even happens on lowest details (~3 GB RAM usage). On maximum details the game will take ~7GB, which is still way below my system specs (16 GB). Switching from maximum to minimum seems to make no difference in terms of lag either. Neither do I see any particular CPU activity during these freezes.

Example: When another race contacts me during their turn, the animation will often stutter or freeze. It can take 10-20 seconds before I can make a choice and leave the dialogue. Clicking too soon can even crash the game.

Note: None of these issues started to manifest themselves until late game. The game ran smooth as butter, even when all seven races were still present (I'm down to three, going on two).

If you have a large number of planets, events each turn can stack several screens high (I have 180 colonies). There is no way to filter or group these events. Neither is it possible to disable uninteresting ones. This late into the game, I don't care which planet has grown or which building got completed. The ability to disable some of these notifications would help a lot. The sheer number of them makes you miss the important ones (Oops, my planet is now poisoned).

On top of that, the game seems particularly slow until you dismiss excess notifications. By excess I mean notifications outside the visible screen area. And if you dismiss them too fast, the game tends to lag and freeze (again).

The ""Empire"" list also starts to slow down considerably at this point. I feel that sorting a list of 180 entries shouldn't be this slow. Neither should scrolling. On top of that, some of the entries in the list are starting to miss icons (e.g. current production). If I would be running out of RAM, ok, but I'm not (see above).
Clicking on large fleets (150-300 ships) also tends to freeze the game for a second or two. Which is to be expected, since it displays an icon for each ship, even at this size. Which brings me to my next issue:

# Fleet management

Handling large fleets is cumbersome. If you click on a fleet you get a grid of icons, one for each ship. Let's say you want to split a large fleet into two. Left click each ship you want, then move them somewhere else to form a second fleet.

You get to see total number of ships, but not the number of ships per type. Neither do you see how many ships of each type you've currently selected.

Want to split a fleet down the middle? Better start counting how many of each type you've currently selected. Tedious. Now add in lag, and the ability to misclick and deselect everything. Frustrating.

It would be much simpler (and faster?) if the game started to group ships by type once your fleet reaches a certain size. Alas, it doesn't. How about dragging an dropping such a group to form a new fleet? Nope. How a about right-click drag to extract a certain number of ships? Nope again.

It's not like these are new concepts. A lot of games where you handle large stacks of items have these kind of controls. Yes, this is a remake but if you upgrade graphics to the 21st century, why not input concepts along with it?

Speaking of fleets, I tend to lose track of them. The ""Fleets"" view is just a list of any fleet anywhere, so it doesn't do much to help keep track of particular fleets. The ability to name fleets or place them on hotkeys would help a lot. Right now I'm constantly hunting down my attack fleets each turn, to make sure they attack.

Oh sure, the game reminds you to move idle fleets. But a fleet that is en route to some distant planet will completely ignore any other enemy planet on its route. So you have to pay attention and make sure to attack each turn. Or move a single planet per turn to make sure you get a ""fleet needs orders"" reminder.

Speaking of long routes:

Even if you are at war with another race, your ships will always take the safest route. My 200-ship-strong attack fleet would rather fly 15 turns to reach a planet, rather than blasting their way through defenses to reach said planet in 3 turns. It would be nice to have a ""shortest route"" option, because such roundabout routes aren't always obvious. Or how about an attack-move that takes you to the planet, attacking anything that tries to stop you on your way? No?

# Mass management

In general anything ""mass management"" is lacking. Which makes late game more tedious than it needs to be. Want to find all planets that have a particular building and scrap it?

- Click on planet
- Click on Manage Structures
- Filter the list
- Click on the building in the list
- Wait for the planet's rotate animation to complete
- Click on ""Scrap""
- Click on Done
- Click on Next Colony
- Rinse and repeat 180 more times

Want to find all planets that are missing a certain building? You guessed it... manual click and search.

# Conclusion

Don't get me wrong here, the game has great potential. I enjoy the nostalgia, the look and feel, the well made animations, the voice acting. If the game was otherwise great, these would make it perfect.

I don't mind the (somewhat) broken fight mechanics and fleet-strength estimations too much. Though I feel more tactical, round based, fights might be a plus.

The lack of polish and the myriad of papercuts in other areas are what break it for me. I could live with long turns (to a certain extend). But lag, freezes and stuttering to this extend is just unacceptable. What on earth is the game doing (while it should be idle) that causes so much input lag in late game?

On top of that, the total lack of fleet management features makes a military win exhausting to the extreme.

Give me a minor performance upgrade and some tools to simplify mass management I'll be happy. Until then, I don't feel like I can recommend this game.",1478030489,1478030587,False,137,1,0.858902156352996826,1,True,False,False

It is about 75% perfect, which is not bad.  The remaining 25% is not horrid, just not ideal.  The ""off-putting"" bits are some features from the old game which I wish it had not changed with so much of a nod towards a civilization type game.

If you want the old Moo II game you can get it as part of the bundle.  It is a masterful work and so I recommend this bundle above all.

The game plays quickly and smoothly.  No load issues, no performance issues, and much better than typical crash issues (Civ 6 crashes more often, for comparison).

There is no scream out at you ""wrong"" item.  Just some that have room for improvement, which while less than perfect is far from a ""don't buy this"" flaw.

Top wished for feature is that it remembers your last settings.  It doesn't.  So create your favorite custom race over and over.

Next I would love some sort of hero system (would even pay for a DLC to add this).

I like the ship design tool.  I like the option to auto upgrade.  I would like it extended to custom ships (just apply the same logic to them).

I dislike the fact that the ships have unlimited range.   So I typically play on ""spiral universe"" which puts red jump lanes in which can not by used until mid to late game.

There are about 1/2 dozen ""nearly identical"" games to this out now.  Sadly I own them all.  This one despite the flaws is the most fun to play.

The computer controlled opponents make trade or diplomatic offers that are actually fair or even favorable for you if you are stronger (unlike some similar games). They seem to be using every aspect of the game (every ship design, spies, different technology options, etc.) and have their own style of gameplay. For example, I've played a game where the ai Sakkra was colonising as much planets as he could with his huge army of frigates and destroyers while the ai Silicoid was using a smaller number of bigger ships using biological bombs (or whatever they are called) as he was trying to genocide everyone.

In my opinion, pretty much everything is balanced and there isn't any overpowered technology, ship design or race bonus. These are all good at what they do.

The game has improved massively since its apparition. The development team is clearly working hard to make this game awesome. Good job and keep it up!

Great design choices: 
1) The next turn button is the same one which points you towards any actions you need to take.

3) Travel time between warp gates? Sigh, okay.

There no really diffence between the races. Sure there are diffences like the spiders make more and the science guys get all the tech when the choice of tech come up, but they don't change one play style. Take Endless Legend and throw out the cult(one city only) and Nerco(only war) since they far out. The rest still have major traits that will effect one's playstyle like the valter have a huge boost to science, but they need science to get that extra science so they will hunt out snow areas because they have the best science or reserch tech that allow science to be gotten on areas that don't already have science. Meanwhile Master of Orion's science guys get extra reseach and bonus tech. There no drive to get one planet over another beyond what another race would look for because they are the same. The rock guys are the only race which has anything near this quailty because a lava planet is good for them while very poor for everyone else. Also the tech trees are the same for everyone. Not really an issue, but when the races are so alike in mechicals, I needed something.

The tech tree had no game changer. No moment of 'I can now make use of this.' or 'Now I have a counter to that race's ships.'. It all just numbers. That would be fine, but once again, MoO needed something good and the tech tree fails.

Planets are boring. They have low, normal or high graivty and maybe a +2 resoure that can't be improved. There also size(how many people), Bio(food) and ore(making). It doesn't matter, just build the same order of building.

Spying never been good in any 4X game I've played and MoO has not changed that. Moving on.

Fighting...................................there it no strategy here, just keep all your ships in one or two fleets, throw them at anyone weaker in numbers then you. Run away from the stronger till they have to chase you into a spacestation then fight.

They took great car of removing the only cool feature of MOO3 I could remember were the diplomatic cutscenes in which Aliens really looked alien and they were speaking some cool unintelligible giberish.  In that new version, the aliens just looks like guys in a suit.

As an old MOOII addict, I was let down by MOO3 immensely. Besides the many technical problems it had it was just not fun to play. And thats were this version excels at: it is fun. It doesn't take itself too serious, has a lot of self aware tongue in cheek humor. MOO3 was depressing. It tried very hard to be gloomy and bleak. Not in a good, mature entertainment kind of way, but in a emo teen trying to be dark and edgy way. Some people remarked it goes into Disney territory, and thats partly true. The Races are stereotypes, but than they never were anything else in the originals. There are the warrior Cat people, and the smart, arrogant, big headed Psilons ... that was never meant to be ""realistic aliens"".

There have been many attempts to reboot classic series and none have come close to delievering an updated experiance that also maintains the spirit of the origonal. I was happy to find out that Master of Orion 2016 does both.

I have played many space empire building games. I love building ships and researching crazy sci-fi techs, but most of them over complicate the experiance. There's too many things going on, the research tree is over blown with stuff, Colonies are over compicated to manage and everything is just micromanaged to heck. MoO isn't this. Everything is there, the menues are intuitive, you don't have to search for important information at the bottom of a menu that's overly busy. Colony managment is easy, ship design is intuitive and its not had to see whats going on in the galaxy with a glance at the map. Not to mention knowing who hates you at this moment. 

There are some things I'm not too hot on. It does still have the thing from MoO2 where the Sakkara, Klackons and Silicoids would rampage though the galaxy because their racial bonuses were over strong early game. Obviously with some planning this isn't a problem, but its still fustrating to start right next to them and known ""welp, better make a giant fleet"", which is my second issue. Each race has its own style of ship, and they're all fitting; the Humans have classic Star Trek/Wars looking sleek high tech looking ships; Burathi have suitablly bulky and brutal looking ships; Klackons have what looks like a fleet of giant bugs and so on, but the problem is there is only 2 versions of each ship. Both earlier games had multiple options for each class, and this means your fleets are basically going to look the same the whole game. Not that the games are going to go on that long where you'll have too many ship types. 500 turns is not long enough. I have never finished the tech tree, nor built a doom star, and even when I'm rushing as fast as I can, bam turn 500 and its over. Either things need to speed up, construction and research wise, or there needs to be an option to increase the number of turns. It does mean you can finish a game in an evening, but it would be nice to have long drawn out games.

It's so limited by start lanes, unstable wormholes that artificially divide the game until a certain tech is reached, and planets you can basically colonize regardless of species only limited by resources and food.

MoO remake is faithful to its roots in almost every sense of the word. 

The races involved & tech tree feel familliar, the playing is smoothed out & has a new if a bit simplified feel to it.
The simplification is superficial though, as your colonies number in the 6-10ish the simplification feels welcome and maybe even lacluster (MoO veterans know what im talking about, The horror of managing 20+ colonies). 
There is a  colony manager that you can set in general terms, manufacture, research etc (helps a little).

Ships can be upgraded, so thats a relief, no more Mk I s*itboats running around getting blown up. Upgrading is easy (just park your ship to a planet you controll & refit the bugger to the latest blueprint)

Diplomacy is there, more choices than most 4x games.. Pretty straightforward.. 

Spying, now this is where they made a lot of changes, you can now select what your spy does. Disrupt trade, steal tech, etc etc.. There is a whole tree for that now.. 

Combat: Realtime, felt odd at first, but after a few bouts it works.. Weapons are arced so you can manouver your little buggers to ""bite the bears ass"".. Wont work so well in big fights (naturally) turning speed seems to be linked to the size of the ship.. 

Overall.. I would recommend it to every MoO veteran out there.. Give it a go and dont be too critical in the first hour or so.. You might just have found a jewel in the rough.. (Oh, yeah, allmost forgot to mention, the game is still getting patched, minor races for example are coming in the near future)

The negative: After playing for a while, the tech advancement is pretty fast.. (Or maybe thats just me)

EDIT: Almost forgot, the voice acting is a controversial thing for this game, personally I love it. Familiar & professional actors bring a certain charisma to the different races.. As for the controversy, people are saying that the acting took too much from the budget.. Not so from my point of view..",1476017080,1476047366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was hesitant to purchase this game based on many reviews, but I do really enjoy it.  I do believe it's shelf life is relatively short unless they bring out some major updates or expansions soon.  Some of the positives that I really enjoy about this game is that games go rather quickly.  I enjoy the level of management meaning.  I don't enjoy games that bog me down in the details of every thing.  Ship design is done well to keep it easy, but there are enough choices that need to be made to make it interesting.  The game is beautiful, and the voice acting is pretty good.

My primary negative is that the races don't feel all that different.  I also think that custom races start with too few points.  I think if they gave custom races 2 more points it would retain balance, and make the game more fun by being able to design your own take on the races.

 In essence this is a steamlined freshed up version of the legendary Master of Orion 2, it has superb production value, and what it does, it does extremly well making it a genuinely fun game.
 And that is preciesly sort of the main problem of this title: yes it does everything beautifully, but it doesn't do that much as it's missing some key features the previous title had such as:

- Lack of heroes
- Lack of an end game attack on Antares 
- Missing races which in turns offers less race customisations
- Lack of Goverrnments
- The battles are in real time, which for me is totally fine, bur can be seen as a negative for some people

A good deal only for casual players, or to rekindle old MoO-memories without much available play time. The game looks good and starts very accessible.
If you're looking for a deep 4X experience, look elsewhere.

Explore (yawn) - scouts without range limits plod through a circular galaxy to map the stars. Rarely a reward beyond some credits or a vessel. Meeting races early to reap in trading boost.
Two other setup options separate sections of the galaxy until midgame. Prevents early diplomacy and stresses expansion and research.

Expand - planets operate separately. Their properties matter most in the beginning. Some good, close fertile planets boost growth excessively, while hostile environments cripple colonies. 
Much later in midgame, solar systems may pool their production and planets specialise more.

Exploit - planet food and production slots are limited, with small spread and decreasing yield. Works only well at start, in the long run technology levels out differences. Planet size matters most.
This is far from the old system where the galaxy might look completely different according to your race.

Exterminate - Stationary defences add initiall resillience, invasion tech is delayed. Using star lanes feels more like combat along mountain passes than in space.
There's tactical decisions and challenges. Still battles failed to excite me. Went to just calculate combat in the end. Invasion looks unfinished. Conquered planets don't revolt.
In mid-game, portals may connect a side's systems, specialised shipyards churn out fleet. Travel in enemy territory stays slow; mopping up a war becomes a drag.

Science - Instead of independent fields of research, we get a Civi tech tree with crowded nodes. The frowned upon old choice system is consciously reduced to a few select applications. 
This means that more than 85% of technology can never be traded, stolen or conquered but must be researched instead.

Money - main source is population tax, with trade second. This is probably the biggest design change, as the forerunner used industry for taxation. Money and production were interchangeable then. No more.
All ship upgrades can no longer be produced but must be bought, and there's no alternative to a large population base to fund your buildings or excess fleet.

My brand's canary chokes on several features, mechanisms and concepts that often match the forerunner just in name.

UI problems pop up in midgame and with huge positions. The game increasingly reacts sluggish and information is missing. MoO2's UI could handle 100-planet empires, MoO can't.
Zooming into a planet looses the strategic view. Event list can't be scrolled, when overflowing you must klick through the least important items first. Some events pop up first, ignoring your selection. 
Planet list can't be sorted by production type, to e.g. check fleets in construction. Planet uniformity makes sorting by resource (food, science, production) way less usefull. And the list goes on...
All this is known and unadressed since EA 4

Diplomacy is listless. Incoming offers can't be put on hold and checked, no counter offers possible. Swap charts without knowing what you trade for is the most frequent offer. 
Get an embassy. Trade and research deals have to be continually refreshed, with the AI later often too broke to accept. Cultivating AIs is possible to get access or alliances. Otherwise the AI is simplistic with no real grasp of reality, demanding when ready to strike, or crawling when currently involved in another war.

Espionage mostly consists of offensive spy micromanagent. Some Intelligence; stealing of the 'choice' techs is best done at lowly, undefended outposts, the rest is sabotage.
Sabotage works like a separate game, after succes the victim can't react, e.g. can't attack a revolting planet but must wait it out. 
Defense is static by race traits or expensive buildings, or dispatched spies, without a good view to coordinate. 

Races - Most predefined ones work, but use way more perk points though than a player gets for a custom race. Race differences are noticeable, but very timid. 

Ship customisation has some wellcome improvements (like scout autoupgrades or the UI layout). On the other side a convoluted system obscures this. 
Payload is consumed at rates differing by class by essentials. A 25% payload extension consumes part of this for itself. And so on. You can't just compare the numbers displayed.
This also hurls another wave of micromanagement at the player, e.g. each new drive is slightly bigger, often forcing a ship redesign. 

The final result is a wasted opportunity - a good looking time waster, not without appeal - but too shallow and boring for me.",1475330232,1475330232,False,56,5,0.723143458366394043,2,True,False,False

- Galaxy map zooming is an issue.  It's either too close or too far away.  This makes system exploration and ship movement very clunky.

So in short in MP you really just manage planets.

MP Settings are not persistent. So if you save a game and load it up again races gets jumbled and private games become open with no recourse to lock them down. Say hello people!

The best thing I can say and the worst thing I can say about this new version of Master of Orion are one and the same - the game does nothing particuarly wrong. That's also known as damning with faint praise.

The Essay Version:

The Positive:

The MOO series is a venerable, beloved (except for #3) gaming franchise that still remains the peak of the genre in MOO2. I remember buying the first one. I remember sinking many hours into the second one. I remember cursing the third one. Naming any game as ""Master of Orion"" is going to instantly invoke comparisions and criticism. I'm not going to compare this version, feature for feature, versus a 20 year old game made when gaming was different. That is counterproductive. If I wanted to play the original I am sure I have the disks around here somewhere. So how does this one play?

Well, MOO does a lot of things right. The first thing any player will notice are the production values. Voices by Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Dwight Schultz, John de Lancie, Alan Tudyk and more give the game a lot of flavor. There are some that are annoying (the Alkari scientific advisor comes to mind) but the overall effect is wonderful. 

The interface is crisp and sharp. Any 4x player can jump right into this game without a major challenge because the UI is spot-on. Many modern 4x games create cumbersome interfaces that interfere with the game. For instance, I'm a Distant Worlds fan (a couple hundred of hours played before it was ever released on Steam) but the interface is terrible. Master of Orion handles things wonderfully and there's no guessing required.

The graphics are beautiful. Everything from the art of the various races to the look of the planets has been done in top-notch style. There's probably not a better looking 4x space game out there (note I said space because I love the art style of Endless Legend). It's kind of cool to just look at the spaceships flying around your planets in the planetary screen. The little touches are nice too, like if you drag population from one production to science you can shake the little icon. 

But the real meat is in the gameplay. Distant Worlds overcomes it's cumbersome UI and less-than-stellar graphics to present a complex, challenging gaming experience. The strength in MOO is not in its complexity but in it's simplicity. It's a throwback to 4x games in the 90s where extraneous features weren't added. There's a lot to be said for the design of MOO in that it presents a straightforward but challenging 4x experience. I feel that in MOO my decisions count and I'm not overwhelmed by so many choices that any single choice feels trivial. The choices here have weight and that lends itself to giving MOO that all-important ""one more turn"" feel that so many other games do not capture.

A couple of other positives are the pacing and a lack of bugs. Pacing is important in a 4x game and many of them drag on for too long (Civ V, I'm looking at you) where a player must spend 5-10 hours in ""mop up"" mode. MOO's pacing is quite nice in that once you know you are in a strong position it's quite easy to then wrap up the game and start another. As for bugs, YMMV but in 30 hours I've not encountered a single bug. Not a crash, not a sound glitch. My hat is off to the devs for creating a solid game.


The Negative:

With that said, everying in MOO-Land is not perfect. As I said before the game doesn't do anything particularly wrong. And while simplicity is nice, this is game that needs more meat on its bones. In almost every area there are obvious design decisions that could and should be taken to add a little more complexity and a little more strategy to the game. This is a game that could really, really benefit from enhancements by the devs and/or a very open modding community.

For instance, diplomacy is done OK but so much more could and should be added. Not to mention that there needs to be tweaks to how opponents react. Each reacts to things very much the same way and thus it takes away from the AI races' personalaties. Not to mention that severe hits for turning down a war declaration need to be smoothed out.

Furthermore, there needs to be some effort made for players to specialize. Right now your planets all end up building much the same things. There should be unique buildings for different biomes, more specialization in ship design, more specialization in the races, more specialization in esponiage (which is a particularly under-baked system)...as it is there isn't enough ""strategy"" in this strategy title. Give me some unique buildings, unique planets, unique races, unique wonders and then let me create a unique strategy to conquer the universe. MOO doesn't do this and it's probably the biggest failing of the game.

Another area that demands improvment is the combat. The battlefields are too small, too sterile, too limiting to be of any use. While I'd love a return to turn-based combat, that's not happening and I can deal with that. But give me some good options in this real-time world to create a unique attack pattern, the ability to play cat-and-mouse around a planet, use an asteroid belt to shield myself from incoming missiles, etc. Combat in MOO is an afterthought and right now is just best autoplayed when it could and should be a key component in the game.

Finally, this universe could use a little more life. Exploration is dull and should be a far more engaging process. I am not speaking of an artifical limiter like more pirates but some way to slow expansion, more goodie huts and simply a more interesting exploration phase. It's a big universe out there and exploring it should feel more ""star trek"" where every planet has a story to tell.

There also needs to be more events and minor civilizations (which were removed). I want to trade with minor civs and use them as pawns in this large chess game. I want to have to prepare for a pirate invasion (once I've had time to build up my military) or perhaps uncover a race of homicidal androids who are hell-bent on making the universe their own. A player should be faced with difficult decisions and events that they need to react to outside of their grand scheme. MOO does not do this and it really hurts the game.


The Overall:

As I started off, the best and worst thing I can say about MOO is that it does nothing particularly wrong. That ""just one more turn"" feeling is the ultimate arbiter in a 4x game and MOO has it but it could and should  be so much more. I've rarely, if ever, encountered such a solid 4x design that cries out - SCREAMS OUT - for some new, well thought-out features to take the game from a status of merely competent to be considered a wonderful classic. MOO has the potential to do that but it's up to the developers to make that happen.",1474811639,1474912332,True,8,0,0.595986664295196533,1,True,False,False

- done something interesting with the battle system. The current implementation gives you so little control that I auto resolve almost every time. That is in sharp contrast to the very involvng battles of MOO2.
- fleshed out the spy system. Right now dealing with spies is almost like busywork and could have offered so much more. Why not let spies level up - and make them more hard to recruit (it feels like spy spamming right now).

They don't pirate. I know the pirates in earlier games weren't amazing, either, but by now the pirates should have some function other than ""screw up the early game"".

That's all they do, literally. And this is the design philosophy for this game: add something to slow down progression, otherwise the game is too easy.

The pirates never pirate. They don't take anything. They destroy everything they can, and otherwise just provide fodder for no reason. There's no diplomatic interaction with the pirates, even tho it seems an obvious idea to be able to buy them off or pay them to attack an enemy, etc. Nope. They are just randomly spawning units that fly directly to their death over and over until they've sufficiently weakened your defender to kill it.

It's so damned *boring* and predictable and not fun. Anti-fun, if you will.

Farms harvest food, so why not wood cutters, mines, manufactucting, and assembly plants ect. to deepen the building of fleets and weapons to keep it from being a game about quantity over quality. 

Human race survives better because of diplomacy and staying out of untimely wars.  Research, and stealth aren't nearly as competative to mass quanity right now. 

Research.....split up research tree's to keep it from being a 'research everything first' ftw.....
Being really good with lasers and,  energy should be competative  to expert mass drivers and armour builders but researching both takes too much time.  

Have a separate tree for racial only benefits and society perks.  Phylon gets their own science building techs, Humans get diplomacy techs, Bulrathing get terraforming techs, Crag get elemental harvesting techs, ect...

I love the game.. I have played every incarnation of MOO since it came out. 

I am not an expert but in the past have always played at the 'normal' difficulty or one harder and dont reasonably alright.

In this incarnation, I have had difficulties and not sure why. The diplomacy is very one sided in my experience.  The AI always seems to want much more than they offer.. even the races like the Klackons and Silicoids that are supposed to be repulsive and suffer a minus to diplomatic negotiations. Which is hilarious if you think about it.. what makes a race repulsive to a galaxy of differing life forms?

I don't care for the spy system.  It just doesn't feel right. Im constantly harrased by them shutting down research and production for 10 turns or poisoning my food. Having anti spies everwhere does not seem to help. I have not tried the Darloks yet so I have never gotten past gathering data with anyone; while they are constanlty crippling my planets.  Its just 'uninteresting' to me.

The graphics are nice... not what I look for in a 4x game, but it really is *cool* to have large fleet battles having my destroyers taking out all the AI frigs whilst my cruisers hurl heavy missile fire on their capital ships.  The DOOM star is f-ing EPIC! Using Guardian weapons is great too. 

The 'State of the Galaxy' stuff was interesting the first couple of times.. kinda funny seeing the antics of that male? robot anchor.  But now I just skip it because I can see the info in the victory path screen.

The differing ships for each race is nice. The Silicoid rock ships and the classic 50's UFO shapes of the Psilons...

Tactical battles are fun. Don't ever let the computer figure it out for you. 

I am not sure what more I could want from the game... it isn't MOO2 but its nice. If they fix some of the imbalances, make the diplomac and espionage more engaging some how...

+ High profile talent carries forth excellent voice-acting production, giving more character to each race.

Not every singleplayer game has to take a dozen hours, with the wide array of customization options you can engineer a campaign that lasts one gaming session or one that can last days.  Your choice.

Like most of the MOO title technology trumps all so the Psylon are still the goto race for most players, but if you don't choose that race you can still do well in a singleplayer campaign provided you stick to your racial strongpoints.

There is still alot of work that can be done and optimization to come (lithovores come to mind, nothing in the game is designed to accept a player race with lithovore trait yet) however the game is READY TO PLAY at this time.

Pros:

Graphics are very good 
UI is well done
Tech tree is acceptable
sounds from past games are still present reminding you of the games linneage.

Cons:

Diplomacy is very weak, Allies are aloud to spy and sabatage on each other.
Spy machanic is terrible, Planetary security level seems to have little effect
What happened to the Hero characters you could hire from moO2?
Pirates are little more than a nuisance, they need to be more of a threat
you can only create a few ship designs
Custom race attributes points are too restrictive
Where are the Antarans, this a huge oversight.

I like the starlane concept, it is similar to Ascendancy (yes I am old lol) Some don't like this machanic, I like they included a stargate tech to skip long starlane travels. In MoO2 there was a way to send a colony ship to a planet while you were in the view planets menu. That has been removed and it should be returned to the game.

4] not all ship improvements need a refit [ dautless is auto, not a mod to refit]

298050,25503180,76561198008466188,0,17,2156,0,2156,1473868015,"First off, I am ashamed to say I haven't played the original Master of Orion game (I sadly missed back in the day, and have had too much on my plate since to give it a play. I hope to rectify this problem soon). However, I have played Stellaris, the Galactic Civ games, Sins of a Solar Empire, Endless Space, and several similar games, so I feel comfortable talking about this genre.

What I enjoy most about this game are the personalities of the alien races (I've played as humans and Balrathi and enjoyed both), the presentation (the space battles are exciting, the art is nice, and the music is really good). Even though I'm not planning to play through another match anytime soon, I did have enough fun learning the ropes to recommend it on that basis.

There are, however, some negatives, especially for those familiar with the other games I mentioned. For instance, troops and ships do not gain experience or level up, nor are commanders or admirals that level up as in Heroes of M&M. True, you can upgrade ships as you learn new techs, but the lack of an experience mechanic meant that I never felt much emotion for the ships in my fleets. I have become used to being very protective of my military in other games (such as Civ) for this reason, and I missed the mechanic here.

Secondly, I am concerned about the difficulty level. I played two ""huge"" maps on normal difficulty, and in both games, the pirates were so puny as to be a mere nuisance. Likewise, when I encountered the aliens, I was able to easily conquer them. I'd like to flatter myself by saying it's because I'm such a pro, but, alas, I know this isn't the case. I should've been defeated or at least seriously challenged until I had properly learned the game. To be able to win so easily was a downer for me (and, yes, I know there are higher difficulties, but to me ""normal"" should be a baseline, and I don't like the idea of handicapping myself to compensate for a poor AI). I was never able to use my ""Doom Star"" or death star ship, either--another minor gripe. By the time I was able to build this juggernaut, the game was over.

Thirdly, the game feels underdeveloped in some key ways. This is most obvious during land invasions. I can excuse an indie dev for limiting such sequences to a static screen, but here it just feels cheap. If the game offered more compelling planet invasions (or at least a handful of nice cut scenes like the ones for the colony ship landings), I'd be more forgiving. But towards the end, I felt like I was just killing time until my troop ships finally arrived on the scene. 

Finally, I think there are just too many techs. The tech tree is extensive, but not nearly as finely honed as Civ. There was always something to look forward to that would make a difference in gameplay, but there were simply too many that just offered minor stat upgrades. I slowed down the learning pace in my settings just to keep from being distracted by them (as well as the GCN broadcasts). I would rather have a third fewer techs and have the remaining ones thus be more important and hard-earned.

Overall, though, I enjoyed this game, but I must admit that I prefer some of the games I mentioned before. If you're bored with Civ, Gal Civ, dislike the ""sector"" mechanic in Stellaris, the real-time of Sins, etc., definitely consider this game. I can't speak to how well it captures the magic of the original Master of Orion, but I tend to doubt it since that game is widely regarded as a seminal game of the genre. In short, I don't regret my purchase, but I don't feel enough was done to really set this game apart and make it something truly special.",1473895870,1473896096,True,7,0,0.61788707971572876,2,True,False,False

It's not. It's also not bad, there's just not a lot too it that 4X gamers haven't seen before, and other games are doing space based 4X bigger and better. Galactic Civilizations offers a MUCH bigger, more customizable 4x space experience. Even older, lesser known titles like Distant Worlds have New-MoO beat in terms of size and scope. It pains me to say it, but there's nothing here but a vanilla 4x game. No scenarios. No campaign-type play. Not even a hint of a story. Sure, it's got some big names doing voice over work and some of the graphics are pretty shiny, but as any gamer knows, your game needs to do something better than it's competitors (of which there are many in 4x land), and New-MoO doesn't.

Maybe via expansion and update this game will become better but the bottom line for me, in a short review format, is that there are quite a few titles that are doing what New-MoO wants to do, and doing it better in many or all aspects of 4x gaming.

Your ""ALLIES"" will be stealing/hacking,  contaminating, striking and revolting your planets no stop. You can't counterdemand any request the AI made.
   Espionage: The AI have a lot better chance than you even wit a security level 5 or getting your spies cought even when their security level is ZERO. 
   Buildings: Some building just don't work ""Space Academy"", ""advance Spy center"" and others. Or don't really give the bonus as the info box said.

It's a little part familiar with a few small adjustments that are overall neutral to the original experience.  For those who have played the originals, I will share some feature comparisons for you to help decide if you will enjoy this addition:

Things that were removed:
-Antaran attacks against the top player (I really miss this)
-Branchless research trees
-Distance restrictions on space travel (and fuel research in general)
-Turn based combat
-Unique characters to manage colonies or ships
-Racial government traits

Things that were added:
-Warp gates (all travel between systems must go through a warp gate)
-Command points that limit the fleet sizes (no more bloat warfare in space)
-Economic Victory Condition (in addition to the research, military, and council win conditions)
-Factory ships that build system upgrades (such as star fortresses, artificial planets, etc)
-Snazzy graphics

Some things are still present that probably shouldn't be, such as space monsters, the obnoxious robot news broadcasts, and the espionage system.  All of these things are even more time consuming and pointless than their previous incarnations.  Fleets can't skip systems with space monsters anymore to reach distant planets because of the warp gate restrictions.  The news broadcasts are rarely interesting or relevant, but still play at regular intervals if only to force a quick comparison between empires (which is viewable at any time from the menu).  The espionage system is MUCH worse, spies are trained automatically, but must be moved manually, and have to complete several tiers of spy activity before important tasks like stealing research are possible.

The one feature about research I appreciate most is the research choices.  In classic MoO, each tier of research had several choices and you could only select one.  In the remake, you get most of the research each time you make a discovery, but there will usually be two or three extras you must choose between.  Creative is still a good boost, but not nearly to the degree it once was.  Being uncreative is a race trait that is actually quite playable.

In closing, I would like to share that the real-time combat system a LOT of fun.  The pace of combat is very good, ships move at a respectable pace that caiters to strategic thinking.  It is not at all a click-fest, weapon systems fire automatically and there is little need to micromanage.  The scale of ships is better as well, titan sized ships truly dwarf everything else in the area.

POSITIVES
Nice graphics and cut scenes
Modern UI
Smooth transitions and scrolling
Tech tree display is very nice/well done
Pleasant music
Good sound effects
Excellent path to victory timeline graph

NEGATIVES
Few planets in each system
Multi-ship fleets appear as one vessel despite zoom level
No multi-player manual combat
Only one tech research at a time, few paths

Overall nothing really bad but not exactly innovative either.

I would have liked to see a few things different. First, because of its relationship to the Wargaming company, I had hoped to have battle occur in the manner of World of Warships or World of Tanks. Likewise I had hoped for the ship customization that is used in those titles to find its way into this game. Upgraded modules, signal flags, pennants, ammo options, etc.

The espionage system has tons of potential but is handled very simply. It would be amazing to have a few espionage cut scenes and some more detailed choice trees. Perhaps specialization of operatives? Maybe some tactical missions that allow players to control the spy?

This game is competent and has a modern look, but there are more interesting options to consider. 7/10",1473715058,1473715058,True,1,0,0.480938434600830078,0,True,False,False

For starters, there is no readily accessible manual.  Not a huge issue, really: you've played one 4X game and you've played them all, and there is a ""tutorial campaign"" provided...which appeared to last for about 4 turns until it just assumed I've got everything.  Again, not a gamebreaker, just a bit of a put-off.

The game itself is the gamebreaker.  Initial attempts at a playthrough resulted in many resets as I slowly figured out that the AI will destroy my ships without warning if I happen to blunder into ""their"" territory (which isn't really marked during the early stages of the game), yet will merrily cruise right through my own star systems with their unarmed scouts.  Several of the special attributes granted to the various races in the game (or to your custom race builds) don't work; specifically, anything which says it grants a technology, doesn't.  

The UI is clumsy, to put it kindly: at the beginning of a turn you are inundated with alerts on the right side of the screen, letting you know any time a planet's population grows, or a construction project is completed, or a threatening fleet is nearby (even if it's just the space eel that's happily flitting back and forth between the planets in a neighboring system), or a technology has been researched, or a crisis is going on anywhere in your empire, or...you get the picture.  On a small map this became an issue in the late game; I can only imagine how bad it would be on in a huge galaxy.  So you've got this notification telling you that your capital has just grown in size, so you click on it and see that it's also finished building whatever it was building (exactly what that was is not displayed on the planet screen.  Anywhere).  You plop your citizen into whichever slot you want him in, click on the empty build queue, choose a new project, click on that, click on the button to close that screen, go back over and click on the next ""alert"" icon...and end up right back on your home planet screen, because that was the alert letting you know that it'd finished building whatever it built.

Every time you research a new technology which grants any new weapons, modules, improvements, or whatever for any of your combat ships...hoo boy.  First you're going to click on the screen letting you know that you've finished researching whatever and letting you know what you can do with that technology.  Then you are automatically going to go to the ""blueprints"" page to change your ship designs...all of them.  With every new tech.  Which merely involves clicking on the desired ship design, then clicking on the ""edit"" button, then clicking on whichever hull slot you want to change, then going back and forth a couple times because it doesn't allow you to compare the old weapon setup vs. the new one, then finally figuring out exactly what you want & will actually fit into the hull, saving it, and...doing the whole process again, for each individual ship class.  With.  Every.  Tech.  You.  Research.

Then you will inevitably run into the bugs.  And I mean the good ol' fashioned bugs in the software, and not the insectoid race in the game.  Once upon a time those were ironed out before a game was shown to the public.  Then progress meant that they were fixed during live beta tests with volunteer gamers.  Now, you're offered a convenient ""Report Bug"" feature right there on the in-game options menu.  No, seriously.  I discovered that if I clicked on a specific alert, it caused an infinite loading loop in the game.  I discovered that if I go for a technological victory and opt not to build the final piece of the game-winning item in the first city screen that happens to open...well, that option is gone.  Forever.  Kind of annoying after 450+ turns of gameplay.

Others have pointed out that there ~are~ good things about this game: the graphics are beautiful, except that after the first couple times you see the same cutaway showing your colony ship landing on a barren planet, or the leaders of each race teleporting onto a platform in the middle of an asteroid belt to cast votes for galactic leader, or the robotic news team letting you know about the latest disaster to befall your empire...well, you're just going to be mashing the escape key to skip them.  Many technologies that you research cleverly give you the option of unlocking this ~or~ that, with the various items geared toward specific game strategies...but this promising aspect of the game is undone by the fact that you can then go back and trade with other races to gain whichever capabilities you didn't choose (or play as the Psilons and get all of them).  The ship design tool can be interesting, and offers you the ability to cater your blueprints to counter a specific threat from a neighboring race...until you get to the end game, and it's just a matter of cramming as many doomsday weapons as possible into your death stars.  In the end, this is litle more than a diversion which I can't see myself putting more than a dozen gameplays into...and even then only if they fix all these gamebreaking bugs.",1473568576,1473568576,False,61,1,0.628929257392883301,1,True,False,False

Originally I had given this game a resounding no for its lack of adherence to the moo formula but I have to hand it to the devs for listening to their community. They fixed the racial traits, random race picker, tech tree issues and many other things. This game is now far closer to the MOO formula we all know and love. And while I'm still not a huge fan of the RTS ship combat I understand that this is a new entry in the game and they have to mix things up somewhere. If they just carbon copy moo2 with updated graphics then its not a new entry its an update. I do really like what they have done with the pollution system on this version though. In other MOOs a portion of your production was lost to pollution clean up. In this version you have to burn turns of production to clean up your pollution. You have to ballance between production and clean up. The one major thing that I think is still missing is the ship refit feature, in previous moos you could take an outdated ship park it at one of your planets and spend production to refit it with more modern tech. The only way to do that in this version is to spend mass amounts of BC which makes it almost not worth it. I'd rather sacrifice my old ship to the guardian and build a new one in 20 turns then spend 2800bc on an upgrade. Would be nice if i could spend production on that instead of money.

The early game is exploration and discovery, with several turns going by between actions other than ship movements (playing on Prewarp, which I always do). The GNN events bring me back to that as well, although I was surprised the first time I saw a whole other race (Mrrshan) wiped out by a supernova! 

Later in the game you become more cautious, consolidating your gains or taking advantage of your opponents' weaknesses to attack them. It's fun and exciting and I enjoy it thoroughly.

I don't prefer the combat system, as many have stated, so I just put it on cinematic unless it's a close battle that I think my human brain needs to participate in. Most of the time, though, it isn't. 

The AI seems fine, nothing extraordinary. No complaints or accolades yet.

All in all, if you liked MoO2, you'll like this one. If you're a MoO2 purist, though, believing that any successful sequel must copy it exactly (except updated graphics or what have you)...then maybe not. Although it really DOES feel like that to me, honestly.

That being said, having experienced the disappointment of Master of Orion III (and I know the game has its fans, I'm not one of them), and having experienced many disappointments of poorly redone classics, I was also majorly cautious. I decided to get the ""Early Access"" version after trying it out so that I could follow its development. The Early Access versions were certainly fun, but their flaws were also apparent, which made me concerned about the actual release.

Now that I've played the release version, I can say that they've managed to quell my concerns. Once I learned some of the mechanics of this version of MOO (mostly deciding how to prioritize using the colonists to properly research/farm/build), I found a much greater appreciation of the game. I'm in the process of figuring out what weapons work best on my ships, as well as how to deal with being bullied by the Silicoids. After doing some reloading, I blew up their fleet that was surrounding one of my planets. Very rewarding, while I also learned the tactics so that I won't have to reload in future playthroughs.

My biggest complaint is the lack of turn-based space combat. I *loved* that mechanic in the original Master of Orion, so I greatly miss it. I also feel like they needed to be clearer about some of the effects within the game. For instance, they don't fully give the details behind the properties of the different biomes (for instance, the food production per cell or the different cell availability. It was much more readable to look it up on the MOO Wiki). So there are other concerns that have popped up, and I'm curious to see how the AI will stand up to the test of time.

Overall, I'm enjoying the game in the same way I did with MOO I & II. This is not to say that I think the game has lived up to those versions yet. I do need more time with the game before fully comparing it. However, I can say that I'm really enjoying the process of learning & growing.",1473239098,1473244932,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To summarize my impression of this latest incarnation (wish I could just call it MOO4), I'd say 7.0.

There are many aspects that are great ... I find the voicework by various well-known sci-fi actors keen and enjoyable including Michael Dorn (Worf from Star Trek: TNG), Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from Star Wars) and Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly and Serenity).  An amazing amount of features and tidbits are carried forward into this incarnation from MOO1 and MOO2 including elements of the technology tree, race customization screen (though bizarrely -- and really frustratingly, one of many unexpectedly lacking features that reduce my rating of the game -- not able to retain a customized race between games so you have to re-create it each time from scratch, particularly frustrating in multiplayer) and all but one of the races (the Terrans, not to be confused with the Humans -- the Terrans are basically evil humans) are carryovers from the first two games though some MOO2 races are notably absent -- the Gnolams (gnomish folk) and the Elerians (dominatrixes).

Unfortunately, the interface has not been improved -- in some aspects its taken a step backward from all predecessors -- and can be cumbersome in terms of how many buttons you have to click through to get to things you want; using the technology tree as opposed to a one-deep technology, for instance, requires clicking on the science screen from icons at the top right, then a 'View Technology Tree' button at the bottom right, then scrolling sideways through the tree to find the tech path you want before finally clicking on teh tech itself.  You have to do this every time you finish researching the 'tech path' you previously chose -- you can only click on one tech to pursue; it will automatically select the requisite techs to get there if you haven't researched them yet, but you can't shift+click another tech to queue afterward and you will have to start this process again after finishing the one particular tech and its requisites -- including, yes, re-opening the technology tree and the tree always opens all the way to the starting techs at the left; the tech tree is several screenwidths across so you will have to scroll more and more as the game goes on before you can pick a tech you want.

While its okay in single player, this really consumes time in multiplayer.   So do animations like colonizing planets -- there's no option so far as I have found to prevent those and if you go through heavy expansion, you may find yourself unable to colonize planets when your colony ships reach them because of everything you need to set up on a new colony (and no, there's no copy-and-paste-able build queue ... and the build queue is only 5 buildings/ships long -- I recall it being much larger in MOO2 -- which means you have to fiddle with your build queues much more frequently and it gets too cumbersome to manage in multiplayer much past 20 or so colonies).

There are also frequent crashes and bugs ... I find, sporadically, one particularly building for some reason cannot be built after researching the tech even though it should be; this bug persists between saves.  On one game, I was unable to build terraforming -- so I could not terraform my planets; on another, I was unable to build Robo-Miner.

One frustrating missing feature of multiplayer is locking players to the civ they start in the event (more like eventuality) the game has to be continued from a save -- so when a host reloads a multiplayer game due to a crash or folk just having retired from a long game to continue another night, random players connecting in will be assigned the civs that previous players had been playing and block the original players from being able to play them ... seems silly they wouldn't code in a 'lock' of some sort so only either the original player can play the civ, an AI or if the host decides to open up that civ for other players, but as it stands you can't really stop this from happening except to ask the new player to change to a different previously-AI-controlled race or leave the game.

Overall, I like the game, and I do recommend it to fans of the series.  Its nowhere near as bad as MOO3 ... but don't expect it to quite be at the level of MOO1 or MOO2; it has some shortfalls and some bugs.  If you find it on a good Steam Sale, and you are a fan of the series or at least the genre, I definitely recommend a grab.",1473211703,1473211703,True,46,1,0.798643529415130615,5,True,False,False

1. Pollution. The way this was implemented means you have to micromanage everything, since the autobuild doesnt care if the planet biome drops a level.

2. Micromanaging. I am fine with this, but the way its done you have to control EVERYTHING it seems like every other turn, which in small empires is fine but once you hit 10/12/15 planets or more...beware.

3. Combat. Not only is there no tactical combat, you cant even tell your ships to fire on a certain enemy ( they will spread out to fire on all enemies of that class instead).

4. Tech tree. The tech tree was ""streamlined"" aka dumbed down. There are very few ""choice"" techs anymore, and most of those are no-brainer choices anyway. So no trading for other techs or stealing them, since everyone has the same tech.

5 Spying. Since stealing tech is almost worthless, the best way to use these forced to micromanage spies is to put them on a planet you control for counterspying. If you really want to use them, you had better have a better tech level than the enemy, because otherwise they WILL get caught almost always before their mission is done (missions have timers, but there is an rng every turn to see if they get caught).

6. New Colonies. Since a colony can starve pretty quickly on the planet you just landed them on (whether its a barren or a gaia), youd better buy a food prod building or have 2-3 population transports right away to put there.

7. Star Lanes. Bottlenecks that make the game less tactical, more, build more ships to win.

8. Diplomacy. It seems like the devs ripped the diplo right out of civ5, aka all other races hate you but hide it ( As of the last update, I have had a full ally declare war on me because I deported the spy he was spying on me with).

9. AI. The Ai in this game is bad. Just horrible. They are really stupid about every single thing, and then when you get ahead  of them they cheat to even it out ( On harder difficulties, that means they ""make"" 20-30 ships in one turn on one planet to even out power).

just...damn.

I nearly cried playing this, it brought back so many memories of playing MOO2 with friends. The art, play style, everything, is a perfect homage to the classic. This is a long overdue overhaul imo and worth more than I paied for it. Buy the collectors edition imo, it was worth it for the retro style fleets and terran race choice.

I can't wait to get my 10 yo playing it so we can conquer the galaxy together. (or destroy each other, never know :))

This is what most MOO2 players expected from MOO3 I believe. It certainly is what I was hoping for way back when. And this game delivers. Seems stable as well, I haven't played long (yet) but no crashes or graphics glitches or anything.

Devs, well done and thank you for doing this right.

In my opinion, wait to a very good rebate to buy this game; I originally bought it in early access at full price because I wanted to support the devs and I don't regret it, but if you want to invest your money in a good game, this one is not for you, beside all the flaws and things that I kept writing to the devs through all this time, now that they had released it for real I played it again to a great disappointment as it seems that all the feedback the gamers gave for months were ignored, beside the previous things I reported now there's another list (with things pointed out before):
- No control over scouts and colony ships design (as in MOO1, 2).
- No need to research technology to colonize extreme environments (that gave some advantages to different races in the game and gave more strategy to research, as in previous games).
- Linear technology research with no different technologies for different races (again, that gave more strategy decisions and sense to spying technology from adversaries).
- If player changes the production (no matter if it was a mistake) all the previous production is lost (say, you had 10 turns producing something, bam, lost, start from zero again).
- No previously saved games list, if the user wants to overwrite a previous saved game it's necessary to write down the name again (don't use complicated save names!), if you don't overwrite you'll need some time to browse saved games and delete them if you don't want to pile up a lot of unnecessary files.
- No way to change colony names.
- Scouts and colony ships can't withdraw from battles when unescorted (idiotic game design).
- Scroll zoom deficient, there's one point when you jump zooms.
- Crappy ship design UI, the previous one (from months ago) was better, and until now there's no way to know how well your ship will do, when upgrading technology you actually downgrade the ship (another great idea from the devs!).
- Idiotic just 4 ships design slots available.
- Space battles are pure crap (sorry, but I can't describe it in another way).
+ Overall performance is good (unless you start, load and exit a game, those takes ages).
+ Some of the original spirit of the game is there, but devs keep ignoring gamers and how awesome the previous (1 and 2) games were.

In conclusion:
- Unfortunately for the devs, they chose 2  great games to update them (or to base their game), and ignored the things that made them great (maybe for the franchise's new gamers it'll be fine).
- Save your money (this game isn't as MOO1 or MOO2, I had that hope but now it's all lost); if there's some 75% plus disscount then buy the game, until now the only great things that I've got from this is the digital artbook and the soundtrack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far so good! Until now the space battles system doesn't convince me so much, but the rest is very good, a wise combination of the old good things and modern gaming!

Update 1: my saved game has disappeared! And there's no ""Continue"" option neither. When saving a game that was previously saved there's no way to select it, forcibly one has to write the name. Take notice devs.

Update 2: The planetary invasion is somewhat basic and honestly I expected something else than watching numbers and random explosions, it's supposed to be infantry+mechs fighting on the surface of the planet! At least in the original MOO they had the animation of soldiers facing and exploding.
Once the game totally crashed when loading the saved game.
Another thing that's bugging me is the turn limit for a game, is it only for the EA version or it'll be like that forever?
The ship design is somewhat not good, the devs can visually add the weapons bays for the player to decide where to place them, or some sort of real ship customization; though, the option to update the ships to a new model (when orbiting planets or battlestations) is awesome!

Very disappointing.
TLDR: game is oversimplified and bland.
          (  the poor ship combat and loss of real weapon differnces from MOO3 is what kills it for me.)
          ( Saddly in this MOO beam and mass driver weapons funcition almost identical,  Fighters bombers and missle almost identical.  Where as in MOO3 each weapon had its own unique flavor among mass driver, laser , plasma, missle, fighter, bombers intercepters.)

(PROS: easy to lean and play since its so simplified.)...
             

This game turned into an oversimplified version of master of orion 3.  I feel like this is what MOO3 would look like if you wanted to make it into a mobile app.

Ship combat is stale, the battlefield is so tiny ships weapons cover a quarter of it.  Making maneuvering and scouting pointless.
In MOO3 you would design ships to fit rolls in fleets including specialized point defense ships, bombers carriers, scout fleets (since the battle field was large enough that you would have to scout out enemy ships.)   

The tech tree was interesting in MOO3 because each play through you would get different techs you wouldn’t get auto fire, enveloping, miniaturization,  on every weapon you would work with what you had and strategically trade for what you wanted.
MOO3 had a real economic, population growth simulator not little guys you drop around 3 choices.  ( MOO has some differnce in techs with each playthrough just not the extend of MOO3 and not in weapon mods.)


I don’t find the great voice acting adds to the game, the click of the klakons or beeps of the meklar conveyed just as much and gave them real personality instead of everyone speaking English. 

MOO3 had horrible game breaking bugs, but its scope was amazing, the creativity you could use with ship and fleet design.  The real difference in weapon functions including ranges optimal damage range accuracy fire rate for point defense was so much more interesting.
In this MOO I have had the enemy ship AI go straight across the battlefield tell they hit the “wall” and just stop they didn’t even rotate to aim their front facing weapons at me multiple times. ( I have also had a couple combat freezes and large fleet battle lags)

I do feel like it was a mistake calling this game Master of Orion however. It shares many similarities with its predecessors and I feel it's fitting to say it is a game in the Master of Orion series. The problem with calling it Master of Orion however is that long time fans and veterans will expect almost an exact copy of Master of Orion 2. These two games a very different and objectively I would say that this game is better overall. Of course nostalgia plays a factor and people may be frustrated to discover that this game is different and not realize that many of these changes are for the better.

I could go on and on about various specific parts of the game but pretty much anything I could talk about fits into what I have said above. 

Tl;Dr: The game is very well made by a developer that cares what people think. Long time fans expecting a very close copy of Master of Orion 2 won't find that. Instead they will find a new and exciting game that is heavily inspired by the games before it.

I was a big fan of original series. So this one really reminds me the old good MoO, except now it's more casual. Graphics are nice, not so agressive after CPU power, runs smooth on my macbook pro retina 15 on max settings. I wish the music wasn't cheesy epic orchestral with slight electronic touch, but something more space-orientated, like Jean Michelle-Jarre. Yet the game is kind lacking something, universe and AI are lifless a bit, maybe there should more life and details in the game, on the other hand, I had really nice two days playing the campaign, but I wouldn't play it again. Let's say it's my tribute to the series and my teenage days. If you'r looking for a big universe strategy with really flexible diplomatics, resources and military system, look somewhere else. If you'r after casual simplified ""civilization in open space"" - give it a try. Hey, you get original series as well, pay your tribute to the game history at least.

I have a love hate relationship with 4x games and often get the feeling that they all offer the same gaming experience. You get tech trees, alien species, anomaly bonus crates and a thin veneer of a story which is fluffed out by how you go about your galactic business. Weather it’s uniting factions with your diplomatic hippy powers or crushing your enemy’s with fleets of alien shit kicker ships. You can pretty much do as you will. 

Master of Orion or Moo as it’s funny acronymic title is okay for a 4x title. I see it as more of an entry level 4x game. It has nice cut scenes, fairly in-depth tactical space battles and a Klingon traitor doing the voice overs. The problem I had with the game is I just couldn’t get in to it. After the first opening moves (or turns) everything just seemed to slot into generic 4x. The thing is I’ve played Distant Worlds which is a huge real time 4x game. Okay DW has graphics that would make a C64 blush but it has enormous depth and customisation. I’m not bashing Moo but just warning seasoned veterans of the genre that Moo in my opinion won’t satiate that galactic empiric feel you get from other 4x titles.
So on to the obligatory pros and cons:
PROS:
Michael Dorn
Nice art assets and animations
The races are pretty well thought out but limited
A solid entry level 4x game

CONS:
Generic 4x gameplay
Pretty limited tech tree
Not enough ship and general customisation
Evil human race is locked behind paywall? (I could be wrong)

I’m giving it a positive review because it does exactly what it says on the tin. The tin is subjective though. It may be a tin of glorious Heinz baked beans ready to be lovingly poured over some toast. Or it’s a tin of all day breakfast that you scarf down after a drinking binge that should have stopped 4 days ago.

I will recommend the game but there are some things that I miss from the old game. What I miss the most is that the custom race option only has 10 points and the other already made races have more points and access to more custom options. This destroys what I thougt was so good and fun in the old game and gave it so much replayability. Now you must choose one of the prefab races or accept to have worse(fever points) race then the rest of the galaxy. They even make it worse by limiting what you can put togheter(if you are creative you get 25% research and access to all the technology, but cant chose 50% research to go with it...), I also think that the ekstra resources are in % instead of a whole one(+1 research or +2 production) a bad decision. The main thing by chosing these bonuses is so you will get at edge quickly, something the total resourch times some procent delivers late game.

I'm an old-school MoO fan, having played hundreds of hours of both MoO and MoO2. No 4X since MoO2 has captured me like that game did, because they all made fundamental mistakes or oversights.

I did not have high hopes for this game, because the previews looked bad, but I was very, very pleasantly surprised. This game actually does have the MoO2 spirit, and almost all of the important stuff is there. The radical race differences, the simple yet effective economy, the ship design, the battles - it's all there. Some of it is streamlined, in particular the battles, but for the most part the important bits are intact.

If I had to complain, it would be that they went slightly too far in the streamlining of the tactical battles. Realtime is fine, there's a wide variety of weapons and modules, and taking control of the battle does make a difference (particularly whenever torpedoes are involved), but I just wish they would have kept the shield quadrants, the subsystem damage and the ability to board ships.

Other than that minor complaint, this game is great.

If you're a fan of prior Master oF Orion games, playing this raises a lot of fun little nods to them. Everything from the reprised races from old games to the fact that the colonization music is the same tune as its MS-DOS ancestor. The people that made this game definitely knew the Master of Orion series.

Other reviewers here have brought up very valid points, however, regarding how this doesn't embody the spirit of Master of Orion. No free range travel, making various drives and fuels boring and inconsequential, overall simpler. Star lanes make things very isolated, and present a very different, in a much simpler way. Technology tree is very straight forward, even if you've got the illusion of choice, you're very likely to just be picking the same tech everyone else is, and unlike the prior games you eventually can just research everything (outside of very VERY few technology categories where you pick what effect it has and have to trade with another empire that picked the other), overall the science track is much simpler. Combat is very straight forward, with none of the dynamics of missile counter measuring, and all the jazz with boarding ships with tractor beams or assault shuttles, making for a simpler tactical battle altogether.

You'll notice a common theme, here... Everything's simple. Very... Easy to grasp and just click through without much thought or care.

That's when I realized the real issue I have with this Master of Orion reboot. And why I also still enjoy it. It's simple. Easy. And really is just a lot of playful references to the older games.

Presently, I just play the game when I'm on downtime at work, or need to break the monotony of studying. But if I want to truly sit down and enjoy a game? I'd sooner just go for Master of Orion 2. This game sooner belongs on a tablet or cell phone, with how simple it is, and I'm seriously wondering if that's the idea they had at the start.

Overall, I enjoy the game. But if you want a real TBS experience, I'll much sooner recommend ANY other Master of Orion game.

Issues

The tech tree is very repetative with no real innovation, just 25% more +1 dmg and you don't really decide what to research you just work along the tree.   Often attepting to pickup just production and planet techs, researches everything; guns, shields etc there is no way to focus a ""tree"" like other games.

All races share the same tech tree and have very little variation in racial traists outside 25% bonus in X to make them unique.  The one race that doesn't consume food (like every 4x these days) is the only Unique trait.

The AI is hideously dumb and not very agressive, You have to try to provoke combat in most situations and then its simply a matter of defeating 2-3 fleets and GG you won. now you spend 50+ turns playing Whack-a-Mole on planets that spawn a single frigate.  The game ""ends"" in 1-2 turns of combat.
Increasing AI difficulty simply makes them cheat and build faster.

There is no real tactical depth, the Combat is very simple, the area you fight in is too small to play ranged tactics and ships respond poorly to commands, about the only tactics involved is making sure missile vollys don't overkill small ships.
The ""ship builder"" is the most simplistic thing I have seen in almost any 4x that basically boils down to, do you want direct fire weapons or missiles and upgrade your ships armor/shields x% every tech level.
Unlike most games where a well built design can outclass multiple designs of the same production value this game feels like you simply pick what colour the lines seen in combat will be.

Govening is poor, when you get a large amount of planets its quickly annoying to spam production, the game stops after a build queue of 4 as if we are saving memory space for consoles? Autobuild seems to randomly pick somthing, there is no large scale tools and managing fleets is just annoying.


I feel like the developers of this game need to play some ""MOO clones"" and implement all the innovation and amazing features that have been developed over the past 10 years.
It feels more like a High rez texture pack for an old game

The micromanaging of your colonies is made fairly easy via the way events are presented each turn.

MOO4, which by the way, I really wish the folks behind the game just called it MOO4 to avoid confusion.  It's ok to have lots of sequels, look at Final Fantasy!  Anyway, MOO4 swaps out the MOO2-turn based space combat engine to a RTS style engine found in any other game of this genre.  The cinematic camera in the space combat is annoyingly bad, with no way to control camera, or battle.  Top down seems the best way to watch space battles and naturally it never ceases to entertain to watch large fleets unleash death upon each other.

Overall MOO4 feels and plays a lot like MOO2 in my opinion.  It doesn't really bring much new to the table in terms of comparison to MOO2, but at least it's copying from a proven game.  All the familiar races and elements, right down to the types of random events feels taken straight from MOO2.

The main distinction is the overlying goal to reach Orion, a legendary planet populated by an advanced race. Other goals for victory are the typical ones we're used to..Diplomacy/Combat/Economy.

What struck me about the game is the amount of polish that went into it..I honestly had no idea Wargaming was developing this title and they've done a fantastic job fleshing out the world and giving distinct flavor to each race. Some are more keen to combat, others are more predisposed to economy, while a few are downright unpredictable and unstable.

The art and animation is fantastic. They even went so far as to add fully fleshed out space battles you can manually control with cinematic angles (Although auto resolve will be the solution 95% of the time). The dialogue with the races is really cool, and having to keep in mind the nuances of each race versus the planets you colonize also gives the game depth I haven't encountered before.

The U.I. and settings and whatnot are all nice and clean, I haven't experienced that many bugs, actually since release I haven't ran into any bugs at all. 

A.I: they've improved the A.I. a lot... I recommend playing them on a normal/hard difficulty because that is when they're best and decent. if you play it on Very hard or Extreme then they just become super aggressive and for some reason they're all out to get you. but I've been playing it on Normal, the A.I. make fair trades, I don't have to feel like my back is gonna be stabbed.

Star Lanes: I still think Star lanes are really retarded, I mean I can play with them, but oh my gawd, it can become really hard to defend planets if your fleet is way out of position. and you don't get jump gates till mid game.

Military outposts: they're still one of the most useless things in the game. they can't defend worth crap. they're just there to be able to upgrade your ships if you don't want to go all the way back to a planet you control. I was disappointed when they didn't change it.

Races: Each race has their own unique traits and whatnot which is good, cause in early access, it actually didn't matter what race you played cause they were all pretty much the same lol.

The game isn't very fast paced, I have 2 monitors and I like to play it while I watch something, and if I need to go do something its nice that I can go take care of that and not worry about being attacked. or something happen without me knowing.

The diplomacy, contrary to Civ 5 actually makes sense (AI don´t backstab you 3 turns after they propose a declaration of friendship). Although you can read the AI´s intentions pretty easily in Civ5 after 20+ games.

The new build options for planets and spaceships enhances the game in my opinion.

The only part of this game that I am disappointed with is the space combat (I haven't tried planetary combat yet).

I enjoy all kinds of space 4x games, from MOO2 to Stellaris to Endless Space to Distant Worlds to Stardrive to... you get the idea. This game may not be as ""complex"" as some of those I mentioned, but what it focuses on it does quite well. Incredibly strong presentation and a smooth UI make the game feel easy to grasp and fun to play. Late game colony management can be a drag, but I find I have plenty of fun playing on smaller maps.

I started with this series back in '96, sitting on my father's lap as he played on our old Aptiva. Master of Orion 2 was one of the first games I owned myself and I got hundreds of hours on that in my childhood. So I am a bit biased towards the series. 

However in regards to this product I can say that I am quite happy with how it feels. It has much of the same feel as the older members of the series, with exploration and fleet development being a major part of it's overall appeal. The graphics are lovely and so far I've had no framerate issues to note. The game runs very well and crashes have been non-existant, even though I've only had it around a day. The characters all feel nicely animated and as though they have a personality profile that helps to flesh them out. The voice acting probably helps a great deal with that (John De Lancie, Mark Hamil, Michael Dorne and other big names) to the point where when the humans deciede they don't like my expansion and roflstomp me I find myself yelling a definitive ""Damnit Q!"". 

Now for the cons of this piece. 
One of the commonly noted issues with this instalment is the lack of certain features that the previous games had. I can understand that, Heros were a useful feature that I do miss somewhat. As well as missing a few races if memory serves me. However in both cases I am willing to overlook them due to one simple fact. This is a reboot, it isn't Master of Orion 4. So when looking over everything one must keep that in mind. Things tend to be a little different in a reboot if a series.

The game has a good deal of polish, and it looks and sounds absolutely great. The gameplay is stuff you've already seen before, nothing really stands out about it, standard 4X fare. However, I will say that my major complaint against the game is how simple it is, AND the complete lack of any strategy in regards to planetary building.

When I say simple I mean simple. The tech tree is simple, your ""choices"" are pretty easy to make, economy is really easy to get going, things like that. What bothers me the most, though, is that there is no planet space you need to worry about as far as building things, so there is no strategy involved. Usually in games like Stellaris and Endless Space and the like, the planets you colonize have spaces to build improvements on, many times with a certain property to them, that forces you to make choices on what to build, when, and where to put them. The planets in this game have infinite space, and thus the determination of whether to build them comes directly down to 1) whether you really need/want that building on that planet and 2) whether you want to take the hit to your upkeep (don't worry you get tons of money anyway). There is no restriction to any of the buildings except having a few that need certain planetary properties (you can't build X unless the planet is mineral poor, for example).

Finally there is a good bit of the combat that needs to be adjusted (why can enemy scouts just ignore my blockades? why are space amoebas so freaking ridiculous in combat? why can't i see my ship health in battles anymore? WHY ARE MY BLUEPRINTS LIMITED TO 5? Blueprints should have no number restriction), but as I said, overall it's a respectable game. If you enjoy 4X games that aren't terribly deep, this is a good one to get for 30 bucks.",1472571250,1472571250,True,9,0,0.485624939203262329,0,True,False,False

I think Wargame is on a good way to create a appropriate follower. I'll personaly change it to thumbs up, if Wargame consider some very simple changements.

I played the old Microprose Game Title and I was addicted.
Here my Pros and Contras for a Game which is really nearby Master of Orion 2, but which is not able to beat the old Masterpiece:

+ Interface looks nice and polished, the most menus were kept.
+ Game looking beautiful now
+ Basic Diplomacy (except of little changements) were kept. I was so lucky about that!!!
+ You are still playing on a Galaxy map which looks familiar to the good old one.
+ You'll have the oppurtunity to cutomize your race!! Thumbs up for this.
+ You are still able to design your ship and Equip it with special systems and Weapons.
+ The most of the buidlings are quit the same as in MOO2, except of some new buildings. I cannot really give a good feedback to them yet.
+ All old races have been considered
+ Early Access works without any crashes, MP wasnt tested yet.
+ You'll have now the oppurtunity to upgrade your ships (Blueprint and ships which are at colonies) immediately after absolving the research project. Nice!
+ You are having now several Victory conditions (similar to Civ Games). Score, Conquest or be eleceted at the council of the galaxy.
+ GNN are great!

Now the Cons:

- Colony Management changed a bit, not much. I still prefer the Management of MOO2 and the handling, which was much better and easier in 1990!!!!
- I really tried to like the new ""tactictal"" combat. Instead of the old MOO2 it's not turn based anymore. It's now real time strategy, which looks and feels a bit too simple. On the one hand you'll save more time during the combats, which is basicly good for MP sessions. And you'll notice your special systems and weapons from you designs. On the other hand, you feel a bit helpless. Because even if you gave an order, the ships are going to attack automaticly, all ship categories are gathered to a group, you cant select a single ship. Then, you are not able to create real tacticts like in MOO2. Where you maybe activate or deactivate weapons and systems, because you was waiting for the right moment to use them. So, I'm still not sure, the only thing I know that it hasn't satisified me. Good thing: It looks beautiful and for a ""Wargame"" there is a lot of action, nice feature is the action cam ;))
- Ground combat = sucks! Completly unspectacular, uggly without any action or sth. Wargame....are you serious? Hope you're going to improve this one.
- The baddest thing is, that every game you are going to start is limited to 500 turns. Yeah, you are right WTF???? Why you guys are going to set a limit for the game? PLEASE WARGAME JUST SET THIS ONE OPTIONAL!!! WE SHOULD HAVE THE DECISION!!!
- Okay, it's early access at the moment, but the game felt a bit too easy and a bit more to fast than MOO2. I played the Bulrathi empire and I've been very rich (very quickly I have to say) and I haven't less technologies than the Psilons had. And, I just had 3 colonies the Psilons had 8!!! Everybody who played the old MOO2, knows that this would quite impossible then =). Even If I fought against them, we had the same technology. They usually should be very strong when they having 8 colonies. Old players will know what I mean.

However, I like the game anyway. But, as long if the cons will be exsists, I cannot give it a thumb up. Wargame, well done for now, you are almost nearby finish a very good follower! Please don't fuck one of the best Gameplays ever been created in history of PC-Games.
Hope that was helpful for all of ya out there in the stars =P.

FINAL REVIEW: GAME = SHIT",1456484337,1472554138,False,262,15,0.600965917110443115,15,True,False,False
298050,25246511,76561198007610552,0,32,6897,0,4509,1584663453,"After 74.5 hours of playing (also hours more during the early access stage) I can say that MoO is a mediocre 4x game. It mimics most of the features of its legendary ancestor (MoO 2)

I am sad to give a negative review for this game. It is certainly playable and you'll have fun with it. But for a 2016 game, I honestly expected much more... Here is a list of pros/cons.

Pros:

1. Excellent cinematics and voice acting. 
2. Good language support.
3. Graphically well designed races, race animations, in game research assistants.
4. Fluent game play.

Cons:

1. Repetitive technology tree. Too few creative weapons or technologies. Most of higher tech nodes in the tech tree just replicate the early nodes by just improving parameters. +1 production buildings become +2, x damage weapons become 2x damage weapons and so so. In some tech tree nodes you can decide from 2-3 different technologies but the better tech is in most cases obvious.

2. Although the races are parametrically different (some get bonus to diplomacy, some have better spy mission success chances, some have better ground troops etc.). They all share the same technology tree without a single variation. This makes the game very dull and uninteresting.

3. The game is very uneventful. Unless you provoke the AI (by colonizing near their systems) you can be in good terms with all AI races for the entire game. The AI does not challenge you. No random events that may cause a political crisis between your race and some other AI race occur.

4. The AI is not smart. They do not colonize the choke points systems to protect their borders. They do not make clever attacks or defense. They just throw whatever they have towards you (2-3 fleets at most) and once you deal with em they are left completely defenseless and broken. 

5. As with almost all 4x games, harder AI does not mean smarter AI but rather cheating AI.

6. There are no strategically important bread and butter resources in the game. The game needs resources that would end alliances. Resources that will cause every race in the galaxy hunger for them and eventually cause galaxy wide wars. Resources which will enable you to unlock technologies, build buildings and new ship hulls etc.  

7. Governing complexity is not scalable. After you acquire 10 or more planets you'll quickly realize this. There is no abstraction method in MoO (such as Stellarsis' sector governing) which will enable you to govern huge empires.

8. I do not understand why the number of different ship classes you can design is limitted. I might be ok with a limit (like 20-30) but 5-6 designs? Seriously? Why?

9. Some annoying bugs which should have been solved in early access at least a year ago. For instance you cannot save your keyboard mapping if you change it. Everytime you enter the game you have to change key mappings again and again. Also the game may lock up or crash after long lasting space battles.",1472553028,1472553297,False,147,4,0.787300050258636475,3,True,False,False
298050,25244312,76561197986340537,0,4,4891,0,2414,1493668685,"+Great production values (great leader voicing and event narration, design, animations, art style and music)
+Runs smoother (and gets through AI turns faster) than any other contemporary 4x
+Has that Master of Orion je ne sais quoi
+Core mechanics are well-balanced and solidly built

-Some mechanics are obtuse (""+6 damage reduction""? ""+4 city tiles""?), and there's no in-game encylopedia or help system
-The advisors are all great at first, but they mostly recite the exact same two lines every time you unlock a new tech (and those same two lines will be ~90% of all the spoken dialogue you'll hear in a given game)
-AI is terrible, especially around diplomatic deal weighting and colony capturing (I've yet to even see one build a troop transport - they always just bomb colonies to death), and indistinguishable between civs
-Manual battle mechanics are kludgy and unresponsive at best
-General severe lack of variety in the experience (galaxies mostly look the same, AI races mostly behave the same, everyone says the same 2-3 lines dozens of times, colony micromanagement gets more and more repetive the later you get in the game, etc.)

Overall it's a solid-to-good successor to the previous MoOs, it's beautifully polished on the design level, and the framework is all in place... but it's also a highly repetitive experience without a lot of extra muscle on that framework. Providing mod support and better customization options (especially colony renaming and starting condition options) would resolve most of the issues I have, though, and move this up from a hesitant recommendation to an enthusiastic one.",1472543213,1472543213,True,9,0,0.495587289333343506,0,True,False,False

- Star lanes.  The game doesn't let your ships fly just wherever you'll order them to go within a maximum range.  Instead, there are definite paths between star systems that the game chooses for you.  You must follow them, creating a strategic layout that is remarkably worse than MOO2 offered.

Video is great, voice acting is great, and with all the different racial traits, there is a ton of replay-ability. Lots o fun.

On a side note, the selling point for me on this was the voice acting. Am I the only one that feels this is a lost art for dev's? You can have a great game, but if the audio puts me to sleep, people will not like it. Period. That is not the case here.

And i must say im having  a lot of fun. Its a classic 4x but very well made and balanced. Your every turn decisions feel important, and each aspect of the game seems fleshed out and polished.So in points:

+Great long tech tree with balanced techs and giving you a feeling of prgoression and achievemnt.
+ Your every turn decisions feel important.
+ The AI seems good so far.
+ The tactical combats are fun.Ship designing is simple, but very important with meaningful decisions.
+ Teh galaxy has enough planets/anomalies/monsters to be interesting and make you expolre to find the bestest planet for your next colony.
+ The  defense stations/modules are well balanced and allow you to organise a defense. I noticed many strategy games nowadays have problems with it.
+ There is a lot of winks towards old MOO which is nice for old farts like me:)

- I dont like the art  direction . I cant say it isnt well done in the style they choose, but for me it got that fantasy pastel  a bit childish vibe that annoys me. Cartoon is fine but you can go Ghost in the Shell cartoon or Gummi Bears cartoon. Assuming  a 4x strategy is aimed at a bit more mature audience , the style baffles me.

So for me its a very good game and im glad i bought it.It just all the parts mesh together to create a really fun and relaxing experience.

1- The very strong art style annoys you even more then me.
2- You hate starlanes

Once again i find myself immersed in the world of MOO with its haunting lonely vast expanses of space where home is onboard a huge colony ship or other space faring vessel. Exploration and discovery abound in joyful moments of finding a planet that can be colonised in all its mysterious beauty waiting to reveal its naked reality to you. Then there are asteroid fields which can be mined as well as strange signals in distant places where advanced technology or some anamoly which may or may not be a threat could be waiting to be discovered.

You will encounter other races alien and inhuman looking who may or may not become your ally depending on ones skill at universal politics. Of course there could be some who because of their tempermental and competitive nature will turn on an ally just for the fun of battle such as the flirtatious and easily offended Mrrshan ruled by the feline Empress Marupa.

Then there are the space pirates who are a constant threat but with a bit of exploration and bomb capable space ships you can discover their bases of operation and blast them to stinking fragmented bits of charred flesh.

Taxing your empire for much needed coin to run it is a necessity to be able to afford the research and development to create the habitats, weapons, ships, electronics, population motivating items etc etc needed to grow and florish across the universe as well as be more attractive to other races as an ally when making many types of agreements, trading tech, paying tribute, giving gifts etc. Just make sure not to tax your people too much at the wrong time or you may find them rebelling as they unleash their displeasure until you act one way or the other.

Graphics bring the infinity of space along with the bliss and horror of new worlds. Alien races are a sight to behold capturing a 1990s science fiction quality as if from an episode of BABYLON 5 and STAR TREK. Battles are violent and catastrophic as scenes of ships charging full speed ahead with ballistic and energy weapons blazing across monitor screens create exciting encounters which are played depending on whether you auto resolve, give partial control to the ai or take complete command of the battle controlling your ships in battle which is wonderfully executed.

Music captures a mix of classical and 1990s science fiction ambience relaxing yet full of suspense and the wonder of discovering a universe. Hearing the insane amounts of voice acting by an all star cast who create characters who are very diverse, full of depth and unique is an incredible experience to go through which motivates me to keep diplomatic contact with them.

In that case you can ignore my complaints mostly - MOO2 was a big hit back in the day. Basically it's a well made 4X game that does many things just right. It does look pretty as ever, no problems there.

However, it's way too much like MOO 2, in good and bad. For me, playthrough feels like another nostalgic trip through the same old game, as if there hadn't been any progress during these 20 years. Same set of alien races, same technologies, same command point mechanics etc. Overpowered traits like ""creative"" have been balanced away, which is nice. Late game micromanagement has got is a little bit better but it's still pretty bad. Like before, you spend most of your time managing colony build queues, which isn't very interesting, unfortunately. The colonies are pretty much like each other, so you keep doing the same thing over and over again. I would have wished they had fixed the problem with limitless expanding being a valid strategy, but alas, no. Like before, in this game you compete with volume. There's simply no room in the galaxy for small empires, big empires do better in every aspect. Also, nothing's been done to fix the uninteresting diplomacy system.

Others have complained about the combat system and the starlanes, but I'm pretty much OK with these. The combat feels a bit more chaotic than before, but it slows down the game a lot less, which is welcome. I'm not yet sure how much you can influence the outcome with valid tactics - mostly the ships seem to be blasting away at each other until one side runs out of hit points. The starlane mechanic seems a bit weird at first, but I like the way it makes it possible to fortify your empire by building military outposts. Jump gates allow for faster travel inside your own domain.

I sincerely wish there were DLC or mods that would make this an interesting game in 2016 as well, in the way of DOTA, counter strike or long war. It'd be a shame to have all the love poured into this game to go waste otherwise. Originality goes a long way.",1472461331,1472461331,False,32,0,0.687591850757598877,4,True,False,False

well... It's Amazing! i still stand by my word on what i said in the Early Access Review!

game has improved A.I, good multiplayer... well it's an 9.5 for me!


Early Access Review:

While IS still on Early Access, like with Subnautica, this game deserves a try, even in this state, there are errors and bugs here and there, but the overall game, the overall experience, it's amazing, Amazing animations, Amazing Voice Actors, Amazing OST and an Amazing Gameplay!

After the poor showing of Master of Orion 3 the torch was eventually passed on to the Galactic Civilisations games to keep up the popularity of the space based 4X genre. The question is- does this new version live up to the lofty expectations  formed thanks to the old games? Can it dethrone the now-king 4X of Galactic Civilisations? What does this do right and wrong? 

Pros: 
The look and feel:
The game really does capture the alien nature of the Master of Orion universe- there is colour, humour and a lot to explore and do. Planets feel alive with their live preview, the ship artwork is unique and defined, while the Aliens seem just as alien as ever. It just works.

Music, Sound and Voice Acting: 
From the moment you open up the game you are met with a powerful score which harks back well to the older games. But honestly where this game shines the most is the voice acting. Don't let the poor voice acting of the launch trailer push you away, there is a star studded vocal cast which really makes you want to vary up who you play and who you are versing. People who normally prefer to always play the human may find themselves rethinking when they hear that the leader is Q from Star Trek and that by playing Humans yourself you are dooming yourself to never hear more of him. Overall everything you do seems to be greeted with more great voice acting, be it reaching a certain ending- participating in diplomacy- or beating the game through one of the victory conditions. The GNN has also got an overhaul, one I assumed would get annoying over time... it did not. I really enjoyed the live commentary of the universe and it really made me wish there was more interesting random events out there.

Living Universe: 
Thanks to their accurate recreation and inclusion of the Space Monsters and Pirates the universe always seemed alive. There was a reason to build a fleet even if you were aiming for a more passive victory type. It felt good to lock down a warp point with a super powerful starbase- defeat a space monster and claim its planet or track down and claim the elusive Orion itself. As you grow in technology as do your systems- you may turn a gas giant or asteroid belt into a planet, upgrade your passive defenses or upgrade your planets into a series of different kinds of ""Uber"" worlds. This is one area where MoO Crushes the current state of the Galactic Civilisations games- and it is likely the best reason to buy this title. 

The combat cinematics:
These are second to none- really spectacular esspecially when you are going up against a large space monster or the guardian of orion... However, the actual gameplay doesn't keep up. 

Cons:
Everything feels- Shallow.: 
The concept of ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" shines brightly during this game. For every positive point there is another system that just seems laughably tedious and ill-thought out. Sure there are a LOT of systems in this version of MoO- but most if not all of them feel as if they were half baked. Like they would have done better as a dedicated expansion later down the line. A lot of these issues will be outlined below.

Espionage:
Espionage is a major annoyance and acts as more of a penalty againse large empires instead of a functioning system. It also seems like it is heavily weighted in favor of the AI. It basically just involves the user training spies and sending them out to either their own planets or the planets of your enemies. Spies do not seem to gain experience or get better in any way beyond the points they must earn to do increasingly more annoying missions. You send a spy to the enemy? Chances are it will be caught and you will be asked to stop sending them. They send a spy to you? You MAY catch it and send it back, or your best planet with all the security upgrades may be thrown into revolt. Moreover, the weighting of the diplomacy behind it is just screwed up. You ask them to stop spying? They don't, you get spies from them again right away. They ask YOU to stop spying? Counts as a treaty that if you break basically they hate you for life. The whole system just seems incredibly tedious and gets only more and more problematic as you get a larger and larger empire.

Ship Design:
This is one area that Galactic Civilisations really just ran with once they started to take the crown. In Master of Orion there seems to be very little reason to ever create a new ship. Not only do they look exactly the same as the auto-upgrading counterparts that you get built for you.. but the amount of choice and freedom on offer is laughable. While I appreciate anything that lets me customise my units, as it stands this system just felt boring now. Not even worth using unless you really wanted to min/max. While in GalCiv 3 you can clearly see and work out what your enemy is focusing on and design a ship to counter it, this one seems very basic. 

Research:
This is not to say that the actual things you unlock are cons- certainly not. I love the variety this game offers as you level up... You learn to build and perfect planets, blow them up and everything in between. No, what I mean is the actual system of research. Most things you research have a correct answer for ""which is better"" but sometimes it is even worse to consider that they don't. While some games lock insignificant percentages behind research walls, this game offers actual tangible things which if you miss out on may just make your game more tedious. Sure, the fact that you can trade for them later is a nice touch... however when one of your traits allows a race to get BOTH of these choices for EVERY CHOICE- things get out of hand. So either you are forced to choose and trade for the rest or you just get given everything on a platter and get to use that to make yourself reign supreme. Either way the entire thing just seems... off. 

Not enough interesting events:
Events are delivered by a really interesting medium thanks to GNN- however they still manage to feel half baked. While sometimes there are cool ones- like the idea of a star going Super Nova- most of the events seem to just be ""Someone gets some cash"" or ""The resource level of x falls"". For a universe that manages to feel so alive in some ways, to feel so dead in this way is more than a little disappointing. Now I am not advocating for a morality and choice system like the awesome one in GalCiv- I just feel as if that if you want to shake the world up- do it in a more fun way. 

Actually doing combat:
The turned based strategic almost ""heroes of might and magic"" style combat found in MoO previously is gone- replaced by a much simpler real time combat system. While it does still offer more control then its nearest competitor- it does not come close to being as good as what people were expecting from this title. For that reason this is listen as a con. 

Overall:
Overall the new Master of Orion is a highly polished, beautiful and interesting game. This however seems highly marred by the fact that so many systems are half baked. What is there seems polished for sure, but what is there still seems often very tedious. Master of Orion feels like a casual and beautiful version of Galactic Civilisations. A first dip in a pool before you go on to play the more complex Galactic Civilisations. Despite this appraisal, I still feel that people will have a lot of fun exploring and playing in this world, so I must recommend it. I just feel as if needs a little more depth. Did it reclaim its crown? No. But it did certainly reclaim a much higher title then I was expecting, and damn does it look shiny.",1472448260,1472448419,True,18,1,0.605903744697570801,0,True,False,False

The good:
The alien races in the game have a loving polish to them, each one has a life to it that is both amazing and imaginative, and the acting talent that was tapped for this did a bang up job.

The game is beautiful, more than just an update, there's a streamlined if simplistist look to a lot of the buildings and ships that doesn't detract.

The sheer size on the Guardian is definitely appropriate.

The Bad - 

No governors -  noone to run your planets or you fleets for bonuses, as this became more or less a staple of the series since the 2nd game this oversight is glaring.

1/2 the races -  holding the topic of weither there was overlap between the old races aside, having a galaxy that diverse with aliens gave more than what's on offer here.

Random events -   where are they? having played several games thus far, the only things that seem to occur are the occasional population boom and a random monster sparingly,  which brings me to my next point - 

No Antarans -  These are THE signature bad guys of the series, the boogie man that puts everyone in the game in check, and they are gone, a footnote to the rest of the game.  Not having this enemy has cut out one of the defining features of this series.  The frustration I will feel if this was held aside to be DLC down the line, I Will pursure a refund, time played be notwithstanding.

The Ugly, 

Want a spacestation that repairs itself after a fight? nope, hope the shields soaked it,

Want to see the shield and Health of your ships each fight without reloading the game after one fight? Definitely not here.

How about not getting softlocked by the space ameoba because it doesn't actually destroy your ships? sorry, maybe next time.

The other alien races are allowed to shoot my scouts down for free, no warning, not at war --- What!?
Colony ships too --- ......
My fleets as well if I blockade a jump point
all of the above doesn't trigger war either.

noncombatant ships are a part of the fights if attached to the fleet ---  I really want to know who signed off on this design choice.

Yes, I am giving a lot of flak over these issues, and I feel it's duly deserved because they pushed the game out to full release with these bugs very much in the game and apparent.  A lot of how I would command my fleets in a fight depends on how much damage I see going out versus what I recieve, having to reload the game every time to see this is ridiculous.  The numbers you'll see for damage still appear, but without a total health indicator they offer no idea how well or not your fleet is doing.

Finally, if anyone feels I'm making unjust comparions to Master of Orion 2,  This company aquired the license to make this game using the IP, the comparions are I feel fully justified for this reason.

tl;dr - can't recommend until the bugs are squashed, and feels like 2/3 a game compared to Master of Orion 2",1472432981,1472432981,False,267,3,0.815383374691009521,12,True,False,False

Sadly (for me), not much have changed in the way of content and depth, research is flat and similar to all races. no race is special in any ways. biomes are just names most of the time.
No animations for ground battles (I miss you MOO II !!), planet view is the same.
Battles are solid if you control them but nothing like what I felt in MOO II.

Despite months of EA, and lots of great feedback from players, the devs made only minor changes to the game, and have now released the full game with most of its original flaws intact. I have played a number of partial games, throughout the EA process, but haven't yet had the heart to finish one.

A few of the many unnecessary flaws and limits:
- Why can't I put multiple layers of armor on a ship? Multiple shield generators? Multiple engines? Where Stardrive 2, Star Ruler 2, and Endless Space give you real freedom in ship design, MoO seems determined to limit my imagination.
- Why can I design combat ships, but not stations or civilian ships? Again, where Star Ruler 2 allows wonderful freedom in design, MoO creates unnecessary limits.
- Tactical battles just aren't real tactical. This is a deep and complex problem, too complex to outline here, but there are many deep and thoughtful discussions of this topic in the forums.
- The tech tree is bland, full of lots of incremental improvements, but rarely anything that feels interesting or meaningful. The game plays (almost) the same from start to finish.
- Planetary special resources are piddly, giving a simple +1 or +2 to research/money/production. This means that, except in the very beginning of the game, there's no reason to choose a planet with a special resource over one without. This is a huge missed opportunity.

For sure, there's some fun to be found in this game, but with such a bland design, there's little replay value. And in this age of gaming, with so many better choices around, why waste your time with something so bland?

If you really want a space-based 4x game, go for Stardrive 2 or Star Ruler 2. Both are a bit buggy, products of small teams stretched to their limits, but both are also full of genius and innovation - and that genius makes both these games far more fun and interesting than MoO.",1472224827,1472396280,False,32,1,0.540432274341583252,1,True,False,False

As you're probably well aware the latest incarnation of Masters of Orion is what is commonly called a 4X game. eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.

When you start a new game there are a myriad of options when 'creating' a new galaxy within which to play. Be it a large galaxy, small, how many empires inhabitat said galaxy, which species they are, game speed and other options besides. Meaning you can setup an epoch spanning game that could easily lasts days or weeks (it seems) to games that perhaps take a mere afternoon. I'd have to spend some more time with the varying settings to give you more details on this.

As your sweaty little fingers eagerly click your abused mouse button, with it's cursor hovering over the start game tab you'll find yourself transported to your galaxy and a single planet. From here you will manage your population putting them to work in the food industry, manufacturing plants and labs. Managing your output of food, construction of buildings and space ships and research into new technologies.

You'll eventually send scoutships out to discover new systems full of juicy (or not so juicy) planets to explore and perhaps even colonize. When you colonize your new planets you'll have to carefully manage their early years, it helps to buy (automatically receive) automated construction factories, biomes and indoor farming to help your colonists thrive and build newer structures quicker, increasing your population size and therefore food construction and research speed, eventual increase in taxes with government buildings and tradeports and increasing your fleet size with starbases.

Some planets have negative effects, such as high or low gravity, toxicity, barren, gas giant or asteroid. Eventually you will unlock techs to change all of the above into habital planets or at least more appealing to your average space colonist.

Diplomacy seems to work well, in as far as I've experienced it on my singular game I'm still going through. I don't attack the marlocks, (or whatever the hell they are) and we trade technologies and set up trade between us increasing our monies.

What does annoy me though is that when it comes to espionage in order to put an agent on an enemy planet you need to have visited it first whereas my friendly foe has no problems with this, having made sure their ships never entered my space in a couple of rather more violent forms of diplomacy. Yet they still have agents on all of my planets. Perhaps this is a racial perk as their faction is the espionage specialists. But still, it annoys me.

The space battles themselves are a bit... Meh. Still, better than most space battles I've witnessed in other 4X games.

Despite my lack of conversing with all of the races within the game, I rather like the characters I've seen so far and the 'Global News Network' droids that tell you everything you need to know about the galaxy in a fairly amusing manner and occasionally some helpful news too. Such as detailing the top three races in colonization, population, military etc. The most recents news story was several cips about a star about to go supernova. You'll be pleased to know that on the brink of disaster the weird turtle people managed to save themselves and stop the star going supernova.

Overall, probably my favourite 4X game. It's relatively complex and yet VERY streamlined. Fans of the genre should enjoy this.

Ah Masters of Orion. One of my most beloved games of all time. I still play the original game still. Even MOO2 as well and MOO3 modded. Of course a mention of Star Trek Birth of the Federation modded needs mentioned as well. The 1000's of hours spent playing those games. 

Before I go on, I played this game from Day One Early Access. I have over 220 hours if not more now playing it. I was very harsh on the Devs about their choices and decisions of the game. I think NGD Stuidos hate me :P. But I would also say I am fair and I have praised them when they did good. 

So what do I think of Masters of Orion Conquer the Stars? I like it. Is it perfect? HELL NO! Still it's a good to great game with warts and all. When Masters of Orion Conquer the Stars (MOO for short from now on) first came out in Early Acess (EA) I hated it. I let it be known what was wrong with the game. For me it was just another game pretending to be MOO but with the MOO name only. It really should have been called something else at the time I thought. Hopefully this gave NGD Studios more incentive to make the game better. Did they make the game better and improve it from EA1? I can say in my opinion, yes they did.

But I can't review a game of previous builds, I need to review the game on this build. 

MOO is a game to be played in a day (small settings) up to a few days or weeks (huge settings). It's a simple game to learn. While it's simple to learn, there is some complexity to the game, but nothing complex that you give up playing like I have when playing Hearts of Iron or Europa Universallis games. Sometimes I love playing complex games, other times I want a simplier game. Playing Civ in Space is what MOO is, and I love it for it. I am so glad it's not complex and made everything more streamlined and simplier to do. While I liked HoI and EU way too many screens and complexity that I don't have many hours in them. Maybe 10 or 20 hours each game I have while I have 1000s of hours in previous MOO games. I am already at 220+ hours with MOO and can't wait for the mods to start coming in once they are implemented into the game. I can see 100s hours more still to come.

Let's get the biggest issue out of the way that is for me the biggest problem of MOO. Combat. Tactical Combat to be precise. It sucks. I hate it. I can swallow it like a bitter pill because the rest of the game is so much fun for me. 

(Not yelling I will use CAPS to indicate my RECOMENDATIONS.)

Why is combat bad for me? I feel like I am watching combat instead of taking part of it. I hated Gal Civ series games over this, and same thing for Stellaris. I don't want to watch combat I want to take part. Combat has improved from previous EAs but still I wish there was more to do. 

First off, I don't like the Auto Fire. I rather have the ships do nothing until I tell them to do something. I think that has been fixed, but I am so use to do it now after playing over 220 hours, not sure if fixed or not. Also I would LOVE to be able to pick out single ships instead of just the fleet. 

Since ships auto fire, you don't know when they will shoot next. WHY DON'T WE HAVE TIMMERS ON OUR WEAPONS? I want information, and I am not getting it. WHY ARE MY SHIPS NOT MOVING AND JUST STANDING STILL. Again we need information. 

Besides timers to give us information I wish missles were not unlimted like in MOO1,2 and 3 but I can understand the Devs have a different vision. Still It doesn't make it better when I keep thinking the things I can do is taken out of the game. 

The ""arena"" or combat map is too small. This is 2016 not the 1990s where the combat arean is small because of limitations. WHY CAN'T THE COMBAT ARENA BE AT LEAST TWICE THE SIZE? This way at least it will give the illusion I can move my Big sized ships around and I am fighitng in space instead of a small Gladiator arena. Bigger ships need to be slower and smaller ships faster. At least now we have a choice to keep at the same speed, but I feel Big sized ships are too fast still. 

Also this would give having faster engines and what not more important. 

FOR COMBAT TO BE BETTER AND MAKE THIS GAME A MUST BUY, WE NEED MORE INFORMATION IN COMBAT AND A FEW MORE ABILITES TO TAKE PART OF SO WE FEEL WE ARE DOING SOMETHING besides just watching. 

Good things about combat, is we can pause it. (Annoying though how it doesn't pause where the camera is facing and defaults to top view or the other view which I forget the name.) Also we can speed up time or slow it down. Another great option. WHY IS IT WHEN WE PAUSE THE GAME THE TIME DEAFAULTS TO 1X????ARGH!!!!! So we can see combat is the weakest part of MOO for me. Does this make the game a No Buy? HELL NO.

***corection*** It seams there is a new options I just found out when you can choose when you pasue in combat that the view stays the same.


What makes the game good/great? Let's get onto that now.

Exploration is fun. When discovering a new system, all the planets 0-5 are blacked out. So you have to send your scout/ship to each planet to see what it is. Is this a bit tedious? Yes but it's fun. Why? Because now we have to discover a tech that will let you choose to see all planets at once. Thing is, once the tech is discovered, do you take the tech that lets you see all the planets or do you choose the other tech that gives you something else? NOW WE HAVE CHOICES :D. 

Tech tree is a spitting image of Civ V. This can be good or bad depending on your tastes. Lots of techs to discover. Also one discovering a tech, like in MOO2, sometimes you have to make the choice do I take this or do I take that. If I take that, then I have to trad for to get this. A few times they are no brainers, other times you need to think what is more important to you. This for me is a great feature.

OOPs I got away from exploration. Sorry. Only draw back I have for exploration is goodie huts. Like in Civ you can get a free unit, money or tech. Sadly the only time you can go off road from the Star Lanes is to discover an Anomoly. While fun, they are not as exciting as in MOO2 when discovering a planet and seeing what it might be. Artifact planets don't give a bonus to research but just a +2. So basically a free tech building. But now we have Gold to give a +2 Billion Credits (basically a BC think of it as a dollar). Dark Quartz for production +2 and fungus or what it's called for a +2 to food. It's a nice little bonus to make the colony start a bit faster.

So I am having fun in exploring now. I choose to go into the options menu and use fast animations for me and the AI so the game plays quicker. I am glad we get this option. While nice in the begining seein ships zoom here to there, it gets boring. After 220 hours so glad for this feature. 

What else is exciting is will this planet be an Ultra Rich Gaia planet? Maybe, maybe? Dang it's not. But OOHHHH there is some nice Rich planets with a Terra Biome. Bonus. Others a poor planets or ultra poor or not good biomes. Well we need to extend our borders and they will make good bases for our ships to repair at. 

The AI. I find it good. Really good. Yes it still makes stupid decisions sometimes. What is this a strength 500 fleet about to wipe me out, but thank god it went in a different direction other wise my game would be over. Phew. Wait a second, shouldn't the AI try and wipe me out? Dumb stupid AI lol. Thankfull or unthankfully that doesn't happen alot and I have been wiped out on higher difficulty levels. I guess playing on a normal setting the AI wants you to play more. But on extreme settings, I basically gave up. The AI woudln't wipe me out, but I swear the AI is mocking me letting me live just so they can crush me some more. 

That said the AI is pretty good. In diplomacy the AI is offering alot of trade at me. Sometimes when I ask for a trade the AI will say no, but then a few turns later will offer the same trade back at me. Now to be fair, I",1472346554,1472346705,True,118,7,0.606638967990875244,12,True,False,False

- The AI is terrible.

- The tech tree is poorly thought out, lacks differentiation on many techs, and the choices on some techs are a joke: there's one clearly optimal tech (i.e. Microbiotics vs Cloning Center) and one trap tech.

- Pointless micromanagement of things like pollution and spies.  Adds nothing to the game and simply forces the player to waste time micromanaging basic stuff.  Poorly thought out mechanics.

- Not much difference between racial traits compared to what we saw in MOO2.  The radical differences in gameplay between Silicoids and Elerians in MOO2, for instance, are pretty much smooshed into ""Silicoids don't need food.""

- The real time combat is OK, but shallow.  Face weapons toward target and focus fire.  Done.

MoO: Conquer the Stars has great voice acting from a spectacular crew.  The UX was amazingly well done, fluid design. the Empire screen is incredibly helpful in managing all your planets from a single window without having to go to each planet. 
The normal length of a game is maxed at 500 turns, I was able to complete the research victory within 425 turns with Psilon on my first game.  I had a nice mix of industrial type planets and good research type planets.  Plus I was able to terraform a couple of the highly rich planets into Terran and Gaia type planets as well.

MoO3's major short coming for me was the overall length of a game and the incredibly large amount of things to research that were added on top of what I thought was already quite large before. I remember going 250 turns into a game on MoO3 and barely making headway into a single game.  I can't remember what the max turns were if there were any at all, because I never finished my first game.  I uninstalled and went back to MoO2.  it was so bad to me.

I really enjoyed this game and will be playing it quite a lot, It runs really great on Linux by the way.

I have only played this reboot of the ""Master of Orion"" series for about 4 hours, but already I see the immense detail, time and care put into the game. Firstly, they hired top notch voice actors *cough cough* Mark Hamil *cough cough* . They paid these actors probably hundreds if even thousands of $$$ in order to have this game in top quality standard before release. 

Secondly, the actual structure of the game and lack of glitches and bugs are absolutely fantastic. The way that they designed the ship paths around stars and the way that everything was animated really made me feel like I was commanding a galactic empire. Good ol' M.O.O.1, the legendary M.O.O.2 and ESPECIALLY the godawful M.O.O.3 do not live up to this new competitor. And dont get me started on the AAA graphics.

Lastly, the way that they structured the gameplay is fan-f***ing-tastic. The A.I is so well developed that top players from Stellaris, M.O.O.2 and other strategy games lose so often to the A.I. The A.I will do the most seemingly random things sometimes, such as blowing up your space-factory when they are on the verge of defeat in order to distract/annoy you, they might give you technology and befriend you even though they are more advanced and they may even destroy you before you have researched Xeno Relations. They are just that good!

This is *especially true* if, like me, you loved MOO II and were more than a little disappointed with the follow-up releases and found yourself wishing they'd ""go back to when they got it right!"" - And they have done so in spades, with this one. 

Similar gameplay to what we all remembered and loved, but with much, much better graphics, beautiful animations and some truly well done voice acting, though some of it does get quite repetitive (every time you make a scientific discovery, your advisor says the *same thing* each and every time)

It's pretty much the game we needed instead of Master of Orion 3.

You see, back when MoO3 was announced I was very interested in it.
MoO2 was one of the games that kickstarted my love for videogames and boosted
my switch from consoles to pc. 

The horrendous ui, bad ai and terrible gameplay mechanics in MoO3 killed my dream of a more modern and refreshing MoO experience and as such left me with replaying MoO2 countless times.
Which by no means should be interpreted as bad, because to this day I still love booting up MoO2 and the original CD-ROM plus euro box are on display on my shelf.

However as much as I love MoO2, it has flaws and with these flaws it would never survive a simple remake in today's gaming world.
Game franchises of the older days like Civilization, Total War and X-COM have shown that slow paced 4X games aren't dead, but at the same time require careful updates to keep up with today's audience.

And all of these changes are usually either dumbing down game mechanics (Hi, Total War post Medieval II) or changing the franchise itself to a certain degree, making it far more accessable for newcomers (X-COM 2).

I have to admit it's not the worst approach, it's actually not even a bad one when done well.
X-COM 2 and Civilization V have shown perfectly how we can get very fun and deep 4X games that proceed to build the bridge between ""casual"" 4X and the ""number crunching"" ones.

Master of Orion 4 is such a game.
Hate it or love it, it's the Master of Orion I would play in multiplayer with people younger than me or those who had no previous interest in 4X games.
MoO2 would just make the average joe turn away from the genre with it's focus being more on the number crunching and in-depth game mechanics rather than the steamlined approach of MoO4.

Now of course it's great that the game caters to a wider audience by including those that have no previous experience with the genre, but what of the ""veterans"", those who have played 4X games since their earliest incarnations?

It's pretty simple, either you can appreciate what the game does in it's own way, or you'll never like this game.

I wrote in the very beginning that MoO4 isn't a remake of former games of the franchise.
It's a new game in the franchise, taking new approaches and changes to not only simplify existing game mechanics, but also adding new ones.

Take the change from tactical to real time combat for example.
I like that change, I also liked the real time combat in games like Imperium Galactica II, I loved the newer Sins of a Solar Empire for it's great real time 4X approach.

It's not only more graphically pleasing, but also interesting in it's own way.
Turn-based combat leaves a lot of it's representation to the player's imagination, which is enjoyable, however also confines it into a corner of the room.

To put it simple, turn based combat is methodical, more like a puzzle, while real time combat also relies on player instinct and ability to adapt to situations quickly.

They're too different to each other, but interesting for exactly that reason.

Turn based combat in any game makes me want to min-max my troops performance as much as possible, granting me perhaps the chance to turn a devastating loss into a victory by making the puzzle pieces fall into the places I want them to be.

Real Time combat fills that itch of mine to do my best possible within the time granted.
It's decision making on the fly, identify the outcome, proceed or change the tactic used and work 
with the results to prepare for the next step.

And that describes MoO4 perfectly, too.
It's not MoO2, it didn't try to be to begin with.
It's a game on it's own.

Does it have flaws?
Oh yes it does, some of which prolly won't be fixed until later and some of which are flaws of the genre itself and are unlikely to be ever ""fixed"".

MoO2 had flaws, too.
Different ones, from a different genre subtype.
Did these flaws make it a bad game? By no means.

Do the flaws in MoO4 make it a bad game? By no means.

As such I recommend to buy MoO4 to anyone who likes the 4X genre in itself and not just certain subtypes of it.
It certainly isn't a game for someone who only appreciates the number crunching Paradox-esque 4X games of this world, but for people like me who enjoy all the subgenres it'll be a good gaming experience.

Major negatives on the current build (As of 26.08.2016):
- Tactical combat maps are too small
- No tactical combat in MP 
- Tactical combat duration still feels a bit short",1472203581,1472205517,True,82,0,0.764708459377288818,1,True,False,False

Unfortunately it is a huge disappointment, serving a dumbed down 4X experience totally out of touch with why people still enjoy turn based games, for instance considering the recent huge success of XCOM. Sure, they got it to look almost as pretty as XCOM, but all the research and a lot of the ship systems you could add in MoO2 are not to be found, because they went for simple RTS combat implementation. Combat is ridiculously simple and vastly inferior to great RTS space games like SotS, Homeworld or Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. Combat, ship technologies and ship design in this game feels more like an insult to fans of the genre and few games makes ship design as meaningless and combat as dumb as it is in this game. This mass selecting clickfest where kiting the AI is basically the only ""advanced"" technique at your disposal is just not appealing to guys used to much more juicy space combat offerings both currently and in the past.

I recommend that you save your money for one of the other more recent 4X space games (Stellaris, Galactic Civilizations III, Predestination, and many more worthy of your cash), which offers a much more satisfying strategy game experience either turn based or RTS.

I had been maintaining weapon mod list thread in the official Moo forum until I gave up on the game.

This game massively suffers in three areas: combat, content, and game design which is terrible.

I am not even going to talk about the tactical battle being real-time instead of turn-based, or staranes instead of free movements, because those issues are actually trivial issues compared to what I am going to discuss here.

No, there is no tl:dr version. You can always choose to not read this.

[h1]1) Combat :[/h1]
The fact is that you will probably feel have even less control of the units in the battle than the games like Stellaris and Endless Space. Only game that provides even less interesting and uncontrollable battle is Gal Civ 3, and Gal Civ series was already infamous for such lackluster battle.

You will notice that you really do not have much control on the ship movements in ""AI assisted"" mode. You could try second option which gives you ""total control"" of the ships, which is nothing more than making ships basically immobile shooting turrets unless you order it to move. It's really badly implemented.

A good ship movements example would be games like Homeworld, where the capital ships properly make formations (this game's formations are hardly formations except 'bonus' stuffs) while smaller fighters/bombers and smaller ships move around to flank the enemy in fluent way. Despite 2016 game, New Master of Orion provides worse battle than a game that came out in 1999.

Also you will realize that you have no clue just how effective weapons or have no indication whether the weapons mods or special modules are actually working due to lack of the information. Even Stellaris provides a nice during-battle statistics such as damage, accuracy, and other useful stuffs. For Moo, this is very hard to tell due to fast nature of the tactical combat. One of the reasons why my thread was popular was that people have no clue whether the mod is working or not, and had to be manually tested each in optimal conditions.

This is already a fatal flaw, since the Moo is not really famous for 4X elements, but rather robust tactical battles. By throwing away having good tactical battles, the game is already in mediocre category.

Unfortunately, the combat is the least problematic of the three I mentioned.

[h1]2) Contents :[/h1]
The game basically lacks contents. Even if NGO and Wargaming implement minor civs back in a good manner, the game still lacks a lot of stuffs missing. There is no governors, no interesting random events, pirates are half-baked, and the research tree feels shorts even if one can consider they have changed it to Civ style from binary choice method.

The main cause of the problem is... well, starlanes. So what happened? Since NGO has chosen to go from free movement to starlane movement, suddenly there was no need for implementing techs like fuel and reactors. The problem is that those fuel and reactors took a large portion of Moo techs. Because NGO has not sufficiently added additional content to fill this void, the overall tech tree feels short and feel something is missing.

Lack of governors and/or general are really missed features and most likely won't be ever implemented since it was NGO's decision to not implement in the first place.

However, even this content issue is not the most damaging issue for this game. Again, people can change their minds and spend money/time to implement said features, or you can just suck it up since the game is a bit cheap, however....

[h1]3) Game design :[/h1]
....One just cannot fix design issues. You cannot fix it with time and money when you have a wrong idea. Try make gold from dirt, no matter how hard you try for next thirty years, you cannot transform dirt to gold.

This issue also unfortunately includes UI issues too. Here is copy-paste from my ""My verdict on new Moo."" thread regarding UI and micro-management issues caused by bad game design.

[quote]
There are so many unnecessary, tiresome micro in this game. I think the developers believe making the game micro-intensive would make the game more 'complex' or something. No, it doesn't. It just makes the game chore. Here are the examples of this super duper terrible amount of unnecessary micro.
 
 
1) Pollution mechanic : The most insidious mechanics I've ever seen in any 4X games, literally. It is as insidious as Emperor Palpatine with his master's name ""Sidious"" implies. Basically, it works like this.
 
""You MUST babysit ALL non-barren, non-volcano planets with sharp eyes or they will degrade, forcing you to terraform the planet again!""
 
Seriously, when the number of the planets goes up 20+, this just makes me crazy all the time. You know, original Moo and other Moo clones have chosen much sane way (by just reducing total production output) to cut off this unnecessary micro-management, for a good reason.
 
This pollution mechanic is perhaps one of the most discussed subjects regarding micro-management problem this game has, and yet no adjustment is being made.
 
 
2) Population : Yet another micro-intensive element that does not have to.
 
Even moving people around is challenging.
Why we have to individually move them around to properly balance planet output?
Why we have to make individual civil transport and disembark population individually in such tiresome manner? I mean for god's sake original Moo and countless of Moo clones got this one right a long time ago. There are just tons of unneeded and unjustified micro-management in population alone.
 
 
3) Colony improvement/management : another crucial element that riddled with terrible micro-intensive-ridden stuffs.
 
From EA1, we have been voicing about the fact that there are only 5 (what? why only 5? Just... why???!?) order slots available for planetary improvement building order, and the fact that we cannot make our own building order to save time in the late game. 
 
After 3 months this issue, like other micro-management issues, is rarely (more likely never) recognized despite the fact that this is the most crucial reason why people easily get 'tired' after several hours of the play. Watching a person playing this game in twitch is insanely boring and exercise in futility that forced me to turn off the channel, because of these insane, endless micro-management feast.
 
After how espionage has been implemented, I have no faith that the micro-management issues will be ever fixed.
[/quote]
(Reminder: this article was written in May. For more than 3 months these issues were never addressed.)

Sadly, it turned out that most of these issues were actually intentional(!!) When someone actually asked why there are only 9 ship design slots available, the dev said it's intentional. Just like terrible pollution mechanics, such arbitary restrictions that cause massive increase of micro-management are all intentional (a.k.a ""features"".)

This is actually a huge step back from the original Moo and Moo2. Even Moo2 had MORE building queue slots than this modern Moo. Yes, Moo2 had 7 queue slots instead of 5. Sad but true.


So, are there any positives? Sure yes, the game itself is very polished (tho Endless Space is about as polished as this game), and super expensive AAA voice acting, and surprisngly competent AI (then again, the game itself is not that complex to begin with) but none of these can overcome such fatal flaws this game has, particually game design issues.

After about two hours of messing around I got down to playing properly and found it all very enjoyable even more so as the game progressed.

Top tip......don't get hung up about what planets you colanize to begin with. Its nice to find that sweet goldilocks planet but thankfully you can eventually research planet terraforming minus the Xenomorphs....

Its Early Access but apart from a single bug which just seemed like a graphical glitch this game feels complete even more so than a lot of other released games from certain publishing houses. Its got the full support from Wargaming so its not going to vanish and is certainly worth the money.

If you are looking for something that hits the sweet spot with being just the right mix of challenge and relaxation without ever feeling stressed or too challenged then this is it. I built the 'Titan' battleship and it got destroyed by six enemy cruisers so I built ten cruisers and carried on stomping the enemy into the ground without having to reload or pull hair out. Something goes bang.......just build another one. 

There is a 'tactical' element to the game but at the minute it seems more just who has the biggest gun/guns wins. Its all relative to size and numbers as I mentioned earlier 5 cruisers can kill a Titan but it also depends on their tech level and you can use different abilities in battle but if you like you can just sit back and let the A.I do the work.

The game almost sits happily between the adult and child audience that it is no doubt targeted at but there are a notable few things that do seem more child friendly than adult and if you are looking for a hardcore space strategy simulation or even civiliazation in the stars then this will probably not quite be what you are hoping for but it is probably the closest thing to it and who knows where it might develop.

Would i recommend you buy this game right now; Yes. It feels complete even though you know when playing through it that there are certain element missing none of it detracts from the game experience. 

Running everything on max in 1080p with all civilizations and the largest galaxy I would guess that everytime I hit the end turn key it was my go again in less than 5 seconds and that was still almost the same after 300+ turns

One word of caution though; it does at times to me feel sometimes overly simple and not as indepth as it could be but then again by the time of the final release it may feel deep and complex.

This game finally feels like it's coming into it's own.
But good news and bad, i'll do bad first.

There are things I wish had been done differently. I wish hotseat was a thing, tactical combat for multplayer, (in fact maybe a more clunky and turn-based tactical combat too). The entire combat arena feels off, (moo3's was better and thats never a good thing to have to say).  

I like a bit more of a dark tone, I feel like this is a bit too cartoony.  I miss leaders, they are a small layer of customization to a game that adds immersion and rp. Speaking of RP, I feel like the space could be bigger and have more lore things going on in it. And how about more events? Where are the Antarans or whatever new big bad? Are minor races coming back? All of these things are great and more space (real estate) is needed in this game to allow a verdant RP environment.

And then you have the generic performance issues they're still ironing out, UI improvements needed, etc. 

BUT, this is a beta. And is important to remember. 
While most shortcomings will probably make it to launch they have made some moderate steps towards making this a pretty darn good game. I enjoy making my way through early-mid game and the tech tree, it looks fantastic, I DO like the voice acting very much (even you Lt. Barclay). 

The sounds are all there, the music. The videos of landing your colony ships is gold. I'd like to see more of them, maybe even a colony overview screen where it pans the area (it would be nice to actually SEE my cavernous/grassland/inferno planet) in a  similar video fashion.

There's a lot of good to find inside this game. Wargaming has a lot of potential here to go even higher if they want. 
Or maybe they'll start development on 'Moo 2...2'  and build perfection overtop 'pretty-darn-good'

The graphics, the battle mechanic and the way you can control battles, the economy, and the victory paths that you can do really are complex and fun (specially if you go with espionage).

This game is not finished by a long shot. However, it looks done and that has convinced the higher-ups to stop bleeding money and release an unfinished project. I don't recommend purchasing the game unless it's on sale or after the first one or two patches are released.

Overall, it's a shiny tablet version of MoO, dumbed down but full of tedious micromangement.

Pros-
Excellent audio and visuals.
Real Time combat & Squads provide a fix for the old combat failures (but bring their own issues to light).
Game feels like the old ones, but is very different at the same time. In a good way.
Ship design is confusing but once you figure it out it works nicely.

Cons-
Combat still has things to work out, most important is a lack of information and the lack of difference between beam weapons.
AI is pathetically weak or extremely aggressive. Mixed reports. AI has come a long way since EA1. Almost there.
Diplomacy *still* feels useless.
Random events are lacking.
Antarens? Plot? Orion system discovery?
Custom races are weak and held back by the developers intentionally.
Spying...*everything*


*Edit*  The lead dev has a vision that doesn't coexist with the majority of long time MoO fans. In my opinion, he is the reason this game feels like a tablet version with shiny graphics and voices.


Audio
-I love the audio except in combat.
- Combat - I think I heard some lasers. Can we have different audio files for different weapons please? That would significantly add to customizeability and replayability. It gets old hearing the same weapon audio a few thousand times. Engines and specials could have their own audio too.

Visuals
- Everything looks fancy.
- Then you see the same buildings on the same planets and all of a sudden you've got 30+ gaia planets with the same exact layout.  This is not important, but would be nice.
- Ships - PLEASE add many many many more ship designs. I love Psilons but why do I have flying saucers with purple paint or crop circles? That's ridiculous and is an immense turn-off. If I'm going to get 3D real 
time battles, I sure as shit want more than two ship designs to look at. Especially if I have a long range ship and a short range ship that look the same.
- Battlefields are terrible. Some nebulae gas clouds and some asteroids on a blank canvas. Cinematic view or bust.

UI
- If you've played MoO2 and other 4x space-strategy games, you're familiar with this UI.
- Combat UI - Come a long way since EA1 but would still like actual tooltips or detailed information. Works well enough however and once you figure it out it's nice.
- Ship Upgrade UI - *almost* there. Again, come leaps and bounds since the beginning. A few minor kinks to work out but for the most part works very nice.

Combat
- The AI thinks ""run in and shoot"" is intelligent. As such, creating specialized roles or a diverse fleet is useless if you don't manually fight every battle. A cruiser with nothing but missiles and torpedoes should not be rushing off to the front lines. Battleships with displacement devices should actually use them instead of lumbering along while everyone else dies in agony in the midst of the fray.
- Pew pew, shoot the asteroids! Ohnoes, they shot the asteroid I ran into three times! Pathing AI could be more intelligent.
- Ships refuse to keep their minimum engagement distance, so you end up with a clusterfuck.
- Invading is rather pointless

Research
- Tech tree is great....but feels like Civ V

Diplomacy
- I'm not sure the devs will figure out how to make a properly working diplomacy AI before release. Maybe after.

Random Events
- Few and far between. Please add more, and add a failsafe so that I don't get three or four negatives in a row while no one else gets anything.
- Sometimes really cool. Sometimes your planets get fucked over. I like it.

Specials/Monsters
- Oh look, a monster. Well, they're probably not even guarding anything worthwhile anyway. Let's just ignore them till mid-game when I can slaughter them.
- Why the F did you nerf Orions Guardian? Such a terrible idea, especially in EA7.
- Planet specials are...almost useless.
- Anomalies are cool and a nice addition, but add more of them.

Antarens
- ...wait, there aren't any?

Orion
- I love getting all four techs, this is a wonderful change. BUT YOU NERFED THE CRAP OUT OF IT SO WHO CARES. Not even worth the effort for one decent planet in the entire system.

AI
- Where's the backstabbing? The aggressive expansion? Underhanded cheap tricks (otherwise known as common 
sense to the AI)?  *There it is, finally showed up* Now fix it so we don't get mercilessly slaughtered immediately upon discovering a species.
- The AI is capable of doing well on it's own, but makes few decisions in terms of other players. As it is now, the AI won't attack me while my forces are on the other side of my empire just because...well I don't know why.
- AI needs to be significantly more aggressive in each races' respective ideology. I.E. expansionists need to expand instead of twiddle their thumbs because they were blocked in on one side. Humans should be diplomatic monstrosities and making treaties/friends/etc.

Some time ago I wrote a very negative review during the early alpha of this game. But many things have changed since then, and it is fair that I write a new one now.

[b]Interface, graphics and soundtrack[/b]

The interface in this new MOO is really similar to its predecessors. It has, however, some new tabs that are a delight for the macromanegement fans. The Empire Tab, that permits you to change your taxes, check all your colonies' production, research and food generation, as well as checking in a glimpse what each one is producing. The diplomatic menu is simple and intuitive, as well as the ship production one (but I'll go in detail about this one later). However I find that the fleet menu is useless -I literally could not find an space factory using it!

Graphics are beautiful and work very well in the MOO game style. While they are not excellent, they are pretty enough to make your MOO experience appealing. The planet zoom looks gorgeous, with the colony lights, aerospace traffic, etc. 

The soundtrack follows the same path: It's not a OST that I would listen normally, but it works fairly well with the game itself. 

[b]Ship design[/b]

The ship design is here this time, and it works fairly well. However I noticed that it has some problems; more particularly, your own designs may not work at all if you auto resolve the battles. In one example, if you design a missile specialist ship to stay behind the main combat line, you may find in auto resolve that your ship will be the first to die -as its defense values will be very low-.

This may force you to control your own ships directly. 

On the other hand, while the ship designer is quite easy to use, it REALLY needs a filter system for the weapons and systems. 

[b]Diplomacy[/b]

All right, now I can say this: [b]it works[/b]. Previously all diplomatic stuff would go like ""give me that or I get grumpy"". This time I found more interesting things: alliance requests, allies driving you to war against another ally, requests to stop colonizing, and many ways to influence your relationship with the AI. Not a really complex mechanic, but yet complex enough to make you consider the diplomatic impact of your actions. ""If I ally the terran, would the humans get angry at me?"". 

[b]Spies are there[/b]

The spy system is very nice, indeed. You get your spies, infiltrate them in an enemy planet, and start performing your operations. The problems I see: First, it is absurdly difficult to accomplish a ""3rd level"" operation. Even with the darlok and specialized in spying, I manage to accomplish maybe 3 out of 200 failures. 
I also see that the AI will never kill one of your spies if they catch it. No matter if you are at full war, they will always deport the spy back. Thank you, AI!
The diplomatic consequences of spying are really something to keep in mind. It could literally change a relation from ""friendly"" to ""Cautious"" in just one turn.

[b]Game changing: RTS space battles[/b]

And FINALLY they work properly! 
Basically, you can either full control the ships yourself or let the AI assist you. And the AI this time is smart enough! Ok, it uses pretty pre-programmed movements -battleships and bigger ships to the front, while frigates and destroyers try to flank the enemy-. But the important bit is that it really works, creating space battles that are realistic enough to enjoy.

Still, the cinematic camera is very bad.

Release date is August 25. They took into account basically none of the player feedback. Pretty much my every previous complaint still stands. All they did was squash some bugs. Their EA program was a lie and a joke - they never intended to listen to their players at all. I cannot recommend this game. Furthermore, for the horrible EA practices involved here, neither NGD nor Wargaming.net shall ever again see any business from me. Sigh... what a waste of potential. Does not live up to the name they bought.

[u][b]July 22 Update[/b][/u]: EA Phase 6 now. Lots and lots of bugs squashed... but many get reintroduced in subsequent cycles. They have still not implemented ANY of the heaps of great feedback regarding tactical combat. The combat system, aside from some ""balance changes"" is largely untouched, simplistic, and devoid of any requirement for strategy/skill. There is also still no tactical combat for multiplayer, and there probably never will be. Strategic level gameplay has seen some improvements, some worsenings, and many bugs come and gone and come again.I still cannot recommend this game. I have lost hope that I will ever be able to. If you value campaign map gameplay over combat - seek out Stellaris, you'll have more fun there. For an integrated approach, look into Star Ruler 2, Sword of the Stars, or even previous Master of Orion titles.

Should I ever be made to eat my words, I will happily do so and amend this review. Until such time... avoid this game, it is not worth the asking price, and has been a perpetual mess. I have no confidence in the development.

[u][b]May 6 Update[/b][/u]: well, they let out a patch that fixed some technical issues - which was welcome, but that's about it so far. You still can't fight your battles in MP, which basically makes MP a snore. I still cannot endorse this game.

[b][u]Original Review[/u][/b]: As of this point in time, Early Access phase 3, I cannot recommend MoO. It's actually gotten worse since EA2, despite the new features, and there seem to be no patches inbetween EA phases to fix what's obviously broken. Furthermore, they seem to be ignoring player feedback entirely, and many bugs that crop up go unfixed. I am very disappointed in this game so far.

The interface is smooth and the game flows. But there is very little real challenge here. 

Diplomacy appears to be complex but the reality is that your neighbors will bully you until you are stronger than them. After that, they will leave you alone.

Designing ships is an abstract exercise which point appears obscured. Until you get into combat. Then, you will realised that it is pointless. Combat options are limited and useless as the combat is reduced to a couple volleys before it ends. There is no scope for tactics as it is over as quick as it started. 

At the end, this game is reduced to conducting admin on your empire and moving fleets about. Everything else does not add anything to the experience. Even getting into combat can be best described as looking a statistical tables and letting the computer determined the outcome based on those table.

Early game is fun when turns are short. Turn time increases at an alarming rate as you grow, if you want to keep your empire as productive as possible. It's similar to MoO2 in that respect, but MoO CTS is even worse in this area. A few examples:
[list]
[*]You must manage all your colonies one at a time; with a 5 long queue; which can only be accessed in each separate colony. Almost the same as MoO2 (which had a 7 slot queue).
[*]Pollution works as in MoO2; reduces production. However, the system is different in that you need to manually manage the pollution with clean-up projects. Not fun with large empires.
[*]Population movement between colonies is done 1 at a time by building tranports. A very time consuming process, but necessary as colonies don't grow unless supported by population influx. Fine in small empires; not in large.
[*]Each colony must manage food separately (cannot send food to other colonies), and production output per worker is variable (more production for first worker), so population management is much more complex than in MoO2 where you simply set enough on food; all on production/research depending on richness.
It might sound fun, and it can be in small empires. It does however not scale for large empires; where you have multiple colonies growing every turn requiring you to check each and every one of them, if that colonist is doing what he should be doing.
[*]Between turns, you must watch all visible enemy ships moving and fighting one at a time instead of all simultaneously, increasing turn time even more.
[/list]

Diplomacy and Espionage are arguably not as important as in previous MoOs; largly because of the changed research system.
Research is linear much like in Civ 5 with a few techs where you must choose between 2-3 different options ('choice techs').
The only techs that can change hands (via diplomacy or espionage) are the 'choice techs'. This means you can never advance your research by spying, and you can also never catch up in research by trading.


The reason for this review is that it's becoming more and more apparent, that they are creating the game for those that like the game as is; pointing to steam reviews being mostly positive, so everything is fine in their eyes. The problems listed above are non-issues to them.

When I heard they were remaking this game I was so stoked. Michael Dorn and Mark Hamill are doing voices as well, that's awesome! Bought into the early access and played the game, thought it was good. Beautiful, great sound and all my favorite races were back. The problem is each time I play it I find I'm less and less interested. The game seems to forgo deeper strategy for a glossy polish that simply makes the replayability slip and fall on it's ass. 

The combat is kinda fun, but I found myself simming through battles more and more. The only time I can remember doing that in Moo 2 was near the end and I had a gross number of doom stars and didn't want to watch every stellar converter animation tear my opponent apart. My choices don't feel like they matter in combat, and you know who will win by the difficulty bar before it begins.

The colony managment is a little better, but growth based off food supply doesn't seem to make much sense. Does having an abundance of food make my population sexually agressive? No freighters either so forget about colonizing that terrible radiated world that happens to have gems on it using food farmed somewhere else...

Tech tree seems really streamlined. By that I mean it's pretty boring. Different weapons don't ""feel"" different. They get a little blastier as you go, a little more green or blue, but nothing substantial enough to make a mark on your memory like some of the weapons in Moo 2.

Maybe that's not fair, this is a good 4x game, but every person who has played Moo 2 will have their opinion colored by their previous experiences with that game. Maybe they shouldn't have called it Master of Orion. The biggest problem with this game is I've already forgotten I own it and likely won't pick it up again. In contrast, if I'm flipping through my old CD book looking at old titles and find my copy of Moo 2. I usually spend that evening ignoring my wife and conquering the galaxy.

Believe me there is so much potential here and I really hope that it continues to move in the right direction. A lot of players don't really like the real time battles but I think they aren't too bad and when they work (aside from minor bugs) they work really well. Almost makes this Total War in space (if they continue on adding more tactical options in ie perhaps experience and ship captains or even some morale system).

The game is overall pretty well polished and runs very smoothly with some minor UI annoyances and bugs here and there but remember it is EA so it's bound to improve. Audio and sound affects are awesome and once you've fully explored a galaxy it looks pretty sweet.

As far as content is concerned that is my current bug bear. Like exploration just doesn't feel like eXploration. Needs more events and things to keep the early game fresh. I hope this doesn't come in the form of DLC either... I expect DLC down the track to give the game some longetivity but not an empty game with fast DLC releases. I guess time will tell.

My last negative for the review is that they really seem to be balancing the game out a little more at this stage and I can see why it's needed but I'd rather see the time go into adding content and fixing bugs. Balance will work itself out once more players are playing, but without content, you aren't giving them reason to play in my opinion.

But hey I'm not a dev so what would I know right?

I bought this at full price and for what you get it isn't too bad, but at it's current stage of EA5 I would recommend waiting for a sale. Otherwise if you are a fan, then go for it. It's been fun so far and hopefully get's better.

The devs want to make this a carbon copy of the first Moo game with some minor extras but have no plans of implementing the things that set Moo2 apart and made it one of the greatest 4x games of all time. They have incorporated aspects of less successful modern games (for instance limiting travel to fixed waypoints to bottleneck and lengthen space travel LAME). They stole some concepts from other games like civ which probably add to the game in a good way but this definitely does not feel like Moo. No turn based combat, they stated in forums that it is hard to do it in 3D, as if thats even relevant......just do a 3D rendering on a 2d plain and don't ruin a great concept. I waited 20 years to be disappointed. They have limited race customization over concerns of balance to a point where it defeats the purpose. Don't get me started on the tech tree, shoulda built on the Moo2 platform for that instead of stealing the boring linear concept from the Civ genre. I waited 4 patches before writing this review to give them a chance to improve the game but it just keeps getting worse. My perception of the situation at this point is that the devs here are your typical ""I want to make my mark"" type of people and as a result they are a detrement to themselves. You know the thing about the wheel is that it does not need to be reinvented. As soon as they start incorporating features from Moo2 this review will change. Until then im going to move forward with the belief that I was tricked into buying a game that had no intention of ever being true to form. BAH HUMBUG!

A quick update. The way they just changed how food works is awful. Just awful. cant produce anything because my 1 colonist on new settlements HAS to produce food or they will starve?

--------------------------------------

My previous review (May 5):

I have been playing MOO2 for ages. With its transcendental music, lovely graphics and rich possibilities that may make each game unique, MOO2 is like the ultimate tool for meditation for me. The previous sequel, MOO3 (not this game!) was quite the contrary, I genuinely disliked it.

[b]So, briefly I have been waiting for a good sequel for ages. It has finally arrived. I loved it.[/b]

This new implementation did a very good job on maintaining the original qualities that made MOO2 a cornerstone piece for 4X lovers. Even though the game is still in early access, it is engaging, doesn’t overwhelm with details even though they are there if you feel like micromanaging, same calm graphics and music, and is very playable. If you are looking for one, this game is a proper sequel to MOO2. It is definitely worth its price. If you love MOO series, go for it.

I have some criticism for the early access as of May’16, though:
[list]
[*]It is getting a bit too similar to Civ5 dynamics: City states, establishing embassies etc. While it gives a familiarity feeling for Civ players, I would expect more innovative diversions from the Sid’s path.
[*]Diplomacy is still a bit shaky, very frequently in a single turn you may become the common BFF of the galaxy and after a few turns suddenly they see their error and declare an all-out war on you. I am sure there will be a better AI diplomacy when the game is released.
[*]I like playing tactical battles, but they are still a bit confusing for me. With every new release I give it a try but I always end up auto-resolving the battles. It is obvious that the designers have pretty good ideas and trying them out.

The revamped food and colonization plus an extreme difficulty has really improved my play experience.

Watching 50 ships go at it with missiles, guns and shields in one epic battle is just plain awesome. It is not turn-based but still allows some controls and it is both quick and cool.

It has been and continues to be a fun ride seeing the large and small changes the developers make along the way.  As of the time of writing this review, the game is in EA5.

The game is not yet perfect, but you can sort of feel the trajectory the developers are taking with changes to certain areas of the game.  Feeling nostalgic, I played through a couple MOO2 games recently for comparison.  I now feel colony management on this game is much improved over the original.  This has been something the developers have been making steady changes to with each EA incarnation.  I feel that ship design in the original is still a bit better because one really gets a sense that the way the ships are designed, what systems are installed, really affects their viability.  I was surprised to find that the turn-based combat I used to love in the original game became a bit tedious and I was actually looking forward to the real time combat we have here in this new Master of Orion game.  However, the addition of some turn-based elements to the combat system with the addition of hotkeys to activate various ship systems real time shows to me that the developers are addressing my concerns about ship design but doing it in a real time combat world.  Kudos.  Lastly, with the EA5 update they even brought back the beloved creative/uncreative options as well as added some other novel bundled “Special Abilities” picks to the race creation scheme.

Come, join this journey with us.  Provide constructive criticism of what you do not like.  Provide feedback on what is working well.  Make this game into something worthy of bearing the name of Master of Orion.

First the races and customization options now are interesting, and favors picking one area to push and less so in the others, so for example one can do a Merchant focus and outspend the AI enemies or focus on ship size and quality or work on better colonization to expand better and play along those. Now I agree some special technologies need to be added along the species specialty technology and that should not be for custom options so they stand out.

Other things I like as a disabled player its very playable for me and with new easy settings can be something you can work on as you learn the game from very easy to much more difficult settings.

Pet peevs though they took out minor races for now, I liked them, and sometimes if you pick certain world options they shove you on a starting planets who gravity is to low or high so your penalized I'm of the opinion if you spent points on a super rich and large world you should not be penalized for it since its supposed to help you.

I've been playing Master of Orion II since I was 9. Man, what a game. I've played it recently as well, and it really is a very good game. Sure, it would be great if you could just get a high res texture pack, larger galaxies, etc, but the game really is well thought out.

Master of Orion, the new one, is not the same game. I think balancing and mechanics are closer to Civ than MOO. There is nothing wrong with that, however. This is a different game, and if you treat it that way, it can be thoroughly enjoyable. I've had a couple of ""just one more turn"" evenings, which is detrimental to my job performance.

This doesn't replace MOO II, this can be played as an alternative. We must stop treating MOO II as the be-all and end-all of games, and start appreciating alternatives. This game is fun, and I appreciate that.

I've seen games with 12 - 15 ""unique"" groups that shared the same unit models across all of groups. Cutting corners to keep costs down and deliver a game quickly. 
Is it all unique... maybe not. Heck some of the models are incomplete or in design process still and display as ""unavailable"" frames. Don't let that distract you from the magnitude of effort that is going into this game to make it unique. The AI is decent and the pirates are annoying. I've played with a couple of the difficulty settings and they all, for the most part, affect the game and AI as you would expect. Harder difficulties = more aggressive AI.
I will keep this game and unlike other early access I've participated in, Master of Orion has become a favorite. A hopeful favorite. I hope others will give this a shot. Help developers find the bugs and get the squashed. Enjoy a CIV like game that pulls away from the CIV style just enough to keep you interested. Play for hours on end. 
All in all this game has amazing potential and I can't wait to see what lies beyond the next star as I explore the galaxy that is Master of Orion.

The User interface is clunky and missing a lot of features to make gameplay efficient.  The AI is not very well developed at this point.  I would hold off on purchase until after the Early Access phases are over and what the general reviews of the finished game are like.

I'll come back and revise my review after Early Access is complete, if the game significantly improves by then.

EDIT: after a month you can see from my ""how helpful"" review score how diametrically opposed the game's followers are.  

To re-iterate, you are better off just waiting for the release, perhaps instead watch the youtube videos of game play to see if this is a good game for you or not.    I suspect casual strategy gamers may like this game and play it a few times.   For more hardcore 4X gamers this game will probably be too simple and very easy to beat the AI, based on players' feedback from the hardest difficulty settings.  Based on that assessment one certainly doesn't want to pay full price for this game.

As of the EA 2 release the AI still has issues.

EDIT:  Updated for EA 5.  I still find the game very annoying to play.  The zooming around on the galaxy map is inconsistent and difficult to control.  I don't like the inconsistencies in their Racial Traits overhaul.  For whatever reason they made the Alkari inherit traits that the Mrrshan used to have (bonus for attacks), and give no explanation why.  

Maybe mod-makers can fix this game once NGD Studios has taken their hands off of it.

EDIT:  At this point I'm done: I don't believe these developers will ever get the game to a state where I will enjoy it.  I arrived at this conclusion after reading all the explanations from the developers about the various changes they made for EA 5 for colonization and custom races and for tactical combat. Their decisions with each EA phase are erratic and don't show any sound methodology to their designs.

Also their QA is atrocious for each phases' new features and redesigns they arbitrarily come up with.  The game is a nice-looking mess and it's a shame Wargaming got their hands on this IP to begin with.",1457209636,1467087304,False,16,0,0.418581396341323853,0,True,False,True

I have completed two play throughs of the game with the humans. Although there are some good points I can not recommened the game and its 50 dollar price tag in its current state.

Things I liked

-Looks nice (ships, planets, races)
-Voice acting is well done
-Music and SFX are good
-UI is easy to navigate

Things I don't like
-Combat is too fast and boring. You can try slowing it down by using the pause option but really it's pointless. You can win almost every battle simply with numbers and let it auto play while you watch. Faster to just simulate battles than go through the cinematic tactical fighting.
-Customizing ships is pointless you can easily win with the default set ups the AI chooses for you
-AI currently isn't implemented so diplomacy plays no part in a game (other than extorting money from the weak)
-Tech tree choices don't feel like they mean anything. I can easily get through a game just randomly picking.

Conclusion
Don't buy this game in early access. If it goes on sale maybe. I don't think it's worth more than $25 in its current state and that's only because it comes with MOO 1 and 2. It has potential I hope that the developers use the player's feed back to improve the battles and AI.

***EA5 UPDATE***
So I tried the EA% update and can still not recommend this game. First I'll have to say that the developers made some great changes that fixed many early version problems. For example

Improved AI both in diplomacy and overall strategy
Ship designer finally in a good place (was pretty bad until around EA3 or 4)
Custom race designer and galaxy generation paramaters greatly improved
They put spies in EA 3 or 4 (can't remember exactly) and improved their functionality some what in EA5
RTS battle UI improved and it's a bit easier to  control ships now

These are some of the things that I thought were well done by the dev team. Having said that the following issues are simply holding this game back and will continue to do so in my opinion.

Absolutely horrible UI camera during empire management. I can't stress enough how annoying it is when the camera moves and zoomes from one side of the galaxy to another to make sure you aware of some mundane event (congrats you just found a planet...ugh) and now you have to zoom back out, find where the camera was focused just so you can continue playing normally. This happens ALL THE TIME and is incredibly annoying.

Planet management is absolutely boring. It's so boring in fact that they are planning on adding preset building queues to the game as a feature. Now some might say 'yay preset building queues!' but to me it's the same thing as admitting that there is a boring part of the game no one likes to do so we are finding a way to automate it. Now this happens with a lot of 4x games but it's especially bad in MOOcts. Some 4x games try and get around this by using a grid system for building placement and assigning values to each box in the grid so that there is at least a level of randomness and value in building on one box over the other. In MOOcts however its the old boring build queue that might as well be the same for every planet (again why they are making preset build queues). For sure this was a flaw of the original moo2 and should have been identified as an area where they could innovate.

And the big one BATTLES. Lets face it 4x games are about big space battles. Everyone wants to  see their super badass fleet mass up against another empire's super badass fleet and PEWPEW till there is a clear winner. And although there can be big space battles in MOOcts they just aren't fun. You would think an RTS style battle system would guarantee awesome big fleet battles but nope. Most of the time you just end up sitting watching it happen like a little movie. Sure there are tactics to use and ways to move ships around but it's nothing like the strategy someone would use in a game like starcraft for example. The system lacks the feeling of speed and split second decision making that will make or break the battle found in traditional RTS and at the same time has managed to simulate the boring sit back and watch as things happen found in turn based combat.  I can't stress enough how boring battles are in this game. It's a killer failure imo.

Again I very much appreciate the work put into this game. The graphics are nice, sound is excellent, atmosphere is very MOO style but the game is just dull to play. Why pay 50+ dollars to play a mediocre 4x game when there are so many out there that are doing everything this game offers but better and for less money.",1457983932,1467005765,False,9,0,0.508619487285614014,0,True,False,True

If you are looking for a deep 4x experience however, you won't find it here. Not now or when it's released. Yes, people climb over each other to shout about how its EA and therefore will only get better, but the thing is: its basically feature complete. They may be balancing things for a while yet, but they have not announced any new features of the game for months now, and in their several announcements of what's yet to come, there has been no mention of new features. Why does that matter? because the game, as pretty as it is, is extremely shallow. 

Iy you are a fan of the series, and absolutely must experience it, get it on a sale (at the time of writing, the steam summer sale is active and its 30% off). It really does pull on a few of those nostalgia strings the first time you have a colony ship land, or meet a race, etc., and perhaps that is enough to be worth it; But for me that novelty quickly wore off.

I do have many pet peeves with the game, many are style choices, immersion-breaking voice acting, clunky interface, and poor AI, but those ARE things that may be fixed as the EA moves on. What is unlikely to be fixed is that there's not really a game there in the first place to bring you back for a second playthrough.

I have played them when i was a kid before i even heard about the Internet. Playing MOO2 in HotSeat with your friends had a certain feeling (old gamers know what i mean). Many of those games have had newer versions / remakes and many of them were bad.
I read many reviews about this game and lots of players found this game to be a total catastrophe. So being a MOO fan i wanted to see it for myself. I bought the game, played it for a few days and i can tell you that it is a good game and it's far to being a catastrophic game. Now before you start yelling and throwing vegetables at me, let me explain why i find this game to be good rather than bad. Don't get me wrong, the game has its flaws and i will try to point the essential pros and cons.


Pros
+ The gameplay has that MOO2 feeling and you can play a single game for days without getting bored.
+ Random map generator is good - it does exactly what is supposed to do. Many games fail at having a good RMG but not this one.
+ Planet building and ship designs are good.
+ Research - everything from the old game is here.
+Space combat is good. I see the opinions are devided here if the game must have a turned based combat or not. Believe it or not, it will not matter in the end as it didn't in the old game neither. If your adversary has a better technology, he will beat the crap out of you either if it is turned based, real time or an Endless Space similar combat tactic. It's not a big deal, i myself prefer turned based combat but really i'm not that sad about it.


Cons
- Racial Perks.
In my opinion this is by far the most important thing the developers should not have ""touched"". This is the bad side of the game and i want to clarify it in more detail. I will give some examples of the most important traits in the game that have been drastically altered:

Creative
Before - Researching a tree level gives you ALL the technology of that level!
Now - it now gives 25% research bonus.
Anyone thinking ""it's not that bad""? Let me tell you when you have to choose between Hyper Drive, Plasma Beam and Hyper-X Capacitators you will have the feeling you shot yourself in the head no matter the choice for leaving the other 2 behind. This is just an example and my first feeling was to uninstall the game - that's how bad i think this is!

Tolerant
Before- No pollution and zero maintenance for toxic, radiated and desert planets.
Now - no penalty for LowG or HighG.
Practically you can easily colonize and maintain any planet now. Guess what - so will the AI who will now try to colonize EVERY single planet on the map and will make this his main objective! It will even colonize planets in your home system if it's not defended.

I played (and still do) only Custom Race. The combination i loved to play had Lithovore and Creative perks. Sometime i chose Tolerant instead of Creative. For those who don't know what Lithovore does - it eliminates your race's need to eat food (i think they eat rocks or something similar) therefore you can have you population go into scientits, workers or both. Lithovore has not been changed (thank you God).

I don't know how many of you realize but these traits have been the absolute core of the old MOO. Developers please tell me why did you alter these traits so drastically? I did not mention but some of the old traits don't even exist anymore. Why is that? Does this have a logic behind it? Did you test the original traits and found out that the gameplay was bad? Can you please explain this to me as a gamer and a client who bought  ""what must be"" a superb game? Cause i cannot understand a bit. You created a great game and took away it's most beautiful thing. Leaving the original racial traits untouched felt like giving away something out of your wallet? Does it feel like donating one of your organs? Do you at least consider implementing them in the future? If not for the whole game, then at least for the single player mode?

All that being said (except for some minor bugs) the game is good. If the developers will ""repair"" the racial traits then i recommend you to buy it. You can easily see that it was a tremendous work behind this game. I think it's very close to being one the best remakes anyone ever did with a classic game.

1)  Tech Tree.  It's basic.  There's no differentiation.  You plough through basically the same way regardless of race, and ultimately you don't really ""feel"" like any of it is making a difference.  You're simply clicking buttons to progress along the tree.  Sure, you're getting better ship firepower, but that's about it.

2)  Race differentialtion.  There isn't any.  Yes, there's some pluses/minuses at the beginning but there's no feel for one race versus another.  Ships look a bit different, but as far as technologies go; you all have the same stuff.  The devs could learn a lot from Sins of s Solar Empire on this one.

3)  Opponent AI.  It's terrible.  I managed to get everyone friendly and then ally with me.  Yes, all races.  You would think the game would be over since we're all in one big alliance.  No.  Then suddenly, one of them leaves the alliance and goes straight to hostile.  Not one other race keeps their word on the alliance.  They all leave, and all declare war on me the very next turn.  So don't bother with diplomacy.

4)  Specialization.  It would be nice to have the ability for planets to be more specialized.  But you can basically build all developments on all planets.  Since you can terraform and even convert gas giants to planets laster in the game, there's almost no point in aggessive expansion.  All your planets can be turned quite habitable.  So, grab enough planets so you have have a solid defensive fleet...and sit there.  Race through the tech tree on the econmic advancements and get enough money to buy the market and win the econmic victory.  Every other victory takes much longer, and there's frankly no point.  Wars happen because of resource shortages.  Since you're not fighting over resources, then what?  They need a complete rethink and take notes from Civ 5.  Not everyone gets iron, oil, or aluminum.  Either trade for it, of fight for it.  That creates politics.  Since no planet (except for Orion itself) has any unique value, then I could care less fighting over any of it.

5)  Pirates.  Outright atrocious.  They randomly spawn on any uninhabitable world and start creating ships.  Then they randomly attack anything they see, even if they are completely outmatched.  Again, Sins of a Solar Empire had a better pirate concept.  They were almost a faction of their own, and could be manipulated to attack your enemies.  I feel like they tried to go the Civ 5 route, but that doesn't make any sense in space.

The Technology tree is very unimaginative with a number of higher tier technologies that cost more to use than lower tier with similar or actually lower reward. The ship customization is so constrained as to remove much of the flavor long time players of MOO2 associate with the title. Then to top it off with a tactical combat engine that makes it near impossible to determine what you are fighting and how well your designs really are. Oh, may of the weapon modifications still don't work but the developer will never tell you which as even they don't know.

However the worst feature of the game is galaxy generation. While you can set your own random seed you will find a galaxy generator that cannot even offer real balanced starting conditions when told to do so. Even in huge galaxies you are just as likely to start one  star system away from an opponent or six. Worse, it is almost guaranteed that two or more opponents will share adjacent systems at start instantly eliminating those  AI opponents as effective.

Most of the glitches are with the UI, at the moment, but they are few and minor.  The graphics are stunning, esp if you've played MOO1-3 lately.

This, so far, is almost a straight remake of MOO2.  I really don't remember much of MOO3 as it was so bugged I didn't play it long.  The galaxy map is a little different with warp points connecting star systems, and the only way to travel between them at first.  You can research technologies later that help you travel quickly between star systems you own.  Espionage is different as there are only a limited amount of spies you can create, but the system you use when infiltrating other colonies is much better.  Diplomacy is pretty standard compared to most 4X games of today, but still needs some tweaks and balancing.  Tactical combat is in fully 3D space and is fun to watch but I rarely issue orders myself and just hit Auto and watch the fun.

As this is early access, there are a few things from MOO2 that are missing that I hope they add.  The Antarans are sorely missed, as there is no real late game threat once you have out-researched the other races and build a formidable fleet.  Also, I'd like to see the Captains and Colony Advisors from MOO2 added as they gave the game a little more flavor and their bonuses were cool.

It plays more like a really advanced casual empire-building game, but without all the crap about freemium and pay-to-win.

Fantastic so far on many levels.

If you have not watched the videos you should, they spent good money on fantastic actors for the voice work! That in itself really drew in our curiosity.

As a developer myself, many different chairs(diversity in choices), allows me to review not just based as some 12 yr old wanting to read like an adult. I dont compare to anyone, soley the craft of what I am reviewing, their work, their effort and development route.

If you enjoy Galactic Civilizations III, Master of Orion and its new state is just terrific in comparison for Early Access. 

They did well for balance and such for Early Access which was my only concern. They layed out the production and development with the professionalism we have come to expect from Wargaming.net.

In over 7 hours of play, only a couple of graphical glitches, but fully operational and with no bugs that do not impede gameplay.

Great 60FPM. Not extensive on pc demand, so if you have 1 year or newer video card and solid state drive, your good. 

The writing is done very well too and I hope they continue to add more because it can be a bit redundant in longer games.

The artwork and time spent is fantastic... but the voice work and all the acting stars that did this game including Mark Hamill(Star Wars), Michael Dorinm(Star Wars), Alan Tudyk(First Knight), John Delancy(Star Trek), John Cassir (Star Trek), and Robery England(Nightmare on Elm Street)!! 

I actually expected a terrific game like this from the makers of World of Tanks, World of Warplanes and World of Warships (Wargaming), who aldo just made WoTanks the most immersive tank game from sound effect and realism to date breaking a guiness record. So what do they do... take to space since they completed all war games on earth LOL.

Get it, they give your all the old ones and this one... 4 games for 1 price. 

You wont even know its Early Access and spank people in a way you have not imagined! Old school or new school, this is a game with a nice smooth learning curve, and hard to master once you think you have it down. Replayability will give you hours to try so many races and so many tactics and world development.

Put on a fresh pair of panties and hold on tight.... its one enjoyable ride and still huge amounts to come. Their updates have been bountiful and they are interacting with the community often.

Solid Buy and underestimated and underrated.. but we plan to change that!
It is still Early but this game, you would not know when when in the drivers seat!

Nice touch. 

AI has gotten a lot more aggressive but still needs some work, tactically it tends to chase rabbits and is easy to kite. Diplomacy still needs some work, AIs get stuck in demanding colonies, which is just silly. No one is ever going to surrender colonies unless they're losing a multi-front war and need to close a front, so demanding them as peace terms when the AI is getting wrecked is just silly. Same with tech trades. No, I'm not going to trade a 25 pop gaia for fighter bays.

Game is looking really good as of June.


----

As of the 2016-02-26 release this is a fairly early alpha release. With that in mind, most of the groundwork for a remake of Master of Orion 1+2 is there and given another 6-12 months of development this could be a real successor. A bunch of key MOO concepts are only in framework here, particularly most of the non-combat technologies, tactical controls and diplomatic options, but the concepts are at least there.

Superficially it resembles MOO3 with the inter-star lanes bu the gameplay feels much more like Moo1.

That said, I went into playing this game with that exact mentality.  I have had many systems over the years, and MOO2 was almost always among the first games to get installed on it.  I cannot even begin to imagine how many hours I've spent playing the game and inventing new ways to try and beat the game (Single Doomstar Antaran win, anyone?).  So, when I heard that a new MOO was out, I was excited to have my old MOO2 back with better graphics.

What I got was a game that is far different than that.  For starters, star lanes and non-turn based combat was a huge turnoff.  In fact, those two items alone almost made me uninstall initially.  But I decided to give it another shot, and what I ound was that, even though those elements were different, they were ultimately changes for the best.  Gone are the days where a Darlok fleet randomly drops a giant fleet in the furthest backwater area of your empire out of nowhere, and that's fine.  Do I miss that sort of random thing?  Maybe.  But does it make for a better strategic framework for a human vs AI game?  Absolutely.

In regards to combat, a few things need tweaked, but it is quite playable in its current iteration.  If you are thinking the real-time combat is like that unspeakable mess of MOO3, it isn't.  It likely is an issue where you are misunderstanding the controls (like I did initially), but a sticky on the official forums will bring you up to speed and bring you around on it.

Now, to the overwhelming good of the game.  The voice acting and research trees are great.  Are they great in the conventional sense?  Eh, it isn't Mass Effect or something, but as a huge sci-fi nerd, hearing familiar voices from my favorite actors is a fine bit of nostalgia.  Similarly, the tech tree creates many of the same feelings.  Researching jump gates, battle pods, and other techs from yesteryear are fun, and the more I play, some of the choices forced by the tech tree are genuinely meaningful.

Some areas of the game, still in early access, are up in the air for me.  Diplomacy seems pointless right now, the AI is a little too pacifistic, tech research a bit too fast and a passive afterthought (think autolab x100), and the spy process seems promising, but under-defined currently.  Also, MOO2 races need to come back, and even some of the races from MOO3 would be nice (races is one of the few things that game did right).

In summary, if you loved MOO1 or MOO2, buy this game and give it a chance.  If you can't stand early access titles, wait a bit and get it on release.  While it isn't a re-skin, it is a genuinely good title, and one that makes up for the abomination that was MOO3.",1464992265,1464992265,True,20,0,0.53973078727722168,0,True,False,True

I did not notice missiles hitting the seemingly omnipresent asteroids on the tactical map. The initial pirates are no longer a joke. The basic mechanics and style of tactical combat seem unchanged though.

However, the game is still incredibly bland, visually and in gameplay. Check the simplistic ship models out which you can't even zoom in on. The gameplay is still a simplistic rush to build constructor ships and block off choke points while expanding your holdings.

Honestly, this MOO reboot looks and plays like a tablet game. Doesn't it look like it?

I'm so glad I bought Stellaris which gives me a visually gorgeous and immersive game with deep mechanics that give a feeling of running an interstellar empire. Try zooming in on the ship models in that game and watch in awe as the turrets track their targets and fire in visually glorious style during tactical combat. Stellaris needs some development work too and that is underway but it outclasses MOO by a long shot in my opinion.
**********
This game is incredibly bland. It would need serious development and additional features to make it an engaging experience. 

The game is a very simplistic remaking of the original MOO2 with some of the good parts of that earlier game currently missing.

There are few random events and creatures, and pirates are not a threat in any way as they are very easily defeated. These features are bland and almost irrelevant to your gameplay.

The models are cartoony and simplistic. I find the map overly bright too but its part of that cartoony style. 

While the leader models and voice acting are great, I find some of the advisors to jar with the tone set by the leader. E.g. the Psilon leader has a calm gravitas in his voice acting yet the advisor is a snivelling Golem-like creature. 

Yet any character of a race is made irrelevant by their diplomacy AI which is simplistic and hostile to any player offerings. The language is quite hostile too with the AI rudely cutting off contact despite decent deals being offered.

Tactical combat needs so much work. I personally don't like asteroids on every tactical battle map. There is so much scope for varied maps. Currently, the AI will simply fire through asteroids causing shots to miss. The control and information available on the tactical map is so limited. It's a poor gameplay experience and it needs a lot of development work.

Colonisation and planet management are both very simplistic. They're simply copying the mechanics of Master of Orion 2. While it was a great game back in the day, the computer gaming world has moved on. More depth could've been achieved while maintaining the core atmosphere of a MOO game. 

Espionage is also a strange set of mechanics. You can't enter systems blocked off by military stations to find enemy colonies and without that location information, your spies have nothing to do except counter espionage on your worlds. But spies keep being recruited. Once all your colonies have an agent, the rest will just sit on Hold on your homeworld. So boring. Surely spies should be helping you find out information about other empires, aided by trade and other treaties as they infiltrate other empires?",1462498053,1464598008,False,9,0,0.514070689678192139,0,True,False,True

EDIT: The devs are apparently working hard on the game, considering the reviews etc. It looks even more promising (early access version 4). I will happily recommend the game if it continues in that way. END OF EDIT

The game is definitely a good looking remake of Master of Orion 2. The graphics and sound are excellent. The details are very nice. The game is already very polished at the moment.

The issues of the current version as I see them are

1. Star lanes
Systems are connected by star lanes and you must travel through them between systems (unless you have built jump gates). In my first game I got coined in by AI blocking exactly 2 spots in the universe with a starbase. I could not go further unless I attacked him or sorted it out diplomacally accepting his ridiculous price. Well... it's supposed to be the 3D space modeled as 2D space...and it has been made a 1D space in fact. Why? The defense strategy is just to defend a few frontier points which does not require much of strategy really...

2. System travel points
In a system, besides the travel points that are one end of a star lane, the ships can stay at each planet... when travelling from a system, they need to go to the travel points on the ""edge"" of the system...and then continue by the connected star lane...So basically in a system, they do not travel at full speed...why? That is one more feature of the freeness of space movement that is somehow diminished in the game...

3. Battles
You can simulate a battle, that's fine. You can enter a 3D battle and ...well, watch it. There are some controls but you cannot really influence the battle much, or, have a feeling that you actually do something. I need to compare this to MoO2 now since there you saw how your ship designs perform. You could control every aspect of the battle and thus took care when designing ships. At this moment, the battle in Master of Orion (4) is just as bad as in MoO3...

4. Minor issues
There are some minor issues that will hopefully get fixed. For instance, the UI of the ship design part needs a bit of work: once you have many components, the large icons are not very clear. There is a feature of MoO2 that has been copied: all troop transports get eaten when you invade a planet: I should be able to choose how many marines I want to invade the planet and after the battle how many of them should stay boarded to ships. (The ships of dead or garissoned marines will still be eaten .... )

Once more, I know the game is in early access and might change. And hopefully it will change and be the best MoO2 successor.",1457161276,1464377474,False,34,0,0.560355246067047119,0,True,False,True

When I go to load MoO3 my graphics are messed up so can't play it. But I like and enjoy what it had in freatures that this one doesn't. For example the way you could control spending on the different screens. I would ask that the game developers get an old laptop or desktop and go back to MoO3 and look it over.  MoO always beat out all the copy cats because of thier freatures and how it was controlled. I like the auto build option and how you can apply it planet by planet, so far the AI builds wrogn for a brand new planet instead of focusing on building up population and then defense it spends all it valuable first development time focus on making defenses. But this is the same way the empires nuild no matter the races. I have not spent enough time in this new release to see how its changed. But the AI is much tougher. 

The ship to ship combat is worthless, and you get a huge OP fleet lost bc the controls are counter-intuitive. But the Auto is fun to watch. I only will do the ship to ship if I have a smaller fleet and know how to kill the other ships better than the AI. But in later parts I just do OP and let computer do it whiling focusing on overall big picture, and logistics of resupplying my fleets.

Cons
-AI is terrible in declaring war/combat/diplomacy/colonization/ship design
[list]
    [*]AI will sometimes declare war on you but never move thier massive fleet in until 30 turns later
    [*]AI is terrible @ Diplomacy they make stupid demands (IE I want 4 of your colonies and 1/3 of your treasury for free)
    [*]AI seems unable to terraform any of their planets at this time which is fortunate as they seem to ALWAYS spawn with amazing planets (I always play human)
    [*]AI still seem to only colonize 1 planet at a time even when they obviously have more than enough resources to colonize multiple planets at once
    [*]AI seems to stop colonizing after thier population reachs a certain threshold (I had a 2000+ turn game the AI Pop never went above 450)
    [*]AI can't design ships to save thier empires worth a damn ... in the mid to end game I can litterally kill a AI super fleet (4 battle ships, 30+ cruisers,40+Destroyers,30+Frigates) with 2 to 4 titan class ships (ship auto design system is abysmal)


Planet Spawning Issues/Management issues
[list]
    [*]I haven't played multiplayer but it seems that when I play human I RARELY get any good planets spawned next to me yet when I share charts with the AI I can quite clearly see they get a polethera of class B planets near thier home planet PLEASE FIX THIS 
    [*]The auto build function doesn't build colonies effeciently AT ALL it flat out sucks as it build litteraly everything in a horrible order choice
    [*]Leaving your colonies on manual is a great way to loose allocation points as the game seems to keep throwing colonists on ONE particular resource and if it over flows those colonists some how disappear into the ether ... PLEASE FIX

COMBAT needs Optimizations
[list]
    [*]I can't tell if it's just because the game runs on DX9 but this game seems to coke my computer to death when there are more than a couple dozen objects on the screen (Running on a I7 4710MQ w/ 970M) I have a gut feeling that this aspect with never change but any optimaztions would be nice 

Tech tree is meh
- Everyone gets the same tech so in the end game everyone would have the same amount of firepower it would be nice to see some diversity

The AI is not very challangeing yet but still fairly enjoyable early on.  I like the idea of NPC minor civs but they dont seem to do much yet other than to give me 40 to 70 credits upon killing nearby pirate ships and bases.  They are yet to offer any mission/quest other than to ask for a single tech early on.  Combat seems to be a little better other than the occasional freeze or CTD following the combat after action report during transition to main screen.  The ship build/refit changes took some getting use to.  They are not very smooth and the way systems are presented in the new drop down menu is muddy and a pain to work with.  The previouse version of ship fitting was more intuitive and smoother.  You should link the ship slot with the systems capable of inhabiting them so the process would go a little more smooth.  By the late game the dropdown menu is way too populated and there is no rhyme or reason to the order they are listed even after choosing a single class of system. There was little gained from the refit changes and in several respects it is less efficient.  First do no harm...then...  Non-gated travel, going off the beaten path, should be an option for later propultion techs.  I liked this ability in other MOO games. I agree with some others, Antarans should be brought back as slap-back ""regulators"" focusing on mega civs that progress too quickly.  Someone else mentioned the late game economy, and yes I have a game going where I can buy titans every oher turn, not realistic.  Maybe consider a cap on purchasable construction points on capitol ships.  I mean really, the parts still have to be fabricated and assembled.  Maybe cap capitol ship purchase to 75% of total.  I still dont see anything about fighters and bombers that make me want to include them in design.  They really seem to be useless at this point.  They add nothing to overall combat points in practice. I want to build a carrier variuent but dont see the point yet.  Anyway, keep up the good work.

Tech tree is doll, GNN videos annoying but you better not skip them as they have usefull infrmation. The advisers, especially Alkari and Psilon are really annoying... voices... their lines...

The core mechanics are now in place and there is litle chance that we will see major changes to them, I assume mainly tweaking, balancing and finshing the implementation of tool tips/special features will be coming in the next update prior to a release. 

Pros- 

. The product in it's current state is playable and can be enjoyable, depending on what you are looking for: it'sclose to a polished finished title +++

. The dev have done a great job (as developpers) the game has very few bugs, the dev are listening and addressing bug reports, and quite busy updating the game with patches, and updates. ++

. Some of the changes implemented (start lanes, polution, victory condition, etc) are ok, those add-on fit in the spirit of the franchise. ++

. Empire management, research, ship building are fairly well done, well streamlined and intuitive: improved on the franchise previous titles. +

-Cons 

. AI un-challenging --

. Tactical battles. ---
I get no enjoyment from the above. 
It's actually the part that makes me lose interest in the game after a 100 turns or so. 
Past the 100 turn mark the next thing that wakes me up is the battle with the Orion guardian.

Before and after no matter what I have done I will dread that boring tactical battle screen, clicking every ship formation to step back, move on,  go right or got left behind that block of asteroid to avoid a volley of missile: I do all this charade to try to get a feeling of control on the outcome of the battle when there is actually nothing critical you can achieve in those tac battle screen.
More importantly for me: have fun.
Fun firing my newly researched  plasma gun, fun testing what that new experimental design will do on the battlefield, fun trying out a fleet with a new module, trying to disable a specific enemy threat, and so and so.

The battle are incredibly shallow I don't even think there is a need to RTS this mascarade within its own instance when you engage a fleet: the game could RTS the combat in the space map directly.
That would save us screen loading time and we would get to the same result anyway.

-My conclusion

I am disapointed in the result of the reboot.

I feel that I have been commercially abused, using such an old franchise  and rebooting it to that level of tactical dullness. Are they looking at people to take selfies in front of GNN robots and start a trend on facebook? That franchise was old, a reboot of an old franchise is going to attract old gamers and requires some respect...

This game goes mainstream, I don't even know what public they are targeting.

So I want to return the favor to you WGS and I will recommand readers to go and get Sollaris, you will get the same Boring space battle but it doesn't have a reputation to live for and it's actually a refrehing title in the 4X genre.



MOO franchise and core strategy was built around space battle (research, econmy etc) here space battle are a side mechanic to manage, like diplomacy or spying so it's not a reboot it's a single title in the competitive 4X market, go for stellaris if you are considering M004.

Dev you did a good job.
The one(s) responsible for the depletion of interest in tactical battles in order to mainstream this title: you've changed.
I hope you get a mutation in the next tractor SIM simulator game: go reboot that franchise it's a niche market.

Warp corridors, I rather miss having a limited range and fuel tech to restrict searches.
A few techs are positioned to late in the game to be useful (i.e. core waste dumps)
Turn based space battles.

I would like to start with a little history. I have been a long time fan of the series. Master of Orion II is still my all time favorite game, and it's a large part of why I didn't like MOO3. I tell you this to set up exactly what I expect from Master of Orion. I was looking for a fun turn based 4X game (as a good 4X game is turn based, IMO), and I feel that Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars supplies that.

The AI races are a bit on the cartoonish side, but I feel that this is a nod to the original MOO. There is a lot of micro-management, and this is a nod to MOO2. The population cells and star lanes? That's all MOO3. What I am saying here, is that just about every design decision can be traced back in some way to a previous game in the series.

That said, the game isn't finished. The [b] AI [/b] and [b] DIPLOMACY [/b], especially, are rough, but then again these are the most dynamic of the features. If I had to guess, I would say that they're saving AI refiniements until last. You want to include all of your toys before you finalize how the AI will decide how to play with them. Right now, they're likely making sure that the components work, before getting them to work exactly how they want them to.

[b] ESPIONAGE [/b], certainly, needs more work. I keep stealing technology that I've stolen before (how many different Cloning Centers does one need?), but they'll iron all that out, I'm sure. Likewise, [b] COMBAT [/b] still has a way to go, but again, this is entirely AI based. The AI is very basic right now, but I'm sure it will be improved.

[b] RESEARCH [/b] needs work, but I'll be honest and say I don't know what it needs. A greater flexibility, maybe. [b] CUSTOM RACES [/b] need more options, but it's still a new feature, give it time.

[b] COLONY MANAGEMENT [/b] is the biggest flaw right now. It's not broken by any means, but it could use work. There is no way to fine tune what your citizens prioritize without perosnally managing your populations. I'd like to see the ability to use sliders to control how my new citizens get assigned, and to save those presets as a custom set. But it's not a major negative at this point in time.

[b] FINAL VERDICT [/b]: if you're the type of person who likes beta projects, or can deal with a game in a yet-to-be-finished state, and you like 4X games (especially the MOO series), pick this up. If you are the type of person who thinks a turn based game is too slow, or you think an early-access game should be 100% playable and finished and just needing some polish, or you want a game you can beat in a few days and move on... this is not your game. I have individual games that last a dozen or more hours, but I like a game I can return to again and again.

This was one of the first 4X games I ever played and enjoyed, and this reboot lives up to the original feel. The game play can be a little buggy at times, but it’s still in development.
All the original races are brought to life, they interact better with the new advances that AIs have made since the original MOO came out and it makes the game enjoyable by actually having challenges between the races.

+The voice acting is an added benefit, not a something at I would say is the reason to play but a nice bonus.

+The HUD is simple, yet detailed enough to understand and find the data you need.

+Technology is broken down into trees that you have to make some choices to advance, and it allows a deeper level of strategy planning into the sciences.

+Graphics are definitely better, and are still based on the core of the original game. The ships are better designed for racial visuals and they also allow for a more customized look at each race compared to original MOO.

-Diplomacy is a little buggy, and could use work to balance it out.

-The News is more annoying than in past games.

It's not a lot, and I honestly haven't finished the game through, but I have played two complete games totalling these hours. I have to admit, it was more than what I was expecting. The shortcomings of the game can be summed mostly up as being in an constantly updated state. There's gonna be quirks, but the developers offer a nice way to extend your issues or problems to them: they included a ""Report Bug"" feature. I've used it plenty of times, and knowing this game is still be roughed out on its edges, I'm totally okay with that.

The things I love are a-plenty! I thoroughly enjoy how strategic, detailed, and animated the battle scenes are. It makes me feel like I'm watching a movie taking place. Speaking of that, whenever you colonize, you get some of these wonderful scenes too. Matter of fact, I'm going to go ahead and say it: The entire game plays like a movie you're making.

Point blank, the way I feel as a casual gamer, and as a person who has used games from wargaming, I know for a fact they're going to pay attention to the customer base. I further know that while these developers are a separate entity (sortof), they still have that same passion. You can see it in this game. From the voice-overs, to the way the game operates, every action and reaction feels like you're contributing to your own story. It's not entirely customizable, not yet, but as someone who enjoyes playing the Terran Kahnat (I recommend getting this addition while there's still time!), I am having one heck of a blast!

I spent countless hours and many lonely nights as a teenager playing MOO 2, and it was revolutionary.  Only to have the francise and name get dragged through the mud with releases that were progressively worse with each release.  This latest installment is not excluded from that plummet from greatness, and downright borderlines on being used as coaster... Well if it were an actual Game CD and not a digital download, but you get the idea.

Like many have said before, the AI is terrible and completely boring.  A faction whom you were friends with, all of a sudden asks for money like a crack head in front of the gas station, and when you refuse the will declare war on you within a few turns, unless you are considerably stronger than them, hey even crackheads know what battles to pick.

The diplomacy is completely retarded.  It is so easy to exploit any other race on any difficulty level that it does not even seem fair.  Imagine telling a 5 year old that you will give him a $20 baseball mitt for his leather satchel full of $100 bills, don't ask me how he got that satchel, I just know he has it.

Combat is atrocious!!!  Visuals are decent, but get very redundant and boring after the 3rd time seeing the exact same thing.  If this were still 2010 the graphics would be amazing... Unfortunately it is 2016, and for today's standards, they are quite poor, with little to no interaction.
Even with all of the die hard fans, pleading and begging for the developers to change the combat on every forum that I have read, there does not seem to be any change in sight.  If I had the control to do so, I would fire every single one of the pilots and captains of my ships, because they fight like they have been drinking everclear and doing bong rips all night.  Not utilizing any of their weapons (yet another steaming pile of dung aspect) to their potential or capabilities.  Don't even bother with guns or beam weapons, just build all missle ships and you should have no problem, as they are way over powered, and anyone who happens to be on the recieving end, literally has no defense...  Yes point defense weapons exist, but they too are being operated and developed by the same people that have been pulling all nighter parties with my digital pilots.

Tech tree = Garbage...  Unlike MOO 2 where I was Sooooo excited that my little digital aliens worked their butts off to get the newest cool techs to help me conquer the galaxy, these little guys do the same thing, however its so boring and redundant that I could care less, at no fault of thier own... These little alien nerds are doing the best they can with what they are given.

The early access games have now are an amazing way to for developers to make money from us poor saps, to help them continue development and make it better for the fans and players.  But these guys seem to have taken the money and ran.  Seemingly none of them have been listening nor reading forums, for what the true fans want to see in MOO again, because none of it exists.

I cannot recommend it to ANYONE!!! I can say pretty confidently that both fans of the series will feel just as violated and sad as I did (like a virgin on prom night), and even if you have never played the MOO series before and are just looking for a good Space 4X game, there are far better ones out there for much cheaper, that will give you so much better experience then this failed abortion will.

Now with all the bashing out of the way... If this is truly NOT the end product, and the devs decide that care more about putting out something great again, as opposed to a money making scam, then I would love to give it the old Siskel and Ebert two thumbs up.

I have played several hours, 4 complete play throughs, each with a different race and a different EA phase. 

Many of the Negative reviews below are quite accurate. The Tech tree is lacklust and has you choose between a temporary boost which will become useless in a few turns or a long term one. One that won't even be used anyway because the benefits don't really show up in combat. 

Combat is a hit or miss, most of the time. I have just seen the AI smash me with frigates (early/mid game) and Destroyers (mid/late game). I copied the AI and discovered the trick to fleet management. 1 or 2 large ships for show and brute force, and have them follow with dozens of destroyers to take the damage while the big ships crank out damage. 
Replace the destroyers in a few turns and get them back in the fight. A super fleet with only big ships will be worn out and will take way too long to replace. Unless you have cash to just buy it out. 

The best weapon is the missle and anything else really is a waste of time. The games PD does not seem to work very well. All of the PD weapons are stacked and thus fire as one, essentially firing on one missle, allowing missles that could have been fired on to hit your ship. This may have been fixed in EA3 but I keep getting bugs that rendered the game unenjoyable for me. 

The AI lacks any real flare and is quite boring and really just stands as a speed bump to Victory.

Because I'm on the fence about this game and my review. There are many things I like and many I don't. Overall, though, I feel like it's a pretty decent game and if you like 4X games you should check it out - just be prepared for some of the cheese.

Pros: Really polished graphics and effects, transitions, user interface, artwork - they spent a good amount of time making a refined, professional game that looks and feels good. The voice-over cast is amazing and they did a great job breathing life and character into the game. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive and allows simple management and stats without overloading you with information and details and micromanagement. Overall the FEEL of the game is excellent - one of the best-looking 4X games made to date. To summarize - the game is very pretty and gets a lot of geek cred for the voice actor fame. Fookin' space bears man!

Cons: Beauty is only skin deep. While there are some interestingly new minor elements to this game, it's pretty instantly recognizable with (and almost identical to) it's genre brethren like GalCiv3 and Endless Space. In fact, if anything, MoO:CtS is a more simplified version of the two other games with fewer options and a scaled-back depth of gameplay and management. What's especially bothersome is that the tech tree FEELS completely ripped-off from GalCiv3, down to the names of the techs themselves and the weapon systems (not to mention the cheesy newscasters announcing empire/galactic events of note). After all that, they added space bears with cheesy Russian accents - I love space bears but giving them a stupid name like ""Bulrathi"" and giving them Russian accents... Oy 9.9

Summing it up: Despite its cons, I still enjoy playing the game and it's very pretty to look at. The lack of depth also means you can play through it faster than its 4X brethren. It's also a lot easier without FEELING like it is - you still feel like you're about to be overwhelmed at any moment by the opponents ganging up on you even if they never have the teeth to back it up. Is it worth $50? Well, since you get all of the other MoO games bundled in with that and you can still get a refreshing, new 4X gameplay experience for a good 20-30 hours, I'd say yes.

Then a fellow forum mate told me that its a pretty fine MoO game... I LOVE the second game, so I wanted a good MoO game soo much. So I bought it... 

This review is based on my first 10-12 hours of gameplay:
Man this game is fun even in this stage. The graphics is beautiful, the races and the characters (leaders, advisors) are great, and the voiceover... They nailed it. The pollution has now an actual effect (I always ignored this in MoO2, i could win without dealing with it), you can build on gas giants, asteroids, etc. Its much more limited (but more logical) how you can pass people from one planet to another, the time when you could jumpstart a new colony with near-full population in a couple of rounds are over. The ship upgrades are more convenient, the tech matrix need some re-learning, but its ok... The space battles are quite spectacular (especially when you arrive), but a bit chaotic for me, at least now. 

Ofc there is plenty of space for improvement. I would like to see more ship design per race (I like the Meklar race, but I dont like their ships), it would be great if you could choose your color, and ofc more custom race skills and talents... I can't decide about the AI yet, since I played just an easy and a normal game for checking my possibilities. 

Nonetheless, I recommend this game for the 4X fans.

Edit #1: With the EA3, we got 2 new races and spying. You can finally turn off the advisor talk and popup, so its definately an upgrade over EA2... And most importantly... It keeps sucking me back into game. I play a ""round"", after 10+ hours I'm done and I had enough from this game... But after 2-3 weeks, I just want to play again. And that is good.

It isn't a clone of MoO2, which will upset some people.  Things are altered, removed and added.  Don't let the idea that things are changed or removed make you think that depth has been diminished.  
People's nostalgia for MoO2 will probably cause some negative feedback for this game, as they see any alteration as heresy.  However, this game is going in the right direction.  Things are being added, adjusted and reworked to get the correct balance of old and new.  

There are numerous races, which are becoming increasingly distinct as the developers progress.  The tech tree is more akin to the Civilization series than the distinct and entirely seperate branches of pervious MoO games, but it works well.  
The combat is real time, but the developers have been listening to the userbase and have added the ability to pause, and various options to make the game not feel like a click heavy rts.  

The developers have been top notch, working with and listening to the community.  They clearly love the property and want to make a great game that will appeal to both the newcomer and to Master of Orion veterans.  That is not an easy line to walk when there is so much love (and for such a long time) for a previous entry to a series.

If you were a fan of the original moo2 game you might find it a little lacking.   It's not quite as indepth as the original.   Combat is simplified and and so is ship design.   Don't get me wrong, they did a good job on it, but they didn't make it better through depth.   They took out some of the annoying things from the original but did not make anything new that would let you explore new and interesting combat strategies.

Combat just kinda happens.   You have some, but not much, control over it.  But unlike the original, you wont get bogged down microing.  I think this would have been better done through an updated UI.  Instead they just simplified the whole thing.

this game so far needs more refinement aswell but thats why its in early access but i also dont care for some of the changes from moo 2 to here... 
star lanes for instance, aswell as ""unstable star lanes"" that box you in untill you get half way through the tech tree, i for one liked the fact that you had could bypass an empires outer planets and attack their inner worlds it added a chance to bypass the enemy fleet if they didnt pay close enough attention and now we have no ship distance restrictions as long as you can get through those red star lanes

now the combat system..... combat..... personally i think its terrible as of current build
all fleets have a combat strength rating which is visible to all.... so you can see exactly what your opponents have which boils engadgments down to a very basic if you have a higher number than the enemy you attack, if not retreat and build up/upgrade your ships, repeat untill you win... even the guardian of orion you can see its combat raiting plain as day.... of all the ships which should have their strength hidden it should be the guardian
for those who claim theres a stratagy element to it because its real time combat.... no there really isnt other than keep your small ships back for a bit because they move alot faster than the larger ones and will die like the cannon fodder they are too early... but then they refuse to sit still so you end up having to micro manage your smaller ships moving back and forth untill the right time to bring them up closer to your larger ships for the attack to start

shurly the races are being done well? ..... nope
granted i havent played matches with them all yet but so far its a definate nope. the psylons i remember being an awesome race.... so what did they do to them in this game?  in the animations they made their advisor into the stereotypical highschool geek whos afraid to speak. and with that in mind in the game play they have a tendancy to rule their corner of the galaxy with ease, crushing any race unlucky enough to be stuck in the same boxed in star lane segment as them

the diplomacy.... needs to be implemented still... aside from the ai making demands of you and then declairing war when you refuse, there is none but they have announced that its going to be worked on (thank god, if i hear the murshan hiss at me for refusing to give them money ill snap and declare war on them first)

so long story short i prefered playing moo 3 to this stage of its progress... wait until its out of early access to buy and keep an eye on it because it does have potential to be great..... great flop or great success is yet to be seen


***Update***

 so after a couple of patches the game is comming together nicely and im changing my recommendation to a yes 

you do need to understand its still a work in progress, like the diplomacy while it has been worked on, still needs more work done such as: it would be nice to throw out a counter offer (within reason) to avoid the ""refused to trade with us"" penalty to rep because an offer of 60 credits/bc/gc/whatever they call the currency is too low for technology that requires multiple turns to research

the only other part of the game i dislike is their choice for voice actors for some of the leaders/advisors such as the silicoid advisor.... for those who dont know, the silicoids are a race of rock people (essentally) and their advisor is a soft voiced person it just dosnt seem to fit, but i gotta say they did a good job on most of the leaders voices

now you may be noticing im only saying what i dont like about the game... thats mainly because the rest is either in the awesome catagory or at least the acceptable because its early access

and i guess now that ive said that i should give some examples.... this game is the most stable early access ive seen and i have gotten into several... a few that i regret too... not this one though

the real time ship combat has been greatly improved you can set individual ships engadgement distances so you can customise your ships to have specializations such as long range missile support or a close range brawler. you can also set all ships movement speeds so your frigates and destroyers no longer rush way ahead of the titans that they are cannon fodder for.

i cant confirm it but the unstable star lanes seem to be less frequent than before

TLDR: was ok, got better, getting better with each patch..... EDIT: except the diplomacy..... that team needs to get their shit together

**Update #2**

latest patch increased the ai's value of starcharts.... mix this with the screwed up diplomacy and i have just pissed off another race because they think that their starcharts and 3 credits a turn is worth an entire planet.... thats right they wanted me to give them one of my first planets for their star charts",1458285171,1461962277,True,6,0,0.48657718300819397,0,True,False,True
298050,22635110,76561198032782400,0,8,4884,0,2344,1497666883,"I like the game so far.  I think it has captured some of the spirit of both MOO and MOO2.  Although it is early access, its playable and fun against the computer opponents, although they can be somewhat predictable.  Settle a colony near a computer opponent, when they ask you not too, and in my experience they almost always attack soon.

This is my opinion after playing a few EA2 games, and 2 EA3 games, one  I'm about 500 turns into.

Pros:
Voiceovers - well done and I appreciate the celebrity choices to do the voice overs. 
Ship graphics - I like the ship graphics.  Each alien race has a unique style which I like.  Watching combat between the ships in tactical combat is fun, especially when you have a Titan launch a bunch of Plasma torpedos at a Star Base or hit a ship with 10 Graviton beams at once, or watch point defense phasors wipe out a group of missiles coming towards your Battleship.  :)
Colony cutscenes - Well done and fun to watch, and the cutscene includes the colony ship that matches the ship style of the Alien race you are playing.
Galaxy map and overview - I think its well done and I can usually follow what's going on and where everything is moving over a section of the galaxy.
Sounds and music - I like most of what has been done so far.
Colony view screen - shows most of the information I need to know and I like they way the build queue is setup.
Alien Diplomacy screen - I think this is well done and I like the different backgrounds and animations for each leader.
Tech Tree - A lot of tech to research and most of the weapons from MOO/MOO2 seem to be in the tree.  Takes a while to research up to Doom Stars, stellar converters, mauler, sub-space teleport, etc, so it seems like the game is reasonably well balanced in this regard.  
Its addictive and fun - If I start a gaming session, its difficult to stop without playing at least a couple hours.

Cons:
Some Bugs - The game is still early access and has some bugs.  Its very playable, but it has crashed or locked up on me a few times.  The new ship designer in EA3 caused one crash, and I've had the game lock up going into tactical combat on 2 occasions.
Advisor Voiceover repetition - For the research the advisor animations and voiceovers are fun for a bit, but since they pick from a limited set of dialog, it does start to get old in a long game.  Although I will call out that each alien's advisors say a different set of dialog and they can be a bit humorous at times.
Combat - I have tried to take control of combat from the AI, but its not real intuitive how to control all the ships systems.  I did figure out there was a min-max range slider control and another control for ship speed.   That was EA2, I haven't figured out how to control combat in EA3.
Colony auto-build - the auto build doesn't always work that great.  It always seems to build a marine barracks first on a new planet, and then goes to missile base, starbase, etc.  It seems very defense/military biased even if you have the colony set on ""balanced"".  This can be a problem if the new planet needs food or production as a higher priority at the moment.
Bombing doesn't seem to work much better or differently after you upgrade to fusion bombs or anti-matter.  I was playing an EA3 game last night and had to bomb colonies 5 or more times with 2 cruisers and several destroyers and sometimes only a couple buildings or one population would get knocked out.
Antarans aren't around as far as I can tell, and there is only the guardian at Orion and some space monsters.  I hated the Antarans in MOO2, but they did make the game more interesting and it was fun once you had enough ships and tech to beat them.  It might be nice to have Antarans attack as an game ""option"".
Limited AI Opponents - I have played against up to 5 computer opponents, but the game won't support more than 5 as far as I can figure out.",1461612212,1461955651,True,27,0,0.508843600749969482,0,True,False,True

I've played about five MOO4 games so far and have enjoyed the experience, though there are some things that could be improved to make the game more interesting/ challenging.


1. The first thing I noticed was that any race can colonise any planet, regardless of it's type. In MOO2 you had to research the technology to allow colonisation of different planet types. The lack of this requirement in MOO4 makes it too easy. It also removes any advantage of choosing Silicoid as your race.

2. Star lanes are new but I don't mind this. Star lanes can be used for strategic effect so I'm happy with this change.

3. Technology progression is too fast in MOO4. It's too easy to get the technology you want and it doesn't feel like an achievement. 

4. It's difficult to see the impact of new technology in MOO4 and some of the new technology seems to have been diluted in its value eg; Ground Batteries.

5. The duplication of the voice hints in the technology screens is annoying.

6. Diplomacy is still clunky in MOO4, It would be nice to be able to counter-offer proposals from other races rather than just accept/decline.

7. Space combat isn't very interesting. I just use auto-resolve to save the time it takes to load the graphics.

8. Space Pirates are just an annoyance really. It would be more interesting if  you could negotiate with them.

9. Minor civilisations are an interesting feature in MOO4, though they seemed to get wiped out before you can interact with them. It would be better if you could somehow offer them protection from other races.

10. The new GNN characters are funny. I'd like to see this further developed.

Here's the TL;DR of my lengthy review as of the latest patch [b](4/23/16)[/b]: 

Although it is in Early Access and most developers and fans will insist there's time for change, the game's core mechanics seem finalized, and it is those core mechanics that are deeply flawed, making for an [b]unsatisfying[/b], [b]unoriginal[/b], and [b]poorly executed[/b] experience. Unless you are a casual player, I do not recommend this game.

If you're still reading, you're probably curious to know why I feel this way. Let's start with what I [i]think[/i] those core mechanics are, and what makes them deeply flawed. There are three, and you've seen them before in other, better games:

[list]
    [*]Planetary management
    [*]Research
    [*]Combat
[/list]

I don't believe diplomacy is a core mechanic, and I am fairly confident it will [b]never[/b] become one, as spending just a few minutes in-game will show you how easy it is to abuse negotiations, and how illogical--and obnoxious--the AI is; in [i]every[/i] match I've played (single/multiplayer) the AI demands credits from me, regardless of our relationship or my behavior, and if I fail to appease them, war is soon declared. If you've played even a handful of other 4x titles, this should sound quite familiar.

[h1]PLANETARY MANAGEMENT[/h1]

Planetary management consists of dragging and dropping colonists across three lines of resources: research, food, and production. The resources earned every turn depend on the planet type and the planet's modifiers (mostly positive, and a few negative), mid/late-game research, and specialized buildings, but consecutive colonists in a line provide diminished returns on resources. At a glance, it might seem worth it to distribute your colonists in a balanced fashion, but as a resource, food is overwhelmingly powerful, and as the research tree is terrible (technologies impact your empire in a lopsided manner) there's almost no reason to [b]ever[/b] assign colonists to research over food or production.

[b]Food is overwhelmingly powerful.[/b]

The turns needed to produce new colonists from food are on a relatively linear curve, meaning that the sooner you start massing food, the sooner you cap out your colonists. There is no ""soft"" cap on your colonists, only a maximum that the planet can support; you'd think that certain buildings would be required to steadily increase how many colonists you can sustain and provide for--especially on inhospitable planets--but the developers opted instead to determine that ""hard"" cap from a planet's size, not from it's structures, and reduce the available food on those inhospitable planets. This means that it is still desirable to colonize small worlds; in other games, small worlds are undesirable, as many turns/credits are needed to build/buyout structures which increase the population cap. 

Terraforming a world can increase the maximum colonists that it can support, and a handful of late-game technologies can be researched that also increase this maximum (it is important to note that these technologies apply to [b]all[/b] of your worlds), but the turns needed for these two things are substantial, and typically the game is decisive by the time they're available to you.

The only reason a player might be inclined to [b]not[/b] mass food is the dimishing return, but this penalty is minor, and unless it is tuned to become quite severe, it will remain irrelevant. Immediately prioritizing food will make your worlds much, much stronger in far fewer turns than opponents who do not. Some of you might be saying that I am mistaken, that prioritizing food means you're sacrificing something critical elsewhere, like system defenses or ships, but considering the poor design choice of star lanes and scanners (structures that reveal incoming ships), you have potentially [b]dozens[/b] of turns to adjust your production in response to threats. And since you will be earning more credits per turn than otherwise, you can afford more and earlier buyouts.

If structures were required to increase the cap on your colonists and/or they tuned the diminishing return on food, it could allow for more diverse gameplay. Unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen, as the bulk of gameplay is tied to what you research, and as I said earlier, the research tree is terrible.

[h1]RESEARCH[/h1]

[b]The research tree is terrible.[/b]

The majority of it feels required, not optional, leaving little room for experimentation or alternate strategies. There's a clear meta. This problem is compounded by the incredible number of prerequisites required for each successive research.

You replace newly unlocked technologies--particularly for ships--with even newer ones before the effects of the former are even felt; it is possible to have your newest ships become nearly obsolete after only a handful of turns. Considering how long it can take ships to travel across your controlled systems, they're unlikely to even see combat before becoming obsolete. This happens constantly throughout all stages of the game, and keep in mind that I never prioritize research; I unlock technologies at a slower rate than was intended.

Few technologies feel satisfying. The developers had some technologies that were binary; you chose one or the other, and that was it. In the most recent patch, the developers changed a substantial number of technologies to binary. This would be an issue if not for the fact that you can get an upgraded version the technology you did [b]not[/b] select in the [i]very[/i] next research, making that previous choice completely pointless. This happens constantly throughout the research tree.

Outside of structures that modify your resources, the bulk of what you earn from the research tree feels [b]underpowered[/b]. This is constrasted by extremely overpowered technologies scattered in the tree, like the battle pods, or an empire-wide reduction in the production needed for structures and ships. Some technologies should require a minimum number of research-oriented structures before they can be unlocked--at least then I'd be penalized for not focusing on it, and players who do feel satisfied when they're given those overpowered technologies.

[h1]COMBAT[/h1]

[b]Space battles are attrition-based and entirely unengaging, and the AI controling your ships (enabled by default) is atrocious.[/b]

This is how a battle begins: each fleet deploys on the far side of a randomly generated field. There is often debris, like asteroids, in the field. When you un-pause (battles are paused by default), your ships immediately move towards the enemy fleet, regardless of their equipped weaponry, and they immediately fire any weapons that are in range. I have watched so many battles (spectating combat is only available in singleplayer) where a salvo of missiles fly right into an asteroid. Fire that gunner, please. If that doesn't happen, the salvo destroys an enemy ship. Because missiles have the longest range of any weapon, the first salvo effectively determines the battle. Fully armed, every generation of ships I produce equipped with missiles is guaranteed to destroy at least two enemy ships. There is no reason to equip any other kind of weaponry, especially when you unlock a ""special"" for your ship that gives missiles secondary targets. 

Point defenses and weapon modifiers that take up more space within your ships are either unimplemented or a waste; and even if they were neither of those two things, the AI that brings your ships into what is basically melee range completely removes any advantages they might offer. Why do my missiles need more speed or armor when they're being fired point-blank? Why does my ship move into melee range in the first place? 

I don't have enough characters to further explain the other lacking aspects of this game.",1461435975,1461465871,False,435,18,0.804392158985137939,20,True,False,True

Pros: 
1. This game is exremelely easy to control and understand how to play.
2.Plenty of story for all the races even if their is no campaign.
3. There is a progression system for your technology research and what you decide to research will affect you later on in your mission.
4.  Plenty of sizes for maps to choose from and you can enable or disable features such as Pirates,etc.
5. Random events happen throughout the game to keep you interested and keep and playing.

Cons:
1.  For those of you that dont like simple games this game may be too simple for you to play.
2. The mouse is your only control function and you can hardly navigate during other player turns.
3. The custom race option is not really made to well no matter how customized you make it you only get 100 points to play with but some perks require 30+ just to select and no matter which race you choose to be descended from your basically playing the origional race so no point in creating your own race.

Well it happened...

[u][b]Background and Theory[/b][/u]

MOO2 is in my top 4 favourite games. 

I took MOO3 as a personal slight against me... I know most of us did.

The bar is high because of Two but low because of Three.

It will suffer from being too much like MOO2/1 and, conversely, too different from MOO2/1. 

It also will suffer from where it pitches itself, to some degree it doesn't and I suspect won't offer  the complexity that is now consider normal for 4X games.

[u][b]Reviewish[/b][/u]

This is a very playable game. It is very pretty (it's fantastic to get to see more of the original races, even the voice acting is well done), responsive and suitably addictive. 

I really like:
The new ability to build space structures
Stricter use of pathway moment 
Real time space battles with a pause button (I love the old battle system but feel that it would have aged the game). 
The 'diminished returns' system with worker placement.
The wee movies.
The fleshing out of races.

Currently it's a bit overpriced by 33% - 66% I'd say. Though, worth supporting if you're a fan of the series and have spending money - why not? 

This is a worthy addition to the cannon - MOO3 was not, iMO. I'm really pleased to say we are in safe hands!

Starting rating 7
(This is in the top 2% of Early Access - it looks and feels great.)

1.  There is no ""hall of fame"" for single player-whether you've won or lost, there's no score.
2.  There are no leaders for planets or ships-for me the leaders were important part of my strategy-depending on one's adversaries your colony leaders could mean the difference between winning or losing.

It has all the terms, sounds and races anyone familiar with MoO games will recongize.  The graphics are really stunning for a 4X strategy game and it feels very well optimized for a game still in early access.  The voice acting is really on point and the people they got to play the voice roles are very noticable for anyone that really loved sci-fi TV shows from the 80's though the early 2000's.  From where it started and to where it is now really has me feeling this is going to turn into a really outstanding game once its completely polished, tuned, and most importantly completed.  So below when I say some thing still need some work or are kind of bad right now take it with a grain of salt.  They have been working and fixing many of these things as early access as continued.  I sespect that to continue without a doubt.  But I am just tossing my opinion on those things as they are at this point and in my opinion (of course).

My warning to rose tinted glasses people:
The only warning I give to people about this game is that if you go into it expecting it to be MoO2 with a new engine you likely are going to be disappointed.  Certainly if you plan to kick, scream, and complain constatly about it not being other wise.  This game will not be that.  It will most certainly be its own stand alone title with differences and changes.

Here is my quick breakdown as of NOW (early access - so subject to change)
Whats good:
-graphics
-sounds
-voice acting
-""feel"" of space and space battles
-""direction"" the alpha is heading feels good as well.
-listening to fans that maintain reasonable character on the offical forums (respond often as well!)

What needs some work still:
-tech tree (feels dry so far, but getting better with patches!)
-AI response and reactions (its very much in the angry teenager stage but has shown improvement)
-diplomacy (its not in the game yet, so I put it here -- but for early access it makes a hole noticable in game)

The bad:
-over time repeatitive voice calls can annoy you (bird tech guy anyone?).  Be sure to set your volumes here correctly!
-needs more options and choice in space battles (which have been coming in patches but still more!)

Pros: True to origins. Love it. Wonderfully satisfying combat. Annoying voices can be turned off.

Cons: Same old grind to get to the end win when it is obviously guranteed. Still some game balancing required and some minor bugs. If the AI was a bit smarter then it would be more dynamic and challenging. However, this will all likely change in upcoming updates... how exciting!

One of the previous reviews of this game started with a postulate like that: ""You are a Psilon now... I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can research all tech from current technology benefits most of the time."".
Well, it is also possible to make a postulate like that: ""You are a Silicoid now... I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can colonize all planets except gas giants and asteroids now from the beginning"".
The list may be continued. Simplified game mechanics leaves no room for visible race difference.
If you want some MOO, buy MOO 2 on gog.com, also you can find relativly fresh mods for it.Or buy Star drive 2 se4ctor zero, I am going to buy it soon.
I also do not recommend to buy anything from NGD Studious or wargaming (WG Labs) from now on.
They are just impudent assholes trying to get money for no work.
This guys, for example, didn't include a goverment system and leaders system in their pityfull byproduct!
They dare to say that just maybe they would make leader system in the future (maybe, in DLC?).
Features, which there were in MOO 2 20 (yes, 20, Karl) years ago!
Imagine, I do not know, John Carmac releasing Doom 4 without armour and with decreased number of weapons in comparison with Doom 2! And tells you, that he have heard the wishes of community for armor in the game, and he is thinking that maybe somehow (DLC?) it would be implemented in some future!
If we would pay for such freaks, they would continue to degenerate the hole game industry.
Well, there are also some ""minor"" issues for not buying this game - their game designer didn't play MOO 2 any visible amount of time and, while being cleanly identified as a civ-player (and not moo player) by MOO community, is considered to be a mediocre player in civilisation at best by some. So, while it is early access now, it is doubtfull that a good progress would be possible. 
Watching their forums, keep in mind that this freaks delete negative posts, threads, and ban unwelcomed users.
So, just stay away and wait for metacritic results, and compare the rating of the game with stardrive 2, stellaris, polaris sector, galactic civilisations 2-3, and think twice before supporting idiots who make a remake of 20 years old game cutting off many important features of it and adding about nothing but graphics, Well, this stupid creatures also boast that they hired a well-known artists for postcoring an advisors for this game, but periodically on the forum appear themes were people ask to shut down some of them because they are very annoying.",1460577781,1460577781,False,17,3,0.480183631181716919,0,True,False,True

While fans of the MoO series will easily be able to adapt, there are a number of changes that have been implemented (such as star lanes) that impact the gameplay by making it more similar to some modern space 4X games. Whether or not this is a Good Thing (TM) probably depends upon how old you are.

In its still unfinished state, most major features are implemented. Some features need some TLC: customizing star ship designs isn't as fun or friendly as it could be, switching between screens make an annoying sound, finding and selecting what to build in the selection menu is something of a chore, and pollution isn't the threat that it should be. I haven't experienced and thus don't review all races or spying in this review.

I'd like to see pollution scale in severity to the planet type. Gaia worlds should be very sensitive to high levels of pollution and should provide a more clear benefit. There is little clarity as to what the planet ""specials"" do (Dark Quartz = ?) or why you want them and you don't get new tech for exploring or colonizing Artifacts planets. Tech research times are also much too rapid, you will find it difficult to keep your fleet up with your pace of technological development. Several of the techs have poor descriptions. I expect much of this to be cleaned up as the game moves towards production.

Tactical combat is no longer turn based and is now real time (also similar to other modern space 4X games). You can now control the speed ships move at and control the rate of time. I would personally prefer to see a return (or option for) turn based tactical combat. Battles also don't last very long, taking some of the fun out of them. The planet screen needs some more work; I don't like the rather ""cartoonish"" icons for workers/researchers/farmers.

Good: Return to classic gameplay, modernized interface. Nothing like the soul crushing nightmare that was MoO 3. Less micromanagement and more fun overall.
Bad: Combat isn't as fun as it used to be, some adoptions of ""modern"" 4X games add questionable value to the game. Turn-based tactical combat was fun.
Ugly: The end game on large maps gets laggy and crashes more often. A ""failed to create new game"" bug causes the game to crash every 50 or so turns for me.",1458705756,1460523963,True,26,2,0.524852931499481201,0,True,False,True

A prayer that somone would come along and remake one of those classic 90's games you loved so much, without changing anything. (Almost) If you played Masters of Orion or Masters of Orion 2: Battle at Antares just buy the game, don't think, you'll thank me. If you've never played a game in the series before think of this as Civilization 2 or 3 in Space, or a more fun Galactic Civilizations (sorrynotsorry). The civilizations you can choose to play are all the classic sci-fi alien archetypes: Cat people, lizard people, greys, robots, and so on. 

Overall this game at the moment is an 8.5 out of 10, taking into account it is unfinished. I have spent probably hundreds of hours playing Masters of Orion 2: Battle at Antares, and this game replicates that experience almost perfectly. 

PROS: The races are all solid and familiar, but their abilities differ somewhat from previous versions of the game. This is more interesting than problematic, and it should be clear to the new player what race reflects their play style.

The tech tree is pulled right from Battle at Antares, as well as ship classes, weapons and upgrades. 

The new voice acting and art for both the racial models and ships is much more immersive and brings the races to life.

The biggest change to the game from Battle at Antares is the way you can move between stars. One can no longer travel to any nearby star within range of your ships, but rather, follow pre-determined hyperspace lanes that only connect to certian other stars. At first this was a con to me but I've come around. Although this map setup can lead to the awkward situation where the nearest star to your homeworld can only be reached by passing through several other star systems. It creates a lot of interesting strategies to control star systems with a lot of cross traffic in order to control large sections of the map. Because you are able to build military outposts on each node that leads out of a system you control, you can ""seal up"" whole portions of the map from races you aren't allied with. 

CONS: These are all minor and non game breaking, but cons nonetheless. I also know some of these complaints are because this is based off MoO1 not 2 

Missing Races: Elerians, Trilarians, Gnolam

Game is a bit unstable and I have lost progress due to game crashes, though this may be fixed by the final build

The hyperspace lanes thing still kinda irks me so a bit of a con

MOOX is basically a reskinned - and simplified - version of MOO2. Note that MOO2 was not at all a complex game to begin with. The AI is much more forgiving than in MOO2: it is less aggressive, less intelligent, and also gets a much smaller production handicap. 

The diplomacy is an awkward mix of the rather outdated and opaque systems from MOO2 and Civ3: you can create deals a la carte, but it is difficult to predict whether the AI will accept them (and there is *always* a rep penalty for a failed proposal, even if your offer is only marginally less than what the AI would accept).

The game fails hardest at the strategic level. The basic problem with the game is lack of player choice, combined with pig-headed AI that sends out fleets to destroy everything in their path until they are ground down by attrition by the player. In sum, the AI has the level of intelligence and sophistication one would expect from a game written 25 years ago. 

The game has a very low skillcap and basically plays like a piece of freeware or one of those no-name 4X games you can find in the bargain bin at Staples. These days, one could literally get a better game for free. This is not a game worth the same retail price as Starcraft II or Fallout 4. 

MOOX has the makings of a good game, but I think the dev team is overly cautious and uninspired - I get the feeling the devs are from B-game companies and the dev team leadership is really tepid and just copies features from other games, rather than innovating and doing internal testing - and the end result will fall far short of its potential, which is a shame because MOOX does, like I said, have a lot of unrealized potential. Maybe modders will play with it later. Frankly, I think the goal at the corporate level was just to make a low-budget, B-team $50 cash cow players would plop down money on for sheer nostalgia. From a financial standpoint, I have no doubt they succeeeded. 

Anyway, bottom line - in terms of game experience, this game just isn't worth it. Don't waste your money.

Game elements in MOO2 gone from MMOX include:
- Almost all tech implementation picks (a handful of techs have them on an individual basis)
- Intra-system colony pods
- Boarding parties and self-destruct
- Freighters
- Spies (apparently not yet implemented, although the overall structure of the game suggests this functionality will be very limited)

Compared with MOO3:
- Spacelanes, a really bad design element, are in evidence
- System (sublight) ships, which were actually a cool idea, are not in evidence
- Moon development does feature in the game but is very, very limited, offering only a few bonus points for a couple touch-and-go improvements 

Suggestions for devs:
- Remove spacelanes
- Buff AI intelligence and strength
- Add more options overall
- Make the game pacing more variable; differentiate short/long-game choices
- Add system ships, the ship design system from MOO3 was basically good but poorly implemented
- Reintroduce features from MOO3 without making them overwhelming or inconsequential
- More terraforming / economic customization
- More races
- Less cliche in race design (hurr durr big tough guy / indigenous nation mystics)",1459698078,1460427504,False,15,3,0.505050778388977051,4,True,False,True

(April 10th 2016 - review based on playing EARLY ACCESS, SECOND STAGE release)

The developers of the new game are promoting it as ""a worthy successor"" to the original Master of Orion, and that's why I purchased it. Based on the current release, it is [b]not a worthy successor to the original[/b]. In fact, it seems to have far more in common with Master of Orion 2 than the original.

[h1]MY TAKE ON THE ORIGINAL GAMES[/h1]

I'm old enough to say that I played all the original Master of Orion games when they were new. I played MOO1 when I was in university and spent an obscene number of hours on it, sometimes missing classes after playing all night. I purchased MOO2 back when games came in a box with CD-ROMs and a printed manual. I did the same when MOO3 was released.

MOO3 was pure crap, so I won't even discuss it. MOO2 was fun, but lost much of the 'epic' feel of the original. The UI in MOO2 was clearly worlds beyond what was in MOO1. The atmospheric background music in MOO2 was excellent. MOO1 is still my favourite though. It was released in the early 90's, and a PC from that era had less horsepower than a cheap smartphone of today, so the graphics, sounds and UI look horrible now. Despite that, MOO1 really captured the feeling of starting small in a big galaxy, expanding in all directions to stake your claim for more, and eventually fighting for it. One of the best things about MOO1 was how the tech 'tree' was different in each game. Each race was only able to research a random subset of all the available techs. The rest could only be obtained via trading, espionage, or conquest. That was brilliant. It made the game very replayable and unpredictable, and forced you to adapt if your preferred early-game techs were not open to be researched.

MOO2 dumbed-down some core mechanics from MOO1. In MOO2, you were limited to a number of ships less than the overall 'Command Points' for your empire. The tiniest ship size cost 1 CP per ship, and the biggest cost 6 CP per ship. The number of CPs in the late game was often small, like low 100's. Late game MOO2 fleets were not very epic.

The new game closely resembles MOO2 in several ways. Most notable is the boring always-the-same tech tree (even tech names). They also kept the Command Points.


[h1]BAD AND GOOD STUFF IN THE NEW GAME[/h1]

[b]Bad - Galaxy map and scale of the galaxy[/b]
I really hate the way they implemented the galaxy map.
[list]
 [*] The scale of the galaxy vs individual star systems is just BAD! To compare with a modern 4X game that gets it right, look at Distant Worlds (also available on Steam). That game has it's own set of problems, but capturing the system vs galaxy scale is not one of them. You can zoom all the way in to individual planets, then way way way out to see the entire galaxy, and it feels right. Master of Orion feels totally wrong. For example, moving a ship from one side of a system to the other side often gives you vision of the adjacent system on that side. Isn't the size of a star system insignificant compared to the distance between stars? On the other hand, let's say the size of a star system is vast. Then why does any 'move' within any star system always take exactly one turn, regardless of the system size? This mechanic is goofy and really needs improvement. It makes the game feel cheesy.
 [*] Star systems are connected by fixed 'warp paths' that are pre-determined at the start of the game. If there is no warp path between two systems, then it means you can't go there. It doesn't matter if those systems are right next to each other on the galaxy map. It makes the galaxy map seem like its just a nice graphic drawn over a simplistic graph of lines connecting points that I'm forced to follow. You may only enter and exit a star system via a 'warp point', which is one end of a 'warp path'. This mechanic isn't fun and makes the game seem like a low-quality app.
 [*] Building a 'Military Outpost' (kind of a mini-starbase) on top of a warp point completely prevents opponents' ships from entering the star system at that warp point, unless they destroy it in battle. Come again? Space is pretty vast, right? Why not just go AROUND the outpost? Whenever you start a combat with one of them, you start out of range, so why not just fly around. These Military Outposts are available right at the start of the game. Lame.
 [*] There is no concept of 'ship range' or 'fuel'. Any ship can explore around in space indefinitely, and go anywhere that there are 'warp paths' to follow. This includes the scout ships you start with on the first turn of the game.
 [*] Midway through the tech tree, you can get a tech called 'Warp Gates' that makes a joke of the whole 'warp paths' concept. Any system where you build a Warp Gate is now considered to have a 'warp path' to every other system you own that also has a Warp Gate. Why not just do away with both of these cheesy concepts, introduce fuel/range back into the game (like MOO1/MOO2), and allow fleets to travel anywhere that is within their range.
[/list]

[b]Bad - Boring tech tree[/b]
The new game has stuck with the terrible MOO2-style tech tree, even keeping many of the technology names. The tech path in MOO1 was possibly the best thing about that game. Each play-through gave you a different set of techs you were allowed to research, and there were more of them than in MOO2. If you've played and enjoyed MOO1, you'll know what I'm talking about. The new game should have kept this.

[b]Good Stuff[/b]
The new game does have some aspects that I like.
[list]
 [*] The fleet battles look good, even though this part of the game isn't finished yet. The options for controlling your own fleet are still somewhat limited. Ships in your fleet that are the same ship model are grouped together in combat when you issue orders. You can choose from different formations, each giving unique combat bonuses. The fleet combat looks great. Each type of weapon looks and sounds unique. When you hit a ship/starbase with shields, you'll see the shield impacts. When a ship/base starts to take a lot of hull damage, it will start to look like its on fire inside the hull. This part of the game is headed in the right direction.
 [*] You get diminishing returns when you assign many of a planet's population to Farming and/or Industry. Each planet also has a fixed number of production slots on each production type (Research, Farming, Industry), and the number of slots depends on the planet size. This usually prevents you from putting all of the population on either Farming or Industry. I like how that works.
 [*] More industrial production causes more pollution. If you allow the pollution to get out of control and it reaches 100% polluted, then that planet will be permanently reduced to the next lower category of 'biome' (like Terran downgraded to Swamp). Your three options to prevent this are: a) research tech that reduces generated pollution; b) spends turns on 'cleanup' (which is lost production time); c) build things more slowly, so production stays below the threshold where pollution accumulates. This game mechanic makes sense and is a good addition.
 [*] Production queues are a thing. Done better than MOO2.
 [*] I'm mostly indifferent about the sci-fi celebrity voice actors. They recruited heavy hitters like Mark Hamill, half the cast of Star Trek TNG, and even the pilot from Serenity. I hope they didn't spend a lot of the development budget on this frivolous aspect of the game. I'm embarrassed for Michael Dorn, that he was forced to read some of the uber-crap dialogue (wait for the narration after you bomb a pirate base - /facepalm...) The exception to this is the funny Galactic News Network anchor robot that is voiced by Dwight Schultz (the actor who played Lt Barclay in Star Trek) - love it!

I played the old games alot. and this game captures a fair amount of the old games.

-The Ai isnt too bright in deplomacy
-Traveling outside of predefined starlanes comes a bit too late in the game it feels,
-Travelling though the red warp points comes waaaay too late.
-The Ai that handles the auto building does not take into consideration what your ""focus"" whether balance or production or food
- the game started by default on low graphic settings.(which look beyond garbage)

Of course i know the game is still in early access and more still needs to be done, and I accept that.

If you've ever played Endless Space, you will love the latest installment of Master of Orion. Very similar 4X gameplay, but with more options in terms of ship designs, scales, weaponry and special modules, also more terraforming options. Unlike other 4X games like Endless Space and Civ V, when you start a battle, you go opt into a very quick real time combat, sort of like real time combat in total war games but so much shorter, battles that last maybe two or three minutes maximum. It makes for a more interseting time, as sometimes you can push through better in real time, not often, but I have noticed that units that have a lot of missiles and not much else don't tend to have a very high auto resolve rating, but can crush in real time. In terms of bugs, I have encountered one game ending bug, but that has only happened once and is to be expected when it comes to an early access game, but the auto save feature saves every turn, so I reset the game and pressed continue and I was maybe 30 seconds behind where it crashed, and it didn't occur again. Also the cool little landing cinematic that happens when you first colonise a planet are such a small touch, but it honestly makes the game that much more stunning, I just wish that they would have varying intros rather than just the same angle and landing intro every time you land on a barren planet. I would also love to see a cinemativ when you land troops on a planet and successfully conquer it, that would be cool. Overall I would say this game is definitely worth a buy, even in early access, although I would warn about the addictiveness that comes with games like this, definitely a great way to bring back a franchise.

I think they did the right thing with planets this time around, as oppsed to the MOO3 disaster. I like that there's more yield in the first good spots.

Star lanes are bad. Part of the reason diplomacy isn't what it was in MOO2 (which wasn't what it was in MOO1) is that you rarely border more than two other empires. None of the craziness of five-ways wars in the middle of the map.

I miss the cheap ships of MOO1: dangit, I want to have 10,000 fighters in a stack.

Crashes on exit and most of the races dont attack when at war with you though but hopefully these will be fixed

The diplomacy is also painful as the other race will ask for money and hate you if you say no but wont give you money if you ask, if a system similar to the diplomacy in the Endless games was used were you could see a rough idea of what each item is worth like:

1) The landing cut scenes are crap. The ship is way off in the distance and yet it is shown as if they are flying in front of the trees that are right in front of the camera (from your point of view). I am not a game programer by any means, but this is just lazy and shows either that they don't have much in the way of quality control or just have not gotten around to fixing it yet (I hope it is the later). 
2) Landing scenes part 2: No ship sounds...just music. I hope this gets changed. I have tried turning down the music, but the ships just float down without sound. Also, when the ships get ready to land...no landing struts? The scene just cuts out (and some of the designs don't look like the will land too well...with parts that will be buried deep into the ground and cause the ship to crash!)
3) The Psilon AI (helper) voice is the MOST annoying voice in the game. No way to shut off the AI helper yet. Please get rid of the Psilon AI voice or change it's tone. Too shrill (IMO).
4) Sol, the home system of the Humans usually only starts with 1 planet? I'm pretty sure our Solar System has more than one. Also, along that same note, I have yet to play a game where your starting system has more than one planet that you can use. Sure, late game tech lets you change gas giants and asteroid belts into planets, but that doesn't help you to start off. 
5) There needs to be more options under advanced options: Such as: Minimum planets per system and Max per system. I have had several games where I found yellow stars (which should generally hold the best planets) without any planets. Also, needed: 1) Distance between star systems, 2) A ""Huge"" galazy size, 3) Difficulty setting for each AI (some species are more aggressive than others). 4) The abiity to customize your ship types (the models shown. I love playing the Psilons, but hate their ship shapes). 5) The ability to choose your empire color and flag.
6) Combat right now is a major sore point for many players. Some absolutely hate real time and want the turn based of the original MOO. Others are on the other side of the fence. I like both ways personally. However, The orders for the ships need to be fleshed out a great deal more. I don't want my long range missle armed ships to closed to point blank range. There also should be a chance to get some tech points or something from wreckage I think (maybe have to have a salvage drone on your ships?).
7) Asteroid belts need to have a chance to have some kind of bonus (have rare metals (bonus production/research if a base is built) or artifacts or something. Right now, they can be explored...but I have yet to find anything special about them.
8) Ship designer needs to have an option to edit your military bases and star bases. Right now the computer chooses what tech to place on your bases and it will upgrade it, but if you have choosen a missle heavy approach and beam weak...the beams on your station won't due you a whole lot of good will they?).
9) Ship designer needs to have more stats about the weapons. When I am building my ship, I want to see the range of the weapon I am placing on the ship. I would also like to be able to test my ship (either against another design of mine or against known ships that are out there), before I start building a fleet of them.
10) The tech tree is a bit limited. There are no race specific techs and some of the explanation for the techs are wrong. Example: Cloning centers should increase your growth by a certain percent. Yet for months they are listed (and any other structure that is supposed to give a bonus to growth as well) as -x%, not +x%.
11) The game in general feels very watered down. No artifacts that you can discover on planets that give bonus tech, ships or credits (though there are some things floating around in space that you can pick up, rare though). 
12) The game stutters some (like all WG platforms I think). I have a 2.67Ghz i7, 24GB Ram, Geforce GTX-980 (not the crappy version).

Okay, the pros:
1) If you are a fan of 4x, you will like this game. Is it 100% ready? No. I would say it is about 70-80% there (I hope they are going to flesh it out a bit more). 
2) The graphics (when they get them right) are good.
3) The special effects of battle are good (when you can zoom in and see them).
4) The replay value is good, however, it can get boring since parts are still missing.

Overall, I would rate this game a 6.5/10. It has the potential to be a 9. If future patches change my opinion, I will update the review. However, I am personally waiting for Stellaris to come out on May 9th. That game seems to be just fricking awesome. Disappointed on how WG seems to have dropped the ball on this game.

-Meklar are massively overpowered in research.
-Terran have major environmental issues.

+Very good looking reboot of an excellent 4x game.
+Easy to play, and intuitive.
+Extremely stable, I have had no instances of lag whatsoever.
+It's as addictive as it should be.
+Excellent voice acting, audio, and music.

Negatives:
-Racial implementation is incomplete, several races not implemented yet.*
-Diplomacy needs work. Wars are next to impossible to get out of short of total genocide.
-No spies or espionage implemented yet. I suspect that the Darloks will be released with spies.*
-Combat needs balancing, it's like a less effective combat system from MoO 3. ~see additional comments.
-Ship design feels far more limited than previous Master of Orion games.
-Random events need to be balanced. Every one I have seen has been a planet's mineral classification increasing.
-Star systems need better balancing. Most systems are 2-3 objects orbiting the star, a (very) few have 5.
-Techs sometimes force you to choose between two things AFTER the research is complete. I experienced this several times before I finally noticed there is a bar between the icons in the research box. This needs to be clarified. I like the idea of having to branch research in some areas one way or another, but the choice should be when the research is beginning, not when it has concluded. ~see additional comments for furtherance.

Additional comments:
~Cannot rename stars and planets!!!!! --This drove me crazy with MoO 3 until it was patched.
~Cannot choose flag colour. --This also was an issue with MoO 3 before patching.
~Run spellcheck, there are several spelling errors throughout the game.
~Real time combat can  be nice, but MoO had very well balanced turn based combat before 3. Why not have a setting for turn based combat as well as real time?
~It might also be nice to branch the techs out further with the choosing specific research areas. With Fusion, if you choose fusion beam, you should get later research for enhanced targeting computers, if you go with fusion bombs, you should have later research options for hardened colony structures, or another defencive area for planets.

+ Real time combat, though it needs a lot of refinement. Ship scale needs to be increased so we can see what's going on.
+ Variation of planets and biomes is pretty good. Perhaps it needs the equivalent of Precursor worlds from GalCiv 3 however. Uber planets are decent but they're just beefed up versions of regular planets with no unique bonuses.
+ Voice acting is outstanding. Hearing ""Q"" from Star Trek: TNG voice the Human Republic leader is awesome. There isn't enough variation in the lines though; this needs to be expanded.
+ Visual effects are good, and the interface design is excellent - minimalistic but very much functional.
+ The potential of this game is immediately apparent- maybe not quite a plus point but in some early access games you know it's not going to become much better than it currently is. Not the case here. It could become THE definitive 4x game if some features are expanded and the game systems are refined further.

- AI is quite poor. This is the make or break point for the game. If the AI is vastly improved for release, the game could be very successful. I don't claim to understand the game dev process in the slightest but if their current AI team can't do a good job I'd hire more experts. This game needs the equivalent of Sorian AI from Supreme Commander. Devs: If you need to hire more people to get this sorted then please do it. Giving the AI large bonuses on Hard/Very Hard is all well and good but if it doesn't have a clue about how to play effectively then it's wasted.
- STAR LANES (think phase lanes from SoaSE): these need to be optional. We need a ship range system similar to GalCiv3 instead- star lanes are just a massive pain in the ass. I've read the devs are considering making them optional; I sure hope they do. It'd make a hell of a difference.
- Not enough ship templates.
- Game balance is a bit messed up: missiles are way OP compared to torpedos for example. Some beam weapons are weaker than they should be.
- UI could do a much better job of explaining ship weapon stats and characteristics.
- Research is too fast. Early/mid game war is a pain due to this; ships become obsolete very quickly,
- Related to the real time combat system: we need small/medium/large variations for ship weapons. Larger ships fire massive volleys of beam weapons (because we can fit so many onto the ships) which looks terrible.

Even with these negative points, I'd say the game is still worth the money. The AI is the main problem in the game, along with the star lane system. Give it a go at least; it's no risk with Steam's refund system.",1459871743,1459871743,True,21,0,0.528854727745056152,0,True,False,True

Loving every moment of this game.  In fact this is the only game I ever bothered putting in a comment.

UPDATE APRIL 2016

So, after countless hours and phase 2 fo EA here's what I've found;

CONS

- Map starlanes take away from the MOO2 experience and make it too easy to defend or hold territory for later stages of the game.

- Map sizes are too small

- Want to win?  Custom race > bonus to Production and income = outpace all races in production and cash flow and science.  Rinse and repeat.

- Custom race:  where did Creative/Uncreative go?  Where did gov't type like Unification go?  

- Want to win Part 2?:  Mass colonize.  You get to a point where eventually the races will hate you for colonizing too quickly, but the bonus' you get from all the planets you own snowball into an unstopable machine.

Did I mention Starlanes?  Kind of puts a huge damper on the mechanics IMO

Fleet ""battle points"" make it too easy when sizing up oponents...remove please!

CONS OVERALL:

- Game is made too linear, especially with the starlanes forcing natural choke points.  Just send a few ships to guard starlanes in systems you want, and hold them until you are ready.  

NOTE:  Still missing mechanics such as espionage, and boardring parties, etc

PROS:

- Upgrading system is good and allows for quick and easy upgrades to ships

- Planetary managment is good and heading in the right direction

- Got a good chunk of the MOO2 feel, with the races and GNN

OVERALL PROS:

It's getting there, slowly but surely.  I'm still optimistic that the Pro's outweigh the cons and seeing the progress from 1st stage release to 2nd gives me hopes they will reel in the line and keep it closer to the original instead of straying too far and making it a clone of some of the other more recent 4X games

- Improvements from EA phase 1 to phase 2 are fantastic, keep up the great work, but please don't lose sight of MOO2",1456646411,1459828864,True,13,0,0,0,True,False,True

Master of Orion is a game that deliveres on most, though not all, of the promises that the title makes. No one needs to hear about the 4x mechanics and there are few surprises in the MOO reboot.

But a 4x game can be implemented in many different ways, so I'll try to explain what directions the game designers have gone on a couple of key-points

I go on and on about this things, so here's a summery with scores on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest :)

Complexity: 4 (Fairly simple)
Graphics: 8 (beautiful and functional)
Sound: 7 (Quietly immersive)
Originality: 2 (Not nuch in the way of innovation)

Conclusion: if you're a fan of the 4x genre, and you like games to be simple enough that you don't have to read a 2000 page wiki before playing, then this might well be a game for you. If you're a fan of the MOO franchise and you can get past the fact that there's no turn-based combat, then you won't be dissapointed.

If you used to play MOO2 in hotseat mode with a friend and you're looking to relive those times you will however be disapointed. Hotseat not implemented :(

If you wanna check out some videos, I've recorded my first playthough here.

And then the wall of text...

Master of Orion is (at least in the Early Access version) a fairly simple 4x game. This is not neccesarily an inherently good or bad characteristic, as it depends on what kind on game experience you're after.

When I say 'complex' I'm thinking about the number of mechanics, or choices that the player has to consider at game start, or thoughout the game. A complex 4x game offer lots of choices at game start, normally in terms of which side to play and certain start conditions, as well as numerous dicisions throughout the game than often are irreversible.

Other factors include 'mini-game' mechanics such as tactical combat.

MOO has plenty of mechanics, but they aren't particularly deep. For example, you can choose your race or create a custom race using a pointsystem, but the amount of diversity is fairly small and I found that I'm able to play the game in pretty much the same way regardless of my pick. I'd compare the race selection to that of Civ5, where your civilization give you a small advantage in a given field. An example of a complex 4x game would be Age of Wonders 3, where the choices of class, race and speciallities are much more important to the kind of game you can subsequently play.

It also has tactical combat (not turn based to the lament of many die-hard MOO fans), but the choices you make do not have a huge impact on the eventual outcome. To be fair, I think tactical combat is something that will receive a lot of attention as the game developes - I'll update this review, when that happens). The game DOES have tactical combat, and it is posible to enhance the outcomes of battles if only slightly, so this aspect is certainly more advanced than civ5 to make that comparision again, where combat is pseudo-strategic but it's nowhere near as important as it is in games that focus more heavily on the strategic aspects, like the HOMM series for example. On the other hand units in MOO who fight, do not gain XP (as they do in Civ5 and most other modern 4x games). This makes losses from combat a matter of economy only - not emotional to any great extent.

The Tech tree in MOO is very, very standard, and something we've seen a thousand times. A linear progression of techs from left to right with pre-requisite techs being needed to start research. The thing that made and makes MOO a little different is, that some techs are muturally exclusive, meaing you get to choose between two techs. This is great, but since you can obtain the 'other' tech later through diplomacy, the choice becomes a little irrellevant. I'd have preferred more choices that was FINAL... The tech-tree complexity is only present if you've never played 4x games before :)

Planet and millitary buildup is a function of the tech tree, and it is equally simple. Planet structures are unlocked by tech and usually improve either, resources, research, food, or currency either directly or inderectly. Other buildings improve morale  or planetary defences but there aren't THAT many structures in total, and although each building incur an upkeep cost, you'll want to build most builings in every colony. This makes the developement of colonies a somewhat trivial decision process, that you end up automating, either my muscle memory of allowing the AI to handle it. More complex games add dimensions to colony/city/castle developement by putting a cap on how many improvements of a given type you can maintain in your empire or implement some sort of diminishing return. in the 'central star system with multiple planetary colonies' structure that MOO uses, it would be nice to have some structures that improved a given thing (like research in the whole system). 

The part of the game that offers the highest level of (potential) complexity is ship design. You can create your own version of a given ship-class (frigate, destroyer, cruiser etc.) up to some pretty ridiculous ship sizes. All very cool! This offers the promise of a mechanic, where a clever player might exploit weaknesses in an opposing player's ship design (too heavy on the missiles maybe?) to exploit and defeat. As of right not the ship design feature still feels a little incomplete and you can't review the designs of your oppsing players, even though you've met them in combat. That, in combination with the unfinished tacticat combat makes this a mechanic of great potential complexity. but not quite there just yet.

Moving away from the gameplay I'll briefly say a little about the 'wrappings'. A little unfair maybe, for the game is drop dead gorgeous and the music and sound effecs have yet to annoy me.

All colonizing is preceeded by a cutscene showing your colonyship landing on the pristine planet, while all space combat shows the opposin fleets warping in. Very cool stuff, in you're into that kind of thing. I don't spend a lot of time reveiwing  this sort of thing in a 4x game as I usually end up skipping them quite quickly, but there's no denying that the game looks beautiful, and not just in the cutscenes.

There's a pretty good VO on your various tech advisors and good sound effects on the weaponsystems etc. No complaints there!

Finally in terms of originality, I have to say that MOO bring very little to the party that we haven't seen before. This is a reboot of the MOO series and it seems like the developement of the game has been focused on NOT to repeat the mistakes of MOO3 (which I didn't play so I can't tell you if they succeeded). But it means that you're not gonna find a whole new take on the 4x genre here - you're gonna find a game that you can by, install, start and be playing in no time at all, with a very flat learning curve.",1459714348,1459714963,True,113,3,0.698326230049133301,0,True,False,True

1. you have a huge monitor and great eyesight
2. you like leaning forward every two minutes in your gaming chair to read miniscule text
3. the developers fix the small UI issue

The game looks like it might be playable if the developers do something about this small UI (WHICH they morally OUGHT to do given the 50$ pricetag).    But as of the latest EA release, they are saying that ""there were no problems reported with the UI"".  This is a bald-face lie since I have complained numerous times  on the feedback discussions along with quite a few other gamers who have mid range monitors and video cards.

Now, mind you, I'm not some guy trying to play this game on his 8 inch RCA tablet.  I got a Maingear custom machine this last summer and I'm running a 21'5 inch widescreen off a NV970 GTX with 4 Gs.  

The font only comes close to readable when I set my monitor res to 1900 and THEN start the game from there.  Otherwise, everytime I try to play it I end up straining both my eyes and back.

For 50$ the devs really need to get off their cans and fix the Ui problem.  In fact, I recommended to them at one point that they go for a nice retro cartoonish interface in order to capture the spirit of the original MOO games, but at this point I'd settle for something that was comfortable to read. 

Also - they look like they dont want to address the planet and ship ""leader"" feature that helped give MOO2 its own unique character, even though counless people on the ""feedback"" have recommended it.  In short, I don't feel like this company cares about the legend of MOO2.  The devs probably haven't even played it. 

Put it this way GC 2 is a far superior and more thoughtful game to this in its current state.  When I see something other than proof that the company just wants to just make money off the MOO franchise, I might change my opinion.  But right now, I feel like I've been bamboozled out of 50$.",1459648958,1459649243,False,6,1,0.453561484813690186,0,True,False,True

I am going to start off with that I do like and why followed by the big issues and what they need to do to correct this.

1. Sound! Omg, I was smiling from ear to ear when I realized the music for the colony ship landing was the same from the original. 

2. Graphics are great and their attention to detail just amazes me, like having the ship’s path curve AROUND the star. The races are detailed and beautifully rendered. 

3. The UI is clean and unobtrusive. This is great because you get the whole galaxy as your backdrop.

4. I love the colony manager and how they display your information, it is a great take on the MoO 2 mananger with a modern UI.

I have enjoyed playing, but I can say the same for the countless MoO clones. Sadly like them I see this getting played for a bit until the combat becomes so bland I don't pick it up ever again, usually two to three games.

1. Combat - The combat is real time and I have no direct fire control of my ships. Sure I can get into tactical mode where I tell them where to go and who to shoot but that does no good if I cannot control the weapons. I don’t want a real time combat, I wanted MoO turn based ship combat. Sure you could get bogged down in MoO 2 space combat if your fleets got really big at the end game but that is why you had AUTO. In MoO 2 you could make some really nuanced ships, and special variants, in this because of the ship combat AI you are forced to make brute force ships.

2. Research - I love MoO 1’s research, you could play multiple games and get different techs each time. I only ever saw Hand Phasers once out of countless games. This made research unique and you were always checking in on the other races to find out what they got that you didn’t. Here I find myself making strange and unintelligible choices. Why must I choose between fusion bombs and fusion beams? This doesn’t make any sense, all it does is make an optimal research path that min maxers will figure out and share, it does not add variety.

3. Range - There is no range mechanic. In the first MoO games you were limited by how far your fuel cells would let you go. A scout now however can go all over the galaxy and find everything and everyone. So instead of a gradual expansion moving forward and meeting aliens, you are thrust straight away into contact and have to start shoring up your solar systems at the Starlane warp points so you can at least hold on to some of your colonizable planets.

4. It has been brought to my attention the 500 turn limit can be turned off. It is the Excellence victory condition in the Advanced Options menu. These options need to be labeled better. I am testing a game with the turn limit turned off. (update) I got far too bored and just stopped playing.

5. Star lanes - These don't belong in a MoO game at all! Part of the tactics were worrying if commiting your fleet was going to leave you open at home. You could pick where and when to attack, now you just walk right into bottleneck after bottleneck after bottleneck. These need to go NOW. I had an anomoly pop up near my homeworld in my first game and I thought, ok without a star lane it must take a while to get to it right? Nope, one turn, one turn for a distance the same distance as the star lane going to the next star system. That star lane took FOUR turns. This makes no sense. These need to go.

If you haven't purchased it already I suggest waiting. I would rather play MoO 1 or 2 before touching this one again.",1456686602,1459642116,False,697,18,0.847356319427490234,39,True,False,True

MOO is a timeless classic.  Even MOO3 was startling for its excellence - its problems were early release and play style that encouraged excellent players but put off lesser players.  The current MOO version is an obvious attempt to bring forward the excellence of MOO2 and MOO3, perhaps wreitten smaller with less innovation in the technology tree, fewer races, less tidbits of detail, and and smaller horizons.

Right now it is pay for beta grade.  I never suggest player pay to play a game that is in essence a late alpha or early beta.  The game has serious flaws that prevent carry through an entire contest, and is essence a rough draft.  The rough draft though shows extreme promise.  Double the number of races, double the number of techs, work out the vario bugs in visual style and in combat, and get the combat rules to work (which of course, MOO3 never really did) and you have a game that would be one of the best of its type.  Add to that MacOS support - a game killer for many who have friends from the Mac side, and this could be the new standard for MOO>

That said, there are rumbles on the horizon.  The forums are filled with people who want the game to be a RTS or a nerfed experience.  Most of them never played MOO before.

I'm not a fan of the way you have to move between systems, for one thing. The tactical combat is also not as much fun as it was in Master of Orion 2. I'm hoping that more racial customization and better tactical combat are on the way. I also hope that travel between systems gets changed a bit so that there's multiple options for how to do it. Honestly what the game is missing is more options for things.

For an Early Access version of the game, I am thrilled. I am incredibly happy that I purchased this game and do not regret it at all. If it does not get any better than it is now, I will be a little sad but I will still be happy with my purchase. Hopefully they will add more customization. Giving more racial customization as an option, better tactical combat, and allowing to choose how your game will allow you to move between systems.

As someone who played a great deal of both MoO and MoO2, I had great expectations for this game, and so far it does not disappoint.  Obviously there's still a lot to go--spying, for instance, doesn't exist yet, and at least six more races are in development--but it's fairly faithful to the original games.  It is 'closer' to the MoO2 gameplay, which is no tragedy; while I did greatly enjoy the simplified colony management of the original game and the massive fleets of stacked ships, the gameplay in MoO2 is more 'interesting' being more hands-on and everything.

Interestingly, and quite pleasing to me, the character models were more based on the original MoO races rather than the (sometimes greatly changed) MoO2 races.  The Psilons are like greys with 4 arms, the Mrrrshan is a cat-lady, and the Alkari are birds, not pterydactyls.  Nice shout-out to the original.

The voice-acting, particularly for your chosen advisor, can get repetitive, but it's a nice touch.  The narrator (Michael Dorn, Mister Work himself) rarely gets old, although the GNN is my least favorite VA collective (they can still be amusing, tho)

All-in-all, it's hard to recommend an unfinished game for $50, but if you are a die-hard MoO fan it might be worth it to leap into it now.  Otherwise, if you're interested, you might want to wait for the finished project or at least for it to be further along before picking it up; but in the latter case, you should keep an eye on it, because it is already looking to be as successful a go-back title as XCOM.",1459523661,1459523661,True,18,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I came into this one blind wrt to its lineage, just looking for a decent space 4x and for me, it ticks all the boxes. The asthetics and sound are superb, really catches that old style soft-SF theme without seeming out-of-date. The game play is simple but solid. If you're into micromanagement this might not be the game for you, it doesn't take much effort to manage an empire with twenty or so planets, although there is enough micro to make you have to think about how you're going to develop and use those planets.

I've read some crticism and debate over the star lane FTL system: you can't travel anywhere but can only jump to nearby systems making the map a network. I find the system quite refreshing. It creates some good tactical scenarios like grabbing systems, even if they have bad planets, because they are choke points for travel. It can make it difficult to send ships out in the later game without open border treaties but overall I think it works.

The game is still in Early Access but it seems nearly finished.

If you are a gamer of the 80s and 90s and experienced the death of your social life due to MOO 1 or MOO 2 then you must pick this game up.  All of the pieces that make MOO 2 such a fantastic game of ""...just one more turn."" are in this game.  I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this game and I admit there is much to still be accomplished, but that's why it says it's an early access game.

The new races are a fantastic add.  The balance issues I saw before with the Psilons massively dominating with no negatives to those big brains of theirs have now been put in place.  Combat is much improved with the ability to set how fast your individual ship classes will rush into battle, and at what distance they will attempt to keep the enemy at bay.  

At this time I will not create a pro/con list because it's just silly.  This game is not complete.  Spying, space combat, ground combat, diplomacy, and several other features are still being worked on.

The bottom line is this.  If you were one of the unfortunate few like myself who purchased and played MOO 3 and then cursed the sky for the game being so terrible look no further than this latest installment to restore your faith in the franchise.

The best way I can describe it is a mix of A Turn Based Sins of a Solar Empire and Endless Space. You start in a sector of the galaxy which itself is made up of a combination of planets, asteroids, and gas giants. Leading out of that in what I think are called warp points, they take you out of that sector and into a connecting sector. And so on and so forth. The game is beautiful and nicely detailed, the races are well animated and have great voice acting. I esp like the Terran Kahnate, I guess they are like the Klingons of the game but in human form. I was making the game harder than it had to be by just clicking through the turns waiting for this or that, but it's important to manage every planet, every turn, to maximize population effectiveness.

My only real complaint is the A.I. are very bold jerks and I don't like that you can't try to compromise on a deal they want you can only agree or disagree. They also seem to work in unison againest you, know where your ships are, and will come together if you are doing slightly better than everyone else, no matter how much they hate each other. I have been a faithful ally to the Humans in one game, went to war againest a common enemy with them, and they just decide to abandon me when someone declared war againest me. Then declared I was taking too many sectors for my own good. Oddly enough, I asked for an alligance again the next turn and we were buddy buddies again. Except I was in two wars and they were in one.

Game features custom race option like MOO2 and I really enjoy it. I didn't like that the game didn't feature different government options but thats not a dealbreaker for me. But you can build a Doomstar and blow up planets so that's a relief, though I still haven't gotten that far in the game yet. Looking foward to how spying will be handled in this game, probably my least favorite part of MOO2, though I do love the Darloks.

Ships can be customized to suit any loadout you want, but I think you can only have 5 Custom loadouts at a time? Kind of a Bummer. Make that 8-10 slots and I think that issue wouldn't be a problem anymore. The other issue, though I guess it's not a plus or minus is the command point limit. I had twice as many planets as another empire and I still felt like I didn't have enough fleet strength to close off key sectors to keep them from expanding, and for every point over the limit, you lose about 10 or 20 BC a turn. It can add up quickly but it is managable as long as your constantly working on improving your command point limit by building more star bases.

All and all a very enjoyable experience, I'm glad they took the time to reboot a much loved series but I think most people are either going to really love this one or really hate it.

Short version:
The game is shallow in its current state and doesn't even come close to MoO2. I can't recommend it as it is now. I hate how the starlanes system has been implemented.

The longer version:
I've completed one match through a council victory after about 8 hours. Now in the second EA phase I'm in an active campaign on hard as Terran. I've got to my breaking point in terms of frustration with the game.

First of all let me say that visuals look nice and the performance is pretty good. The controls and UI work for the most part, but some things are still bugged (it's an early version),

Research:
From what I've seen the research system is not to bad. It's actually working pretty well even though it has been moved closer to what Civilzation does. A different approach would've been more interesting. Most technologies provide you with several unlocks to improve your empire. Sometimes however you have to make choices. This is always where it gets interesting. Do I take the faster ships or do I go for the better bombs for example? At the moment the spy system has not been implemented so your choices matter even more if you're not creative.

Diplomacy:
The diplomacy system is weak. I've made a few deals with the AI, but at a certain point when you start expanding and growing. Trade agreements are extremely weird. You first have to pay a pretty hefty sum only to have an increased income per turn for a limited number of turns. Due to the high initial sum I actually have my doubts that it brings in much profit. Why not have a penalty per turn in the beginning and the longer it runs the better it pays until the agreement is cancelled? It worked much better in MoO2. In addition the AI is just insanely arrogant. In my last game even on neutral ground every single race always demanded every BC I had plus 10-20 BC per turn and one of my best planets as compensation. It just doesn't make any sense. When in the beginning it was possible to do agreements after about 100 turns everything went completely nuts. I only had one race I had ""decent"" relations and with them I made an alliance. But even they demanded these stupid compensations for fair trades like technology exchanges. Oh and lets not forget the unreasonable demands like ""give us 512 BCs and your great planet that is extremely far away from our empire"". And they get angry when I refuse? 

Ship Design:
The things I completely hate are the ship design system and the combat. I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed that. Every ship type has a predefined number of slots. The engine, armor, shields and targeting computer is almost the same as in the old games. However the weapons and special systems are a pain to handle. When you implement a new weapon system the numbers are extremely confusing. Sometimes the dps is lower but the overall attack is higher. Changing a weapon to heavy doesn't even change the dps and usually lowers the overall attack value compared to standard weapons. In the end I've only used standard weapons and ignored the upgrades and my ships where always superior to any AI ship. Btw. whenever you research new technology for ships the game always tries to upgrade all of you existing designs. But it doesn't really tell you what exactly the change does. It increases or lowers the building price and provides some icons on what appears to be upgrades, but the auto upgrade usually made the ships worse and I always had to fix the setup afterwards.

Tactical Combat:
The combat system is just there. You have barely any influence on what happens during the combat. You see your ships flying in. You then start in Pause mode in which you can assign a target. However you can't specify what weapons you'll use or how specials are used. You can change the formation, but even that system is implemented poorly. In addition I can't control single ships to pull the damaged ships back. If I select one ship and issue a command, the others do the same. Also the AI does an awfull job with firing and targeting. Hey look my ships have frontal assault weapons. What do we do? Park the ships in a way so they can't fire. So in short the combat system is complete c*** even with the most recent upgrades. Also it's funny how a fleet with a much higher military rating (120.000 vs enemy 80.000) gets completely obliterated. The best thing at the moment pretty much is to simply simulate the combat and just wait for the result. It's more likely to have a good result compared to the so called ""tactical combat"" anyway.

Travel:
Let's talk about the most controversal topic => starlanes. In general I don't really like the idea behind starlanes but I could get behind it if was implemented in a good way. Well, it isn't! The current travel system makes travel sloooooooooow. Let's say you want to go from system a to system b and you have 2 systems in between. Even with the best engines in this case travel time will be at least 5 turns. Why? Well let me explain the route your ship will take:

1. Turn => Move from start point to jump point
2. Turn => move to next system
3. Turn => move to next jump point
4. Turn => Move to next system
5. Turn => Move to target location

This is only with two systems in between. The bigger your empire gets the more systems you have in between and even with the best engines it's possible to have 2-3 turns when traveling between two connected systems. The Stargates help a bit, but you have to consider where you place them because they are pretty expensive (5BC per turn/gate on hard).

A much better implementation would have been if your ships have a certain distance they can travel each turn and it doesn't matter whether you enter a system or move between jump points.

Other Stuff:
Planet leaders / ship captains are gone. Your ships do not gain any XP neither. So it doesn't matter how many battles your fleet does, the crews do not get better at their job. It's all narrowed down to technology. Whenever you get something new and shiny you should have enough credits available. Upgrading ships has been moved closer to civilization. All upgrades are instantanious and are just costing money.

What else is there? Well GNN is annoying. The news themselves are giving you a bit of information around how you are doing, but holy **** the talking of the robots is awful. The voice over has to be redone for this or remove it. It's neither funny nor entertaining. It just makes my eyes roll whenever I hear it. I haven't seen anything from the Antarans or other ancient aliens yet. There was some hint to it in the GNN news, but it's probably not in the game yet if it is there at all.

Btw. we now also have barbarians....I mean pirates in the game. They are just there to annoy you. They can have their own little pirate outposts that provide you with money/population upon destruction. Again it's very similar to Civilization which seems to be the overall problem this game has. It tries to be Civ in space.

I just don't understand why it seems to be so difficult to take games like MoO or MoO2, look at what both games had and then build on it. Why reinvent the wheel when it was working fine 20 years ago? There is still time to improve aspects of this new MoO, but as it is now I can't recommend it.

It did not let me down.

Every negative review I have read for this game is based  on the content not yet implamented or minor game balancing issues due to the fact this game is still in early access.

Having finished my first playthrough I have to say that the UI is the best I have seen in any 4x game. It is very streamlined and intuitive. All the strategy and empire management elements from MOO2 are still in place. The tech tree has many familiar technologies that function essentially the same, but the order in which techs unlock is different. You still have to prioritize carefully and try to balance Infrastructure and military technologies.

The main fundamental gameplay difference is on the galaxy map with the addition of starlanes. This is a point of contention for some. 
I didnt like the idea at first but it is not too much of a travel hindrance as most systems have 3 or 4 warp points. It helps with empire planning. 
It enables you to shelter your research and economic inner systems by having systems with heavy military instillations on  your  outer borders.

Although it's a tad pricey it does give you the original three games, two of which have been rigged to run on new computers, some bonus features, an extra playable race and it allows you to troubleshoot bugs and make recommendations for alterations to gameplay or new features. So far the developers have kept their word and have tried, mostly successfully, to make changes the players desire. They even went so far as to make an overnight patch so that some players experiencing bugs on certain systems could play the game properly, which shows great promise and dedication. While they were at it they applied a few player-recommended patches and encouraged us to give both positive and negative feedback.

As it is about thirty per cent of the game's features are disabled and about half of what is present seriously needs work. Nevertheless in the first update alone there were significant strides in this area, and it was all to a high standard of quality. Sometimes in updates they'll put in slightly whacky or unbalanced features, but it seems to be a deliberate move to guage how players respond and to find out what the majority of gamers strongly desire, as well as to find out what gamers -do not- desire.

If you are passionate about the Master of Orion series and want to see Master of Orion 4 be a success, you should seriously consider buying this early release and helping to fund the polishing of this potentially great game, and be able to give feedback that will shape it into something awesome that will be played eagerly for years to come.",1459209230,1459209230,True,14,0,0.507104456424713135,0,True,False,True

The game runs well and is playable as is.

I'd write a long review but I must get back to the game... It's finally here! :D

Updated for Early Access 2 release:

Updated combat is a LOT better than their first Early Access 1 release. Diplomacy still stinks badly. New additions and rebalances of the racial traits are showing they are making some progress towards a very playable release. Indicators are that the difficulty slider is just an economic boost. Would be nice if this were more impactful than just BC per turn.

Game still runs very smoothly and looks quite nice. They did a rebalance on some audio and that makes the intro to the GNN clips a bit low volumed when they start out on my system.

Still eager to see how they impliment the espionage aspect of the game. Playing as Darlocks was one way I really enjoyed playing in the originals.

1.  Ships - could do with more options for the looks, currently they only have 2 looks per class could do with a few more to make your fleets look different.

3.  Races - All the races seem to have the same personality, they used to do diffent things like be best at research, expand, lots of ships, now they seem to be the same and do the same in negotiations as well.

4.  Random Events - could do with more random events/monsters, this seems to have been cut down as well.

5.  CNN News - I know there robots but jesus, make them a bit more interesting they are so boring you just want to skip them.

6.  Combat - can we have an option like Homeworld where you can follow one ship or a squad by clicking F on the ship.  Also could do with some diffent combat grounds, not just asteroids on the screen.

7.

- the deathray, mauler-device and stellar converter have a bad damage to size ratio in the late game. for example a full complement of plasma cannons or disruptors is far more powerful then an array of deathrays, mauler devices or a stellar converter. MOO2 had the same issue with this weapons.

That carried over to Master of Orion II.  ONE MORE TURN, and oh how my grades would suffer.  Chemical addiction had nothing on Moo2, and I regret nothing.

So then came Moo3 and I got deeply involved in the fan side of things and worked to make the game good.  While it is largely considered a failure, it still holds a warm place in my heart.

This Master of Orion is in absolutely no danger of challenging any of that.  In fact, this tripe feels more like a student project than a game worthy of a genre-defining classic.

First, the good points:
[list]
[*]Slick graphics.  Lots of JJ-Abrams flare and a strong palette.
[*]Music is nice and fitting.
[*]Voice acting is stellar.
[*]Beloved races from earlier incarnations are well realized.
[/list]

Now, my problems:
[list]
[*]Abyssmal diplomatic feedback.  Friendly, treatied neighbor attacked without there being any feedback to me that this was coming.  Straight out of the blue.
[*]Disastrous diplomatic design.  Really, friendly races suddenly attack?  No insults, no declining relations?  Just a roll of an invisible die and 'hey, lets shoot at the human.'
[*]Pathetic star systems.  One or two planets might have been fine in the early 90s but today it feels like cut budget (or cut corners).  And those early 90s games at least benefited from the then-dominant threory that planets were rare.
[*]Spacelanes.  Can you say chokepoints?  First one to a few key systems wins whole regions of the map...no way out of that.
[*]Boring tech tree.  Anymore linear and y=mx+b could be used to plan your action.
[*]Races don't feel special.  Everyone is just a rubber-suited alien.  60s Star Trek sported more attempted diversity.
[/list]

So I wouldn't recommend this and struggle to see if it's salvagable.  The diplomacy engine needs to be gutted, completely, and rebuilt to perhaps make some effort to resemble interacting with real races.  Instead I'm left at the mercy of a random die roll and there's NOTHING a player can do to stop that.

The copy that I have does not have all the races in it. The last four ones are blocked for some reason. (I would also like to see the Elerians in it).  2. I cannot seem to access the racial improvement list - that is - the custom means of designing one's own race is not available. 3. The automatic design of ships when a new tech is discovered seems to change all of a ship's design, and not simply the improvement made. If I, for example, had an armor upgrade because of a newly discovered tech, then the upgrade would change my fusion beams to mass drivers, for example. 4. For some reason i can only play on the ""Average"" difficulty level. 5. Finally, the maps need to be more diverse. I have played the same map 3 or 4 times now, and it starts to get pedantic.

The tech tree is still my favorite in the 4X genre. Ship design is exactly the same as in Master of Orion 2, with firing arcs, targeting computers, shields and utility modules.

As to the new additions, I'm surprised how well the real-time combat works. Pause the game, issue orders, resume. It's much faster than moving each unit individually, and it doesn't sacrifice any tactical depth.

I also liked building up the new military outposts. They restrict enemy ship movement, allowing for the creation of a militarized border zone on the outskirts of the empire.

The only thing I'm not sold on is the unlimited travel range for all ships. Discovering other races is much faster now, but somehow feels a bit out-of-character for Master of Orion.

Wait for the full release. Game is unfinished, unbalanced and too easy at the moment. Buy only if you A) Want to support the developers or B) Want to experience all the patches that will come untill release. At this time the game will give you about 10 hours of fun before you will realize that it needs to be finished to give you about 100+ more. It plays well though and I like it a lot.

*** See the bottom for updates. ***

First impressions from Early access, review will follow when the game will be released.

If you cannot bare bugs, strange behavior and missing depth to some parts of the game elements then DO NOT buy this game yet, except you would want to support the developers.

[b]If you are a 4X fan in general:[/b]

* This game is a lot like Endless space when it started, but has a lot more potential. The tactical combat mainly is going to be better in my opinion due to the possibility to control the ships. The production values overall are higher.
* Game lacks depth at the moment which is coming in few months I hope but is very well playable now. I will repeat myself here; the game is very similar to how the Endless space was at launch.
* The art and voice overs are TOP quality. Music reminds me a lot of Star Trek for some reason.
* Graphics are OK for a 4X game but in my opinion the ship models could use some work, especially at the strategic layer.
* If you want to experience full depth and engaging game from the start then you should wait a bit... I suppose the game will be feature full in the summer.
* Strategic game is turn based and tactical combat is RT with pause.
* Map options are limited at the moment. Map size, difficulty and number of races mainly.
* If you like 4x games in general then you will most probably like this game too. The gameplay is fluid and quite fast, no HC micromanagements at the moment.

[b]If you are core MOO fan and ""old school gamer"":[/b]

* If you are expecting a graphically updated MOO 2 then you will be disapointed. This game is going to be a bit different. This is in no way a clone of the old MOO games. It uses the same basic structure but the feel to it is not the same.
* Game is not finished; you can see it mainly in tactical combat which is lacking a lot. And the combat is not turn based (maybe it will change?).
* Research and race stats are done differently than in MOO2.
* No NPCs yet.
* The voice overs can be a bit annoying if they will not fit your ""expectations"" from how you have imagined them in MOO2 for example.
* This game is, in my opinion, for new generation of players. It will have a lot in common with MOO2 but will never be the same...

I like how the game is looking now and what potential it has so I recommend it in general but be careful here. Even though it fits my ""needs"", it may not fit yours. Do a bit of research and watch a lets play on youtube first.

*** Updates: ***

[b]10 hours in[/b]

So after playing a bit I've found following things that will be worked on most before the release, or at least I hope so.

* Espionage is missing at the moment, but the foundations are there. You can build and research upgrades for your spies.
* Ground combat is a placeholder at the moment. No armies battling at the moment, only simple explosion animations.
* Tactical combat is a bit better than ground combat but it's still a place holder too.
* No story at the moment as far as I can tell.
* Races are not complete, the racial stats are too simple at the moment to be considered finished.
* No race specific tech at the moment.

I played MOO and MOO 2 A LOT up till very recently. MOO 3 was a train wreck that had good intensions but just was a horrible implementation. Seems this version is slowly going down the MOO 3 path with a glossy version of MOO 2 graphics slapped on top.   Graphics are good for a 4x game, sounds ok I guess but I do not play these games for a good soundtrack. In fact I play with them muted as it is about tactics and what you are going to do next turn not how nice the alien leader sounds. They spent way too much time and money worrying about that when the gameplay is lackluster.

To start star lanes really make it so easy and unplayable. Basically defend 2 planets and you are good to go. There are definite choke points which make those systems critical.  

Combat, ah combat. Pre beta people that are younger wanted real time combat. True MOO fans that are older and enjoy the tactical nature of turn based obviously didn't. Well they went real time, but not really. You just build a fleet, and click fight. Trying to do any sort of maneuvers or tactical layout really doesn't matter. You can try as I did, but you will find out that in the end is useless. The combat system is a glorified combat viewer of the simulation. Once you realize that just skip combat. But wait, you want to control your ships, this system and game doesn't really allow for it to make a difference or change the outcome much at all. So sad, they could have done a really nice turn based or even a put in your moves and both sides move and fire same time type of setup and would have worked well for this game. As it stands this game ""combat"" just doesn't stand out from anything else in the 4x world of games and thus they missed their chance. 

The races seem to be missing their big differences that existed in MOO and MOO2. I have played most and they all seem the same. You research the same, build the same, build same type of fleets, etc.  I would have preferred if each race really did well on one type of planet type, or you could take pros and cons like in MOO 2 where you can customize each race. I cannot nail it down but they all seem very generic with a different skin. 

The ship builder looks nice and works well but again is really useless as the whole combat system really doesn't work. Since real time combat just isn't meant for this type of game the upgrades to weapons with fire arcs and such just won’t see the light of day when you can just cram on more weapons in same space without having to worry about such mundane details which made MOO 2 much better. 

They need more areas of the map that affect game play like nebula, super large asteroid fields, etc that affect areas of the map differently. Adding those would add a lot of depth to the map and gameplay.

As mentioned on the discussion board AI is just awful. As much as I hear people say, ""just play multiplayer and your problem is solved"", have you tried to play and FINISH a 4x multiplayer game?  I have maybe finished 5 in my lifetime. Most games with 4 people, 1 will drop early, 1 will get run over for various reasons and drop out, thus leaving 2 people who then you hope have the time to play out the game over the next few days/weeks. But invariably 1 of the 2 will drop out making the game you vs. the AI in the end. So the single player game has to be somewhat resilient to keep me engaged between multiplayer matches. This game doesn't even come close, period. As AI programming is a bit of a hobby for me, this game makes me want to cry how someone is paid to create an AI and this is what they came up with. 

If the game wasn't ready for beta, then delay, and delay again. Any sort of alpha test would have found or shown most of these issues.  AND IF the development team would listen to the outside alpha testers the game could be fixed. My guess is another development studio thought they knew best and missed the boat on this one. The best games I have played in the past many years are games that change and adapt to its core player base. Because if they are somewhat happy, they spread the word, others come and like the game and lo and behold you have a hit. This game seems to rest on the past IP glory and hope to make millions on people like me that paid and hoped for more but got a lot less. 

I would at this time NOT recommend this game unless combat, star lanes and AI are fixed which may take a more in depth rewrite than this publisher has time/money.

I will change/update review after some major patches/final release comes out and things have changed, hopefully. :)

I won't get into what features are missing, or suggestions for updates, that will be on the discussion boards. This is for those of you looking at this game and wondering, is it really MOO?

The answer is a resounding Yes.

I have been playing MOO games since I got my hands on 1 back in 1993. A friend and I were just getting our of highschool and we played it on his old 386. It was glorious.

I got my hands on MOO2 a few years later, and didn't play it much until 1999. Initially I was thrown off, the interface was more like Master of Magic, than the MOO I had come to be used to. In time I realized that MOO2 was a worthy successor to the title.

I bought MOO3 when it came out. I really can't state my disappointment with that title. 

This game, this game feels like MOO. The mechanics are balanced, much of the tech and the strategy of MOO2 is available here. I think they may even have lifted sections of the text from MOO2.

The original races are here, or soon will be.

The beauty of MOO was that it had enough micro management, without being too much. You have control, but you also don't need to babysit every planet constantly. The build queue is not as long as it was in MOO2 and some technologies with the same name now have different purposes. Biospheres is very different.

The combat is realtime, but the speed can be increased or decreased and ships can be controlled, there is also a cinematic camera for when you know you will win and want to savor some up close and personal views.

There are some changes I hope to see, but if you loved the origionals than you should enjoy this game. This is what MOO3 should have been, but is actually better. I never cared to take a screen shot in any of the previous games, my profile is getting filled with them here. The game is beautiful and amazingly fun.",1458456251,1458456251,True,15,0,0.422627747058868408,0,True,False,True

This game is WAY too easy on the normal difficutly (which is the only one available at the time I wrote this). I played on a Large, Old, Spiral Galaxy with no end date and won with absolute ease. Basically I started boxed in with one other faction by unstable warp points. After crushing them I pretty much colonized unopposed for 300-400 turns. By the time I met the remaining factions I was so powerful that I was able to bully them all to vote for me on the council and won the game WITHOUT EVEN BEING ABLE TO REACH THEM.

 Will say so far I like what I have seen. I know there is more to come so reserving final judgement. But right now recomend this game. 

 But the final verdict is still out. Some features missing in game that can make it great. One is Hotseat from old MOO2. That simple edition made MOO2 so entertaining with friends at home for so many nights.

 One thing I disliked about MOO2 is still in this game. Too few star systems and too few planets. I had to get the online editor to fix the problem in MOO2. Sad to still see that this game limit is in this new game.

Ship design and building is another key feature. Will have to see how this is implimented. 

Like the new version over old MOO2 with technologies. Hated the limit of having to only chose one of three techs in a group. Really need to see that removed finally.

Finally would love a tech adjustment filter. I downloaded a mod that allowed tech discoveries to take longer than MOO2 allowed. Always hated that tech changed so fast making early weapons and tech so useless to even find.

Things i personally want to see,

*The continued introduction of more minor races after realease.
*More unique traits of races. Need to have the feeling of wanting to be that race because of their traits. Currently it's because they look better haha
*MORE TECH.  Needs to feel like it's different every time you play a different game. 
To me I don't like the civ look of the tech tree. I don't like seeing want comes from a certain tech. I like exploring and working out for my self what techs give what.
*More more more customizable options for ships.
*More natural disasters and random events that force you to respond. Love the galactic news!

Many of the core elements that made the originals great have been stripped away completely or deluded so much that they are almost unrecognizable. This is to the point where several aspects of the game that have been brought over from the previous iterations just don't seem to function as they should anymore. Several of the playable races seem ineffective and pointless in comparison to others. Weaponry and technologies have little logical uses and are therefore trumped by a handful of superior options. Combat has been reduced to what equates to tactless skirmishes with extremely limited control. The game has ship customization, however it seems like a mute point when all elements of strategy and tactics have been removed from combat.
The game is pretty to look at, but only to an extent. It seems as though there are a very limited number of well crafted objects in the game, but the small amount of them get redundant very quickly.

Frankly, what made MoO2 a great game, was never the challenge and balance of the game.  The game was always super easy when you made a custom race.  What made MoO2 fun was how the elments of the game were presented.  Having all the choices to make a custom race was great (even though there were a select few optimal traits).  It was just fun to learn the game mechanics and create a glorious space empire.  Sure, MoO2 had things that we not so fun, like the fact that the Gaurdians were so tough that colonizing that sweet sweet planet known as Orion was almost pointless.  (unfortunately the reboot still makes that mistake),  but this game has almost all the building blocks that made MoO2 so much fun and I expect to see a great product by the time they get done with it. 

To the developers I would recommend two things:  Please implement the governors and fleet captains from MoO2!  And don't overbalance the single player game too much, just implement a scoring system and ""balance"" that (giving bonuses to score for harder racial picks)

There is a lot of work that needs to be done, more than I would expect for an initial early access on a major brand featuring the voice of Luke Skywalker. 

I'm worried that hype and brand is stronger than the content to drive sales. So far, I feel very skeptical while wishing a concerted effort to improve this game because I want it to be great. The AI is worst part right now as there is no challenge. The tech tree is far too linear and uninspired to be enjoyable. I feel like I'm being given the illusion of choice. It just doesn't feel tactical. A second, third, fourth, and fifth, playthrough and I can't seem to will myself to do any research choices differently. The advisors you are forced to interact with in game make you feel like a young child with the exception of the humans. I wasn't expecting that from a complex strategy game, and if I wanted a cartoonish casual experience I'd go play candy crush. 

Overall, there's potential, but there has to be some real changes in direction to encourage replay value, challenge, and choice.

The parts of this game that ARE done, show a ton of polish, and harken back to the glory days of Moo2. It offers a great balance of nostalgia with updated procedures. I think many of the more recent Space 4x titles have made things too ""complicated"" in a misguided effort at ""realism"" - Moo has wisely avoided that in favor of understandabilty. Because the choices are more clear, it's FAR easier to understand the consequences of your decisions... and therefore much more fun to play (Imho). 
The game still has some rough edges, of course, but it's already the most fun I've had playing a space 4x (or really any strategy game) since Civ5. Wait till it's done, if you like - but if you enjoyed Moo2, you'll LOVE this game.",1458229373,1458229373,True,11,0,0,0,True,False,True

-When a new tech is earned, and ship blueprints update, the player has to go back in and re-customize the weapon and option layouts that weren't even effected by the new tech. This is unnecessary, time-consuming, and potentially damaging to the game experience if the player isn't diligent and doesn't correct the issue before more units are built.

-On the bombing screen, the only bomb name shown is ""nuclear"" even if the ships contain ""fusion"" bombs. Is that aesthetic or a bug?

-Diplomacy has (so far) been non-existent from the AI. The only time they contacted me was to threaten. MoO2 wasn't really any better, but I would presume game AI processing has improved significantly since then.

-Tactical space combat isn't. I like the idea of more real-time combat, but the tactical combat is more like trying to guide balls of varying size and speed while they are rolling downhill. I can select ships, right-click to set priority targets, (sort of) set a formation, and alter course...but ultimately the ships just turn right back toward the enemy and go full-frontal attack.
And speaking of full-frontal attack, the enemy ships just sit there until your ships get close...then they just head toward your ships without the slightest deviation. The obstacles are no more useful than as eye candy, which is really unfortunate.
If the devs can make the space combat into an actual real-time, flowing, tactical experience, this game would be amazing. It could garner YouTube videos galore.

-Not sure why only so many slots are allocated for production or food, while research appears to have unlimited slots. In MoO2 I liked how one could specialize ultra-rich planets to crank out the ships by putting everything in production.
Also, the technology, separate building, and separate (mandatory) ongoing order to share resources intra-planatarily makes little sense. Think how the fictional conversation would go in the game:
Planet 1: Hey, do you have extra food sitting around?
Planet 2: Yup.
Planet 1: Think you could send that to us?
Planet 2: Yeah...let me just put *everything* we're building *on hold* and have *all* our production workers fly that extra food of ours over to you.
I could accept the tech requirement, and the building (that requires 5BC maintenance), but a production-halting order is unnecessary and just plain dumb.

-Not sure why the game has an arbitrary cutoff at 500 turns. Building a decked out titan-class ship can easily take 30 or more of those turns on some of the better planets thanks to the aformentioned limited slots for production.

I'll leave it at that, for now.

The game has a polished look and feel to it but it is also missing a lot of features and depth (AI should be better, diplomacy is not great and the game is way to easy).

- a larger map size
- make the tech tree similar to MoO 2 
- more ''choose only one'' techs
- make the player races more unique like in MoO 2
- more options in the game setup similar too MoO 2
- more cutscenes like an opening cutscene for the game and a stellar converter cutscene and a cutscene or actual tactical combat for ground combat
- more ship design options
- i reeally dont like how you are able to scout the whole galaxy from the beginning of the game without even having to research anything
- tactical battles are terrible, bring back the classic turn-based battles or have an option for real time or turn based battles
- replayabilty lacks because of non-unique races and the terrible tactical combat and planets
- star lanes are one of my most hated things in this game, they force you to explore only in some directions and sometimes in only one direction, at least have an option to turn those off
- more random events that make the game more interesting
- ai improvements
- freighters were a great part in MoO 2

1. A way to dedicate enough production to clean up that you eliminate waste build up (like you could by just clicking the arrow in the original?) 
2. I would like to be able to bypass warp points and cross pure space with large penalties later in the game 
3. Large planet or system wide construction projects that would require the resources of at least a half dozen planets for the small projects (halos, specialized planetoids), and even perhaps half a huge galaxy for the big ones (ring worlds, Dyson spheres) Production could easily be rerouted to such projects from an Interplanetary Administration. 
4. I would like to be able to negotiate exceptions to treaties to prevent conflict and make it easier to maintain relations by allowing you to do things they might not like, but needing to pay a large cost to mitigate their displeasure. An example of this would be offering tech or credit in order to settle a planet that's closer to them then they'd like. 

I like the flexibility of the diplomacy offer/counteroffer system letting you feel out what they want (and then negotiating for less). Looking forward to seeing espionage implemented and unlocking all the races again. I am very curious to see if mixing races of your empire by conquering planets populating other races will have any impact on espionage; and possibly eventually improving relations as your populaces get used to intermingling. This could be a way for both sides to bypass some of the planet wide DNA detectors whether your empire n captured a planet or had a planet taken.

Ive even gone way out of my way to get it to work multiplayer even after that aspect of the game went down. That being said, I have seen a lot of negative feedback about this new verson of MOO and I just wanted to address some of the unfavorable responses I have seen.  I understand there gripes, It is not a MOO clone exactly.  But to be honest, i didnt want a moo clone or i would just boot up moo 2.  Yes the trade lanes add a different feel to the game. But IMO they can be used to add a stragety element to the game.  I can colonize a planet in strategic places to block off entire sections of the galaxy to myself.  Some people claim that you can have every tech in the game. Well, when i first played i was given this impression myself.  but on closer inspection there are some techs that are one or the other.  An example would be I can choose to have either Fusion Beam or Fusion drive.  On the tech tree it appears as Fusion Beam | Fusion Drive.   I can CHOOSE to be faster in space faster, or have better beam weapons right now, if i choose one, it will be a while before i have something better in the other field i didnt choose.  This is not the only example on the tech tree.   Now for the battle system.   All together I think this game is a great addition to the moo franchise. It is AMAZINGLY better than MOO 3 at any rate and the best addition I have seen to the game in decades. We should be thanking NGD studios and WG Labs for taking a chance on a game that took a lot of hard work for a fan base that doesent seem to appreciate a gift.

In every other area, it's a perfect replica and updated graphics / sounds / music of the original game, but Combat sucks.

It's kinda the worst combat I have seen in a 4x RTS game, the ship design is really bad also, that could be vastly improved on also, so ship design is basic and combat SUCKS.

Why does it suck you ask, because it's hard to watch what is happening because the camera control is too awkward to control, the combat is basicly ai vs ai, you do nothing but watch, I remember the original MOO 2 combat, it was like chess. you have your ships vs AI, the enemy hits your shields you rotate your ship to put the rear shields facing the enemy for the next attack.

You sacrifice some ships so others can get the win, it was a great combat system. this one is start combat sit back and wait to see which AI wins.

The art style is very cool, and the tactical real time space battles are pretty awesome. would love to see real time land battles in an expansion pack eventually. The space lanes implementation is really fun and allows for strategic bottlenecking of enemies but I wouldn't be opposed to the possibiity to make them redundant with late or mid game tech research. I would most definately like to see an end to tutorial pop ups as they can get really annoying the more you play and learn the game. also i think a diplomatic feature that allows you to pressure another faction to make peace with a third party would be fantastic.

Master of Orion is in fact a reboot of the original game, with very fancy graphics and a lot of surprises, most of them are either on the Ohhhh or Ahhhhh side of surprise, but once or twice you might call out Eeeek!

What first catches your sight is the immense upgrade of the interface, well actually that is no wonder - given the time between MOOI and now... but the graphical interface offers a lot to players who love the old Master of Orion series. Then your ears might flap, really... voiceactors, good ones and quite through the whole game. Also nice addition is that the old games are included into the collectors Edition.

I was astounded as I created my first colony and saw... for each planettype a new in game movie... nicely done, it really makes the game worthwhile - especially since the worlds look so different (I am hoping even for more planettypes - we now know that there are some ridiculous planets out there...) 

Oh, and the advisors... I played two races (only trying them... not fully playing) and Stego really made me laugh a lot, even if he's repetitive... Things...

I have to say, that I am a fan of the original games - and this remake caught me totally on a soft spot.

[b]Pros:[/b][list][*]Some beautiful graphics.[*]Great Voiceacts, you have to hear them to believe it.[*]Marvelous remake of an all time classic.[*]The original games are bundled into the collectors edition plus some additional content![/list]

[b]Cons:[/b][list][*]Governors make this game literally a run through.[*]I still remember how hard it was to beat the space monsters... not so in this version.[/list]

[h1]Recommended[/h1]

As I said, I am a total fan for this series, so my verdict might be... a bit overwhelming. Yes the game is great, really... but it's also a bit too casual in some spots. Since the game still is in early access this might change. A nice addition would be racial tech specialities (technologies that can only developed by the race) but I migh also have overlooked them. And of course some additional planetary types... oh, and maybe trying to make some additional races ;-)

Never mind I am just rambling. Great Game, if you like 4X games, you might as well try to get some money for this one.",1457634063,1457634063,True,9,0,0,0,True,False,True

(Editor's Note: I would classify this as ""Maybe"" as to ""Do you recommend this game?"", but there is no maybe catagory.  I would say on a scale of -10 to +10 it would fall around a 0 at this stage.)  

Right now, what we have is a reboot of MoO II, with not all the functionality implimented, but with the graphics updated and reimagined.

UPDATE: If you are looking for a remake/update of MoO II, this is not it!  It is a reimagining of the franchise into a ""beer and pretzils"" game that can be completed in an hour or so, reguardless of size or complexity settings.  Not much strategy involved, just build and kill.  Die hard fans of MoO II will be disappointed.  If you're open to a simple, not very involved game, much like World of Tanks or World of Warships, then you might warm up to what WG is serving up here.

[list]
[*]Graphics are what you would expect from WG, fantastic.
[*]Depth of gameplay is minimal at this time, only 6 races are included at present. (Warning: The voiceovers have been processed to the point of being nearly unrecognizable.  Dorn sounds like Shultz.  Pity, Dorn has a great voice.  Only Hamill's and deLancie's voice are identifiable.)
[*]Map is way too small for 5 races.  There needs to be a readjustment as to the size ranges as even the largest map is only sutiable for 3  players.
[*]AI all play the same.  The only distinction I see is the Sakkra breed like rabibits (despite the Buthri being the first to get three planets) and being the most agressive, usually win.  Psilons never seem to get a good setup with other races running into them by turn 5 or 6, even with three players.
[*]Latest hotfix seems to be moving things in the wrong direction.  AI home systems will be within 5 systems of yours, causing you to be hemmed in between all of them before turn 20.  Talk about strangling the baby in the crib.
[*]Diplomatic choices consist of extort, gift and war if you go with the default 5 AI players.  Also be prepaired to fight after getting your first colony as this will trigger the neighbors to curb stomp your butt.  [u]On the other hand, if you start with fewer than 4 AI opponents, and you have the luck of a good set-up, then you have a chance to actually negotiate with the AI... for a while.[/u]  Fail to agree with the AI once triggers a negitive slide in relations.  A second disagreement with the AI's attempts at extortion are met with war.
[*]Research is pretty much ""choose, wait, complete, refit, rinse repeat"".  I presume this will improve, though it will be interesting to see how.  [u]Also take note if the tech icons have a bar between them (the OR sign if you're a programmer) or not,[/u] if so, you only get one of the techs, which you get to choose after research is complete.
[/list]

As I proceed further and WG adds features I will update this review.  The skinny on this ""early access"" (2/26/2016) is ""Don't expect much right now.""

Side Note: The early access also includes MoO I, II and III.  I have to say the folks at WG did a smashing job of repackaging these games.  MoO I and II run under Dosbox, MoO I is a bit finicky though and will crash on start up unless you set Dosbox to the game's original resolution (800x600).  MoO II runs flawlessly.  What really amazes me is they managed to repackage MoO III to run without having to install all the crap that it required when it was relesed.  My psyche still bears the scars of making my system unstable just to ""run"" (using the term loosely) the darn thing and arguing with the developers that it was a stupid idea to have 4 external dependancies.

I really hope they keep working on this and improving it. one of the BEST parts of MOO2 was the turn based tactical combat, this combat is horrible.

298050,21743489,76561197971326277,0,5,3134,0,1895,1527262630,"Very similar to Master of Orion 2 (this review requires some knowledge of Moo2).  I sat down and couldn't stop playing it.  A few differences that could be seen as detractors to some.  This is going to sound like a giant bash of the game, but I'm just putting the difference out there, I'm not going to stop playing it anytime soon.  

Tactical combat is real time - however you can pause during it, so not sure why so many people don't like it.  There is less to do in combat, you can make your large ships go first, eat some shots and make your small ships move in to do more damage.  You can also position your ships behind asteroids and missles hit them (a really cool addition to the original).  I like the combat myself, but right now you can't disable weapons and select specific ones like you could in Moo2 (say to stop your missles shooting an asteroid).  

Ship building is also fairly difficult because you cannot chose to refit specific ships in a specific manner, this ability to micro might be added later, but for now you have to change your base design, then either refit or build a battleship, if you go to upgrade it later because you got better armor or shield tech, you have to redo the schematic.  To refit or upgrade a ship there isn't a production option, the only way is to spend credits on it at a starbase or starlanebase.

It feels like food and population growth is too easy, you are able to farm ""barren"" planets, and with soil enrichment technologies, they provide alot.  I haven't yet settled on ""toxic"" or ""volcanic"" planets... so maybe barren just got an upgrade.

The Diplomatic victory is a misnomer - right now it's all about your current popluation (other races don't have to like you, you can be at war with them all).   If you can grow your empire enough, you win the game if you have over 66% of the galactic population.  That does seem like alot, but I've won 5 games by just expanding and maxing food growth - all vs the standard AI.  It seems like with the current setup you'd never win by pure combat - the vote would probably finish when you conqured 2/3 the galaxy.  Also, if you start to conqure the more numerous faction you are likely to win faster.  Obviously the AI is weak, and technology victory isn't in the game.  Actually I think I would have won all 5 games with tech victory faster then dipolmatic, so I guess it's a moot point, still strange there is no diplomacy involved.

Heavy/Low gravity needs balance - Low gravity isn't a negitive at the moment, you can still settle on ""normal planets"" - actually Low grav is a bonus, I'm pretty sure if you have lowG you can settle low and normal with no penalty and HighG with -50%.  If you are normal low and highG get you -50%.   Moo2 was HighG = no penalty (maybe -25% on lowG it cost points to pick up), LowG -25% on normal and -50% on highG (it gave you points to spend).   Normal was -25% on Low and High

One of the biggest changes is there is no ""creative"" - you get all the techs, except a few where every race has to pick between two or three choices.  Some are really tough, you have to pick heavy armor OR reinforced hull, you can never have both.  This is a good balance option and hopefully the AI choses different things so you can either trade or steal it from them (spying not in game as of yet).

Oh another big change is ""Starlanes"".  I actually really like the stratical implication of this and is one of the best things.  Every star system has only a few ways to access it, and from only specific other systems.  This creates chokepoints, and makes it much easier to decide where to go. I have settled on farther planets with less physical value (poor/small etc), just because it protects 1 or 2 other systems that I want full control over later.  One game I settled pretty far out and close to an AI, and he got completly boxed in by myself and another AI and only had access to 3 systems...  It does make actually finding your way to Orion much harder though, there is an ""open borders"" option in diplomacy, so I guess you can spend a few credits or whatnot to get through someones terrian.
In Moo2, you kinda had to have your fleet centralized near important planets, then once you saw someone moving there, you'd have to respond.  I never really played multiplayer, but I think it would be impossible to defend anything, because once you got tech to tell your ships to change direction, you could tell them to go to somewhere nearby, and just instantly stop at a closer planet... there was a tech to help prevent that and increase movement to it, but seems kinda silly.

One thing I'd love to see in the game is ship and colony heroes, but they have some touching up and retweaking ship design and refits before a custom ship hero is going to do too much.  At first I was thinking of putting off my purchase until they got added, but after reading everyone elses review and the forums I decided that heroes are just kinda a garnish add-on that make the game fun to player longer.

I have no idea how long this is, and I've probably skipped some changes (well there are no antarians... no ship to ship combat or boarding - one of the best things ever in moo2 was capturing an antarian ship and scrapping or using it with its really good tech)

TLDR;
A few changes - Still Moo IMO - I love the game.

Yes, it's true that the AI is as intelligent as a slice of bread. The game is too easy to challenge a 4x veteran. It's also true, that some features are still missing and the game is far from being finished and polished. But any point of complain I read so far is allready addressed by the Devs, that they are going to work on it eventually. And I believe them. This isn't an unknown independed Developer working on this project in his free time, it's an established company whos reputation might be depending on this game.

But what the Devs allready have achieved is a great atmosphere, something most other MoO-like games are missing. The game felt like good old MoO2 from the first minute and soon after I felt into this ""Just one more turn..."" state of mind, that will cause you to loose some precious hours of sleep. That's impressive in this early state the game is in.

Even though I belong to those people who would have prefered a turn based combat system, I can tell that the system the Devs have chosen isn't dumb. You can loose a battle against a weaker enemy because you have been careless or you can win against a much stronger enemy if you use the right technology and tactics (and maybe a bit of luck). If they continue to work on the combat as they promised allready it might be pretty decent.

The only complain I have are the star lanes. I'm still not a fan of it, allthough I have seen games where star lanes have been implemented worse.

Ok, so I am now in 90'ish hours, having now played all races through to victory in all available victory conditions, so here are some initial thoughts - in generalised rather than specific form.

Yes, I recommend the game; that doesn't mean I don't think the game is currently without its issues, but it is early access and I expect that there will be continuing support by the devs for what is a high profile franchise (I note they have already patched in some content to reflect early player feedback). 

[u] General [/u]

So it's MOO. For those who have played the MOO franchise (let's ignore MOO3), yes they have managed to imbue the game with some of the same kitschiness that its predecessors had. 

The races offered with the initial release are humorous enough and offer some amusing gameplay via quality voice acting, and more races are to come. 

The UI is largely functional, operable, logical and without much in the way of glitches. That might not sound like a ringing endorsement, but the fact it enables you to get on and play the game without really noticing its there, is a positive for me - it means nothing is wrong (the same can't be said for all 4x games).

The battle intro cutscenes are some of the best I've seen in any game, and seriously I want to get into battles just to see and hear my ships warp into the combat zone. These are some of the only cutscenes in any game that I don't want to Esc through after the first few times. Similarly, most of the graphical/audio content in the game is polished and of a high level. The ships are decently rendered and you have a choice between two models/designs for each race-based ship (as well as three basic ship artwork choices), which is a nice bonus.

The game hasn't paused, slowed, glitched, locked-up or crashed on me once. When you're in late-game, turn cycle calcs take the game a few seconds longer, but that's about it.

It's enjoyable to play, and has a lot of promise.

[u] Specific Thoughts [/u]

[list]
[*] [b] Technology Tree. [/b] Each race starts with its own 'advantage' in technology, but pretty much all end up with access to everything. It would have been nice to see a race-specific technology line, or even one specific mega-technology, that sets each race aside from the next. These would still be tradeable (or perhaps not?), but either way, some more tangible differentiation would be great here.

The technology tree itself has (rightly so) been compared with Civ5 and I find it, while functional, lacklustre and linear, without any means of manipulating to achieve markedly different ends. It is possible to min/max to a degree, - or to just flatline cruise through it - but there is neither any great jeopardy nor reward in the manner in which research is able to be conducted, and I think the tree could be reworked to provide sufficient scope for achieving more varied outcomes. Again, it would also be good to see some standout race-specific tech in there. 

[*] [b] Star lanes. [/b] People are going to argue about Star Lanes. The jury is out for me at the moment; while I had a moment of consternation when I first saw them, I can see a practicality in their use and I'm not convinced its game-limiting. Ships can't enter battles if/when they cross each other heading different directions in a Star Lanes - but this isn't wildly different to previous games.

[*] [b] Combat. [/b] People will also argue ad-infinitum about turn-based v real time, individual weapons control v ship/fleet based, but for me there are no great highs and no great lows. You have control in terms of pausability, navigation/targeting, use of mega weapons - but at the end of the day, if you have bigger ships, with up to date tech, then you will *usually* win. In that way current combat could be seen as a little bland, with no opening for detailed strategy or even tactics - but then it is, in general, hard to argue with 'My ships are bigger and better-armed and outnumber yours'  - notwithstanding what Sun Tzu has to say. You can, however, still lose with a theoretically more powerful  force if you just let the battle roll out and have your ships do a frontal assault on the enemy - while at the same time, a 'weaker' force can take out a stronger enemy by flanking the enemy positions, circling 'behind' them and drawing the enemy ships away from the support structures (usually the enemy will start with its ships 'behind' the enemy starbase and missile platforms - if built), so as to attack and defeat the enemy ships outside the support of its defence structures, then pick the defence structures off separately.

I don’t want to see the game devolve into a combat simulator, so this is more than enough for me at this stage. Combat is always a contentious area in 4x games, but I don't feel disappointed or slighted with it here at all. 

[*] [b] AI. [/b] This remains my biggest beef with the game. The AI is completely and mind-numbingly linear. No matter what you do, or what style of gameplay you adopt, within 10-20 turns of meeting another race, it all ends up the same from there. First the alien contact will want to share Star Charts with you, followed shortly thereafter by your bank account codes, deeds to your house, script from your unpublished novel, husband/wife and first-born child. If you refuse, then the alien's attitude toward you is immediately 100% hostile, and remains that way for the rest of the game until you annihilate them in blinding fire. 

They will become scared of you when you outpace them, but they'll still hate you and, even if they drop out of war with you temporarily due to other conflicts, they will always re-declare war with you in due course (even if you have no further direct interaction). In fact, they'll choose to remain at war with you even when you have obliterated every colony they possess and you are currently hanging over their home planet in a massive fleet with your finger poised on the 'exterminate' button - rather than yielding to the inevitable and grudgingly accepting a Peace Treaty.

All the races are the same in this respect and none of the native characteristics make any difference or show through in any manner other than in voice acting. E.g. the humans are intended to be diplomats and the Psilons explorers (generalising), yet they both (like all the races) become immediately upset if you decline to share charts and then, upon refusal of the next request (usually of cash, tech and conceding a system) become enraged and declare war. Is it possible to elicit any different relationship progression or behaviour from them? Yes, but only by playing such an absurdly exaggerated game style that it makes it not only ridiculous and unenjoyable, but completely self-defeating. There is no realistic possibility of diplomacy or subtlety. In summary, the AI is completely common to all races, with only the voice acting attempting to be a differentiator.

MOO fans (of which I am one) are going to point out that divergent AI was never a strong suit of MOO races, or indeed any 4x game out there - and they'd be right - but this is a really obvious short-falling (or opportunity in waiting), particularly so because the way the races have been portrayed and brought to life by voice acting gives the expectation that they are actually going to be interestingly and amusingly different in game play. The devs have a great opportunity here to make this a stand-out aspect of the game.

I will be mostly playing multiplayer, as PVP is really what I enjoy, but of all games, I want to enjoy the AI and distinct racial attributes, quirkiness and game play that MOO can offer. I am optimistic that this will be forthcoming, as I am pretty certain the team is determined to make this something special.

The game retains the addictive feel of the previous games while most of the changes are an improvement over the previous games. Even things like the wrap points that some people are complaining for in my opinion provide more depth in the game.  

Currently the only aspect of the game that is kind of underwhelming are the tactical battles. I still have not managed to understand how you can actually have a meaningful contribution to the battle that will change the result compared to that of the simulation. More control over what every ship is doing and how the weapons are used, is needed in my opinion.

I hope that in a few of the areas that the original MOO/MOO2 didn't do very well that the new development team can innovate enough to bring the game into what we should expect out of a 2016 release.

I can't comment too much on things that still appear to be unfinished - for example, numerous reviews have been pretty critical of the current ship battle experience and I would agree that it is missing a lot of features, but based on its current state compared to how other elements are fleshed out I would say that it will probably get better before the developers are done.

What I would say is that there are a few aspects of the original game that should be more significantly revisited in this version of the game. Two examples are the way that technology influences battle outcomes and how the tech tree implements the restrictive either/or choices from MOO2.

If you played MOO2 you know that a) a more technologically advanced ship pretty much always beats a lesser one and b) a bigger ship is pretty much always better than a smaller one. Because the current combat system is so close to the old one, that's still true, but that's really not the best way to balance gameplay in my opinion. The developers should probably try to evolve the game a bit more so that new tech isn't the automatic win that it is in the old game.

On the tech side, it's improved from the MOO2 system where you were generally given a choice between two or three useful technologies that didn't really make sense to be mutually exclusive; there's only a few times where you have to pick between two different options. However, the ones that are there don't make a lot of sense; for example, you can have either fusion bombs or fusion beams, but never both. It seems like it would make more sense to provide a more sensible system if they want to prevent full access to the entire tech tree. Maybe an affinity system that lets you do certain things better than others in the combat realm - for example, maybe some races can build better shields where others can build bigger ships.

The final comment I will make is that it costs a pretty hefty price and that there are a few things that they need to do to really make it worth that - the textures are currently pretty low resolution in a lot of cases and the art assets are limited in ship building.

Even with the current flaws, I'd still give the game a thumbs up, and if you were waiting for a MOO/MOO2 remake, this is definitely it in my opinion.",1457333242,1457333242,True,29,0,0.525641024112701416,0,True,False,True

Two major issues hurt the game however. Number 1 is the star lanes which were a terrible idea in MOO 3 and should never have been copied to this new itteration. MOO 1 and 2 were about free travel and exploration in space. The forced star lanes here dumb down the overall strategy and promote huge fleets building up at choke points. Developers claim star lanes are the more popular choice (doubt it), but at least make an option for no star lanes in game set up. The second major fault is tactical comabat (the complete lack of it). Its supposed to be a hybrid of RTS (real time strategy) but is more like RTW (real time witness). You can pause the action at any time in battle to ""take control"" but besides steering different groups of ships and changing their formation, there is nothing to do. You can chose tactical mode and watch the battle happen with nice graphics, or you can skip that and just get the results with a simulate option. In ""tactical"" you have no control over individual ships (groupings only), no control over weapons fire, and cannot tell damaged ships to pull back or retreat from the battle. There is nothing meaningful to do. The developers said turn based combat was too slow so they dropped it for real time, but at least turn based combat was meaningful and really impacted game play. These real time battles seem decided almost entirely by math rather than tactics and are neither engaging or memorable.
All told the game does capture much of the same atmosphere of MOO 1 and 2 and it has development potential. Wait and see how they address the problems before buying though. They haven't earned our money yet.",1457309719,1457309719,False,106,1,0.685079693794250488,3,True,False,True

1) Tactical Combat - Real time is total crap. It needs to be turn based and bring back different shield facings. All the strategy is gone out of this aspect of the game.

2) Need custom races options. This includes what ship set your fleet will look like. I love the Sakara but hate the look of their ships. I am sure this is in development.

3) More options of things to do with ""dead"" systems. For example a system with only a gas giant. You should be able to build an orbital station of some time.

4) Some sort of approval system for upgrades to designs based on tech. I really like the upgrade feature but it would be nice to have a pop up menu for the new ship design for a quick double check. I ended up upgrading all my ships without any ground bombardment capability without realizing it.

5) Races don't really feel distinct in gameplay at the moment but I think this is under development.

There are plenty of reviews from folks giving this a thumbs down and I've read through most of them.   Nearly every negative comment is due to the game not being finished yet, I still don't understand the folks who buy an ""Early Access"" game and expect it to not have some issues with it......c'mon people you are basicaly play testing for them so they can have TONS of input on what to fix before the full launch!

Things the Devs are working on that most have commented about.  The AI is crap, yup it's extremely easy right now and they did that for a reason.  If you make it too difficult, and we all have seen that, then folks will simply throw up their hands because it's frustrating playing against an AI that is basically getting inside information or has built it cheats that allow it to progress faster.  Having a true balanced AI is extremely difficult, but they are working on it.

Combat can be improved upon but many of the comments I've seen are bunk.  You can control your ships to a degree, you can select which targets they shoot at, you can change formations, you can send them anywhere on the map you want (in groups or individual ships).  You cannot choose which weapons to shoot and you cannot target specific things on the enemy ships.  It's very simplistic combat that you can actually effect the outcome of the battle.....I know, I've tested it many times and have watched my fleet lose battels they would normally easily win by me making bold and too aggressive actions.  I've also won fights that I probably would have lost if I had not manipulated my ships properly around the map.

Deplomacy is something that the Devs have said is a work in progress.  Not sure what these people are talking about that the AI players are forcing them to give up tech or they ""get mad at you"".  Um, yeah, that's kinda the way the world works presently so it's only fitting.   The AI will get upset if you don't share but it doesn't attack you, it doesnt do anything other then pout.   No matter what you do though it really doesnt matter, the AI is so easy to beat you can share all you want and you will still win.  Again, it's something they will ramp up later and then we'll hear all the crying about it being too difficult.

I don't know why so many people are giving 'no' recommendations, and are complaining about stuff not working.  Like it says in the big blue box at the top, this is an early access game.  I bought in early so I could get the previous MoO games.  If you're unsure, wait for the full release.  I plan to switch to MoO2 until the full release after I conquer the galaxy in my current game.

I am so incredibily happy with this new MOO, even in alpha is shaping up to be a awesome game. Is it exactly the same, no.. and imo it shouldn't try to be, yet it has captured all the main elements of what made moo2 so good imo.

the artwork and visual feelling of the game is just beautiful, I would like to see it fleshed out with female choices for the races, also be able to choose whatever color i want for which ever race i play, but like i said, this is in alpha and they have time to add/implement some features, 

the overall game is very intuitive and easy to use, even as you get into late game play you are not bogged down with nicro managing, I love the queueing for the build and research systems. there is room for work on diplomacy but the seeds are in place for it,  and the combat system is looking very good already. I love the auto upgrading function available to keep your ships upgraded easily.

all in all i rate this at 8.5 of 10 and its still in alpha, I paid 49.95 for this game and would do so again, I feel i have a game I will be playing often and having a lot of fun with for another 20+ years if i am lucky enough to beat breast cancer and still be around that long. cheers all and look me up for a MP game!

The espionage feature is not turned on yet, and the AI diplomacy didn't really seem very complicated which could be good or bad. If in single player with more complicated features turned on/ added, I could see a good reason to make the game unlimited turns but at the present it's fairly easy. I like that I could mine asteroids or gas giants before I had the option of transforming them into planets. The combat is not turn based and although I have run through the game, I have yet to figure out exactly how much I can manage the combat. It's in real time so clicking on your ships and changing thier focus of attack seems to be as complex as it gets. You can upgrade/ design your own ships personally or you can allow the computer to auto upgrade your designs.

Im a big moo fan from the first minute, even played moo3 plus mods for a long time
Nothing ever reached moo2 though...

that said i don't get why ??? didn't they implement Turn based Combat??    WHY real time??   Ship design is almost obsolete or doesn't pay off fun wise so to say..

The rest of the game feels fine and ok..   just travel distance mechanics are not there??? 
Anyways, i hope there will be a way to implement turn base combat somehow!!!

I'd like to have a story mode for singleplayer with mysteries to discover and please no funny psilons!!, seriously why is their voice and appearance try so hard to make them funny ??  id really doesn't add to my immersion while playing a Star Lord 

final word: just not happy yet

If you're not a 'long time fan' of theses games like me and you just want a soild 4x stratergy game to play then this is a good choice. I will mention the fact that you must remember this is an early access title because there are features missing however the base game they've laid out here is very well done and interresting to play. I can see where they're going to build on this game and, when complete, it could be fantastic.

I am a huge fan of the Civilization fanchise and you can definitely where this game has pulled from the design of games like Civ 5 which in my experience gave me a good starting point to understanding what to do to play.

While the game is pretty, and alot of effort has been spent on making the game beautiful, this has been a zero sum game. The effort spent in making this game into a beautiful game has not been spent on making this a complex game. There is no tactical combat, ship design is a thing of the past, diplomacy doesn't function very well, and the galaxies are relatively small. Planet management is pretty great though. So if you're looking at building simplistic spaceships by clicking on predetermined modules, then building said space ships and spending 19 turns moving it across starlanes to attack an AI that's completely useless then this game is for you.

I want to love this. The game is getting a very nice polish after years ont he shelf. But LIke XCOM you CAN NOT TAKE THE SAME GAME and just update the Graphics. The Reason XCOM reboot worked is becuase they made it thier own. it brought the familiar and added enough new to make it great. I want the same thing here very bad.

Pros.
1. Graphics and Sound are top notch. - the voice acting is spectautlar and if you are a geek like me most of the voices will be familer to you. (see things like Firefly and STNG). The graphics show real polish. the detail on the GUI and tactical maps are scary good. 
2. Stable--ish - some poeple are saying they did not have crash issues. I hit a few bugs in my playthorughs both single and multi-player. Forcing me to reload the turn ( thank god for Autosave). But other than that smooth.

Cons-

1. Ok easy one first. Labels and discriptions.  Many times. the discriptions were not accurate enough.  For example. When you are resarching a beam weapon on the tech tree you get that weapons damage, size, and cost.  Then you get to the Ship design Screen... and all you get is an inaccurate DPS and a frustating 'fleet value' more on that later.   Another example, is the Jumpgate discription... all you get is ""this helps you travel between your colonies faster..."" that's it.. nothing else. It doesn't actually say that it will let you travel Directly between 2 colonies without using the warp lanes. A better discription here would have made me jump on the tech much sooner in my first time through ( I obviously did in subsiquent playthroughs)

2. Ship Design in general- The ship design screen is problably my biggest headache. Small bugs like the ""this ship is already being used.  to the 'Auto' update that actually overwrites your ship designs with less efficeint weapons and even older armors and computers..""

3. Tactical Combat- And here we have it. the ONE thing that NO 4x game seems to get right except MOO and MOO2(and even they had some flaws). Real time combat in this game is point and click you have no control over most weapons.  This problem was solved in MOO2 by a simple ""on""/""off"" switch. The asteroids do offer a SMALL amount of stratagy. you can use them to hide ship and engage on close combat, but that is a crap shoot and most weapons seem to go around or over them, Honestly the only truly great 3D realtime space combat I have seen is Homeworld. Soo unless you can steel a game engine or two I would suggest a switch back to turnbased. (might not be possible.. but hey I can dream)

4. ok lastly  Warp lanes- Lets get one thing straight I LIKE the idea of warp lanes they segment the galaxy and it makes empire building interesting. Especially because you cannot jump through all of them right away and there is tech (jumpgates) that negates the lanes somewhat. THIS IS A GOOD THING. you can build the defense stations to give your empire a true 'border' without having sentries at every single frikken one of your colonies.  

What I do not like about them is that they are BOTHnNot limiting enough and it takes to damn long to just use them. First you have to spend a whole turn to get to the point, Then you send X number of turns traveling through the lane then you Finnaly reach the destination and it starts all over.  In the early game I would expect this kind of limitation but I would also expect Techs to negate the flaws.  

For example.. All ships no matter the tech are only able to move ONE spot in a system a turn.. Better engines/fuel cells should allow for more mobility..  And the final engine in previous games allowed for instantanious travel between systems. ( Warp Gates and Transwarp drives).   

Ok that covers the time it takes to use them now the  ""not limiting enough"" you can LITERALY SCOUT the ENTIRE GALAXY no matter what tech lvl you are. As I said before there are some warp lanes you cannot travel through, but it just doesn't feel epic when you can see and speak to every single race in the first 50 turns... I miss the limiters that  pushed you to research better fuel Cells so you could get that xtra parsec. 

On the whole I would say this game is a GREAT alpha. I hope beyond hope that some of the issues above will be solved before release and I am looking forward to seeing the final product.",1457144511,1457150292,True,23,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was surprised to see this update materialize unheralded, and intrigued enough to purchase an Early Access game for the first time.  Watching the videos, one has to commend the studio on its selection of actors who give life to the various faction leaders.  ""Worf"" (Mr. Dorn) is back!  The animated characterizations of the leaders are a treat to behold, a huge step up from the caricatures of the original.  There is a subtle humour in the exchanges, as well as with the GNN commentators and news stream.  Granted, the variety is limited, but if the game continues to be developed, I hope dialogue and events will be increased.  This IS an early release, and the development team focused, sensibly, on getting the main mechanics right.  This game plays true to the original, except as already noted in other reviews, with warp lanes/points.  The technology tree has been streamlined, ship building is refreshingly easy and enjoyable.  Colony development will be familiar but with a few new twists.  Effort was made to make the star map attractive.  While not 3D, it is perfectly fine and gives the illusion of depth.  Ship models are distinct and detailed.  Battle animations are well done, basically a video to watch, but one cannot help admire the fighters, missiles and torpedoes streaking towards their target from your battleships and Titans.  Does it, as some have mentioned, get a bit repetitive?  Yes, but then so did the original.  This just looks far better.  For an early release game, I am impressed (and surprised) that it plays so well.  It is better than several supposedly ""finished"" games we could all name.  After two playthroughs, I had no crashes, glitches or lockups.  My hope is that the developer will continue to refine, expand and add to this game.  There are four more races that are suggested.  As well, at this time, there are only two map selections.  Steam offered a package which included the new update along with all three of the old series.  I already had them.

But one of the huge problems with MoO2 was the late game, having huge fleets and battles that took forever; it stopped being tactically fun and just a tedious and laborious inconvience. So with this new iteration, I'm glad to see they have tried to address that by adding in paused/realtime combat. It's too early to say they will have it spot on but the direction is quite exciting to see.

I like the introduction of starlanes, I feel it adds in choke points and the ability to have a war front and not have surprise attacks on some odd random system miles from the rest of your fleet. I also think they have done really well in capturing the spirit of the original MoOs.

When only given the choise to recommend or not, I can't recommend it. There are better alternatives now.

spacelanes, bad ""tactical combat"", no leaders, no ground combat animations. Stuff just seams somewhat dumbed down too.

If you've already made that mistake, play the original MoO2 that comes with this release until this game is finished before you start pointing out what's missing.

-Tactical battles have already improved (they are now bigger) and will continue to do so. 
-Turn limits have been turned off unless you're in a score based win scenario where they're relevant
-Jump Gates mean you can ignore the warp gates, you just have to have an armada ready and send a colony ship to rout your enemy.
-There are buildings not yet implemented that “give troops experience”.

A lot of the systems that people are saying have been “dumbed down” probably haven't been written yet...I could go on.

I am on my first game which I have managed to drag out to 40 hrs worth of game play, I am on turn 386 meaning I have 114 turns left, but what does that matter, I doubt I will hit turn 500 because I am partly in the middle of wiping out the last 3 races, all while I am colonizing every star system.

That is not the point though, by turn 386 I have enough points to vote myself as the Supreme Chancellor of everyone, I now abstain my own votes as wiping out every single one of them is more fun this time round, I will venture into the other victory's when I play this over again.

I have every piece of tech researched except ""Evolving Techs"" either because Scientific Victory is not fully finished, or because I need to build the 2nd building before it unlocks, I have not ventured to check because domination is my path for victory.

I own 43 planets, my Colony ships are in the process to flying out to all other planets to take them over too.

Out of them 43 planets I have Terraformed 16 into Gaia biome's, the best biome you can upgrade too, most of the other planets are in the process of terraforming as well, I basically have every building unlocked on nearly all these planets and max population.

I have done all of this while playing as the Mrrshan, who I think are pretty enticing....

But apart from that 500 turns is a fine number of turns to hit the peak at everything, I will play all the other races just because the game is fun.

The only thing I have issues with is that I started getting lag the further into the game I got, but its Alpha, fact I can play this game on fantastic graphics is great, the game looks graphically beautiful.

Scouting does not fully work, sometimes it auto explores, other times it doesnt bother...they need to make it so my scout can auto explore all the time, even if I have seen all star systems, mainly because its handy to have/do.

There is not enough description I think for certain things, like the University, it does not tell me what requirements I need to have it at certain places, being as I have one on nearly every biome, every size planet, all the different colour star systems, and yet I cannot get it on random planets which would meet the same criteria as ones I have it on.

I like that the game has things like population growth spurts, certain star systems have the possibility to go super nova, even one of my planets got infections to cure, it is all interesting and fun as its random to happen...nearly forgot one of my planets had an earthquake which killed alot of my population and destroyed most of my buildings, pissed me off, but I still liked it and the randomness of it all.

In total this is the 2nd turn based game I have played, I have not played the previous versions of Moo, nor do I care if I have or not, I find people compare games too much these days and that leads to stupidity in the gaming world.

Look forward to things being patched, new content being added, so keep up the good work and please get working on making it so you can play at harder levels, or make average harder as it feels like I am playing against an AI lower then easy and being locked at average is the only boring part about this game so far :)",1457110324,1457110927,True,23,0,0.472027212381362915,0,True,False,True

Battles not turn based well there is a pause button so if you wish to slow the battle down and hit the pause button to issue new orders, seems the same as turn based.

I like the jump lanes very much like a board game I played in my youth.

Systems look great pretty good, capturing the feel of the original MOO 

Liked the tech tree its a bit to predictable does not reflect the unpredictable nature of research after all lines of research can take you down rabbit holes and blind allys. May even be worth throwing in random tech events slowing or speeding up research.

Espionage to be added ok early access
 
More races to be added ok early access

More difficulty levels Normal is a bit to easy for me I always played on the harder levels, ok early access

I went into this game thinking it was gonna be another remake i would hate. This game had me hooked from the word go. The fancy intro, to the talking help the game really does grab you quickly and game play quick to pick up.
 So where to begin

 First thoughts did not seem promising from the download. Even though this game is in BETA it was still a really small download which did raise initial concerns. These however were quashed quite quickly from starting the game. Graphics are good but nothing fantastic and the intro is relatively short. Not complaining myself as i like to get stuck in, but anyone wanting a background story there isn't much to go on. (however this is still a beta and could change).
 The initial character selection is as would be expected with the description of races and perk. However i find the perks to be a bit lacking of a decription and so far don't make a noticeable amount of difference. Once you have selected a race you jump straight into the game, which has helpful advice on how to play.

 The game play had me hook. Once i started i had to finish, this game really does draw you in and has a sins of a solar empire sorta feel. The AI is quite poor though but as the BETA stands you cannot change the difficulty. Fingers crossed the hard AI will have some kick when the game is finally released. The battles look amazing but have limited ammount of input from the player. Anyone who has played the previous games might find issue with this. However i do feel that the battles will benefit the multiplayer aspect of the game, hopefully cutting game times down from a full day  to complete a small galaxy.
 Diplomacy on this game is still as bad as the predecessors, the AI is unreasonable and trying to set up any advance treaty will take so much time and effort. The diplomatic victory is also easy to achieve if you expand quickly. This does have to be my biggest bug bear with the game. If 4X would make the AI vote tactically i would be so much happier with this already awesome game.
 Planetary interaction has been improved slightly so has the monetary and tax systems. With this game you will find you are paying alot more attention to tax rates, pollution, construction etc. Also there is a new addition which is warp point structures. I really do hope they develope these just alittle bit more as the idea is great but as they dont provide much protection unless you camp them.

 The game runs very smooth, sounds great and has relatively low load tiimes. The sound is pure excellence and have found no real bugs with the game so far.

 Pro's and Con's

 Up Side

1. Looks great
2. Gameplay is simple 
3. Alot more thought to multiplayer
4. People who are new to Master of Orion can jump straight in
5. Planetary interface has been improved
6. It is the much needed update for Master of Orion
7. Not many bugs for a BETA
8.Quick start no messing around


 Downsides :(

Most of my downsides are going to stick out more to Master of Orion enthusiasts
 
1. Battles are really lacking user input 
2. Diplomacy still sucks
3. Warp lines. gone are the days of direct travel
4. Ship range mechanic has been removed
5. Pirates are terrible
6. AI are not very tactical
7. It feels more like Sins of a solar empire than Master of Orion
8. This is a biggie bear with me..........

This is largly because it takes some of its content from a genuinely great 4X game, MOO2, that was so good that it is still excellent (in spite of some flaws) after 20+ years.

The research categories are taken from MOO2, but they are broken up into smaller pieces that are incremental. Where, for example, in MOO2 an Automated Factory would give +5 production and an additional +1 production per person, in this game the Automated factory merely gives +2 Production, making it an incremental change rather than a major strategical achievement.

The designers, in their words about design admitted openly (see Steam discussions)  that building an almost chess-like 4X game like MOO2 was beyond their programming capacity. In MOO2 the one who went first in major battles would depend upon something called initiative, based on speed and maneuvering capability. This worked very well and typically with two relatively equal human players in a large battle the best ship or two of each side would go first and then the other ships. It worked extremely well, while the developers of this game called it ""unwarranted complexity"" and claimed they just couldn't do it.

Please read some of the positive reviews for discussion of this new games virtues. There are all some and sadly it is better than many 4X attempts there because they did take a lot from MOO2... but not nearly enough. That is the reason this is very sad.

Hopefully, someday, a genuine reboot or sequel to MOO2 will be made. The tragic part is that the existance of this game might give potential backers the false impression that such a reboot/sequel has already been done, which it has not.

I did pay my $50 and play this game to give it a shot. I could give a balanced look at the positive qualities, but instead, in this review I merely wish to share my deep feelings of heartbroken disappointment. It is frustrating when designers just cannot understand what is great about a game they are trying to reboot or give a sequel to.

For comparison there is a great colony building game called Outpost that was turn-based and genuinely great but rushed too quickly into production without completing it. When Outpost II came out it had been made by some clueless executive at Sierra into an action game. As an avid Outpost enthusiast waiting for a sequel/completion of the original, I was offered a free copy of Outpost II which I refused. I don't care about the $40 then or the $50 I paid now. I care because a great game like MOO2 has never been rebooted or done with current graphics, refinement of the random event/initiative systems, a better AI, etc. This game took from MOO2, but changed way too much of what made it great.",1457028410,1457028410,False,9,0,0.52179485559463501,0,True,False,True

The main difference here is that this new MO is made for multiplayer. Just try it if you haven't.

This is just the beggining and there is much more content to come for sure. Key points of notice so far:

1. Star lanes is a huge + to gameplay as it makes  for a much more strategic game. In MO2 without warp inhibitor it would be impossible to stop all e nemy invasions at once when they have good drives. I think that was MO2's weakest feature although still a great game.

2. Missles were fairly useless in MO2 past mid tere. In this version they seem uber powerfull. I don't think they need  nerf just a study of the eefectiveness of counter measures. ECM seems uselesss so far.

3. AI needs work. That is almost 100% certain for any new strategy game.

4. A better outline of each races special attributes is needed. I think though the creators f the game are planning to release this when the full version comes out.

5. Enabling tactical combat for multi-player is a must. I'm undecided if the game needs the old style tactical from MO2 back. It may make multi player games to dragged out. The new stye tactical combat does have some great benefits for what it sacrifices from the old turn based,. Time efficient resolve, a more realistic battle sim and you still have full control of the ships.

This iteration of MOO has the feel. It has the lore. Some of the animations and voice acting (particular the Psilon) is a little cartoony, but nothing too annoying. 

The mechanics are solid, the graphics are great, and the AI is very wimpy and needs serious work. Combat is good although I warn you it is not turn based, which presents both new opportunities but also requires you to rethink how you do combat. 

Ship design is a bit less robust in someways -- since you fight in RT trick ships with teleporting boarding shuttle loads are not as effective. 

The stellar converter is still there. So are doom stars.

[b]Races[/b]
 The game is going to have 10 races in the final release, six of which are playable now. These are the ten races of Master of Orion I, and include the Bird-like Alkari, the Bear-warrior Bulrathi, boring old Humanity, the Cat-like Mrrshan, the subterranean lizard Sakkra, and the scientific Psilon-- with the Ant-like Klackon, Rocky Silicoid, Mechanical Meklar and secretous Darloks planned for a later release. [b]Missing[/b] are the Trilarians, Elerians, and Gnolam.

each of the races are drastically different from their originals, and overly diluted in characteristics. Rather than a race that is tuned in to it's heritage, each one must play more as a generalist instead of  focusing on a single strength or two.

The Alkari, for example, were originally highly effective in combat in space, and masters of propulsion-- a function of their evolutionary history with flight. Now, they have a 25% defensive bonus to certain combat scenarios, the end.

the Sakkra were the masters of overwhelming populations, able to reach twice as high populations thanks to their ability to live both on and below a planet's surface. Now? They grow a little bit faster. 

[b]Research[/b]
An important mechanic of the MoO universe has always been research. New technologies, and important research decisions: Do you want to use the new Fusion technology to upgrade you ship bombs, engines, or beam weapons? This sort of decision made decisions critical, and brought diplomacy to a monumental forefront in the game. It wasn't just about which tech you chose, it was about which tech you let your opponents have. The Psilon used to have a special racial characteristic: While they sucked at most things due to their frail nature, their brilliant minds allowed them to capture all these options instead of just one-- and use these technologies to surpass their enemies. But the tech-tree has been redesigned such that technological decisions are few and far between, and the Psilon's unique advantage has been replaced with a flat bonus to research. 

[b]The Galaxy[/b]
In the original MoO games, travel took time and fuel. If a star was close enough, you could reach it. If not, you did not go there. Later in the game, you could travel from any star directly to any other star, if fuel allowed. You expanded your reach by building colonies and outposts, or by researching new fuel technologies. This entire system has been scrapped in favor of a starlane system, with each star acting as a node-- and if you can navigate there, you can go anywhere in the galaxy from level one. The advantages of this system are, presumably, greater strategy-- creating choke points around the galaxy to protect your territory from opponents. Military bases can be built to ""blockade"" ends of starlanes, for example, from enemy travel. But it destroys the open feeling of space present in MoO2, and is completely not worth it. 

The current version of the game includes pirate raiders who will occaisionally attack, forcing you to keep a few ships handy to quickly dispense them as an annoyance-- and a few stationary space monsters like a Giant Squid, Eel, or the Guardian of Orion-- usually guarding a particularly nice planet. There are a few scripted events and anomalies, but not nearly enough to keep the game interesting just yet.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
This game shows promise of being true to the Master of Orion Spirit, but I am concerned that the scope will not go deep enough to make it worthy of the name. MoO fans from the original series will find the game fun for a few hours in it's current state, but the lack of complexity and depth really prevent this game from being the huge hit it may become if the developers revise the systems they've created to make it more like the original. The controls also are unintuitive for now, space combat is boring and unmeaningful, and ground combat is non-existent. Voice acting shows promise, but has way too much repetition. ""I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee"" kind of repetition, only 1000 times worse. But if the developers do what they should, this game definitely belongs on any 4X fan's wishlist. But as is, it feels too much like Civilization and not enough like Masters of Orion.

Will continue to update throughout the game's development, and if the game ever reaches a fun state for non-MoO fans, I'll give it a thumbs up.",1456875179,1456976121,False,57,0,0.6179848313331604,0,True,False,True

i had an Battleship design with 28 phasors  and no missles at all  cause that would have been even more OP

to make it short i attacked marrshn homeworld to test my ship 

1vs 28  +  planet defense

of cause my ship won 

BUT: the 28 phasor banks  dont work correctly ( ALL WEAPONS TO BE CORRECT)

if my ship shoot on of the frigates  and that exploded after 3rd hit   it counted as 1 turn for ALL my 28 phasors...

reload time again..

not that the other 25 phasors shoot other ships.. NOOOOOO phasors fired turn  end.....

same with point defense... did you notice the pd only fires at the FIRSt missle ....????

it even keeps firing all pd lasers even if that missle allready gone boom and the shoot simply aim for the spot where it made boom!!


AI to dumb to clean there own planets it seems ... invaded enemy planet without bombing so to speak at turn 1 

and they had 78% pollution


i bet the alkari and  psilons  poisened themselves  cause the alkari where realy spread out as they made first contact

trough map share i got the know all the now empy planets  there all gone

After playing the remake, I can't help but feel extremely disappointed. Looking down the discussions list, I really do question what people VALUE out of this genre.

I do have a big problem with the lack of tactical combat. I think it's a damn shame. However, I will avoid talking about the lack of turn based combat, you can find about a thousand topics about that fairly easilly. But what about everything else that seems to be so poorly thought out and designed, or just plain doesn't follow what established Master of Orion as a great 4x IP?

To start: Star Lanes.
Why? There was already a very logical method to travel in MoO. Do you have X amount of fuel? Great, you can move Y amount of parsecs. If you can't get to a system you want to get to, you either make a priority out of fuel research, or build an outpost, which is also good for your ship count. This made exploration a much more active affair, forcing you to change your build order/priorities based on the system that was generated. Star Lanes are boring for exploration. Just mindlessly click the next thing on the path you've taken. Fuel also brings me to the next thing:

Research.
Simplified into (or copy/pasted from) Civilization. I like civ, but not as a 4x space game, which should take research very seriously. Research was half of what made MoO interesting. You COULD NOT know everything, unless you were creative, which was an ungodly expensive race trait (which got even more expensive after a patch). To know as much as you could, you had to trade. Or steal. Or invade. The ""branched"" techs in this remake are shallow, and boil down to extremely superficial choices of numbers (get more industry, or more research. Woohoo). In MoO 1 and 2, the choice was very difficult. Like mentioned above, you needed fuel. New fuel was often one of three researches, and the others in the same pool could be very useful, but if you wanted to fly farther, you had to make sacrifices. I don't feel like any of the remake's branched techs make you sacrifice much of anything. However, one in particular caught my eye, and that brings me to my next point:

Diplomacy
Why, oh why, is the ability to make a trade or research treaty stuck behind a tech choice? The other race, upon viewing my ship, called me up on my space phone and told me that they wanted to lay their eggs in my stomach. Could I not figure out how to say the word ""trade"" in their language? The method by which you do diplomacy also seems to be lifted directly from Civ, from the interface to the presentation of the alien race, lounging in their background of choice and talking at you as you decide how best to screw them over. What about the audience screen from MoO2? Or the holoconference from MoO3 (one of the few decent things from MoO3...)?

Cosmetics
Gone are the days of HR Giger inspired artwork. I understand why, it's hard to have art that detailed in a full 3D environment, but much of the game looks to be constructed of clay and coated in KBToys brand plastics. I won't say much on how the game looks, as that is as deep into opinion as I care to go, but I will say that for a PC exclusive game, I expect it to look much better.


All in all, I really think MoOremake is still in desperate need of work. Of course, we all know the game is easy access, and much will probably be changed. However, I doubt any of the changes will be drasticly different from what we see before us now.",1456964472,1456964472,False,100,3,0.616552948951721191,3,True,False,True

[*]Great graphics all around (planets, ships, and cutscenes)

There is only one big gameplay issue that may turn people away - the choice to have all battles played in real time (with slowing & pausing) rather than the turn-based in previous versions of the game.  This is a personal preference that some players may strongly object to.  I played both the original MOO and MOO2 and loved them both and find this version as fun as the originals.

There are other gameplay tuning aspects that anyone could make about the game in its current Early Release state.  These include number of playable races, diversity of the tech tree, quality of the AI, etc.  I would fully expect these to improve as the release date approaches.

I saw ""Mostly Positive"" and read the reviews, because I felt burned by Master of Orion III and I didn't want to waste $50.  It scared the hell out of me that all the reviews were negative.  It gave me the impression that I shouldn't buy it, and I carried a bitter taste in my mouth for a couple hours.  Then I decided to do it.  I played MOO1 when it was a new release, and I keep the disks on my desktop.  (the only floppies I have that are not in the attic)  I'm a game developer, and this game has always been a personal inspiration.

So this review is coming from someone who knows and loves MOO.  I think this game is every step in the right direction.  I had so many concerns, and now I have none.  It looks to me like the designers went back to MOO1 and updated it.  I notice this isn't MOO4, it's MOO:CTS, right?  You could call it MOO4, if you wanted, but that sort of validates MOO2 and MOO3.  Now, I got MOO2 on release day, and I played the hell out of it and enjoyed myself very much.  I don't keep the CD on my desk, though.  I'll probably never play it again.  So I'm now happy to forget MOO2 and MOO3 existed, because these wonderful people have remastered a classic.

Each part of the game stays true to the original, yet is reimagined using modern game development techniques.  Systems are fun to fly around, look great, and make good strategic choke points.  Ship Design and Tech Trees have familiar technologies.  Planetary economies are simple to manage.  Realtime combat is great.  I am very happy with the decisions that the designers have made.  It is a beautiful game, and lots of fun.

When I reread the negative reviews now, they look like a bunch of people who don't understand the concept of Early Access, and that upset me enough to come on here and share.  I am a fan of the original MOO.  I enjoyed MOO2.  I thought MOO3 was horrible.

Combat needs to be deeper, too shallow as it is now. I can agree that it needs to be fast for multiplayer, but it should still be a mini-game that gives you real choices to make... that creates strategy and strategy is why I play these types of games.

Planets are not different enough, found myself building most of the same buildings on every planet, should be different paths you have to choose when developing worlds. Any real sense of making hard choices is not there when developing planets at the moment.  Once again choices creates strategy and strategy is why I play these types of games.

Research should have more branches, that result in more choices, which creates strategy and strategy is why I play these types of games.

So to sum it up: I like what I see so far and hope that the developers take this game the way it needs to go.  As of right now I have that ""one more turn"" feeling but do not have that ""Ahh this is hard, which way do I decide to go here?"" feeling that I love getting from a well designed, fun strategy 4x game.

As you can see from the above video the game looks very nice in 1080p with a easy to handle ui.
There are a few elements that might not be obvious when starting out as fleet movement does happen automatically at the end of the turn but you can move it during the turn manually.
The voice acting is great as you would imagine given the all star cast hired for this title.
Gameplay seems quite addictive but that could just be that new game feeling we all get after downloading a game you just purchased but so far it seems worth the price put on it.

Pros
- Game is reasonably quick to pick up and play.
- Looks good and plays well even on max settings.
- The game has a lot of depth of gameplay and tech with enough species to play as to make it rewarding to play again and again.
- Even with the depth a noob like me can still quite easily get their head around the mechanics and play and have a chance of winning but I guess this is also a con due to it meaning more experienced players will find the game a push over.
- Customize your fleet the way you want it with tech you unlock as you play.
- With no prior knowledge of the game you will come to it without hang ups thus accepting it for what it is rather than what it isn't.
- No unskippable cut scenes

Cons
- Walking away from a game and coming back to it can be daunting as trying to establish what you were up to even a day or so later is a hell of a thing to do.
- The tactical battle simulations seem slow and hard to watch in or out of cinematic view.
- Ai seems quite simple currently and does not offer a lot of challenge on its standard setting.
- There is no woarning that making some choices with one race will automatically disable those same options with others even if you reverse them later.
- People who played the game previously have told me its lacking in a few respects comparred to their nostalgic view of the second game.

I do recommend it, however I would suggest waiting for the actual release. There are several positive and negative aspects of the game, which I will try and go through in as much detail as possible.

+ Graphics and Music: The ship design and battles look and sound impressive. The score is reminiscent of Master of Orion, which is definitely a boon. 
+ UI: The user interface is clean, easy to navigate, and provides a decent amount of information.
+ Races: The races are true to form for the original Master of Orion, though the racial bonuses are significantly weaker than they once were. 
+ Next Turn Addictiveness: I found myself trapped in a civilizationesque pattern of hammering next turn to see what would happen. This is a good thing as it shows the game is immersive. 
+ Ship Design: Mostly positive, I wish we could remove some systems entirely so I could build swarms of shield less missile frigates.
+ Excellence Mode: Allowing a turn cap is useful but unneeded really. I would mostly leave this off.

- Battles: The battles in this game, while visually impressive, are extremely shallow. There is no retreat button, there are no formations, there is no weapon selection. In every fight I wanted to watch, I simply let the AI command the ships because giving orders in this game is quite cumbersome and unneeded. 
- Diplomacy: At one point during my playthrough the Alkari were on the verge of collapse. They sent forth their most diplomatic of ambassadors and... demanded a planet from me to stop? I bombed their capital into the ground a few turns later out of annoyance. It seems that no matter how good your diplomatic skills are, once you start expanding over a certain number of planets or systems, everyone hates you and will declare war on you if you don't supply them with credits frequently. This is not a good diplomatic system.
- Auto Build: Why does auto build always build Military structures first? Surely the population of my radiated planet would prefer hydroponic or fungal farms first instead of marines?
- Difficulty: Average difficulty is incredibly easy.
- GNN: Love the information, liked the droids for a brief period, now hate the droids.

So far, Master of Orion looks that it might be that sequel, though given that its early access, it is too early to tell for sure.

Right from the start, the game feels very familiar to a veteran MoO 2 player. You can tell that this game was made by people who know and love the MoO franchise. Most changes made to gameplay (like starlanes) are minor in nature and, at least in my opinion, make sense. The ship designer in particular is still there and not too different from MoO 2  (You can still outfit you ships with tons of different weapons and specials, as well as modify the weapons themselves - missles, beam weapons, point defense, firing arcs, ecm jammers, fighter / bomber bays, you name it).

The only real big change is the - much discussed - replacement of the turn based space combat with a (pauseable) real time version. While I am not to stoked about this myself, I do not think this is the end world, and - if done right - might even a good thing. Unfortunately, given that the A.I. is very limted so far in Early Access (the A.I.  difficulty is set to average for now), I have not been able to experience any battle involving two large fleets so far, where you could truly test the depth of the real time combat system. 

Just to be clear (because I have seen wrong information about this), the combat is not merely a interactive movie, like (unfortuantely) in games like Endless Space. You have full control over the ships, i.e. you can designate targets, maneuver the ships and manually activate specials on the ships.

Later to my astonishment, it is the series that I was looking for. In that instant I bought it. It was worth the 50$.

The one I remember is Master of Orion 2. You build your empire, you have your ships and research to do. You interact with the other races. Played a game then moved on to the Reboot.

Oh boy, the Reboot. You build, you explore, you talk, and you conquer. Each race, as the previous versions, have their own style of ships. One looks like a cat's head and another looks like a flying saucer. The more you research, the bigger gun you have. They stick true to the predisessors, you make the ships.

You can't beat that, you can't beat a game that it's your choise to rule or rule beside. If you push your people hard, they push back harder. If your out of money, there goes most of your stuff.

-AI never seem to gain Battle Ship Class.
-Some vauge discrptions in regards to tech.
-Zero ground combat. This shares the same graphics as per bombardments. (I was hoping for something similar to Masters of Orion 2 or even if you could control ground troops in a similar setting as per space combat)
-Space Stations are very under powered
-Space Monsters are also very under powered, they should be something to fear!!!
-There are also no leaders.

Gametime: aprox 20 hours.

As a long time fan of Moo2 i am pleased to see that this game is way more Moo2 than Moo3.
It kind of reminds me of a crossover between Moo2 and Sins of a solar empire.

This game has a lot of potential to become great with some tweaks and polishing.
As it stand right now i think the game is unballanced in regards of research,
and the opponents are not much of a challenge. Frankly they are quite push-over.
Also combat is a little bit dull, its not engaging like the classic moo2 where you got to play your fleet.
Here it is real time combat and you have little control over whats happening. You can activate modules manually.
Also i miss being able to recruit ship officers and colony administrators for increased bonuses.
Would like to see this implemented, and perhaps with an xp system for the officers and administrators.

Some things that need adjusting and improving are Tool tips, Correct and updated stats on ship modules, Research,
Difficulty level, Sorting out misc bugs and strangely enough.. savegame size. My savegame folder now almost takes up 1gb of space.. with the largest save being 150mb.

There are also some bugs here and there, but nothing major, and a save and relog usualy resolves the issue.
If this is only on my client i do not know, my friend who purchased the game at the same time does not experience the same bugs as i do.

But i think the graphics looks great, races are pehaps a bit cartoony but i dont mind. Individual voice acting for each race, nice models and nice textures, nice cinematics. Engaging gameplay and it is easy to spend alot of time ingame.

To sum it up, the game as it stands right now has its flaws.. but it is an early access so what did you expect ?
Are the flaws game breaking ? no, not at all. The game is fully playable and quite enjoyable.
But i expect the game to become even greater with polishing and the correct tweaks.
Also i look forwards to more races and ingame content being implemented like higher difficulty and custom races.

• Should you buy it ? If you are a fan of the series i would say this is a must have. And buying into it right now you can give the developers feedback and help influence the game into becoming something great. 
• Would i buy the game again ? Yes most deffinatly i would, even in early access.

To share some of the issues, I was playing Psilons and my neighbors were humans, I had completed the tech tree and holds 445 votes, enough to vote myself in to finish the game, they were number two and had 76 votes, their best ship was a crusier, I am fielding doom star, titan, battleships...etc, so what do they do? Hey Psilon, give us this system or else, I said...hell no, so they declare war!!  Really?

So why do I have 445 votes and am so much more advance compare to them?   Well, cause they wont expand.  There were 3 computer players left , human holds 5 systems, and the other two has 2 systems each...  We were playing on default mode, circular galaxy, so there were literally 30+ systems that were vacant, but they never bother to expand.  I was holding on to about 10 systems, the galaxy is a big place,  but if they wont expand and wont develop new tech, probably slow development due to not expanding in the first place, the only way I can see a player losing is to do exactly the same, and just send scout ships to map the universe and never expand beyond the first world.

I know it is Early Access, but at this point I would say the game isn't really playable, at least not in a war game sense of playable.  I am not saying hey just make it impossible and auto spawn fleets for AI and ignore command points like Moo1 does, but tuning the AI a few notches just so that a NORMAL game would feel normal.

I found that my tech rate was outstripping my ability upgrade battleships - most of my cruisers (and smaller ships) were quite capable and easily maintained with every upgrade.  The battleships not so much and I didn't even get a single titan built - started several, but I won by having the votes due to my population being about 3-4x higher than the computer players.  I may have coerced all the other players to vote for me with a yearly annuity of 20 BC (except the #2 sized player).

It is a brilliant game that has stood the test of time.  Do not purchase or judge this game out of nostalgia or unrealistic hopes this game will be exactly like Master of Orion II.

This game, in its Early Access stage, is pretty good.  Yes, there are several mechanics that are not fully implemented, and yes diplomacy still need quite a bit of work.  However, if you are wanting to buy an Early Access product, you shouldn't really expect it to be completely polished.

As for myself, I already quite like this game as it is.  The design is pretty neat.  The learning curve isn't steep.  And it's really a game that I find myself drawn into.  I've owned the game for only a few days and have already put in over 20 hours.  I even experienced the ""one more turn"" syndrom... a pleasure that I haven't experienced in a good long while.

+ The ship design allows you transform ships to fit different roles. Although there are 5 ships models right now, you can create roles like support, bomber, long range, scanner, carrier, etc. with all the ship supplements that are available.
+ The GNN to inform the state of the galaxy is a great addition.
+ It’s visually ok, not mind blowing. Sounds on the other hand are great and it seems that a lot of effort was made with the voice acting that it has.
+ Real time battles are great with the addition to pause and still be able to give orders like old MOO’s.
- Diplomacy could have it fixes, I’m thinking of a robust, well-explained diplomacy interface like the Total War series. Diplomatic Victory also feels weirds.
- Even at war with the AI, it didn’t seem too aggressive nor building a large fleet.
- Racial traits are shallow right now but developers already said that they are working on fixing them to make them feel more unique.

Overall it feels more like a demo than an Early Access due to the fact that feels and is a very stable version. It has its bugs and glitches but nothing game-breaking. Is it MOO2?

298050,21574068,76561198006316027,0,1,2922,0,984,1511449488,"Quick summary:
Master of Orion is a game that I really think will be fun with more development, but currently is not really complete or polished enough to enjoy for a long time.

Good points:
The faction leaders and assistants have great animation and voice acting. Related to this fact, the diplomacy backdrop screens are a blast.

The starmap is gorgeous and I was surprised at the amount of polish it got. In terms of interface, it feels like a hybrid between MOO1 and MOO2 in that it has systems and planets and moons and asteroids (like MOO2) but maintains a simple interface that allows me to easily see what's on the map without having to click through menus (like MOO1).

Spaceships are neat looking and space combat looks pretty cool. 

Fun races, overall a classically zany feeling to everything.

I like the UI and think it was pretty well designed.

Bad points:
The technology tree is currently pretty messed up. You achieve a new technology like every 5 turns but most of them don't feel like they make a difference. Many just unlock a building type which has to be propagated over your empire for a million turns before you see the benefit, and in general I feel like the real bottleneck in getting to cool things is always production (making research pretty unattractive, since there's no point in unlocking another thing when you won't be able to capitalize it for 500 turns). There also doesn't really seem to be any reason to strategically cherrypick your way through the tech tree either; with a few exceptions the best approach is just to research everything in the current tier and then move on.

There are too many buildings, and the game encourages you to build all of them everywhere. What this results in is spending your midgame tediously making sure every one of your planets has a research lab and a biosphere and a hydroponics farm and a spaceport and a cloning facility and a marine barracks and a spaceport and a robotic miner and so on and you get the point so I'll stop listing all of the buildings in the game but believe me when I say that it keeps going on for quite some time. It all makes me wish that planets had a limited number of building slots so that I could just make a few smart choices per planet and move on.

It's not possible to make interesting diplomatic exchanges until you have convinced another empire to accept your embassy, which requires being friends with them. In an unfortunate catch-22, in order to become friends with an empire, you perform advanced diplomatic exchanges requiring an embassy. Some races even start with unfavorable relations with others and in these circumstances there's basically nothing to do except watch the AI refuse to let you establish an embassy until they ultimately declare war on you because you colonized a lot of planets. Obviously this is silly.

The real time tactical combat basically involves moving a big ball of ships at the enemy and hoping that you have more ships on your side.

There are a few other things but those are the big issues that come to mind right now, and I'm hopeful to see them ironed out before the release.",1456872540,1456872540,True,22,0,0.500620365142822266,0,True,False,True

We have simulate (auto-battle) if you dont have time to do every combat, I Really hope they will change it into turn based. because the current option is CINEMATIC and SIMULATION, seriously i see 0 reason for tactical, because it have notihng to do with TACTICS. Positioning is tactics, zoning is tactics, turtling is also tactics  but the depth of itit was butchered by Real Time approach. its like turning Street Fighter 2d fighting style into Tekken.

Other than that i have nothing to say because this an EA title, but thing that must be keep in check are
- No Espionage (to be implemented)
- Sometimes AI do some questionable action
- Managing Economy is somewhat too easy, CIV V is 20 times harder
- Theres is virtually 0 punishment for Aggresive Colonization other than constat bugging of pollution and/or pirates
- Ship design deletion will also ""delete"" the actual ship, i think the should change the shup name to <type> obsolete instead of delete the ship.
- Race leader is somewhat become MMO character that kept begging you to give them money CIV-style, please do something more interesting with diplomacy

The voice acting is superb, as might be expected from a cast which includes Mark Hamill, John de Lancie and Alan Tudyk.

Yes there are still missing features, and it could possibly do with better documentation and a tutorial but the game already feels like a finished product.

Positive:
Looks very pretty
High profile voice acting
Very stable build
Very few bugs
Comes with Master of Orion 1,2 and 3 (runs in Dos Box)

Of course I take a lot of things in the game for granted so I cannot list them as positive... they are supposed to be there.

Negative:
The introduction of Star Lanes might not be everyone's thing... I'd prefer the old system + fuel.
At this point the AI is fairly stupid, but this is subject to change according to the devs.
Technologies need to be more balanced (Missiles need ammo or a nerf), also future technologies do not make older tech cheaper and smaller.
Racial traits are very limited


Obviously the game is still in Early Access so a lot of things can change.
Also be aware that right now only 6 races are available and you cannot create a custom race yet.
There is no espionage in the game yet.
You also cannot change difficulty settings or the galaxy size (locked to medium for now) - you can chose between spiral and circular galaxy though.
Ground combat is only simulated - I hope there will be a proper one in the future.


Conclusion: Right now it's an easy going 4X game but lacks depth. 
Buy if you cannot wait for other similar games that are going to be released this year.
Otherwise wait a bit before getting it.

I played a vast amount of MoO2, and I've spent decades waiting for a worthy successor.  I've enjoyed many 4X space games, but all of them had something that made them not quite as engaging as the granddaddy of them all.  In that sense, it's nice to see the Psilons or the hapless Bulrathi back.

Unfortunately, in its current state, nostalgia is what the MoO reboot primarily offers.  The game plays essentially like MoO2 with some relatively minor gameplay changes.  The tech tree will be instantly recognizable to a MoO2 player, as will most elements of planet management, ship design, and overall strategy.  Real-time pauseable combat is new, but not terribly engaging, since most battles involve no more strategy than ""fly straight at the enemy and open fire"".

In theory, I'd like to say there's nothing wrong with a new MoO2 updated to modern graphics.  But the reality is, as much as prior 4X games might not have unseated MoO2 as the best of the breed, they've each done interesting things.  Endless Space had neat unique planets plugged into a complex backstory, GalCiv III had complex ship design and a more strategic feel, and I was even a fan of MoO3's planet habitability and client species spontaneously colonizing your worlds.  You'd hope that the MoO reboot would incorporate some of the positive developments of the last 20 years without losing what made the original game great.  Unfortunately, at least in its current version, there's not much more game than we had in the 90s.  So at the moment I find myself hopeful that there's a lot more coming in Early Access than what we've seen right now.

TL;DR: A gentle recommendation for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, wait to see how Early Access comes out.",1456842055,1456842055,True,33,1,0.547667801380157471,0,True,False,True

A very polished EA game that, from my understanding, is going to be fully released by the end of the year or early next year. That being said there are still some things that need to be worked on, but overall I think this game is pretty solid. 

Pros: 

+Minimal UI that doesn't omit important info
+Decent graphics that are very pleasing to the eye
+Ship design isn't overwhelming like most other space 4x games
+AI isn't completely 'braindead' as in most 4x games
+Tech tree that has 'choices' within most of the mid-late game techs

Neutral:

Diplomacy is pretty standard for your 4x game.
Ship combat is in RTS form, but isn't very strategic. Usually boils down quantity and power. 
Exploration is also standard for a 4x game.

Negative:

- Several graphical glitches, but nothing too major
- Lack of options when setting up a game
- Lack of races (but that's going to be remedied soon)
- Silly map creations. Had a couple maps where the only wormholes on the map were bordering systems...

Overall the game is fun and is only going to get better with further development.",1456839864,1456839864,True,14,1,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,True

Excellent updated Graphics.
Real time strategy unlike turn based combat. 
Starlanes provide a tactical choke point if u plan your space factory military outposts accordingly. 
Background to races and racial traits make game interesting.
Nostalgic feeling whilst playing like MOO2.
Fleet control is excellent.
custom ship building has an excellent layout and is understandable.
Colony screen and other information tabs are in good nick.
Still in Early access development phase, game looks promising. Some features such as spying is missing.

Cons-
No spying window or agents yet. Will be implemmented. 
The game as stated prior is still in early access but this is what I found.
Each race should have a different government system like in MOO2. Like how in MOO2 the Sakraa had feudalism and Klackon Unification. Colony leaders and ship captains would be an added bonus.
The AI needs to be worked on I understand its still being worked on.
In the colony screen it would be nice to be able to select more than one citizen. And more than one building in the production queue. 
A gigantic map size would be good, some notable races like the trillarians MOO2 and others from MOO3 would be an added bonus. 
The freighter system in MOO2 was excellent, unlike every time now u must create a transport nodule and wait over 8 turns to transport 1 population to a distant planet. 

Overall- 8/10 just a few tweaks needed, even in Early access stage well worth paying the price. It will become better :)",1456835321,1456835667,True,11,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
As a long time fan of the series, this is a VERY welcome reboot of the series. 

I've played several short games to get a feel for the game, have an ongoing multiplayer game going with a friend around turn 250, and have completed a large 6 race game with the Psilons achieving every tech (was gaining 3000 tech a turn by the end), 24 colonies, 519 population, 646k credits, 1.3 million conquest, 1.14 million excellence, claimed Orion for my own, and after all the other races declared war on me I wiped them off the face of the galaxy by turn 448. Around turn 300 I was already insanely powerful (power through great technology) and could almost vote myself the supreme leader, but chose not to.

It feels a lot like MOO2 with a lot of nice new UI features like improved menus, empire management, game summary, etc. Below I'm going to say a lot of things to be aware of or cons to the game, but really the game has a lot going for it, namely it's a VERY good reboot of the game and while it's still missing a lot, it has placeholders to show it plans on implimenting everything we'd expect and then some. 

I kinda miss the old MOO2 theme music (listening to it right now while writing the reivew), but I like the new soundtrack as well. Graphics are what you're epxect out of a game these days. The game feels a lot like the things I love about MOO. There are a lot of cool newer features like improvements to notifications, but I wish they could add a little bit of customization to them. Also really like the space factories element to the game. Just learned a new feature, if you goto the summary screen you can litterly got back to any turn in the past. You can click on the timeline graph and go back to a previous turn which means the save game remembers EVERYTHING that happened in every turn.


Things to be aware of with early access:
A lot of systems are not yet or BARELY implimented. Mainly the space combat (just hit simulate because tactical is poop atm), spying, dimplomacy in general needs to be improved, racial traits, AI difficulties, starting tech levels, ship customization (it's there but missing a lot of it's expected depth), half of the planned races, and everyon's favorite: custom race. A lot of the tooltips in the game are not very clear what those things do or even if they are fully implimented right now. The tech tree is flushed out but the UI needs some polish.

There are various minor weird UI bugs including hangs and the occasional crash. Thankfully the game autosaves every turn. There are some pretty annoying bugs for example the game insists that Neutron Blaster is stronger than the Mass Driver). 

Multiplayer works, but can be a little weird when you are loading a previous multiplayer game. Also the invite friends feature doesn't work, your friends just need to join your game.

The voice acting is good, but sitll needs work, obviously that's finishing polish stuff for launch. A lot of times the text of what the voice acting is supposed to be saying doesn't match what is said likely only part of the script has been recorded / integrated or they want to limit the download for early access. Some of the characters you start to just hate how they talk to you (unless you're overwhelmingly powerful then they cower and lick your boots which actually is kinda awesome). Overall how the races react to you can largely be improved.


Cons:
No Elarians planned for launch. The Elarians smell like expansion fodder. No Gnolmans or Trilarians either, but no great loss there. Don't like that they are tying a ""new"" alternate human / pirate faction to the collectors edition but honestly, who cares since if you buy it now you're getting the ""collectors edition"" at like normal release price.

It's REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING when picking a race and trying to read the racial traits having to listen to the narrator. 

Also I miss the old feature where if there was nothing notable happening (everything is queued up etc) then the turn auto passes to the next turn. I wish they would allow me to customize my auto build order.

There seems to be a lot less planets per solar system from what I remember from older MOO games. I wish there where more planets. Also I miss the inter-solar system colonization vs colonly ship. Maybe it's something that's less important since everyone is post warp. If they add in pre-warp age that becomes more important.


Summary:
I might be a fan boy of the series, but it seems pretty damn good for early access and I'm glad they did do early access so I can give my feedback. If you've apprehensive about the game, wait closer to launch. I know I will probably binge on the game for a while then dial back until patches come out and try out the new features.",1456818343,1456822090,True,172,3,0.782762646675109863,0,True,False,True

Other parts are implemented, but unfinished. Combat is currently playable, but has the hallmarks of a placeholder that will be barely recongizable at release. Many planet discriptions and technologies are likewise placeholders that are likely to be changed.

Initial impressions: I like how this beta felt pretty polished from the beginning. They have a great base game the feels like the old masters of orion. The system is easy to follow, A lot of the old research technologies were there. I would have liked to see some more tech however. I felt it was a good start of a tech tree, however playing different races didn't feel different. Asside from the ships looking different, that was about it.  As of this writing I have only played psilon and humans. 

What I would like to see improve: Ship combat in this game is kinda weak. I didn't feel there was much strategy to it other than ship priority. The real time combat system made it feel like picking priority targets was pretty much all you could do. I miss the turn based combat myself. The models look amazing though!

I haven't read what the developers are going to do yet, and what hasn't been implemented. Some things I never found like spying for example. I felt the diplomacy section was a bit lacking as I couldn't select some colonies or techs.

as it stand now i recommend the game.the gfx are very nice and the things u can do man lol its awesome
the ai is smart enough to give u some challange but once u get a big fleet your unstopable.but before u think its a game breaker read on.

right now theirs is only 1 AI difficulty its a early access so dont think avrything is perfect they are still working on it and they do listen to the community.my first 3 battle we hardcore as i did not know what to do but i as long u research millitary and starbase fast you will be fine.
the only thing i find bad about this game is that their is not alot of option right now to costamise your maps.

so i say if u like 4X game this is one of the best so far beats civ5 by far for me anyway
gfx are nice
AI is awesome
Voice acting is awesome
GNN with event ON is cool they do pop up alot when u have event ON and they do warn you when a star will go supernova ect..
thec tree is well done i find all the things i research quite usefull
The battle are nice u can control your ship or let them play out on auto but the battles i love them lol

thats about it what i think of the game so i hope it helps you to choose to buy it or not.
like i said if u like 4X game i am pretty sure u will like that game its really well done and 1 more thing

Changing from turnbased combat to RTS is interesting once they implement the facing of weapons (pro's / cons to doing it).  I disagree with the way they created tech tree to resemble the CIV 4/5 style of teching.  I loved the MOO2 version which made for harsh decisions when going up the tech tree.  There were a lot of critical decision making as far as tech is concerned in MOO2, not so much in this version of the game in which you can tech it all eventually (the choices for certain tech seemed inconsequential because one side of the tech is usually better than the other).

Only the colony screen is like the old one. The fights are realtime, which makes the ship design and tactical combat kind of useless.
the starlane system would be okay, if noone would be able to fly through the whole galaxy from the beginning. (Fuel systematics missing)

This game is cool! But is more like a better Moo3 not a real remake. And Moo3 was not a real Master of Orion anymore. I also liked it but in a total other way.
The Diplomacy is more like civilization tradeing.. so at least the nice diplomacy system from moo3 could have stayed or?

I cannot give a like for this as a oldscool Master of Orion Fan I really miss the Turn Based tactical Combats.
I will still play this as a new Master of Orion 3, but it cannot replace Moo2 for me,.

They tried but failed, hopefulley they will at least change how the combat works, then i might change my review.

For starters combat is basic.... too basic. you can only set formation and your special items like boost or jumping. all your guns and missiles are on auto. Ground combat.... what ground combat? there is none. yes its like 1 where you can bomb, biological attack or invade. but when your troop transports can only make like 1 and thats it. thats pointless. This game has star lanes and some can't let you go anywhere because its unstable unless you get the tech. I liked the 1+2 where it will tell you how far you can go depending on your fuel cell type. The 500 turn limit. yes 500 turns and thats it.... that needs to go. As usual everyone hates you so diplomacy is bad. For example i was part of an alliance and the lizard race demanded i gave him 6 systems for no reason. no negotiation for it. so its off to war with him.  You can't demand peace or peace with another race in an alliance so thats pointless.  voting for council is just bad. i literally cheated and had top tier stuff and everyone abstain their votes. so i gave them all tech just to see what will happen. and they still abstain their vote. Ship building is ok, but I do not understand why if you upgrade something like if you designed a carrier with crud load of fighters, and bombers it will throw your design to the curb to put 100 laser cannons.  Espionage.... what spies??? there is none. but you have to research it???? Speaking of research this I don't understand. Why would a fusion beam and fusion bomb be seperated? Does someone invent the fusion beam but can't make a bomb or visaversa??? just put them like rest of the research. ON top of that fusion beam does less damage than laser but its a higher tier??!?!?!?!   its nice to see the planet being active with your buildings and all, but it could be better if I was in a same system with multiple planet colonies and jump from planet to planet. not system to the next system and back. wouldn't it make more sense to go to next planet and not the next system with the buttons on the bottom

There are some good parts 

Its in early stage so there is a lot of room for improvement

Ships look a lot better and if they can put more ships in the ship design for certain classes. and if you just stick with high dps, at least upgrade gives you the best dps, with some tweeking...

the research is easier to follow on the tech tree, and can plan where you want to go with research. similar to endless space

The UI is better from 3 and similar to 2 with a more 2010 look. 

Landing of the colony ship is cool, sometimes buggy b/c it will say your systems on the side. othertimes... nothing. plus it has the same sound effect from 1 i believe.

- Ability to focus a planet on a certain task weather it be food or production or science
- UI is east to undertand and use
- Easy to pick up and play for newcommers to the 4x games

CONS:
- The tactical screen doesnt really provide any real benefits to combat
- Plant management where you sell buildings is a pain
- GNN bots are so annoying (thank goodness for the baility to turn them off)
- Planets with specials dont seem to have a large impact/ need to make that more important to get good plants (research & tech wise)
- All races feel much to simlar (I find this wiht Civ V as well so lets hope it gets changed)
- Ship customization needs more of an impact on combat
- No unit XP system, there is no care for any speicif units, if oen dies, ""ooh well, ill build another""
- No ""hero"" units of any kind, again makes the races feel very similar

Over all I would give the game a solid 7/10, its great, plays well, and is overall a great time. That being said there is a lot fo room for improvement and I think if wargaming listens to their community this game could easily draw par or even surpass the Civ franchise.",1456791279,1456791279,True,19,1,0,0,True,False,True

The major complaint about this game so far is that it is too easy. Can't say I'm really surprised about that for an early access game however.

As for the main gripe I read about the 500 turn limit, I suspect this will go away since this release of the game (as of Feb 27th 2016) is the earliest release.

I recommend this game, not highly, but just plain recommend it.  I do see how they were trying to stay true to some aspects of Master of Orion 2 (MOO2) but other parts of it feel lacking.  Considering all they have to do is take MOO2, update the graphics and sounds, and CHANGE NOTHING ELSE to get an amazing game, I'm surprised nobody has done this...

After the crap that was given to us as MOO3 I had wrote off the Master of Orion series, thinking that MOO2 would just be a legendary game that other 4x titles would aspire to reach.

Pros:
- Graphics are impressive
- Voice Acting is very very impressive
- Races have personality
- UI is efficient and unobtrusive while still providing everything you need
- Mrrshan's never looked and sounded so... good!

Cons:
- Diplomacy is... dumb... No point in actually doing it now except to hear some of the excellent Voice Acting!
- No custom races... yet?
- Racial traits feel very underpowered, traits provide such a small bonus that it doesn't really matter who you pick
- Ship design is extremely limited (See suggestions below)
- Taxes are problematic in large empires pick +1BC per citizen and you don't make enough, but everyone is happy, pick +2 and make WAY to much, but some population goes on strike.  Needs more tweaking.
- Tech tree feels small compared to MOO2
- What happened to fleet and colony leaders?
- Space Monsters are borked... I took down the Space Eel with one Destroyer and one Frigate with about a fifth of it's Offensive rating.

Suggestions:
I am sure most of these have been suggested by others and I will be posting about these in other forums on the MOO website in hopes of being heard or at least considered.

Custom Races with meaningful racial traits
- This isn't a suggestion, this is a requirement.

Fleet and/or Planetary Leaders
- In M002, were they very powerful? Yes.  Too powerful?  Maybe.  Still, they added something more to the game

Ship design choices
- Why can't I put more than 2 specials or 2 weapons on a frigate?  Why can I put 4 Augmented engines on one ship?  How come I can't put on the Point Defense mod with autofire and continuous Fire?  Various other weird decisions were made regarding this, but I suspect this will change since it is still Early Access.

Miniaturization
- I miss this, it is what made using some of those old technologies over new ones actually preferable in many situations.  Maybe I want to fit 3000 Plasma cannons onto a Doom Star to blow out my old Sound Blaster 16 card like I used to.

Weapons are bland
- Some weapon choices are odd, but I don't like it that I can replace 10 Lasers with 10 Neutron Blasters for the exact same size cost.

Combat needs a huge overhaul
- MOO2 was turn based, we want turn-based at least as an option.  I kind of understand why many games don't do turn-based combat because it is very very easy to exploit AI weaknesses.  Also, why can't I retreat?

Space lanes?
- Seriously... wtf...  you used to be limited based on the range of your fuel cells, but now you can go EVERYWHERE from turn 1.  M002 didn't have space lanes, you could go from any system to any other system in range, seriously, this has to go...

Overall, I give this game many more negatives than positives, but I see where they are putting effort into it and seem to be trying to stay true to classic MOO elements so I'm excited to see where they will take this game in the future.",1456776656,1456776656,True,8,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The ships are neat, the buildings are neat.  The way you can block warp gates with military sations is really cool.

My only complaint is the thing that MOO2 does better than any other similar game out there (including this one):
   In MOO2 you could go to the settings and turn off the end of turn wait.  This way you could essentially fast forward your long construction times and research times.  You can't do that in any modern game because your system has to process enemy turns.  In modern games, the enemy turns take a few seconds to process.  This really slows the pace down...  This game combats that by shortening build times and research times.  (Research now usually takes between 4-8 turns).

Also, I would much have preferred turn based ship combat...  

All in all, though I won't put in the kind of hours on this game as I did MOO2, it's a solid buy (Though I would really put it's worth at $20 right now.  $49 is overpriced IMO).

Ship Combat:  There is no function for it right now.  It is only a passive viewing of the battle.  I'm sure this is being worked on since this is a large part of what MOO was about.  As a plus, the cinematics looks beautiful.

Diplomacy:  I actually agree with most of the criticism.  It is very one dimensional at the moment.  Even MOO 1 had a much more sophisiticated diplomatic feel.

This is a solid, albeit lightweight 4x game. The learning curve is straight forward for both seasoned players and new alike.
Being this is a direct sequel to the MoO universe, it will no doubt bring a lot of heat as there are key changes to the formula (non turn based combat) for example.
However I really like the combat...the cinematic camera is a great idea but dear God it needs some work...and I think the blend of real time and turn based is a great step forward.

The price point is far too high imho, despite it including other games in the bundle. It is very well polished for early access and although it is worth the money for die hard fans of the genre, knock a tenner off the price and get more people playing it.

I did give Master of Orion I a shot around then as well... and I had pre-ordered Master of Orion III and gotten my disappointment just as quickly as I possibly could have.

That being said, as I see it, Master of Orion is a worthy successor to the franchise. The game-play feels almost nostalgic in a lot of ways. The updated graphics really lend to the overall universe and flesh it out even more than before. It feels like an immersive experience, just like Master of Orion II did. It will pull you in and hold you for the next turn... that turns to 100 turns...

I have to say it has been more than what I had hoped. The Early Access was more than a fair deal for the price (and I really rarely do early access at all) and the features aren't as limited as other early access games I have seen.

I look forward to posting on the community boards as the dev team said they would be interacting with players regularly for feedback and to possibly implement changes. 

The few things I have found missing (I've got about 200+ turns and a boatload of tech research under my belt. I have found Orion and made first contact with half of the AI):
1. Governors and specialists for hire to assign to colonies
 - I didn't think they were all that necessary until you don't have them... and sometimes they really gave an edge. Not    really central to the game, but a great mechanic.
 - Psilon research: At times, you have to choose what tech is granted with the research. This may have been a way to try to balance the races a bit. Classically, Psilons did not have to choose what advance to gain from a tech, no matter what the tech might be. 

Things implemented that were kinda neat:
- Pirate colonies that had varying levels of ships coming at you (easy at first and getting harder as time goes on)
- Unstable warp gates (impassable until you could research the appropriate tech)
- Unique ship designs (thank you so much for Psilon Saucers)
- Amazing voice acting
and many more features...

Definitely get it. Try it. Make your loved ones miss you as you disappear into the galaxy. Victory is always just a few turns away...

May update the review as time goes on... I look forward to the rest of the game coming... and being Master of Orion.

Edit 2/29/16:
After a couple of play-throughs (one as Psilon and another as Sakkra), I wanted to amend the review I had put up.
- The graphics are great. On my machine, the graphics detect did not work, so that feature may not yet be available. 
- Micromanagement AI could be a little better using auto-build/colony focus. I find it building some buildings that are odd at the time (ie. Marine Barracks while not even close to war-time or food buildings whenever there is a surplus instead of productivity buildings)
- Combat is really nice. Real time combat vs Turn based was a surprise, but not bad. Managing combat can be tricky, however, if you do not make use of the pause button.
- Some bugs are very apparent in the game. I have had to submit several bug reports in a single play session.
- The beginning star system seems to have a planet and a gas giant. Always. Seems like a big bug to me...

I am a bit torn about the game in its current state.
It looks nice and has a streamlined interface and plays fluidly, also it has not crashed on me so far.

On the other hand currently it is just too easy, yes opposing powers declare war on you but that is all they do, they do not even attempt to attack, and if you do a counterstrike after just one fallen system they call for a truce.
Also as son as you developed the cruiser you will win every spacebattle as it seems no matter how long you play the AI never builds anything stronger then destroyers, and a shielded cruiser kills tons of destroyers without even breaking a sweat. So with 2-3 ships you wipe out the enemy spacefleet of 20-30 small ships in one battle and thats it for them. 
I played MOO and MOO2 just recently and there if someone declares war, on the next turn they turn up with a spacefleet on your doorstep.


Also it does not really seam to make a difference if you specialize your planets as over time you can build everything you have on every planet. And the planet overview is terrible there need to be a list what you have built and not only a planet you have to scroll around and search to find your installations, even if you can build all some buildings make it easier to build others so it would be nice to see that, because after you own 10-20 planets you just loose the overview what you are building.
Same with the research tree, apart from the few times when you have to choose what to build after you complete a research there is no problem researching everything there is.

Diplomacy is hardly implemented right now, and really is not needed as you can pound the AI into the ground as soon as you get cruisers, and the AI wont attack you anyway. Same for the councilmeetings, most of the time all the parties withhold their votes, and even if there is an alliance you are so strong that you have more votes then the 2 together. Not sure if it is intended or a bug, but the AI seems to lie on a few times I had 2 or 3 parties who vowed to vote for me and when the meeting came they either withheld or voted for the other candidate. 

The worst of all are the GNN news updates, the robot does not only look annoying he also sounds like a C64 doing some text to voice. That is too bad as some of the ticker news are quite funny (if not relevant to the game itself).

A bright spot is that the original MOO are included if you do not have them already.

If there were a neutral vote I would give it for now.
But considering the price and the dumbed down AI I will give it a thumbs down for now.

* Tactical combat is pointless and slow and not fun.  Just simulate it, you'll save yourself 10 minutes per fight
* The AI is sort of stupid, especially when it comes to diplomacy.  It got to the point where I could just ask other races to give me planets, and they would.  That seems like a thing that should almost never work.
* Research tree felt a little shallow.  Nothing in the way of domestic skills (different government types, for example), just lots of more or less sequential upgrades to ships/buildings

After spending some hour in this game I can tell that it's, well, not bad. Unfinished, of cource, with a lot of empty spaces, but pretty and not hardcore as the MoO3. 

The game itself - pretty and stable.
The real-time combat actually can be tactical - I killed some enemy vessels with my rocket ship without taking fire. 
The ship building is not ""dumb"" it's just designed simpler for the today's tablet-users: instead empty hull player receive some slots for different equipment - shield, armor, electronics and weapons. So he can't miss something valuable. All other seems the same - set some devices and fill the rest space by weapons.

To buy or not to buy - that is the question. 
Game is an early access, which is a lottery with a high chances to fail. There is a lot of abadonware this days. But the Wargaming is a good company, after all, and you will receive all previous MoO games, if you don't have them already. But now they are on steam and working,

You are buying into a testing phase of the game. It is not finished. It is not polished. It is filled with bugs and placeholder art.

But the gameplay is good. Really good. It brings me back to the old games. They changed up the gameplay from the originals to have star lanes. These limit the direction you can travel to reach star systems, which means you can create choke-points for your territory. This adds an interesting element to it.

I'm looking at this game to have pretty good multiplayer games. I'm also excited for each update of the game before release to see how it progresses.

the pros:

- Game is already very stable. 0 crashes for me
- Interface is superb. Very intuitive and clean. Best user interface of any 4x game imo.

the cons:

- space combat. arguably the best part of master of orion2, and they screwed that up.

Currently the game is pretty stable and only crashed a few times when messing with ship designs. Other than that the game stays pretty faithful to the original. Not everything is in the game currently but appears to be coming along nicely. The AI currently is extremely easy. I hope that they add more difficulties to the game.

This game is like a love child of all 3. It has the classic MOO2 feel, with the modern day mechanics that the other 2 have brought us.

This is the game that MOO3 should have been all those years ago (still to this day the only game I've ever returned).

The voice acting is top notch (and if you take a look at the cast, you'll see why!).
The graphics are crisp, the interface is intuitive.
The tactical battle introductions are amazing, however the battles themselves are pretty much pre-calculated (IE, it's pretty obvious who will win). One feature from SWEOW they carry over is the cinematic view of the space battles, love it!

For an early access game, it is incredibly bug free. There are some very minor bugs I've hit, but they're not game crashing by any means and easy to get around.

The only other complaint I have is that there aren't more leaders, and one of the key features (custom race) is not yet available. Once the game fills out more, this will be right up there with Civ 5 as one of the best games I've ever played.

I've played MoO and MoO2 for the same 20 years that I imagine most fans have played it. When GoG made it available, it is one of those moments when the clouds parted and a ray of sunshine definitely showed through. I think the best thing we can all say about MoO3 is to not talk about it, except for the lessons about detail and colony management that were probably taken into account with this edition.

Die-hards already know alot of the changes: new in-depth and awesome backstories for each fo the races, updated visuals that are beyond words awesome, clean crisp interface that combines the simplicty of MoO with the needs of MoO2. But the new is also means starlanes, no turn by turn tactical combat (yet?), race characteristics tweakability not what we're used to and a few other limitations. 

It's so clear that the team put so much love into this and that early access is where we the fans get to provide input now that if only we could have done with MoO3 could've changed our feelings from disdain to reverence. This MoO is beautiful, sounds like the original with updated music, and the visual RTS tactical combat made me swear up and down when I didn't do it in tactical when my major Psilon fleet went up again the Bulrathe (and lost of course).

It's not meant to be a clone of the originals. We can play those anytime we want now. But as a long-time fan, EA is worth it to see it, play it, and give suggestions on how to improve it.

If the developers put some manhours into this thing it can be great, right now it's just good - and in alpha of course.

The gameplay right now is fine and I haven't noticed any bugs - This is a pleasant surprise. The galaxy map is set up to pen you in and make you wait for technologies or fight your way out, Read starlanes, dead ends, unstable / unusable starlanes and space bases that block passage unless you have open borders. Conversely you can use these features of the game to quickly pen an opponent in to a small area and keep them weak.  

The tech tree and planetary screens are easy to understand and use, although there is a weird quirk in the tech tree: Some technologies you research have two different upgrades on them but by reasearching the tech you only get to pick one of the upgrades, the other is forever excluded from you. Perhaps they intend you to get them through espionage or maybe it's just supposed to make everybody's tech a little different. Either way it's weird but interesting and I'll have to see how I like it after a while.  Upgrading ships is easy, a single click upgrades the design with the latest goodies and a single click upgrades existing ships that are in orbit of a planet you own.

By far my biggest complaint is just the visual appeal of the game. It's absolutely awful. Everything is black and dark and two dimensional. Yes space is black but space is also amazingly colorful and beutiful. For god's sake wargaming, choose the colorful and beautiful, not the black; for example you can click on your planet to get an overall view of what it's doing, guess what, 4/5ths of your planet is covered in night (facepalm). And get rid of the two dimensional feel! For example, you can click on buildings on your planet, like a marine barracks and all that happens is a small tooltip comes up with a crappy two dimensional image of the barracks and a paragraph about what it does. How about bringing me to a 3 dimensional barracks with soldiers and tanks running around and letting me look inside multiple buildings and talk to advisors in those buildings? This game has too much potential to be so visually and auditorilly boring that people may not be able to sit through 100 turns.

I still recommend the game but beware of the boredom if you like your games to give you a feast for your eyes and ears.",1456701702,1456701702,True,10,0,0.499536603689193726,0,True,False,True

Good:
- It feels like MOO.... the look and feel, the layout, the menus all have the right flavor
- It has the one more turn feeling
- The tech tree and buildings feel like the original

Areas for improvement
- Combat. Personally I liked the chess game format of MOO2 and designing ships with this in mind. Not as fond of this combat format as I don't feel I have as much influence on the outcome.
- Ship designs. Related to above I am not sure if I can see how my designs can effect the outcome apart from maximising stats. Feels alot like GalCiv as a result.

The Races are interesting and the voice acting and music are unique and enjoyable to listen to. The artwork is beatiful from the universe map to the colonizing video makes you have the extraterrestrial feel when colonizing a new planet (especially when you are the Psilons, I think that is how you spell them.)

The one thing I think a lot of people need to understand is this isn't a MOO2 remake. Do not buy this game thinking that they are simply going to remake that game with new graphics. You are going to be disappointed. I do get annoyed when people make a lot of assumptions about games and then get all upset when they find out it isn't the clone of what they expected or they have this nostalgic viewpoint of a game, I call that the spoiled brat syndrome.

However I will say the game is simplified in comparison to the older installments and currently there is only 6 races to choose from. I am hoping that the AI is improved quite a bit and the races become more unique in the way they play in the game. I am hoping for more universe based events in the game.

Pros:
- The game is stable I have not crashed once it plays really smoothly.
- Great voice acting from famous Sci Fi actors.
- Artwork music and general feel of the game is fantastic.
- If you have played modern 4X games before you will easily be able to get right in and play this game.
- Planets are unique, terraforming is a lot of fun especially making a gas giants into a huge livable terran world :)
- The Tech tree is interesting and it is great that they have the option to auto upgrade your ship designs when new tech gets researched, allowing more casual players to enjoy the game.
- I have never laughed so much in a space turn based game when the galactic news reported the end of my population growth event.

Cons:
- AI needs work, the different race need to work in a more racial way. For example the military races should not be more technologically advanced than the scientific races etc. 
- Diplomacy needs work, I played the space bears and the only race I could form an alliance with was the humans. No matter what I did the other races viewpoint of my race wouldnt go up. (I may have just not be doing something right)
- I think the Tech tree and ship design needs to be more complicated to make it interesting to experienced MOO fans.
- More events and havestable areas for your builders (they can only build very few things, hopefully more options become available.)
- The battle map needs work, ships phasing through asteroids just breaks the immersion for me and a little bit of control during battle would be nice.
- Diplomatic victory is way to easy, all you have to do is have the majority of votes which you can pay off the other races which for me costs 1500 per race. I was actually shocked when the game ended. I thought you would have certain powers to manipulate the galactic community. :-/

In conclusion currently MOO is a very stable early access game! A great ground structure to build a interesting and modern installment to the MOO franchise. I can see a lot of place holders throughout the game and certain victory conditions have not been fully fleshed out. They do have a lot of work to do but even though the cost of the game is high I have enjoyed playing the game and supporting the developers.

Full Review:
(Disclaimer: I barely played the original games, so this review will not compare this game to the previous entries in the series. It is being reviewed solely on its own merits.)

I had been looking forward to this release for some time. I love 4X games (and strategy games in general), and several friends told me that the original Master of Orion games (1 & 2) were among the best there is. So when I saw a new entry in the series was being developed, I thought this would be my chance to get in join the action. And I immediately picked up the EA version, because I was interested in seeing how the game grew and evolved as it was developed (The game development process has always fascinated me).

So far I have not been disappointed. The graphics are beautiful, the sound design is excellant, and the voice acting is superb, as one would expect given the quality of the voice acting talent in the game. While these aesthetic qualities are nice, the gameplay itself is also quite good. I like the decison to limit space travel to star lanes, as I think it lead to some interesting strategic choices (for example: do I expand to this high quality planet that is easily accessible to all including potential invaders? Or do I expand elsewhere and stay behind this easily defended choke point?). The tech tree is what I've come to expect from a 4X game, though I liked that some of the advances made you choose what the advance gave you. Again, it was a mechanic that allowed for interesting decisions.

That being said, there are a few points of concern that I have. The tactical space battles themselves, while defintely cool looking, felt limited, and not all that tactical (I do like the real-time with pause approach though). However, the developers have stated that this is something they are working on improving. Also, the opponent AI, particularly in matters of diploamcy, seems bit off. They drop in to Guarded or Hostile status way too easily, often for reasons as simple as rejecting a trade deal. Also, they opponents as a whole aren't too smart, and hence not too difficult. Again, the AI is something the developers have stated is a work in progress, so I assume as more difficulty levels are added, and the AI in general is improved, these won't be much of an issue anymore.

As the game currently stands, I enjoy it, and am looking forward to the further additions as EA progresses. It's a fun game, and as long as the developers keep up what they're doing it has the potential to be one of the greats.

Side note: Is it just me, or does it seem ironic that I won a diplomatic victory (as the Psilons) by buying votes from the leaders I wasn't at war with, while simultaneously blowing up Alkari planets (about 10 before the council session where I won) with my Doom Star?  Is it weird that there's no diplomatic penaly for this?",1456685104,1456685104,True,25,0,0.510226070880889893,0,True,False,True

- No difficulty selection avaliable and average difficulty is definately not for average player.
- Ship desing is quite limited compare to other 4x games.
- no tactical formations in the tactical fights.
- no leaders
- no spies ( at the moment but will be implemented)
- doesnt give the feeling of exploring big universe. 
- Planet specialization is  not needed. Just build all avaliable!
- Graphics are not spectacular nor so bad either. But they definately need to work on it.
- Star lanes and no range for the ships. So techincally you can travell all the map.

And that is a BIG difference.

This game MIGHT turn out sort of fun, but I really dont understand why we need another Gal Civ clone, when you actually could remake MOO...

In my oppinion MOO has four MAJOR advantages over ANY other 4x Space game and very little flaws.

1) Simplicity in the planet management - No buildings plz. Leave that to Civ and all the other space games. The ledger system was (and is still) quite unique.
2) Random tech lists - Somtimes you just get stuck with no planetary shields or the right tech to colonize. Have a good laugh, cross your fingers and hope for a miracle to happen.
3) Unique Fleets - We only needed room for more than 6 ship designs and a way to upgrade old ships to new designs.
4) Gigantic turn based space battles - How many legendary fights have you had where your repulsor beam held back waves of enemy ships, while your planetary missles ripped the enemy apart.

But you are not going to find all of that in this game. So thumps down from me.

Pluses -
The graphics are really good
the voice acting is excellent, they went out and got some real actors from some of your favorite Sci-Fi classics.
The cut scenes are well done.
Remarkably few glitches, nice and stable, at least on my machine.
UI is intutive and easy to learn.

Minuses-
Diplomacy needs work, I had a great deal of difficulty dealing with the alien races. Your Allies are quick to go sour on you, they don't make reasonable demands, For example you can be hammering an opponet in a war, be bombing their homeworld and they still will not accept a peace treaty, or even ask for one. If you turn them down for a bad treaty they propose you lose any headway you have made with them. The current system won't allow you counter an offer made by an AI Race. They all want the same thing if you are trying to deal with more than one AI race, and it is never a good deal for the player.

Ease of the game, at no time was I ever in danger of losing a game. There are no difficulty settings to challenge veteran players.
Don't like the GNN robots.
The aliens will never surrender, you must kill them all, have a population large enough to win the vote or go the full 500 turns. I know that other victory conditions are on the way, so I will revise this part as the developers impleament the changes",1456680908,1456680908,True,12,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

So in spite of my reservations I think this is fairly well done, some nostalgia and some changes but overall playable and enjoyable.

There is a noticable lack of depth in the tech tree which hopefully will change as a tech victory is enabled later on. There is a lack investment in the ship design, in Gal Civ3 & Star Drive 2 you  can spend lots of time in ship design and then cannot wait to try them out against an enemy, not so in this game.

If you b-line your research towards cruisers and build a few of them, by the turn ~100, you can start demanding colonies from AI. Just pick the weakest rival, ask for their colonies one at the time. They will accept. After that, skip a turn and do the same for second weakest rival. After 10 or so turns, all AI opponents have 1 colony left and you own the rest. There is absolutely 0 challenge in the game at the current stage. AI is fully passive and does not really take advantage of their tech or position. You can win the game in 150 turns with glass cannon strategy. 

Capturing the planets is ridiculously stupid. You need to build troop transports which magically vanish after you take a planet. That seems just an arbitrary rule to limit the speed of conquest. That's why it's easier to just diplomatically annex your enemies and bombard the hell out of the last colony instead of conquering with troop transports.

Game is so much dumbed down that for a player with years of experience in strategy games, there is nothing to be seen after you've heard all the voice acting. Even that the voice acting is done very well, it starts to repeat itself and you just skip all talking you can. There is no connection between you as a player, and the ""empire"" you're running.

Yes this is a Beta, benefit of doubt and all but I'm wondering how many of the shortcomings I see being resolved in 3 or 4 months since the flaws appear to be part of the overall plan.

I hate turn limits in 4X games. 

So here we go:

CONS:

1) A turn limit. Doesn't matter that it's a rather large 500, it's there and I hate turn limits, feels like board game I'd play with my 9 year old ""ok, we'll play 10 turns then back to homework"". WHY is there a turn limit??? Just kills the whole feeling of.. something, I dunno. 

2) Small number of systems on ""Large"" which in itself is ok I guess, but unfortunately each system only hold 1 or 2 planets. The game feels teeny tiny already. 

3) The Pathways to each system. I honestly don't get why game designers would opt for this route (no pun intended). It works in only 1 game series that I know of, ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" and that's because that game is so freaking stressful and fast that you need choke points from paths otherwise you'd go insane. But in a turn based open space game, it's a flaw to me.

And yes, people will argue that some of the earlier games we loved used paths to systems, still, today with current tech and the state of gaming and computer hardware an all that, it feels weak, like a crutch that the designers couldn't figure out how to overcome. 

4) Lack of rotating view (view angle, rotating clockwise/counterclockwise). Make it feels smallish again and rather outdated. If they at least let us alter the view a touch to get a sense on the galaxy from any direction or height level. A bit nitpicky, but I guess it irrites me a bit.

Pros:

1) Runs smooth at max detail (there isn't much detail so this is to be expected)

2) UI and gameplay is clean and jumps from location to location easily upon orders being needed in certain places.


Summary: Feels like a highly scaled back Sins of Solar Empire remake but with turns and without the 3D view and all the cool 3D fleets and effects and much less planetary building options. 

If you've never play another 4x space game before this will probably make you happy, but for someone who has played everything from MOO1 to Sins, to Stardrive1,2 to Distant Worlds universe, and a dozen or more recent titles that I can't even think of this second. 

Any game where I basically lose interest under and hour, doesn't bode well for me. I'm willing to stick it out until release, but I think the kicker and what set me off on writing this review is that dumb turn limit thing staring at me. Ugh.

I have played four full games versus AI with various parameters and I believe I have enough game time under my belt to do an intelligent early access review.  I am a long-time fan of the Master of Orion IP and I must have played hundreds of MOO2 games.

MOO is well polished considering it’s an early access title.  The game did not crash once and performance was excellent. There were no hiccups or glitches as far as I could tell.  There were some minor UI errors that caused some data to not display correctly and the game does not scale for various resolutions perfectly.  It’s a solid base for a game with excellent voice acting.  (Mark Hamill, John de Lancie, and Michael Dorn!)

Early access is missing a great deal of content including 5 races (6 if you count the missing custom race), two victory conditions, and certain game mechanics like spies and leaders.  Also you can currently only play on ‘average’ difficulty with a maximum of 6 total players and limited galaxy selections.  Games are quite easy to win if you’re a veteran 4x, turn-based player. 

As expected, there are no dedicated multiplayer servers, but multiplayer players of this genre tend to only play with close friends anyways so I don’t see this as a negative.  

Ship to ship combat is in real time and works well, but actions and choices are limited to fleet formation and movement.  Otherwise combat is quite automated.  This is a negative for those players that enjoyed the turn-based combat of MOO2.  Ground combat is very basic (well, non-existent) in the current build.  

Conclusion:  If you are a fan of the Master of Orion franchise and certain that you will buy the game no matter what, by all means purchase the collector’s edition. For those of you looking for a challenging, complete-game experience, you will want to wait until release.  Also there will be a version of the game offered for around $30 so if you’re really on the fence, wait for that.  In its current condition the early access game is appropriate for nostalgic, die-hard fans and players that have already decided to buy the game no matter what.

298050,21518882,76561198006427368,0,9,12723,0,1270,1483733463,"So even if I'm the umpteenth one here, I have to say this: I was a HUGE fan of the original Master of Orion 2. First one was a bit before my time, and I picked the second one a few years after it was out, and was absolutely hooked. So much so that I gave Master of Orion 3 more than its share of tries, alas all ending in utter defeat at the hands of bugs and bad gameplay decisions.

And..I am absolutely thrilled its descendent through the years is shaping out to be follow in MoO 2's footsteps! I don't know how, but even with this as of yet incomplete version they got the mixture right to keep up you clicking through the night (erm).

Now, what many of the reviewers seem to lose sight of is that this is its earliest iteration of early access yet! Many things are obviously not implemented yet - Spying, for instance. Or all 10 races, and race customization. I don't know that Pollution works either. Some placeholders here and there - such as Ground Combat. Etc etc.

To my mind it's obvious that many of the things which are not really working right now - such as Diplomacy, or combat AI, or colony management AI - are still in their test phase and extremely likely to be improved upon.

Why such optimism? Well, for one, remarkably, the game is polished to look and feel as if it were a finished product. I've not crashed once in about 20 hours of play, and I only ran into a few bugs, fewer of which were important in any way (antimissile rockets module doesn't seem to work, for instance, or maybe it just seemed so to me).

And it's good! Everything that looks firmly in place is amazingly good. Such as:
Colony management is perfect MoO. Classic, and superb. Research - Food - Production, and Credits. Small to Huge planets, Radiated to Gaia, Low to High gravity, Ultra poor to Abundant, and random resources (gold, fungus, etc) 

Space expansion, tried and true formula. Worm holes serve as bottlenecks, some of them are unmanageable until high end tech. It does allow you to treck further from the getgo than most 4X games, which I find to be a good thing. Space monsters. Pirate fleets (and bases). ""Anomalies"". RNG events (plagues, population booms etc). Orion and its Guardian! :)

The Tech Tree is..wow. As an example, Beam weapons upgrades never go ""+1 dmg"", ""+2 dmg"" etc - each successive variant is different in some way making it a choice - do I go with higher dmg ye olde Neutron Blaster, or do I pack in newfangled lesser dmg overloading Ion Cannon (the Mass Driver does seem too obvious a choice though). Some techs don't yet work (all the Spying tech, for instance) but that's just upcoming :)

Ship customization is sweet, and strikes a good balance between complexity and streamlining. Modules with all sorts of variants, various types of weapon mounts (6 types of Beams, 5 for Missiles).. it's good.

The one and only thing that does have me worried is Combat. Mostly because I feel like it should already be further along than it is. I don't really have an issue with it not being TBS - in MoO 2 the side who attacked and had 1st turn had a HUGE advantage over the defender - but it's kind of lackluster. The modules and weapon mounts are mostly passive, the battlemap doesn't offer much (there are some formations, and asteroids which can shield from weapon fire) but it's far too little yet. It needs more. Waiting for more.

It also tried for a few new ideas here and there, and I find no fault with any of them. Asteroid fields as a planet type, which can house Mine/Research Stations, and be made into planets. By a Worker unit a la the Civ Settler, which can do all sorts of things (mostly space lane turtling though :)) ). Choices between research results (from this researched tech do I take Fusion Beam or Fusion Bomb?) which also give Diplomacy more importance (since you can get the Tech you didn't choose via diplomatic swapping). Pollution which ruin your planet biome type. Etc.

One thing I left for the end because it really isn't that important for a Master of Orion game - IT'S BEAUTIFUL! It really is! Diplomacy meetings, GNN, space, ships, combat, colony screen (which features the world on the right, all bustling with scifi activity and ever more sprawling urban complexes). The clips played when you colonize a world (one for each world type) are a balm to the soul :))

I love the new system grid and warm holes. Great graphics for a strategy classic sequel.
The diplomacy is still broken, hope they improve until the launch.
What they fixed is that on MoO2 you were dependant on the luck to find a suitable planet at range to colonize, now it is easier to colonize barren, radiated and other kinds of planet. Plus, the military starts early. It is very good to know the fleet and mosnter strenght before combat. It should have a flee option on the simulate option on combat.
I finished the game twice by diplomatic victory. The late game was not that fun, an MoO2 problem too.
The AI should consider moving military ships to a system an hostile act and stop doing it unless it wants war, as it should ask if I want war when I do so.
MoO2 had special characters, it would be good if they use this on this one too.
Right now it is a great game, and every MoO1 and 2 should buy it.

Having played MoO and MoO 2 back when they first released, (ended up skipping 3) , its truly great to see this game updated.

Being an Early Access title, hopefully there will be more features added in. Its very playable as it is right now, and definately worth doing so!

One of the many  things I loved about MoO2 was the planet colonization sequence. Was a joy to see the colony craft landing on each new different type of planet, most of them so exotic and alien, at times made me wish i was was there. This newest edition takes the colonizing sequence to a new level. Beautifully rendered panoramic breathtaking cinimatic cut-scenes of your race's Colony ship descending from the atmosphere and camera pan flyby over mountains or into valleys, across lakes / oceans, through clouds, mist, or snow-storms to land in the perfect spot. Definately a ""Whoa!"" and pause to appreciate moment. I'm so glad they didn't skimp or cut-short this part of the game.

GNN is back and tongue-in-cheek with comedy. The GNN sequences still seem a bit rough, but this is early-access after all.

Galactic Council sequences has nicely been kept true to MoO 1 & 2, with a nice 3d facelift.

Love the ""Next Planet"" button, mind you it cycles through in the order of planets colonized. 

The Planet Screen this time around is an Orbital Space View, with the planet slowly rotating with the daytime on the left, median, and night-time on the right. As for the buildings - are 3d iconic representations placed randomly on the planet's surface (poping through the atmosphere and right ino space), larger than life much like you'd expect from the units representation in the Civilization game series. Kinda takes the realism away but gives you an idea what you have. The downside is for bulding management, you have to click and hold to rotate the planet and click on the structure to remove it (takes several tries to find the correct bulding if you can't recognize it). A quick fix to this could be added later - would also list the buildings you can scroll through.

Love the new updated ship graphics. Ship edit screen gives you a selection of hull paint patterns (no colors though). Your able to view and rotate the 3d models. 

The space combat is spectacular to watch. They added a new Cinematic Camera mode, lets you watch the combat much like it were a movie. Needs a little work, seems to randomly pick where to ""point and shoot"" including actual ""Smart Missle Camera viewfinder"" mode complete as you see in hollywood movies right up to the point of impact. Wish there were a few options to refine or pick / cycle / toggle the current camera selection. 

Only thing missing is the true-tactical turn based fleet combat mode. Hope it gets implimented. To be fair, having seen the new 3d ships and graphics, it was fun to watch the automatic RTS mode, as the battle is over in a few minutes - fast, flashy, guns blazing and ships go ""Boom!"", litle star fighters zipping around in formation,  kinda watching a space battle sequence from Babylon 5. Still, would be nice to have the option to have the turn-based hands on combat again, control your fleet - movements and weapons.

Doomstars!!! These are a sight to behold in space battle - quite massive and dwarfing most ships but at the same time they're not ""Moon sized"" planets either. Gone is the ""rounded borg cube"" type design. Instead, the pyramid design is a nice nod to Stargate SG-1 - Goa'uld warships, and dwarfs all the other ships. These bad-boys do give you the option to actually blow up the planet. Interestingly, there hasn't been any GNN newsbreaks about it either when a planet does get blown up (turns into asteroid field you can later reform into a new barren planet). There isn't any ""Planet-busting"" visual sequence either for now just a second attack button icon, maybe will be added later.

The voice acting and rendering of the species is really good. 

All in all, for an early-access title release, with only a handful of species available its definately worth playing.

Master of Orion is so far a playable game yet what is there is really sublime and demands to be expanded upon throughout its ongoing development.

Pros: (As of right now)
1. Nicely streamlined for newcomers and has the potential to become deeper.
2. The style of the graphics is really appealing.
3.Ship designer is cool.

Cons: (As of right now)
1. Not all the features such as races, victory conditions, espionage, and tactcal battles have been implemented yet.
2. Bugs that could potentially hamper the experience. 
3. The price tag  for the Collector's Edition. (It really is somewhat pricey).

All the familiar features are there; tech trees, colony ships, alien races, etc. However, what it does offer is streamlined play: everything that is implemented works smoothly, and a lot of the tedium of other 4X's seems swept away.  I actually liked it better than I liked GalCiv for the sheer scale of things it didn't make me manage. If you've got a friend you're trying to introduce gently to 4x's, this is the one: it's stable, brightly animated, and not as complex as most.

Things I'm hoping they'll fix before taking it out of early access are:

Diplomacy. Despite having spend full on effort in my second game trying to keep my diplomatic relationships positive (making treaties, giving in to demands, conducting myself in ways game lore might suggest would placate this species) my relationships with the AI's always ended up extremely negative. Also, once they went negative but I became mighty, there was no diplomatic option to bully them for specific planets or technologies as they had bullied me. Perhaps it's not implemented yet, but my one option to gain a concession from my enemies was to declare war and start stomping their worlds.

Pollution warnings. I kept getting these for the first world I colonized that got heavily polluted, even though that world wasn't polluted any longer. It was another world, but apparently because the pollution warning had locked on to the first polluted world, any pollution warnings anywhere got me a dialogue box that dragged me back to the first world. Annoying.

Coherent AI response to overwhelming force. I had such a technological edge by the end of the game that I could steamroll any of the other races. But nonetheless, two of them declared war on me, one when I outmatched her 5:1 and another when I outmatched him 8:1. They also never formed alliances against me, possibly because relationships default to bad so quickly they all hated each other.

Diverse voice messages. They hired good voice talent for the game, but unfortunately the diplomatic speeches don't vary much. They differ based on your relationship (usually very negative) but within a relationship level they repeat exactly over and over. If you're going to go the distance and hire voice, have them, you know, spice it up a bit.

Most of the tech from MOO2 is there, but the tree is a bit harder to understand. The interface is improved in some ways and worse in others, but not painfully so, just weird and needs some polish.

The combat is in real time but it doesn't feel like that adds very much, or it's just me. I just kind of let the computer handle the fleet movement because at the start of each battle the ships are just placed based on some internal game logic, so you have little control there.

The ships are beautiful though and the first time you field a titan feels pretty awesome.

Combat is missing something from the old games, perhaps have not explored it enough, in the older versions I always controlled the ships early on and then gave up when the fleets got so massive it was just no use and let the AI take the battles from there, so far have simply let the  AI run the battles, the graphics are beautiful in battles, kudos to the game team there!

Pro/con time.

PRO:
Draws heavily from MOO2/Civilization
Plays very smoothly and quickly, even on large maps you're not waiting too long between end turn clicks.

CON:
1) AI is very bad. 
2) Only half the races are available.
3) Only two options for spaceship design per class.
4) Most of the game is clicking until you watch a cutscene.
5) Autobuild queue not customizable, it just starts building crap instantly.
6) Music repetitive.
7) Leader is not customizable at all. 
8) No random heroes to pilot your ships.
9) Blueprint/upgrading your fleet is still a mystery to me after 21 hours and multiple playthroughts.
10) Too many cutscenes, which are nice, but if you've seen it once you've seen it enough and they play all the time. 
11) Very limitted map design, every map feels roughly the same. 
12) Lack of options to change things such as disabling tutorial, or turning off cutscenes,
13) Too easy.
14) Spend most of your time moving around the map, constantly zooming in and out as the game will force you to change zoom levels when events happen.
15) Tactical combat is severely limitted, best you can do is maybe avoid a missle by luckily moving behind an astroid or adjust which ships arrive to the enemy first. 
16) Most games turn into a game of clicking next turn while you sit in a stalemate with your enemies until you get a DOOM/TITAN class ship to destroy them or win the Elections.

It has all the required features of a 4x space game: tech tree unlocks ship and planet upgrades that advance the economy and the military,  citizen mangement system, diplomatic interface that allows trading of resources and tech. 

My gripe is that there's nothing new. Nothing to make this game any more interesting than any other entry in the 4x field. It looks nice, there's good voice acting, there's cute news reports, but it doesn't feel like a new game, just a reskin of the old ones.  It's fine, and if you're nostalgic for MoO, you'll enjoy it.  I'm hoping that a lot more fundamental features get added to the game before release.  Especially in the tactical side of combat, where it's pretty much 'watch the visualization' or 'don't watch the visualization'. 

The one notable exception to the lack of innovation is that with some tech upgrades you have to choose which benefit you get instead of unlocking all the benefits of that tech level.  I'd actually like to see this expanded to encompass every tech, which would do a lot to make the game stand out in the genre.

Positives:

+Looks cool
+Stable (No crashes)
+Good voice acting

In essence, the game looks very pretty and sounds very cool. Many of the voices actors were immediately recognizable, and they do a fairly good job over all. The GNN skits get a little annoying after a while, so I usually just skip them now. They are too time-consuming. The graphics are great and the animations are wonderful. Lastly, it isn't a broken piece of junk like Master of Orion 3 was. The main bugs I have seen have been UI and text-related. This seems to be where they spent their resources.

So, on these merits, it is already better than Master of Orion 3 was. That is a very low bar, though.

Negatives:

-No Turned Based Combat
-Excessively Small ""Battle Maps""
-Broken Diplomacy
-Temporary Treaties
-Bad AI
-Restricted Customization
-Generalization
-No Leaders
-Star Lanes

The game is at the very core, nothing like its predecessors. I know many people who will not buy this simply because it is no longer turn based. I'm hoping that the battle maps can be made larger, or possibly scalable, but I did not see this. Also, the AI is terrible. It will decide to fly directly into and attempt to shoot through asteroids, as an example.

Diplomacy is now completely and utterly broken. You essentially have to hand over all your money, all of your revenue, give them a technology, and hand over one of your colonies, in order to obtain a non-aggression pact. I can't fathom what it would take to secure an alliance. This was as a race with ""+25% Diplomacy"", as well. So, I don't think that the system is working at all.

Oh, and if you happen to get ahead in technology, the AI will simply demand you give them the technology you worked so hard for. Not even an exchange. Refusal pisses them off, and you cannot edit the ""deal"". Either give me technology, or I get pissed at you. Great system.

Remember how treaties used to work? Both sides initially lose money, but over time the ""trade"" or ""research"" treaty would add to your revenue? Nope. Temporary. Basically, you gain nothing for a number of turns. Then, out of the blue, ""Yay! Get 348 BC!"". The treaty is then TERMINATED, and requires renegotiating. That is now a treaty.

While you CAN still customize all of the weapons on your ships, there are less customization options. Also, the ""System"" part of ship customization has been turned into ""slots"" or ""modules"". And yes, they put anti-missle rockets here. I don't understand why.

What I mean by ""Generalization"" is that there is a lot less specialization in the game. The races used to be extremely diverse, and had completely different playstyles. Not anymore. I know that ""custom race"" is coming, but the base races are so very similar that I don't expect too much from this right now.

This one is easy. Just add in Leaders.

Star lanes? Really? This one was completely unexpected. You move around by moving to the ""warp points"" inside of a star system, and then can ""warp"" to predetermined systems adjacent to your current system. Want to get to a system ""south"" of where you are? No Star Lane, no way. Gotta take the long way around.

Conclusion:

This game has been massively simplified, and bears very little resemblance to the classics. If you are a die hard MoO 2 fan, don't pick this up. If you are, however, a fan of games like Civilization 5, this may work for you. It has been streamlined into, essentially, a space Civ 5 game with cool-looking battles. Oh, and famous voice actors.

First off; this is not an MOO HD remake, leave your expectations in the 90's. 
This is an entirely new game and should be approached as such.

Honestly even though i would have preferred the new MOO to make a complete break with the old core turn-based mechanics, barring some minor hickups, the core gameplay is fairly stable and has a fairly good flow, though honestly there is nothing that could not have been done real-time at present.

The best addition has to be the very cinematic feeling Real-time battles though, the AI (when this review was written) was fairly simple and could use considerable improvement to provide some true tactical challenges, that being said there is plenty of room for tactical master all the same.

With optimization and time this will shape up to be a great 4X title when all the wrinkles get ironed out.

Didn't run into any game breaking bugs, mostly a couple of minor ones, like planets created from asteroid fields stayed barren visually, even when terraformed to Gaia. Making custom ships with the alternative models would just make em revery to original model, and at one point i couldn't pan the view, but was fixed by alt-tabbing out and back in.

Other than those, i had no problems, ran very smooth even on max settings no stuttering.

There are some balance issues that probably need looking into. Like early game its really hard to get going, but late game you have such an easy time. I was losing money in start of game, and by the end i was making over 3k per turn. For example, i had to raise taxes not to have a defeciet early game, but in the end game i could build buildings to make my minions so happy they didn't care i had max taxes. Maybe add some mechanic to promote smaller planet populations, and with getting higher populations you lose some happyness due to crowding? Kinda how they did it in Civilization games.

Its kinda the same with Credits and Science, you struggle hard early on, but mid-late game it becomes so easy to manage.

This game has the potential to surpass #2 in my opinion, as someone who still played #2 as recently as a month ago, and as long as a good 20 years ago or so. 

I'm going to summarize that the key thing that makes this game better is the focus on balance. Everything modification wise is low to the ground from race traits, to weapons, buildings, everything. Power level is just simply toned down overall, and simplified. Simplified does NOT mean less strategic options, in fact stacking modifiers becomes very important in this, and every single turn almost you're making critical choices as a result. Colony ships don't take 70 turns at the start where you have to sit there clicking next for 30 minutes for the game to just get going.... by turn 50 you're going to feel like you're knee deep in a game, and ordering a pizza for the long haul. Your research is absolutely critical because the board state changes so fast. Likewise movement has changed entirely, for the better. The addition of military outposts is major, and you can use warp lanes as choke points. Loving it. The new changes to troop transports? Epic. Next colony button? Genius.

Also, the first time you get a battleship you're going to feel pretty epic :) Mine just wiped out a whole fleet by itself. 

So here's the very long list of stuff the game kinda needs and in no way has missing these things stopped my friend and I from playing:
- Leaders, even with very minor attributes, will make a nice difference. I'm sure this is planned, but both my friend and I were missing that.
- More hover over information, notably there is no way to access a stats screen for my ships beyond going into the blueprints area. If I wanted to assess my fleet it would be a pain right now.
- Tactical combat in multiplayer as an option. I'm sure this is coming too, but can't hurt to mention.
- More meaningful ability to understand the various scores breakdown and army strength. My friend seemed to have much higher army values, but holy cow was my army performing very well. We're not sure on any level why my excellence score is higher than his. 
- Slow down the GNN reports, they're over really quick and this is the kind of game you can really sit back with. Just keep options open!
- When streaming it is really hard to avoid the race selection being a problem because the narration happens every time you click a new race. Maybe it could be a toggle or a button or something. 
Will alter this list as things change or as I remember the minor issues which came up.",1456604537,1456604537,True,76,1,0.664551913738250732,0,True,False,True

I've been playing for more then 2 decades now and I loved MOO. I'm a casual gamer, a fan of the actors voice playing this game, but not a fanatic or a power monger. Keep this in mind as you read my review as you may or may not have the same playing style.

Second, this is Early Access and REALLY not suited for casual gamers.

I do not recommand this game at the moment for gamers who are like me; casual, micro-managing and graphics oriented. To those, I say get the Endless equivalent for now if you must, cause the early access is more for passionate gamers who don't mind the ""serious"" lack of depth, dumb down everything, semi unpolished graphics, limited everything (again and always, only one leader per race, usually male). Don't beleive the vid about interstellar battles, they look nothing like that...for now. Just tiny ships moving about in RT and cheaply shooting at each other. That said, I've yet to encounter a bug.

Things to do on this game:

- Polish the leader, planets and buildings on planets graphics. They just look like meh spheres with badly drawn structures here and there, like warts added to the surface of the foggy planetary graphics. Honestly, I think MOO 3 looked better then this.
- Make the tactical space battles MUCH nicer to look at, with command choices and either turn based and/or with a less pathetic flow to it.
- I know that more leaders are coming, but so far they are soooo shallow! There's no...connection to the races and of course, you're limited to THAT leader (with no pics while playing), usually male, and his/her point of view.
- Choice of empire color; I know it seems silly, but its a choice the gamer can make and it SHOULD be simple to add.

The combat feels a bit like Gal Civ 3, but you have a little more influence over the battle. I did not see an option to retrat from combat - but thay may be coming later.

No leaders, yet.

Ship design, which I really used to enjoy feels watered down to me. 

The game is pretty, the music/sound is nice and the voice acting is solid, although the GNN anchors voices are annoying.

Civilization by an infinite number of moves I like a much more. I hope the game will be deweloped and then MoO become my favorite turn-based strategy!)

But I found the game good and promising enough, so make sense to buy. However also need to consider some aspects that are not so gentle. 

Close look of space map is looking like Galactic Civ with some StarDrive flavor. Or the opposite. Not bad, but nothing special. 

Tactical space combat is realtime and somewhere between StarDrive and Endless Space. There are minor issues, like ship weapon firing arc is not working, ships are turning over and over (ship movement control is close to nothing), ships are shooting missiles and beam into asteroids, etc.

This tactical combat part of the game is really what have to be re-considered. I prefer turn based game with turn based tactical combat. Need to give control to the players instead of sit and watch what is happening on the screen.
Another area is the ground combat. Hope, the developers do not follow bad example of GalCiv III that was not ready with this aspect when released. StarDrive2-like ground combat would be good, with some fancy upgrade in the graphics and weapon/gadget selection. (Nobody is expecting XCOM2 type…)

Leaders / governors are missing today, hope it will be in the scope. Also nice to have some special ship weapon or extra module to find / buy / manufacture. Or merchants selling goods, or mercenaries, or armies to hire, etc.

I understand that some of the issues will be fixed after having early access feedback.

I recommend the game anyway, it is fun, and the game is pretty. I had one crash only, easy to reproduce so I am going to report it to the developers.

And on a side note the voices of Michael Dorn and John de Lancie really add a lot for me as I am a huge Star Trek fan.

Also the AI let me build a massive Empire and no one even declared war on me, they all despise me but are so afraid of me that they aren't willing to fight me. I don't really mind that the AI doesn't want to fight me though I just wish that they were large enough to pose a challenge to me when I decide to invade.

The Master of Orion series is considered by most to be one of the first, if not  leaders in galactic 4x game series. There are many paths to victory in games like this, which include conquest, science, and diplomacy. I am not sure if Masters of Orion has wonder or quest victories as of yet, but I would not be surprised to see it patched in later into early access. So just a few things ot be said to have a proper review for you folks.


[h1] The Positives [/h1]
[list]
[*] Beautiful, simple, and non intrusive graphics allow you to enjoy the game for some of its finer details.
[*] The races so far have history, they have culture, and they interact (albeit agressively] differently.
[*] Ship design is simple and to the point, something I actually enjoy and endorse.
[*] Decisions matter. Making infratructure instead of ships? Well good luck early in, and mid, and late game... xD
[/list]

[h1] The Negatives [/h1]
[list]
[*] Sometimes there are tooltips, and sometimes there are not. Little placeholders or blank text still exist but this is to be expected early access.
[*] The lack of game pacing options such slow, medium, or fast is kinda saddening. Science pacing would be a nice feaure as well.
[*] The lack of other game options such as minor races, galaxy markets, and anomaly quest is kinda saddening, but very bearable.
[*] Galaxy options! Give us more control with more sizes, more planets, more anomalies, more adventure. Make it a thing guys, you can do it!
[*]This is a con for now but soon to be fixed. Lack of custom races. God I cannot wait for that. Give it to us now! Please!? Ok I will wait *sniff*

All things said this game is very enjoyable already, and very well polished. Iv played games that have been out more then a year that dont play as well as this (I am looking at you Galactic Civilizations and StarDrive). I also like the fact that the 50 dollar package is in fact 4 fricking games. The entire series. And people are complaigning about that? Holy crap.

Fairly enjoyable, but hopefully some features and AI aggression yet to come. The game had some interesting moments, but did get a touch boring as well. Building the 20 somethingth planet up got boring, but the auto-build seemed useless.

The AI basically left me alone. The cat people destroyed my main fleet and I madly build another one while waiting for an attack. There was one attack which I barely repulsed, but that was it. The AI could have taken much of my empire if they had tried. Or another race could have attacked me while I was weak and several did dislike me.

It looked very good if a bit cartoony. There were no crashes. It seemed quite a bit like MOO 1/2 re-skinned, which is good for me. The relations between me and other races seemed fine if a bit simplistic.

I just auto fought the battles and didn't worry about the RTS, so I didn't count that as a negative. I didn't have a problem with the Civ style tech tree. You still have some techs that require you to pick one tech out of two or three options. Also spys and marine invasions seem to be coming later.

Weak AI, some boredom and no custom races are my main negatives. Note that custom races are ""coming soon"".

A few notes that could be fixed easily. A way to see and sort pollution percentage from the empire screen. A way to see which planets had repair ability for my ships. A way to tell a ship to stay at a planet until repaired. Custom lists of things for the planets to build when first colonized. I may have missed some of those already being in game and I just didn't see them.

From a fair old-timer, it wasn't bad and might improve so a thumbs up.",1456525032,1456574752,True,36,1,0.450517266988754272,0,True,False,True

Original reasearch system is scrapped and replaced with Civilization research system.

I'm not sure why they are calling the combat tactical because there are no tactics involved. It's also a horribly looking mess.

Things like no heroes and no events and no multiplayer tactical combat might get fixed. But overall direction of game never will.

+Stable
+Beautiful (playing at 1980 and all ultra settings)->i mean 1920x1080 lol

-No leaders/governors as in MOO2
-Seems there is only 1 universal type of government
-It lacks a lot of info popups and a tutorial

The Bad:

1. The devs withhold on tactical combat for a long time before they let us know it's going to be real time and it's going to be ready for Early Access to show off. It failed on every front at the moment. Compared to RTS like Homeworld or Sins of a Solar Empire, the combat has very little depth and any ""tactics"". Compared to Swords of the Stars, the combat has even less depth and strategy over all. It's very simple, click attack, your ship fire, done. In Homeworld position your ship is important, especially Capital ship, and flanking Capital ship is very important. There's nothing like that here. In Sins of a Solar Empire you have hundred of abilities and micro managing your ship in real time (like any other RTS) is the key to advantage. Right now this Tactical combat has less Depth than Dune 2 24 years ago.

2. The Races has very little diversity, there's almost no different bar very minor bonus/penalty. Coming from MoO 2 you will find this a big disappointment. It's like MoO 2 but you take out half of the strength and weakness of the races.

3. Tech tree. If you are expecting to make important decisions with the research path in MoO 2, forget it. Decisions are too far and few in between and has too little impact at the moment. Like after researching 20 techs you are only asked to make a decision to choose between Fusion Beam and Fusion Bomb once.

For example:
-Multiple ways of invading/destroying planets.  Drown them in chemical weapons to kill off the population while leaving the infrastructure intact (but taking a big diplo hit).  Spend years nuking them from orbit until the planet is a polluted, irraddiated mess, then move in to clean up and terraform things back to habitabal.  Launch a good old fashioned infantry invasion, involving marines of different levels, tanks and mechs.  Or for the galactic conquerer on the go, simply erase the planet from existence with late-game planet-exploding tech.

-Customize your ships with more than just weapons and armour.  The biggest range of options comes not from the weapons, but from the utility/support modules that can be researched and fitted.  From active black-hole generators, SC2 Stalker-like blinks, missile retargetting and all kinds of countermeasures, your ship designs are just as much about your style of fighting as they are about how hard you hit.

-Think the starlanes are lame?  You don't even need to get half way through the tech tree to unlock warpgates, allowing you to make your own starlanes between colonies.  Combined with late-game engine tech, and the appearance of wormholes in the galaxy, mobilizing your fleets really isn't the painful process some people think after a brief early-game play.

- Someone complained that you can't transport food between planets?  Wrong.  Just need the tech unlocked (again, pre-mid game).  It'll also let you transport production, letting you focus late-game production at key planets (for when you want to start spamming those Titans or Death Stars).  Oh, and you can send population around from turn 1.  Did I mention population is tracked by race, and different races can be assimilated into your planets, complete with their racial perks?  What casual unfaithful nonsense!

On top of the depth that's already here, there's more promised to land before launch - and based on how much of this promised content is already heavily referred to across the game (such as in the tech tree), it seems pretty likely that these guys are on it.

Another thing I've seen people slate the game for: no ship bording.  Lemme quote an item off the tech tree called ""Marine Pods"" (under Advanced Tactics):
""Marine Pods house additional detachments of space marines, increasing the number of Marines on board a ship.  The additional marines both defend the ship and can board enemy ships.""

Today, after playing the early access of Masters of Orion, the title has been taken by this Early Access.  This is my review after playing two full games as the Psilons and Humans.  

PROS:

-They stayed true to the old Masters of Orion 2 secret sauce
-Fantastic modernization of graphics and UI (Star Map is beautiflul!)
-Races feel as they did in the previous game (and improved).
-Game feels very polished and I did not encounter any issues other than some labels that need to be updated.

Recommendations for Improvement:

-Bring back ground combat that is visual like it was in Masters of Orion 2 (This may simply just not be implemented yet).
-It's really hard to make an alliance, and keep one.  It's a little too punishing and I was not able to create one without giving them all my money plus monthly payments and giving them one of my best planets.  I did this playing Humans who are supposed to be diplomatic and had technology to improve my chances.  Also when I raised influence with other races, over the course of about 5 turns my influence would continue to reduce until it sat back at the middle neutral point.
-The pollution mechanic is interesting, but causes more micromanagement of planets which I didn't find very enjoyable.  
-I would recommend making the icon of current population of a planet larger on the galaxy view.
-Playing as humans (blue color) it was sometimes difficult to see where my planets were when I was zoomed out.

Exceeded my wildest expectations.

They game of course is in early access, and several races are not playable at this point as well as some features that are sure to come at a later date. That being said, the game is absolutely playable, no bugs that I have encountered, and is entertaining as it is engrossing.

MOO and others like it are the sort of games that take up HOURS of your life in an eye blink. You are so enveloped in what your are doing that you are eagerly advancing turns to get that colony ship to that prime real estate planet before your neighbor, or rushing that ship to change the tide of war in a contested system.  That is what I want from a game, and so far I have not been disappointed. 

The game's workings are fairly easy to understand, there is no tutorial match available (that I was able to access at least) but they game has an abundance of hints. Some things were a bit of a mystery, like worker strikes, but playing long enough provided the explanation needed. It's a straightforward game and unlike MOO3 (which was my favorite, don't judge) its streamlined things to a point where you aren't having to micromanage every aspect of gameplay. I am surprised with how well the game plays so far that it was put into Early Access. Stellaris may have a thing or two to do with that. We are still missing some races as I mentioned above, but other than expanding the map sizes, adding the races, beefing up the tech tree, I don't see much else that needs to be done. 

Space combat is pretty much just like MOO3, over in 30 seconds. I don't think it has ever been MOO series strong point. The bombardment screen is really disappointing. I loved MOO3's planetary bombardment, It was visceral and made me feel like ""This is genocide, the systematic extermination of all life on Arrakis!"" Now it's ""bloop"" you dropped a bomb, there goes item A, B, or C. That's something I would like see fixed up before leaving Early Access.

Planet management is similar to other 4x titles, but like I said previously, you can fully automate planet management and no micro management required. I picked a large map and was a little miffed at first. It seemed so small, especially compared to MOO3. But as I played it became clear that just 4 or 5 planets is enough to keep you busy. Still, I want 200 plus star system maps like M003 in the future (Huge map size perhaps?) 

The AI is fairly predictable, scooping up and taking every available world and stellar object available to them. I would have to play longer to say this isn't the case for all AI, but so far it seems to be. A little more variety would be nice to see, but with Early Access things are going to change. Some variation besides the rush, turtle, and other playstyles would be interesting. Maybe a randomized ""arch enemy"" that the AI will go after over all else, even if it's on the other side of the map. 

I've played Star Ruler, Endless Space, Distant Worlds, Space Empires, Galactic Civ, etc. For me, MOO is the most fun to play and the one game that I believe will manage to keep my interest for longer than a few hours. However, I am eagerly awaiting Stellaris, and that could change things up quite a bit. Masters of Orion has more than just an homage to look and lore of the games previously in the series, it is very much a game of its time. Smooth gameplay, nice graphics, an easy but useful UI, I'd venture to say this game is about as good as a successor to the Master of Orion series as there could be. 

TLDR: The game is a solid 8/10 even in Early Access. With the collector's Edition it's worth its 50 dollar price.

UPDATE: Finished a playthrough. Dissappointed by the 500 turn limit, wanted to see more of the tech tree than I did. I only ever lost one battle, and its because I didn't simulate it when I probably should have. AI needs to up its game.

OMG!! A little history of me, I've played every MOO game, my favorite is MOO2, then MOO1 (never got into the new design and feel of MOO3). I got MOO1, played the hell out of it.. I then preorder MOO2 at a local radioshack, and waited and waited, till two months after the release date i still hadn't had MOO2 in my hands, canlced the preorder (now an order at this point). I found it at Walmart weeks later, and the rest was history.  Story there was never pre-order anythign at radioshack.. :)

Anyhoo, Why am I talking about MOO2 so much, well this feels just like it with improvments that I've always wanted in the game.. I was worried they would take it a new direction, like I felt they did with MOO3, but they stuck to the roots of the game.

Stuff I like so far:
- Nice UI layout, simple enough to decipher things as other MOO games
- Technology Upgrades that effect ship building provides an option to upgrade the rest of the fleet (at a cost of course)
- Build Queue's 

That's it for now, still in EA I'll update when full release and more game time. So far, I'd say a solid buy for MOO fans out there.. Also nice perk of the Collectors pack is you get the old versions too, always good for some replay value, and I might give MOO3 another go..

I am an avid fan of both MoO and its sequel and so far I am enjoying this game very much. It has a slightly different feel than the originals but it's definitely a strong 4x title. 

The realtime combat may be unexpected in a game calling itself a Master of Orion remake/reboot, but works pretty well and is in my opinion superior to the turn-based combat in MoO 2 which could sometimes turn into a chore especially in the late game. Starlanes are also something which I usually don't like and which are new in a MoO game but it works surprisingly well and leads to a lot of interesting gaming choices and opportunities. 

Pros:

- Great visuals, awesome production values overall
- Very stable for an early access title
- Feels definitely like a MoO game
- The UI is modern and very user friendly
- The starlanes add a lot of strategic opportunities to the game

Cons:
- 4 races and a couple of features (like spying, several victory conditions etc.) haven't been implemented yet
- No tactical combat in multiplayer

Overall I am enjoying the game a lot and at least in my opinion it's a worthy successor. If you expect a 100% copy of the older games with visual improvements you'll probably not like this title, but if you are open to the thought of a new interpretation of the source material you might be in for a treat.",1456503615,1456528395,True,37,0,0.519807696342468262,0,True,False,True

Cons:
*The tech tree is more like Civilization than a MOO game, that was disappointing to me. I liked the divided tree into different areas, etc. MOO2 is my fav tech tree.
*Combat: defenses are pretty much useless against ships. The definition of tactical combat presently in the game is point, click, and they shoot, no real tactics to it. From what they say, this is a major work in progress.....I hope, otherwise it would be one of the most disappointing elements in the game.
*No Elarians, one of my favs in MOO2
*Diplomacy.....what diplomacy? I have found it better to ignore this aspect of the game until the computer acts more reasonably.
*Ship design: I love that the ship design here is much like MOO and better than most of this game's piers, but I still find it too restrictive when compared to previous MOO games. Would love to have more choices about how many specials, etc to put on a ship. I should be able to have a titan dedicated to electronic warfare if I want to and have space available.
*Tech comes too fast and ships too slowly, by the time they are built, they are obsolete.

Pros:
*In my opinion the flow of the galaxy, production ques, etc. resembles MOO2 very well and is one of the best out of any recent space tbs game. Some people do not like the auto group, but the same people love MOO2 (which had auto group). It is as simple as selecting the ones you do not want in the group and moving on. As far as the galaxy, fleet movement, etc. goes I think it does well with some minor issues on path finding.
*The bones of a good game, with the glitches of an EA (early access) game.
*All in all it plays like MoO4, bringing some of the best of the first 2 games, and missing many of the problems of MOO3 (while keeping star lanes, which I personally like).

Overall while my cons are more detailed and specific than my pros, I think for people like myself, who are buying this to be a true MOO game, it can be at least mostly pleasing.
There are issues but like I said, overall, it plays like a MOO game (with the exception of that darned tech tree....hate it).
So I recommend getting it because it plays a lot like MOO to me....differences, the the spirit is there and that is something I found lacking in games like Endless Space, Horizon, etc. They are all decent games, but have never had the spirit or held a candle to MOO. I hope that many of those issues above are fixed and improved on, but I at least recommend this game based on the fact that the collectors edition includes the 3 previous games plus the new MOO!",1456528257,1456528354,True,29,0,0.497967451810836792,0,True,False,True

So far the game seems really good for early access.  The game is playable and only crashed to desktop twice in the past 10 hours.

PROS:
+This game is beautiful and has that sense of discovery missing from GalCiv or SOTS
+The additions to diplomacy and the diplomacy screens are awesome.
+Voice acting is usually verry well done.
+The RTS battles are pausable, and you can slow them down by 1/4ths to easily control you units and special abilities.
+The research tree really makes you make some tough choices on what you want to specialize in.
+The ship customization is easy to use, but still allows for a lot of variation.
+Space Lanes, now you can have defensible systems and war fronts. Careful of those techs that let them get behind you.
+Weapon Arcs, it's important to maneuver around to flank big powerful frontal attackers.
+The AI reacts well to what you are using against them and pools their fleets for large powerful attacks to break through your defenses as well as going after undefended planets.
 
Cons:
-A lot of techs aren't fully implemented (Alpha)
-Weapon customization doesnt change the base stats so its difficult to determine if its worth it
-Ship appearance custimization does not allow you to change colors making patterns difficult to see
-Some of the voice work is annoying: Looking at you Psilon Science Guy
-Auto save is only for the immediate turn.
-Very little Game customization allowed currently. Not sure if more will be added.
-Does not allow you set formation before battles and formations are very wonky.
-Races have very minor variation (Hope this changes) Not sure if some get specific techs or not.

I'm definitely getting sucked in already and experiencing that great ""just one more turn, just one more turn"" feeling that a good strategy/4x game will give you.

Bugs - Nothing really noteworthy so far, just a bit of barely noticeable frame stutter on a large, well explored galaxy during AI turns.  There's some minor UI elements that could use some polishing/streamlining.

Some work needed - Diplomacy is a bit shallow, it would be nice to have some more subtle ways to make friends or enemies.  It seems like all the AI will do right now is get progressively more angry with you even if you don't do anything to offend them, even buying them off doesn't really do much. The auto-build is way off base for what new colonies need.  Pretty surprised that this got a public release without a working tutorial.....but that's the only real ""buyer beware"" I encountered.  Even as a 4x vet, I always like to give the tutorial a whirl just to get a feel for the game and all its features.

Wishlist (not really a knock on the game) - I know its probably a tall order with all the art & voice work required but even more different races would be amazing.  Bigger galaxies.  More ship variants.  I'd also love to see some sort of Ship Design Testing Room feature that you could access from the main menu that would take you straight to ship design and let you really play around with the ship building and then perhaps test them against some basic enemies.  I love the ship design part of a good 4x but I'd love to see some sort of testing lab feature to really get to play with various ship classes and loadouts.  With so much else going going on during a full game, you might spend some time on a new ship design, and never actually get to really get a chance to see if it performs well in combat.  A ship lab/fight AI ship minigame that you can access directly from the main menu would be a lot of fun.

Summary - great game, definitely recommend (even in early access), I'm having a lot of fun with it.  A few minor things to polish up and a few ""above and beyond"" things I'd like to see added.",1456521219,1456521219,True,36,0,0.538928389549255371,0,True,False,False

But in the face of recent games like Endless Space and Star Drive 2 I don't see how this really contributes to the genre outside of ""production values."" There are significant aspects of the design and art direction that appear heavily cribbed from Stardrive 2 (which in turn cribbed from MOO2).

I do find the game enjoyable, but considering the overall design decisions I'd recommend Star Drive 2 or Endless Space over this for a modern space strategy game.

There's a few interesting ideas (fortifying starlanes), but these are harmed by many of the streamlining issues. 

For instance not having fleet range like in many other space games turns it into ""whack-a-mole"" with the AI (and even worse with a human player).

The biggest faults which I do not see being handled with the planned features are tied to the end game. The effort to avoid steamrolling at the end game are very heavy handed with enforced turn limits and a 1 ship limit to Doomstars. These heavy handed approaches to ending the game at a set point don't work well when the AI and overall game mechanics lead to scattered empires that drag out conquest victories. (which is ""fixed"" by the hard turn limit)

Tactical combat is another area that could use some refinement. Although there are ship firing arcs the AI tends to circle and there's no fine control for focus fire on individual ships, the AI targets an entire group. Stardrive 2's combat seems to provide more benefit for not using autoresolve or the cinematic camera.

Some of these issues might be resolved with early access feedback. But some of these issues are simply fundamental flaws with the way that game mechanics have been streamlined.

So to make it clear, the game is fun, the game is pretty. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the cartoony art style and voice overs of this and Stardrive and prefer Amplitude's more grounded approach, but that is a matter of taste and not quality.

But overall, for a modern 4x game I'd recommend Endless Space over this title.",1456516502,1456516502,False,177,7,0.659491479396820068,5,True,False,True

This game is already extremely polished, early access or not. I've seen games that were ""released"" with less polish than this one. The UI is simple and intuitive and the animations and voice acting are top notch. Graphically the game is beautiful for a 4x space game. 

So far I've only had one or two VERY minor bugs and certainly nothing game breaking or even hindering.

I have played MoO2 for probably thousands of hours since I first bought it about 18 years ago, and still play it a couple of times every year.
From the first early teasers I was really hoping this game would be a true Master of Orion sequel. I went in to play for two hours. Forced myself to stop just before the 2 hour mark due to feeling VERY, VERY dissapointed, then I went to watch several youtubers to see more of what the game has to offer.

*The races are dumbed down variants of their own MoO2 counterparts, the traits are little more than minor stat buffs in different fields. Not game defining traits that you based your core strategy around, and give each race a unique play style.

*Technology has a civ-style tech tree, which do feel bland, thin and very constricted. I am happy they decided to hold on to one of MoO2s defining features, that you could only choose one discovery per technology. In MoO2, that was something that further allowed you to gradually define your empire and playstyle as the game progressed. However, this feature feels somewhat dumbed down in this game, as at the first tiers of research you get all the discoveries, cutting out some potentially very difficult decisions. Later on you will need to make choices however, which is nice.

*Combat is very boring. While you CAN control your ships to some extent, especially if you repeatedly pause and overview their orders, they fights mostly manage themselves rather quickly. 
In MoO2, combat was a great, it was the climax of the game, where you finally got to test your ship designs against the enemy, and where your actions and tactics mattered the most. It was far from perfect, but it had potential to be FUN. There were definitely possibilities to improve, perhaps by getting rid of the coarce grid, reducing fleet-sizes or making huge fleets easier to manage, adding MORE weapons types, tactical options, etc, etc. 
But rather then keeping what was good and improving on it, they decided to make combat uninspired, dull and nothing like Master of Orion 2. (It is pretty tho).

*Ship customization was the last huge feature of Master of Orion 2. Each ship had a maximum mass, and you could add ANY mix of weapons and modules into it. Mostly, each type of weapon was interesting and offered a unique tactical option. The process of creating ships was always interesting and challenging. 
This new Master of Orion does, very unfortunately, dumb this down... I feel constricted when it comes to customization. Weapons feel bland and lacks uniqueness. This lack of interesting ship design also further hurts the already boring combat. 

I was hoping for a reinvention of one of the best games in history, an improvement on what already was great. But this is not that, at least not yet.

If they want to get my thumbs up, and amount to anything but being another failed MoO2-clone in my opinion, they need to do a total design-makeover and adress the immense dumbing down of the races and technology, find a better and more interesting way to design ships (likely with more subsystems and weapons). And most important of all: make combat something that is actually something more then a mere cinematic experience with minimal interactions.

I will ask for my moneys back, but I will keep my eyes on the game. Perhaps eventually it will grow to finally be a decent game. But I doubt that will happen, as major design changes rarely happen this late in production.

[EDIT] Thinking about it some more; this game is actually not that bad if you don't compare it to MoO2, there are no obvious game-breaking features that actually ruins the game. If you are in the market for a uncomplicated, mainstream space-4x, you might very possibly enjoy the game.",1456436585,1456512558,False,531,26,0.6163138747215271,58,True,False,True

MOO 2016 was my most wanted game since last Summer. And finaly it's here! :-)
The game doesn't look raw and non-finished, it works very stable and looks amaizing. 

The good:
1. Stable and ready for plaing product
2. The same atmosphere as in 1996!
3. Diplomatic is finaly very real and intresting

Neutral:
1. New technology tree aproach instead of choosing one from two - need to play more games to evaluate
2. Interface usabuility - great notification system (bottom right corner), however navigation between star systems and fleet management could be better

To improve:
1. List of buidings realisation - in my opinion it's better to have list of existing buildings on the planet insted of lacating it on 3-d planet.

Right now as it stands it played smoothly except they do need to may find a way to speed up the council voting sessions.  There was the only spot it seemed to dog down a bit on me with some time in between each one stating their vote and moving to the next.  Maybe a few more phrases would be nice during the voting too since I was already repeating their lines in my head on abstainting by the end.  

The graphics are looking good.  The different lokoing ship designs I saw througout for each race are great.  The interface is overall a pretty easy to manipulate around to what you want. 

Diplomacy is there, but definitely feels like it is still a work in progress.  It seemed pretty swingy at points for the way they got angry over things and was pretty hard to raise for me it seemed.  I do like how if you are friends with a race and you try to be friendly with their enemies they take notice.  There was always that aspect where wars and treaties were concerned, but just in general they appeared to pay attention to even the smallest trade of information.

Space pirates were kind of interesting, though never seemed much of an overall threat.  They did destroy a reasearch outpost on an asteroid field at one point on me when my ships were halfway across the galaxy hunting down the remanents of the humans.  Usually I hunted down where they were coming from, took out their base, and then found a planet in that system to settle to make sure they would not try coming back from there again.

I wasn't sure if the Council voting was at set intervals/turn marks or if something else was triggering when those came up.  So was a bit annoying at the end when it was down to me, the Alkari, and Mrrshan and we were all just hanging around for the next vote.  I was pretty sure I could win the next vote on my own, but requested/bribed the Mrrshan to toss their vote in with mine to make sure it was sealed.  

Things not in yet, but are coming and will greatly improve the feel of MOO:

Spying:  There are some techs related to spying in the game right now, but none do anything since there is no spy network option.

Race options:  Currently not in are some of my favorites including the Klackons, Darloks (makes sense with no spying and that being their strength), Meklar, and Silicioids.  Also no cusotm race.  However, they are greyed on on the startup selection screen so you do know all of those are coming :)

Difficulty levels:  Right now can only play on average difficulty, which overall for veteran MOO fans or those that play other similar games a lot is just a walk through the park and enjoying yourself as you do.


Would like to see: 

Planetary queue:  It'd be nice if I could queue up a few buildings/items at a time so I don't have to bounce back to the planets as often if everything is running well in the empire.  Obviously being able to modify/cancel the queued items will also be a plus in that situation.

Galatic laws:  I could see this being a pretty cool addition if done right and let the council of races have something else to affect the state of the universe and of course relations depending on which side of the voting you go with.

Technology splits:  I liked how some of the techs you were making the choice of which you would learn specifically and then you had to trade or eventually steal with espionage what you ddin't already learn.  I would like to see some more of those decitions within the tech trees, if it is possible wihout convoluting things way too far.",1456489620,1456489620,True,39,0,0.514152765274047852,0,True,False,True

The only ""good"" things:

Well your social life is about to take another hit. 

Brought from the development team of the orignal this is something I'd thought I'd never see.

Full impressions on video here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvchxRM-le8

With an amazing voice cast, updated graphics and all the basic core of the MOOverse.
You'll see alot of comparsion between this and Galactic Civ 3. 
GC3 is more polished but you always feel like the universe is rather static at times. 

Doesn't have an in depth as of yet ship designer yet but that is a work in progress.
Tech tree is fairly rounded out but could use a bit more depth to my liking. 
The Diplomacy branch is well rounded esp with the voice acting really captures the original feel. 

You will find a simple tutorial in the beginning that you will have to repeat every time unless there's an option to turn it off I didn't see but it's not bad. 
Galaxy size and the opponent AI is fairly ok. 
More races are incoming and custom races are also on the way. 
This is basically the meat and potatos of MOO. 
The bad is space combat which has been simplified to pretty much just watching the lightshow much like GC3 but it's not a bad show. 

So to sum it up

Pros:
Voice acting-Mark @#$#$ Hamill! Robert England etc!
Really buggy free so far. 
MO1,MO2,MO3 for free on steam with your purchase. 
Easy to use AI
Really good soundtrack
If you've played MOO you'll ease into it like nothing
Addicting gameplay

Cons
$50 early Access entry does put alot of people off even with free stuff.
Early access so you will be playing a waiting for content game at times. 
No turned based space combat 
GNN reports seem rather stale right now

I would heartily reccomend this 
7/10 atm will update review as it progress.

Pros:
+ Feels like Master of Orion
+ Planets are easy to manage
+ Multiple ways to win
+ Hybrid tech tree.  Most techs advance like your standard 4x (think Civ), but a few techs are old school MoO (you only get to pick one choice and the others can't be researched).  It is a good balance.
+ Stunning graphics
+ Excellent Voiceovers
+ Addictively fun
+ Ship customization is great

Early Access Issues
- A few minor bugs.  Ship naming bug, some dialogue doesn't sync to text, occasional frame stutter
- Espionage isn't in yet
- Only 6 of the 10-12 races are playable currently
- Only one AI difficulty at the moment

Cons
- No ground combat visuals, its just numbers
- Space Battles are Real Time, which isn't an issue, but there are no combat options other than selecting units and clicking enemies.  Needs some options like hold range, engage, retreat, etc.
- Races aren't too distinct when it comes to gameplay, bonuses are minor.
- Diplomacy is a little dry

Overall, in its current state the game is a 7/10.  Based just on what the Developer plans to add, it will be at least an 8/10 if it all gets in.  If combat gets tweaked and just a few more controls are added, this game could be amazing.",1456468816,1456468816,True,182,4,0.851072072982788086,4,True,False,True

Wondering about the real time space combat, if the combat area would increase for larger fights?
Note that the combat video can be record, but how does one review those files?
First game I got restricted in a small area of the known galaxy by worm holes that took special research to use. I lost that game by turn 200. It was fun.
Good graphic and voice over for the advisors....very cool.
Technology tree interesting....would like to see special race technology added in too or random technology.
Haven't done ground combat yet...looking forward to that.
Like to be able to slow down the speed of space combat.
Dislike the way planet's buildings were show. Couldnt see it all, without clicking on each one.
Dislike the screen that showed all the discovered planets...no way to organizied viewing it.

The map, ship creation, research, and overall feel is all there.  However there is a few things I wouldn't mind seeing:

1.)   I would love to have an option to enabled turn based combat, even tho the tatical combat is nice with live action, I still feel your more in a rail cart ride then controlling it at a deep level like Master of Orion II.  However as I got near the end of my play through I started getting used to it but a 3rd option for FULL turn base would be nice

2.)  I'm not sure if it just because of early access but I would like to be able to turn some of my weapons off while in tactical mode.  This would add a nice level of demension for when you take control of your ship.  Many times I didn't want to use a weapon and wanted to hold it off till I was in a more tatical situation but was unable to disable the weapons.  Hopefully they will add this prior to release

3.)  Some of the effects on some of the weapons I wouldn't mind seeing enhanced along with the sounds being improved.  The death ray for instance I didn't even know my ship was shooting them until I zoomed in.  The same goes for the steller converter and some of the missels.  You should be able to tell the weapons clearly apart from each other while being a little more zoomed out on the battle field.  Also the sounds should give some indication as to what is being fired to help assist with this.

4.)  I would like to be able to drill into my ships settings after they are built without having to dive into the ship design.  There was a few times with tech being updated so frequently I wasn't sure if something got updated or not on a current ship.  Maybe there is a way to tell and I just didn't find it in the GUI but it would be nice if you could see the load outs of current ships on the map.

5.)   More Skins on the ship design, I know its early access so this is probably coming

6.)  Would be nice if there was some other mechanic other then your allies getting pissed off when you won't give them a tech that is 3 jumps up the tech tree from where they are sitting.

7.)  Being able to tell what tech level your opponents are at in the diplomatic screen would be nice as well, just a general score or something.  This could even be locked behind a tech but would be nice to know.  The new network thing tells you every now and then but its not that frequent.


Aside from these small gripes its the best Master of Orion since Master of Orion II.  It will really bring home some good memories and some good times.  Looking forward to retail launch!

Conslusion (8/10) would recommend to friends, with a good possibliity some of these small things could get ironed out prior to release.

The tactical battle is one area of concern. At this point, I don't feel as if the real time battle really adds much and leaves much to be desired at its current state. Turn based combat would be greatly appreciated. This one area especially I hope to see more from as time goes on. 

I wish this game had governors/leaders as MoO2 did. Perhaps a feature to be added later? 

I like the reimagnined designs of the races, although  the characterizations can be a little cartoony. Nothing that seriously stands in the way though. That being said, I don't see how the different traits of the races impact the overall game yet, at least not in the way traits impacted previous games. Also, I'd like to see government types play a larger role if any at all.

The creaters did a great job with this one. Everyone will have gripes about this portion or that portion, However overall, the pain of suffering through Independantly created MOO2 Clones is finally over!

Rather than trying to make the game into something new, They did what MOO needed done. They have (successfully) recreated the feel of MOO and MOO2. 

The biggest complaint I've seen is in the combat system. And yes, It does feel a good bit simplistic at this stage, and Real Time Combat is a bit troublesome (Basically, its a nicely polished version of Sword of the Star's ShipVShip combat). Some have asked so I'll be sure to throw it in here, that combat IS pausable for a little bit of tactics, However I've not yet had a large enough fight between two fleets to need to use it often. On that note It still needs some polishing, but it IS an early release version. As an afterhought here, Having it real time does fix my biggest headache in MOO2, My fleet of 20 Heavy Ships VS the AI's 250 ship fleet and the 5 minute turns of combat....

The voice acting is FANTASTIC. I'm very impressed with it so far. The audio there does seem a bit rough with my 5.1 Logitech headset, however I'm not 100% sure if its on my end or not (enabling Surround sound actually seemed to fix the issue). 

On the Planetary managment level, Its just slightly above the complexity of MOO2, But just as easy to understand after a short bit of play.

Ground combat is MOO2 style (Marines fighting it out), and I'd like to see a bit of an increase in it before the final version... At least more to watch than two counters batteling it out. 

A lot of people have also commented on the use of Star Lanes... Personally I'm a fan, however I do see how that could be a headache for Diehard MOO2 Fans. It could be an option towards the final release, not sure how deeply encoded it is into the game...

If I did have one complaint, Its actually in the research. (Research is VERY deep already in this game, Its not the system itself I'm mad at, Its almost right out of the MOO Handbook to be honest). Currently there doesn't seem to be a perk for being ""Creative"" over a standard race... Although a Few techs are Either-Or (Only played Human, Not sure if this holds true for the Psilons or not), Most techs are fully open. I'd love to see it go to the classic A-B-C style used in the previous games, as it adds a lot of strategic depth.... Deciding between titans/Battleoids and Starbases has always been one of my biggest dreads in MOO...

Comparing it to Master of Orion 2, while a natural instinct, would not be fair at this time because the game is just far too new and unfinished.

And the largest detraction I can currently label to this game is that it is very much unfinished.  At least four races are missing (possibly as much as eight depending on how far the developers intend to go), race customization is not yet an option and the racial traits thus far appear to be watered down, ship design and combat are not as intensive as they once were, and despite the wonderful narration and voice acting the story does not yet seem to be entirely in place.

Let's double back and remember, though, that this game is hot off the Early Access presses.  There can and will be additional content to come, and even if the detail work from before is missing the foundation for a game as great as MoO1 or MoO2 appears to be there: the races we know and love are present (mostly), the gameplay absolutely feels like a Master of Orion game, and there has been some evolution in how things are managed.  Did I mention that now there's a beautiful voice cast narrating and interacting in the game?

If you're looking for a re-skinned version of Master of Orion 2, I would recommend going over to StarDrive 2 for the time being.  If you're looking for a game being built on the same blocks as its predecessors, this is the game you want.  It would be fair to say it's more worth it when it goes on sale, but one way or another any MoO-loving, 4X-playing gamer will sooner or want this in their library.",1456458760,1456458760,True,33,0,0.529055655002593994,0,True,False,True

1. Master of Orion is one of my favorite games from back in the day
2. This new remastering of the game has similar elements to the first game, but a more fluid movement to all game mechanics
3. The mix of nostalgia and a game that could stand on its own is quiet apparent in this game, whether that be due to just game mechanics, such as the announcers, or the new diplomacy options/ more in depth solar systems

However, There are a few kinks in the armour, mostly just due to early access:
1. The game feels slow;
          By this I don't just mean that it is running slowly on my computer, I mean that the fluid movement of the ships, as well as the movement of your screen accross the galaxy can be a little too slow for my liking. On the other hand, zooming out and then back in on the desired position does the trick most of the time
2. Some things are a little awkward
          The diplomacy responses are too slow and awkward, especially when they say the exact same thing whether or not they like you or not. Another thing that bugs the heck out of me is that the galactic voting mechanism is really slow and almost painstakingly ridiculous if you stay and watch the entire voting process. The awkward silences and then feeling as though you are going to crash out of the game because of the silence just is a major turn off for me. 
3. Diplomacy is iffy
          If the diplomacy in this game was a little better, I would be completely and utterly in love with this game. However, when you are hostile with humans because you are colonizing too rapidly (Which I already hate that mechanic anyways) and then they agree to trade agreements and eventually alliances with you, it feels a little cheap. The other thing about diplomacy is what are the numeral configurations to why they are upset/happy with me? I get an up or down arrow telling me if i did something right/wrong, but it doesn't say how much each individual thing effects the relationship

Anyways, I hope you guys find this helpful; I don't mean to make it sound like I do no recommend the game, but there are some definate greviances that I have with the game, that will hopefully be fixed in the next few months as the actual game comes out. If you think it is worth the investment, you will spend a lot of time on it and definitely get back what you paid for it. If you wanna wait for the solo game to come out and not just the collector's edition, that will probably be a less problematic experience, that is if you are only in it for the new game. This constructive criticism isn't a knock at the producers, but just the fact of Early Access and that sometimes things just don't work like they are going to in the full game. 

Hope you guys enjoyed and found this useful. Would probably rate the game(s) as a whole around a 7/10, mostly just due to the bugs of an Early Access game and the above mentioned things.

I consider myself a longtime fan of the series (by which I mean Master of Orion 1 and 2) and yes I was certainly not sure what to expect when I heard Wargaming Net had picked up the rights.
Though I was happy Orion was finally seeing new life.

For the most part? They've played it pretty safe,  you'll recognize the technologies, the alien species (based on Orion 1's style/look) being able to design ships and put them to good use.
You'll reckognize tiny little details like the Master of Orion 1 colonization theme when establishing new colonies.
You'll see creatures like giant ""Space Eels"" and many many other things you'll reckognize from the originals.

That said? There have been changes, there's now a space-lane system (that you might reckognize from other4x games) rather than the fee jump where you want (that's within range) , to me this works, though you'll have to play the game differently (fortify key systems to avoid the enemy pushing through)
So, if any enemy empire has hidden their weak/developing systems, behind an wall of fortified systems? That's to bad, you won't be able to hit them.

As before you can simply ""roll"" the dice to see who win starship battles, or duke it out. Though ...the ""tactical"" combat leaves much to be desired for now, I imagine this will improve.
Had they simply stolen ""Sid Meier's Starships"" combat, I would've happy with it.

The game is still in early access, but it's already really well polished, there's obvious stuff missing (features and more playable aliens).  The potential fall for this series was a HUGE one,  I'm happy this game doesn't disappoint.

Is it the deepest space strategy game out there?  Absolutely not, and that's a good thing in my mind. It's easy to get into, and there's definitely a lot of strategies to master.

I enjoy just sitting on the main game map, watching the stars twinkle and shine, the nebulae shift and flux, and my ships flying through the space lanes with a massive bow shock in front of them as testament to their faster than light speed.  

This is the first game since the old MIcroprose days to capture the FEEL of Master of Orion.  Everything about it is immersive, from the extraordinary animations for the alien race leaders you meet, the constant chiming in from your advisors (some of which are voiced by big Hollywood names ... hearing Alan Tudyk as the Psilon advisor just makes me smile every time he speaks up).

There is no proper campaign at this point, but plenty of open, free space to play around in, conquer and be conquered in turn.  You can play a game from beginning to end already, through conquest, diplomacy, research, economic might, and several other victory conditions of your choosing.  The game map on Medium or Large is huge, and I know there was some concern that it was only going to contain, at maximum, 100 or so star systems but believe me when I say that at the pace this game plays that is an ideal number.  It feels as grand as games offering thousands of systems to conquer and plays at a more thoughtful pace requiring more attention to detail (unless you automate production and let the game do it for you, which is an entirely viable strategy, focusing your own attentions on matters of military and diplomacy as your governors churn out buildings and units like there's no tomorrow). 

I had some concerns about the ship design system.  There are still aspects of it not in game, but I will tell you straight away that it lacks the complete customization of a game like the GalCiv series.  You won't be putting together the building blocks or your ship here, choosing from hundreds of hulls and nacelles and fiddly little bits.  But it still manages to be intensely satisfying, with lots of graphical bells and whistles (I especially love the Psilon ship designs which harken to the flying saucer days of 1950s alien conspiracy theories).  I felt no great lack of customization in the end and the polish on these ships outshines much of what players could manage on their own.  I suspect there will be more hull designs to come, more options to choose from, but again it is still Early Access.

In short, if you loved the original MOO or MOO2, if Civ5 was your cup o tea, or if you relish getting stuck into the kind of gaming experience that will have you plastered to your PC for hours without a break and every minute of it spent feeling like you ARE the emperor of a burgeoning space-faring race out to charm, deceive, or otherwise conquer all who dare to raise a laser cannon or tachyon beam against you ... this IS the game you've been looking for.

For all the supposed successors to Master of Orion that have come and gone over the last 20 years, this is the first one to do it justice since MOO2.  What Wargaming have made is a clear labor of love and it retains enough of what made MOO the father of the 4x genre while blessing it with enough that's new to bring a much-loved franchise into the 21st Century.  

Buy it.  NOW.

The RTS battles I wasn't sure of before release, but they are fun now that I haven played them.  Had a nice battle where I did a hit and fade and ran behind some asteroids and half of the fleet followed and got wiped out.  Made it a fair fight against their station and remaining ships.

Overall for a early release on its first day, and it being a MOO game with a lot to live up to, it is a very positive experiance and worth checking out.",1456442292,1456442292,True,44,1,0.563616514205932617,0,True,False,True

Obviously with only 1.3 hours in, there's much to see, and nobody should be writing a real review.  HOWEVER, if you liked MOO 2, and/or you just like this sort of game in general, it is a delight, and so far any concerns that WG would wreck the franchise are way off base.
