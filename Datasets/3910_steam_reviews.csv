‚Ä¢ The best Civ of the entire series. Every Civ after has departed from this, which is a real shame. I would've loved to see some quality of life updates and a remaster. Still an easy recommendation.
‚Ä¢ The gamestudio mentioned wanting Civ to feel more like a board game. Civ 4 doesn't accomplish this, Civ 5 does so a little bit, Civ 6 absolutely does, but it's to its detriment. The uncomplicated nature of this PC game, that gets as hard as you like, makes it an absolute masterpiece.
‚Ä¢ Be prepared to play for hours on end, there's no such thing as a short game in Civ 3. You'll be saying: ""One more turn"" as the sun goes down, only to see the sun come up, feel tired all day, and do it again the next night.

The fact that almost a decade after it still sucks me in like the first day is a testament to its ever lasting appeal. You only know when you start a game but you never know when you'll put it down or finish it; it's just so addictive unlike Civ V which has no lasting appeal. For me Civ 3 felt like digital chess. It's a game that has you continually thinking what your next moves will be and rewards handsomely forward-thinking and carefully planning ahead. I even like the graphics which are not as cartoonish as Civ IV. Along with Brian Reynold's Alpha Centauri, Civ 3 is my all-time favourite game. The amounts of hours I've poured into it can be tallied by the thousands. If you like 4X TBS games you owe it to yourself to play this classic. The Conquests expansion infused new life by way of historic scenarios which are fleshed out very nicely. Special mention goes to Rise of Rome and the Napoleon scenario where you relive the glory and bloodshed of the lost Empires.

Armies are largely a matter of luck.",1705895689,1705895689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is middle of the road and to the point ‚Äì not easy for me as I tend towards sesquipedalian loquaciousness!  Vociferously Verbose?  Alright, verbal diarrhoea.  (Although I hate panning a developer‚Äôs work and all the time, effort and love they put into designing these ‚Äì it is their life after all ‚Äì this is my honest, personal opinion of my level of enjoyment.  Sorry devs!).  

A note on time played:  My Steam clock does not seem to work properly, indeed, it even minuses time on occasion!  Plus, I have a tendency to wander off and leave games running at times, so time played may not be entirely accurate!  


Teaboy‚Äôs Tonsil Titillators or Toenail Titbits!  (Rating)  

Tonsil Tickler (Totally Tops):  The frenchy of which you always dreamt!  To quote a master, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a Man‚Äôs tonsils!‚Äù.  An absolute masterpiece and joy to play.  

The Tits (Terrific):  Everyone loves playing with these!  Not THE best bit, but such fun on their own you can be lost for hours....mmmm.  What most games you really like score ‚Äì perfection is so rare after all.   

Torso Teaser (Taker of your Time):  It‚Äôs a flat stomach....sure it‚Äôs nice to look at, run your fingers over, slobber on a bit, sometimes that bellybutton gets your motor running....but it's just basically the corridor between the two ‚Äògaming rooms‚Äô.  The definitive ‚ÄòMeh‚Äô - the middle ‚Äòsideways thumb‚Äô option for which everyone on Steam cries.  

Todger/Tadger & (scroTum) Taters (Tedious):  Is it an ‚Äòa‚Äô or is it an ‚Äòo‚Äô?  Who cares!  The meat can be fun to play with for about 5 minutes of your entire day, the rest it just hangs there and generally gets in the way of doing something else.  The main problem of course, is the two veg sticking to your inside thigh.  This is what this game feels like ‚Äì the occasional/rare bouts of fun, the rest bobbing like a 19th century British Policeman (now you know why!).  

Toenail Tornado (Total Toss):  A playthrough so appalling it‚Äôs like being trapped in a Turkish sauna with the ugliest, hairiest, fattest, sweatiest beast of a neolithic hominid who‚Äôs trimming his toenails using pliers and the splinters are reminiscent of a scene from the Normandy Landings.  My god how did this get released!?  


Teaboy Touts (Score):  Torso Teaser/The Tits


The Review:  

None of my overused exclamation marks for the score for this one, but you can have one here!  Reason being,the sheer frustration factor of RNGesus.  

Now this is a tricky one, a Really tricky one.  On the one hand, Civ was the first 4x game I ever played on the good old Commodore Amiga back in the early 90s, and BOY did I fricking Love the turd out of it!  But oddly, having currently played Civ 1, 2, 3 and 4 + BtS with 5 in library, I actually prefer 1!  Nowt beats the original, eh?  

1 had it all, and although the world is never big enough for my liking in any of the iterations of the game, 1 was just perfection.  2 was literally a carbon copy with Alpha Centauri tacked on the end as a 2nd world to play concurrently with  the 1st (Earth, obvs), but there was no civilopaedia so you had no idea what anything did and you were starting from scratch again with a single settler - I could never get anything going and quickly grew tired of it.  

Now we get to 3.  The last in the line before they changed what everything did in 4 - I hated this!  As in your city improvements effects all changed in 4.  So 3 is good for keeping the old style with a few changes, mostly extra stuff, but I noticed they got rid of supermarkets!  So a limit on your growth!  They also nerfed transport capacity - like Transport from 8 to 6, and Carriers from 8 to sodding well 4!?  Booo!  

However, these are just annoyances.  By far the worst is the literally offensive rng.  This has two parts also:  The fact that I always used to play on the easiest setting simply because I always wanted the longest game I could and the higher the level the sooner the game ended - however, even with the new facility to turn off ALL victory conditions, it Still ended in 2050 with a warning in 2030 that you had 20 years left....so just wrap up your civilization please, vacuum the floors and lock the doors on your way out of existence - wtf!?  

Anywhos....I decided to play on just the 3rdsetting.  Out of what....9, 10, a dozen?  I forget.  But that's besides the point, the point being that it was still on the 'piss easy' side of things.  AND YET....I started to pay particular attention to combat results.  It was glaring in its conclusion.  Seriously, 80% of Equal battles with identical units would end in a loss for my side regardless of attack or defence or terrain bonuses.  Even my F*&^ing Battleships would regularly be beaten by F!""¬£ing Cruisers, Destroyers ffs and Even SUBMARINES who suck!!  The latter only being good for their ability to target a specific ship - kill Transports!  And once enemy has Stealth Bombers your cities are fkd.  I had the missile defence improvement, 4 Jet Figthers and SIXTEEN missile units in 1 city and they killed 1/10.  They destroy everything but missile, factory, aqueduct and hospitals.  Kills all but 1 citizen.  All ships and planes and defending units last.  Wtf is the point.  Whereas my Stealth Bombers miss almost 50%.  

Sorry for the rant.  The 2nd part being the oddity of how the rng worked on a turn basis.  Very strange.  I saved and repeated certain movements.  Once the save slot is reloaded, the result was ALWAYS the same, yet different from original play.  I actually had an enemy unit next to my base which I attacked with about 6 units that ALL died, EVERY $&(¬£W*& TIME!!  I changed simply the square from which I attacked and hey presto, I killed it.  This is just F&^%ing warped.  

I wanted to finish this game before writing, but I was dealt a totally turd hand from the offset - I used archipelago so each nation would have its own land.  I got the second smallest island with a quarter of it at the south pole so all tundra and almost NO resources at all!  Literally I got Iron and Spices.  That was it!  No Saltpetre, no Coal, no Oil, no Rubber.  Come late game, without Oil/Rubber you are pretty much screwed.  (Note:  You have Settlers and Workers in this third iteration of Civ instead of Settlers who eventually evolved into Engineers and did everything.  You can now no longer change every square into whatever terrain you wish - tundra is useless and cannot be altered, also mountains cannot be settled and if you settle on a resource it does not provide the benefit, all cities give the same 2 food 1 shield with only the trade changing) 

Now, randomly new deposits appear, and some disappear - just as I build a city amongst another empire to try and get a deposit!  Unbelievable!  So way after Coal had passed its use, a deposit appeared on my land!  At least I could build railways.  I did get Uranium and Aluminium which are end stage game Resources.  However, they give very little benefit compared to Oil and Rubber.  E.G.  You are stuck with Riflemen whilst everyone else is not only beyond Infantry but building Mech Inf, or I've got TOW Inf compared to their Modern Battletank.  Coupled with the rng, I got massacred every time.  I could only build Nuclear Submarines and thankfully eventually Aegis Cruisers whilst the computer players are knocking out Battleship after Battleship (ironically they seem to prefer Aegis when they get them).  I actually got Oil just as I was trying to settle next to a deposit, again in enemy territory.  Again, unbelievable.  Or not, it seems.  But I never got Rubber.

Hopefully this serves as a clearer introduction and review of this game I have loved since my teenage years. 

For Newcomers, I would not recommend this as a first civilization game to get into for the following reasons that should be noted. This game has some complications for some to play the game, most can be resolved with a bit of file management, but most remaining and introduced bugs (mainly sound bugs) must be self-remediated and through self-experience some can be painful, i.e.  ‚ÄúThe Diplomacy Menu Sound bug‚Äù.  However, if you have the know-how or willingness to learn, there are helpful guides and threads on both Steam and CivFanatics to resolve these issues. 

Additionally, for newcomers to both Civ 3 and 4X games in general, Civ 3 is rudimentary in its design, but at its time served as a novel concept. Civilization III was the first Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization game published outside their MicroProse days. It brought graphic and visual design innovations including more emphasis on their 2.5D graphic sprites while keeping with an isometric layout. That being said, the graphics in vanilla setups have not ‚ÄúStood the Test of Time‚Äù, but as with many things, this game maintains a faithful modding community with thousands of available content additions provided freely to the community. 

For all its faults, it does keep to its promise, it is a fully complete game, which in this modern gaming scene, a complete game can be a refreshing breath. And it is a game that you can get into fast, with a descriptive Civlopedia that can teach you core fundamentals of the game, however no tutorial exists for this game. It can be a game that can be easy to learn for strategy game-lovers but will provide a challenge all the way into the higher difficulties, though at the expense of AI just being given powerful bonuses as the difference between difficulties. 

Now onto the review for those coming from other Civ games and other 4X games. Should you get this game, keep the following things in mind. The games UI can be un-intuitive for some, most of it is done through right-clicking on cities and units to interact with their drop-down menus that pop up. However, there are plenty of hot-keys available for units‚Äô available actions. This game solely favors ‚ÄúWide-Builds‚Äù and so you will always be incentivized to continue expanding and producing vast quantities of units, which can be a drag in the endgame when micro-management becomes exhausting at times. 

Game speed is something that can‚Äôt be altered within the game and instead is dependent on scenario-based games. And once the basics are learned and you are proficient with the game, a single player game can be played out completely within a few hours. It really has served as one of those plug-n-play strategy games, and for a 4x game, is still exemplary in that role. 

I mentioned micro-management, this game is pretty neat in the sense it feels extremely city based. Happiness and discontent are based on population solely and is dealt with on a per-city basis. Additionally, science and gold production are one and the same, with a national budget slider controlling your science and treasury growth, as well as, money spent on your citizen‚Äôs happiness, while culture is often based on the physical development of your cities. With such a simple rule-set, games are straightforward and feel extremely grounded. 

The last thing I want to high-light but was mentioned repeatedly already. This game has an extensive modding community, and while it may not be as active, it maintains a large archive of files, use at your own risk, but many overhauls and noteworthy mods have installation guides and more. Finally, this game has many files found in the file browser, just right-click the game on steam to access those files. Play the World and the original Civ 3 (no-dlc) can be found, each of these with their scenario and rules editors. Modding is extremely easy for this game (barring overhauls) and the guides are really amazing, big shout-out. I have made my own unpublished modifications myself, with little background in modding previously. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So is this review a little too wordy and you need that zoomer brevity, no worries I break down the pros and cons here as bullets.
Pros:
-	The game is straightforward, with player guides and an in-game encyclopedia of rules, concepts clear and concise. 
-	A Potato could run this game, but if you take the modding route, RAM and CPU power will be your friend. Late Game Lag is also a phenomenon found in this game. 
-	Combat Units are very clear, and fill classic niches in games, Offensive, Defensive, Maneuver, Ranged and Siege Units, with Aerial Units being added much later with rules similar to Siege Units. 
-	Science, Culture and Gold Production is straightforward with majority city-based empire management. 
-	Wonderful CivFanatics Community and Modding Community, as well as Steam Guides

Cons:
-	Combat is outdated, with most Units fighting until their own destruction or the enemy unit‚Äôs. Additionally, based on simple dice-like combat, so expect the classic Civ 4 Catapult kills Tank scenario on rare occasion. 
-	Diplomacy is easily exploitable, especially for the AI to cheat together and gang up on you, namely through alliances and Tech Trading. 
-	Difficulty scales based on AI cheats and bonuses.
-	It‚Äôs an old game, bugs arise, and the graphics aren‚Äôt the prettiest. Additionally, it used to be very difficult to get the game to start on Windows 7 and 8.1. Issues minimized with Windows 10, but no experience with Windows 11 installation of the game.
Note: Many of the Cons can be minimized by altering values in scenario/rules editors available in the game files or larger community. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This final section is for Multiplayer and personal history with the game. Multiplayer is not something I am familiar with any expertise. To my understanding, it exists and still has old veterans of the game. Multiplayer guides and strategies exist and are probably your best bet to getting into Multiplayer. I believe, Steam allows you to play MP directly nowadays, or it‚Äôs hosted through GameRanger (though this was back in 2018/2019). I have been playing this game since 2010 or so (on physical copies of the game), it became my introduction to the Civilization series and separately 4X games outside the old retro Warlords III/IV games. Now in my late twenties, this game still serves as one of my fonder memories and game I find myself returning to. Whether you get it on sale or you pay its already cheap price, it's completely worth it in my eyes!

I don't know if you CAN continue to run your civilization after a victory, because the 2 times I did get an endgame and went to click ""OK"", my game immediately freezes and stops working, making me have to quit the game.
Overall, it's a very fun game for you to pass the time, but it's going to be a quite the downer if you want to fully invest in your civilization for as long as you want (which would usually be ""forever and ever"" in some cases).
Overall, this game is a 8.5/10 in my opinion.

It also struggles to start or work well on my Windows 10 Pro.  I'm never sure when the game will hang, and it often does around the Fireaxis screen when just booting up or after entering the new game conditions.  

I suppose it may be possible, if one was willing to take the time and effort, to install a Windows 2000 emulator and get Steam to work with it somehow, that the game might run smoothly.

AI is [b]ruthless[b/], even in lower difficulties. It will send waves of units in an intelligent way, rather than just crashing and dying against a strong city they will pillage and seek weaker targets and gradually eat away at your territory. You will be the subject of joint declarations of war. You will be nuked. Sometimes multiple times. And just when you think you are winning, within 20 turns you will be on the edge of losing.

It makes the AI in later Civs (looking at you especially, #6!) seem like it's designed for infants. How they can get it right in 3 yet wrong in 6 really beats me.

Of course, there are some annoyances. The 'death stack' of endless AI units piling down on your cities and running unchecked through territory is irritating, and time consuming to deal with. To get ahead, you really need to micro-manage pops in cities. Pollution pops up too frequently and too early, being another micro-managed tedium. The wonders are bland, and are hard to get even on mid-difficulties. Even the wonder movies in 2 made them meaningful whereas in this it's just 'meh'. There's only one great person, a general, which you need to create armies, and you can win a ton of battles yet still be without one throughout the entire game. Golden ages might happen once or never. 

But that AI makes it a real challenge, and little things like the palace and city views are what they should have kept in later versions.

To get this game running in your desktop resolution. Find conquests.ini in the conquests folder (*\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete\Conquests)
and add:
keepres=1

If you require a custom resolution, also without potentially changing your desktop resolution with the above ini line.
Use this:
https://www.bcheck.net/apps/reso.htm
I recommend 1600x900 for 16:9 on a 24 inch monitor. The city menu will be 4:3 regardless, but I don't mind. There are custom menus and stuff over at civfanatics.com

This game's music can glitch out, stuck in a loop, and with no music for leader negotiations.
Here's a fix:
https://www.indirectsound.com/
Extract the two files into the conquests folder.

Even discounting these game-breaking glitches, the gameplay has not held up after all of these years.

The classic Civilization game that has truly stood the test of time is Civilization IV. Get that game instead of this one. Or if you want a 2D classic experience similar to Civilization II / III, but more refined, then play Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. You can buy that one on GOG.

Also you would think that bombing (modern me, all others ancient start), the ancient enemies would get old, but trust me it is great fun, with locked alliance option, you can have 31 enemies and fight them, all at once...Note: If you want to use editor, you need to find it first, in the Civ 3, directory and then use help menu to teach you what is what. It is the best help menu I encountered anywhere (not just gaming) , but still far from perfect. Anyway enough said, buy a game and play on easier level, as playing, Sid difficulty, without the editor, is not much fun. AI gets 3 settlers (to your one) and advances 2.5 times faster than you, in technological age. I played a game now-days, without editor and with all my knowledge of the game, all AI had tanks, while I had swordsman's. But, with editor, I created games, in which only I can build, all the Wonders of the World. Lol. It is about having fun, not adhering to, Mr Data's, sense of justice. It is all about abundance and only then, realism - only when it is fun to do so...I also deleted coal, from the game, in order to delete, railroads as they are, too unrealistic, with its infinite movement, on those railroads. So, game, with just roads, is way more entertaining and realistic, at the same time. But, even without editor, Civ 3 is so much better, than Civ 5 or six, and I have never completed, either Civ 5 or 6, but played, Civ 3 instead, even though I own all three games. In Civ 5 and 6, they destroyed the game, by not allowing to place, more than one unit, per hex. I spent more time, trying to place units, on the map, than playing the actual game, overall. Civ 4, on the other hand, I played, 1 to 50, compared to, Civ 3. That tells you all you need to know about this franchise...Civ 3: graphics, concept and editor, is the best, in the series, so you can not go wrong. There is some issues with interface, as it is poorly done, in a sense, that automatic unit activation, is all over the place, and it makes game harder to play. Also AI, does not use artillery, armies or sea invasions properly, but every game's AI is still like that, even now-days, and if you are looking for perfect computer game - you end up playing none...Enough said - have fun, anyway, and good luck....",1679808152,1691404603,True,36,0,0.785727500915527344,0,True,False,False

It's relatively simple, there arent many menus and UI elements so if youre coming from the newer games itll feel like youre missing a lot of information. Mechanically there isn't a ton of depth either, the focus is on expanding like crazy and then micromanaging your population and finances and everything more intently vs the more specialized mechanics and strategies of the newer games. It makes each game and all of your cities feel pretty generalized and the game itself have a lot less character to be honest. All in all it seems much more like a scaled-up, turn based version of Age of Empires than what I'm used to from Civ at this point. Its also extremely long, research is way slower and you stay in each era much longer than the other games as well, which isn't inherently a bad thing if you like longer games anyway (I usually play epic speed in the other games so it doesn't really bother me). Edit: I'm realizing that there are less ""eras"" in the game than in its sequels, eg. the ancient and classical era are merged, medieval and renaissance are merged, etc. so each age is much longer but there are fewer of them so it probably balances out.

I will give it a thumbs up, I didnt entirely dislike it though it doesnt scratch the same itch. I do especially like the atmosphere of the game, the visuals and music are pretty interesting. I'll probably come back to it at some point when I feel I want something to fill that niche. And considering its very cheap I would say its worth picking it up and trying it regardless. I do recommend looking up a guide for your first game if youre coming from the newer games like me, the flow of the game is just so different and a lot of concepts dont translate over as much as you would think.",1661166105,1682705617,True,7,0,0.610722184181213379,0,True,False,False

Anyone picking up a 22 year old game in this day and age either has a fondness for unrefined and quite clunky game or a heavy dose of the memberberries.. However in the case of old Civilisation games the graphics have truly not altered that much of the core gameplay that will be very familiar to enjoyers of the later Civ-titles. Personally I picked this title up to game through the ‚ÄúMiddle-earth: Lord of the Mods‚Äù pack that truly transformed the generic Gandhi vs Attila gameplay into a more mellow fantasyesque theme where you can shoulder the mantle of Theoden, KING! in an all out struggle for domination against the forces of darkness.. 

The base game is fine and has aged quite well, however there are alot of players reporting issues with compatibility and getting it to play smoothly. This is the pure bane of retrogaming these days and though I had no problems with my arguably ok-ish rig your mileage may vary. If you truly enjoy the other civ-titles this is more of the same, and if you, like me, was there 3000 years ago, bashing in barbarian skulls and taking names, you might find a strange familiar feeling when booting up this relic of a bygone past. 

I recommend it, but I assume I'm already preaching to the choir.. Who in their right mind would pick up a 22-year old Civ title on a whim? Well, in that case, good on you kind fellow, we will make a deity out of you yet!

The art style is pleasing without having any extra glam, the soundtrack is ridiculously good, and the UI makes a lot of sense once you come to grips with it.

An overhead strategy game that allows for a surprising amount of creativity, variation in play and replay value. The world editor that comes alongside it is an amazing addition that makes it very difficult to get tired of. 

Whether you want to sit in one little spot and grind til your wrists break, expand outward and conquer the map, try a unique challenge, or utterly decimate every last rival until you're the last one left on the map, this game gives you a huge amount of customization both in gamestyle and winning conditions. It's also fantastic how after so long this game still has multiplayer support, meaning even friends across the world can wage war with each other, whether you want to do it turn based or simultaneously.

I do dock a few tiny points for how slow multiplayer loading can be, but given it's such an old game and only the third installment in a huge franchise with multiple spinoffs and is grinding up toward its 7th mainline title, I can fully understand how and why the internet and LAN options are not entirely optimized.

Especially considering that nowadays this game is only 5$ for the complete package including all the DLC originally released, I HIGHLY recommend this one to anyone who likes strategy games. Sure, the later games have better graphics, different strategies and may add some features that make this one fairly outdated in comparison, it's still an absolute blast to play and worth giving a shot if you haven't already, or coming back to if you've been ignoring it for awhile.

In total, I should have clocked around 4000-5000 hours on Civ 3 Vanilla, Play theWorld and Conquest. This game is very satisfying. I can allow myself to share the following about Civilization 3: Complete edition:

1) You can allow yourself to play with mouse only. This is not only very convenient but it is also a testimony for an almost perfect GUI.

2) Well arranged icons, buttons and menus. Everything is exactly where you expect it to be.

3) This version, the complete edition is the best you can have. Each civilization in this game feels unique and each special unit feels special. With Conquest and this Complete edition, they finally managed to find the balance.

They finally managed to fix the issue with the Great Person: it really provides +20% Scientific Output. Although, you might want or need to spend it on a Wonder?! You never know, as no two games are the same.

Always play in such a way, that you use the specific bonus for your civilization. When your special unit wins in battle, you will have a Golden Age! Never forget about that. If you are a peaceful builder, then build wonders, which triggers Golden Ages for your specific type of civilization.

Stack all ""Double Scientific Output"" wonders in one city.

Always try to produce an Army, which to be victorious. Then, you can build more armies and after the Pentagon, you can have 4 units per Army. After you produced the maximum amount of Armies, you can disband the oldest ones (with older obsolete units) and build a brand new one, full with the latest and deadliest units.

Do not go for dead-end research (Steam Engine, Fascism, etc.), especially if you have a small scientific lead, so that you can gain an even bigger margin. Never underestimate the power of the carrier! Always try to get Philosophy first (one free Technology), then the Great Library and then Republic. If you meanwhile manage to get some resources and roads, plus save yourself from conflicts, then you will win later in the game. If not, then Monarchy/Feudalism is the right way, especially if you will not have any luxury resources. In such scenarios, you can skip researching Republic, as there is Democracy down the line. Also, if you do not have luxury resources and nobody to trade with, then Sistine Chapel is a must.

I might one day write a ""how-to play civ"" manual for all civ games with the most optimum strategies for each game, according to the amount of resources, the terrain you are on and the neighboring civs around you, as per turn 10 or 15. Remember, every turn counts and sometimes games are being lost for 1-2 turns.

Never-ever underestimate Espionage! Never!

I didn¬¥t had my own PC and played with my friend Benjamin on his father¬¥s Computer. I was so excited about the game that I told everyone from the 4000 BC timeline until about 2000 AD. The cities and nations, which you could expand at will, were such a nice game concept that when I wasn¬¥t sitting in front of the computer with Bejamin, I would spend hours in my children¬¥s room imagining how our civilization might be progressing.

The second part of Civilization was published almost 5 years later. In the meantime I had my own PC. So I already played the second part extensively and had partly built up such large nations that the rounds seemed endless to me. I still remember a score with Russia on the real map; it was one of my greatest saves in Civilization II.

Sid Meier¬¥s Civilization III was published in 2001. When i heard about it, I immediately ran to the computer store near my parents¬¥house. I begged my parents until they agreed to buy me a new PC. So, i ran back to the computer store and bought a new PC for Civilization III.

And I have to say it was the best Civilization of all time up to that point. The intro was cinematic at the time and the animated units enthralled me so much I thought I was in Sid Meier heaven. The expansion of the palace is also still present in this part, wich was taken over from the first part.

Okay, you could see this text as a clumsy advertisement for Sid Meier¬¥s Civilization series. But in truth, only the little boy is speaking here, who sat down in front of the game Civilization a long time ago and has been a real Sid Meier fan ever since.

That quirky charm is huge here and unlike some of the other nostalgic games of the time, this doesn't have nearly the same difficulty curve. If you set it to a higher difficulty the AI will definitely make quick work of you but lower ones make it enjoyable to discover or get your bearings after not playing it for 20ish years.

Overall: Civ 3 is one of the classics that brought me into civilization series. I have probably hundreds of hours in this game if we include my disc playtime. This game has a lot of depth that may not be noticed at a first glance. Coupled with the dlc you'll have a civ 4 experience for the most part. Game graphics are pretty old but fitting for a 2001 game. The music is nostalgic and inspiring/relaxing. There are plenty of mods and maps on the forums still being made today. This game has steep difficulty spike as the Ai cheat in a a lot of ways and have no problem landing musketmen on your shores while you're still learning how to make walls in your cities. The combat is very rng heavy allowing for the infamous spearman beating a tank situation to happen. Get this game if you're looking to play a cheap civilization that still holds it's weight. You won't be disappointed.

This is my favorite installment of the Civ series. The game has a slew of nice preferences to choose from, even including an aid for the colorblind. More of a board game feel as opposed to strategy. STELLAR soundtrack.

[b]‚äñ[/b]New to the game? Go into the options and turn the tutorial on. It‚Äôs off by default for some reason. The cutscenes look horrible because of age and stretching. Resolutions are ROUGH. Compared to modern installments, the opponent civs act rather erratically, to the point of being nonsensical. There is no balancing, so some Civs are OP and others you would ideally never play.

[b]‚úé[/b]It's easy to lose track of time in Civ3. It's great fun and I think it hits a goldilocks zone of being more succinctly-designed than 4 or 5 but more appealing than 1 and 2. If you don‚Äôt have nostalgia for it though, it might just be the game you know and love but with less features.

When you have experienced franchises like this from the very first one you can not be disappointed unless the developers do something really stupid.

Thankfully they kept it close to its origins.

With several newer ones out, it doesn‚Äôt hurt with these older ones, yes the graphics are obviously older but the essence of the game is there.

For the collection, sure why not.

Recommended : Why not
Replayability : A rough yes
Drawbacks : It‚Äôs just an older game

I sat idly by as other civilizations were taking over my cities, unable to do anything but defend! Clicking on enemy units does nothing. There's no button on the screen for it either. The escape key just exits the game, no ingame settings while you are in a match. I don't care that it's an older game, plenty of games during that time had tutorials and tooltips and control schemes listed in the ingame menu!!! There's an option in the main menu that says ""Tutorial"", but I ticked it on and there was still no tutorial! What the actual fuck? Many options in this game are broken or don't even work at all! I will say that the price I paid for it was about right ($2.00USD), but I wish I didn't even spend that. I won't even be playing this at all anymore. Waste of time and money.

At the beginning a video game adaptation of the Civilization board game, it began to be a universe of its own. I've played every single games from Sid Meier the first being Civilization III. this game defined my entire personality and made me discover at the age of four countless cultures and heroes. I'm glad to have grown with Civilization III and Age of Empires II. 

This game is in my opinion the best of the franchise. I don't care about graphics when the gameplay and overall design is of this quality. When I was a kid I've played this game for hundred of hours without being bored and I didn't have the complete edition at that time. The excitement of finding the original game on steam (my cd is too old for windows 10 and 11) with double the number of civs that I remembered plus scenarios plus the original map editor... It was too much. If like me you grow with this game, you can understand the overall joy of finding this masterpiece.

The gameplay is fantastic, as good as I remembered. You have unique game mechanics that no other Civ games retried. It is a shame and at the same time makes it rare gem. To name a few of theses unique mechs: the palace, the best diplomacy system of all civ Games, custom civilization principle, easy city management...

if you like graphics with big flashing screens and Uncanny Valley Nightmares you will find this game outdated and boring. Civ III does not give instant gratification. It also has a comedic tone with the leader portraits that are changing in each era. Civ VI may have been inspired by the goofy and well tought designs of some characters from Civ III, while Civ V is more serious.

On the multiplayer level, I can't say much.  I never were a multiplayer guy for Strategy games. But I intend to do it soon. I did some games with my brother and AI but not full players. However the multiplayer screen is well optimized.

However I've found some disturbing bugs and compatibility problems in this version that can break the entire experience. For instance, you will never hear the diplomacy sound of leaders because of the two channel trouble. Also when you finish a game and click on the X button, the game will freeze. You must click on Esc. This is ruining the game in some ways but some awesome individuals found the solution to these bugs.

To conclude: If you enjoy good gameplay over graphics, this game is for you. The game was well put into modern computers and i wish the same thing could be done to Civ I and Civ II that were also fun to play.",1653665683,1653665683,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 This game is completly about RNG not about Your ""skill""... i mean it SOMETIMES do matter and it can help... but imagine that im starting game, its giving me just a banana and tons of jungles all around, then i discover rome... guess what they got on capitol?...

River that Covers 11 tiles ( +11 Gold ) Wines x5 ( thats a lot of extra gold and food ) Hills and Bonus Grasslands ( that gives a lot of shields = fast production ) 

and im sitting with a fking BANANA IN JUNGLE... they comes to me... they demand my technologies... i dont give them and they declare war to me... 

Its all about fking RNG if You get really bad start You can't do shit...
 Other time i was playing on Archipelag with 60% Water...

i got spawned on tiny islands with 2 computers... i was able to put 5 cities...
 and guess what... ONE COMPUTER SPAWNED ON GIANT CONTINENT AND HAD LIKE 20 NEW CITY 2... when You build many many many cities and game is running out of names for cities it just names them with ""new"" in front so for example ""New Berlin"" etc. if game runs out of ""New City"" names it starts with numberst at the end... ""New Berlin 2"" etc...

So yee... i was sitting and having war with 2 computers with 5 cities...
meanwhile one computer was able to build so many fking cities i would never be able to defeat him no matter fking what...


And searching for good spawn is so F annoying... 
 most of the time You are getting Snow, Desert, Jungle, Swamps...

Snow is just killing You... You can't do anything about that no matter what culture / tech... only way to build City on snow is building near coast so u can build Harbor asap and get food from water...

Desert is unplayable unless u play with Agriculture Civilisation that can actualy make use of desert... but its still better to play on Grasslands and have it for FREE

Jungle and Swamps are possible to be fixed to Grasslands...
 IN ONLY 20 TURNS / TILE OFC !...

20 Turns is worth ( in time ) 5 Roads ( +5Gold ) 
20 Turns is worth ( in time ) connecting two cities...
20 Turns is worth building Castle...

but ofc. You can also spend 20 turns to make your tile playable...

if You spawn in middle of Jungle like no single tile of grassland You can't even build settler ( unless u play agri / granary ) - unless u have banana or some other luxury...


Skill do help...
like for example if You first research Writing... then Philosophy and then switch to Math
 Math you getting for free ( not even single turn research )

or build order... many ppl don't know what to build and when...
 How corruption works etc... but even if they do... they can't rly do anything if having really terrible spawn...


I had very good Spawn once... near my capitol i had one luxury, then i found 5 more around and my ppl were rly happy, with more luxuries i could build much more settlers and units... i got to Modern Ages in 270 AD... You should be like in Medieval Ages in 270AD... and i had trains... thats how unfair is very good Seed... 



if that game had like ""Spawn Protection"" so u can't spawn in very very very bad location... it would be much more playable... 

like for example game should make sure that you can build Settler... so u are not stuck... imgine that it is possible to spawn in middle of mountains... you can't do anything... if u put city in middle of mountains u NEVER gonna be able to build Settler... and im not saying like in 20 or 40 turns... EVEN 500000 TURNS... Your city never gonna reach population of 3 ppl... and YES i DID got spawned in MIDDLE OF MOUNTAINS... 

It is easy For( ;; ) loop that can check spawn location for each player...
 and see few If( ) statements to make sure that at least spawn is playable... 


But game don't have that... so u have to start new game like 50+ times sometimes...
in order to get good seed... seed that u can actualy play...

or well... You can get any seed and realise at turn 50 that You spawned on tiny island that is half jungle half desert and u have space only for like 6 cities that not gonna grow above 5 population till turn like 200+...

Meanwhile computer having fun with 50+ cities and 5 luxury items...


Ahh and btw. computers are all cheating agains You...
 if You enter their terrain without permissions they start sending you messages to remove your army or they will declare war... but if other computer is sending units thru other computer land... its completly fine... computers players know they both want to unfair f**k player so why not...

Trading technology with computers is not good option...
 Because if You give that to ONE computer you give it to EVERY Computer...

most of the time if u trade tech to one computer it will give it to other computers for almost free...

Even more unfair is that computers know EVERYTHING... they don't care about Map... You have city with no units to defend in MIDDLE of Your empire?... let me send some units to take it for free.... and YES computers it always targeting cities that he DONT EVEN SEE and he never saw those cities on map... like for him it would be ""Blank"" / ""Void"" because he never scouted this terrain... but HE KNOWS YOU DONT HAVE UNTIS THERE... and he is just sending one galley just to take this city for free... because he knows there are no units... even if he should don't know about this city existing...

And yes computers can simply cheat money too...
 If You have negative income u have problems... ( for example u losing units )

but what about computer?... ahh don't worry he can have -10000 money and still be fine... money?... what are money... computer have everything for free...

like how TF computer can make 2 untis in single turn?... even if u Hurry production...
or if You even DOUBLE HURRY production ( this is ""High Skill Trick"" - When you take one of your citizen to army and then just disband him to get some free shields ( to lower second hurry prod ) and then hurry with money )

its good for hurrying expansive buildings that way... for example if you want to build offshore platform in 1 turn you would have to either give 999 population or 1200 gold ( around i dont remember exact number )

but You could use double Hurry method and pay with 1 population and ~450 gold ( especialy good if Your city is full - so u dont waste food )

but somehow... computer knows even better tricks...
because he can makes 2 units / turn... which is normaly NOT POSSIBLE from game rules... but yee... its computer... its cheating...

i rly don't understand why some Devs thinks ( Computer Cheating = Hard and Fair Game )


No... when computer is cheating its not fking fair...


It just shows how lazy they are... instead of making good AI that makes good decisions... they just give computer free stuff and they call it ""Hard Mode"" ... 

thats why i hate diff settings in all stupids games that have it...
 i always try to play on Hardest possible cuz wtf... plz... just make this game good and playable just make good AI and don't give computers free stuff... 


What if i start Cheat Engine and make everything in single turn?...
 Does that means IM SO GOOD ?...

No... it means im just cheating... as name says ""Cheat Engine""...

So why Dev thinks ""Computer Cheats = Computer Skill""
 Cheat = Cheat... no matter if computer of player is cheating its still cheating...



Thats why im not recommending this game... cuz its simply unfair for player and mostly based on RNG...



I have other Civ games...
 but only this one looks good... only better looking Civ game is Beyond Earth... but well... it doo looks nice... but its also weird Civ game... 

Civ 3 get big + for having rly good layout and easy to read graphics...
 Other civ games especialy 4 looks rly bad... like its so hard to ""understand"" what you look at in other civ games...


So yee... its best Version of Civ in my opinion...

This game does not have the variety of effective playstyles that other games offer. However, the balance of thr game and the quality of the scenarios is as good as it gets.

Running an effective empire is far more micro-management intensive than in any other installment in the series. Resources like food and production are not stockpiled in cities, so they will have to have their yields carefully observed to be as efficient as possible. You also have to deal with and manage corruption draining away at your resources. This extra skillset is not completely necessary, however, unless you want to tackle the higher difficulty levels (Demigod+).

Additionally, there is less of a focus on diplomacy than you may be used to in later Civilization games. A lot of the disposition modifers are not explained in-game properly and you will need the wiki.

The highlight of this game is in the warfare and military-industrial complex. Being able to field and fund an effective army while simultaneously growing your empire tall and wide is the most important aspect of Civilization 3. Units stack on top of each other, so controlling chokepoints and defensive positions is far more effective. There are other nuances, but this is just an example.

Overall, I think this game is definitely worth buying if you enjoyed any other Civilization game. It is especially recommended if you enjoyed the turn-based combat of other games.

As a bonus if you read this far, I‚Äôve ranked the scenarios in order of which are the most fun to play (or replay over and over, like I have):

1. Middles Ages ‚Äî well-balanced scenario with new units and technologies
2. Rise of Rome ‚Äî elongated version of ancient era, with a heavy focus on military and expansion instead of building tall
3. Sengoku - Sword of the Shogun ‚Äî new tech tree and resources, fresh take on the game after you‚Äôve gotten bored of vanilla
4. Napoleonic Wars ‚Äî simulates regular game industrial warfare well
5. Wonders of the Ancient World ‚Äî Extended ‚Äúancient‚Äù era, but fun map
6. Age of Discovery ‚Äî Fun concept, but very short scenario
7. Mesoamerica ‚Äî Extended ‚Äúancient‚Äù tech tree
8. Fall of Rome ‚Äî Pay attention to the Elimination ruleset
9. WWII in the Pacific ‚Äî It‚Äôs actually terrible. I don‚Äôt recommend playing it at all unless you are a completionist",1649463275,1649463275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Decided to revisit civ 3 for one game after more than a decade.

Due to tech trading the AI will constantly breathe down your neck. They will have modern armies capable of waging war in the later eras.
Techs are also consistently used as bargaining chips in war declarations and peace talks.
The AI is acting irrational sometimes declaring suicidal wars when they have nothing to gain (except maybe raze an unprotected city deep within your borders).
Mutual protection pacts are very weird as they can be signed while you are at war, and will only trigger when your are attacked within your own borders.
You can pay other AI to join one of your wars (20 turn military alliance), and if you don't your opponents just might. You cannot bribe your opponents into wars you don't take part in, nor can you negotiate peace treaties for other civilizations.
There are no denouncements, friend declarations or economic alliances but you can at least sign trade embargoes.

Units are fairly cheap and expendable. They have to fight to the death unless they are able to retreat. You need a few dozen units to successfully wage a war. This leads to the game devolving to a few stacks of doom, as there is no 1 unit per tile limitation. An unchecked AI might attack you with hundreds of units while pushing dozens more per turn. Bombardment units are very strong when amassed. Airplanes can even kill units. Units need transports to travel across the sea. All units cost 1 commerce per turn, unless they are captured (workers, siege) so you are encouraged to maintain a modern military.

Slavery is weak for rushing projects (offering only 20 production per citizen sacrifice and lowering the city happiness for 20 turns). But it can be used as a tool for ethnic cleansing.
There is no production overflow (meaning you need to optimize the number of production a city is making to avoid wasting turns). There is also no research overflow, meaning you need to lower the slider before completing a tech.
The land grab by the AI in the early game is insane, and you need about 20 cities to prosper (too many cities to manage for my taste).
You can swap production at any time to any project, which means all wonders will disappear in rapid succession as the AI just swaps to the next available wonder. You can also prebuild with an expensive building before unlocking a new wonder. Chopping woods does not add production to a wonder.

The citizen ethnicity system is great (each citizen maintains their ethnicity on the map as free captured workers and inside cities where they will protest against war on their motherland. There is a small chance citizens are assimilated each turn based on your government. In the later game you can draft your population into conscript combat troops, but only your own nationals.

Cities need aqueducts and hospitals to grow past specific population limits (6, 12).
Infrastructure is very strong usually offering 50% yield bonuses.
Luxuries are very strong and fun to collect.
Since happiness is local and the settler cost does not scale up the only limiting factor to your expansion is higher and higher corruption.

The governments are fairly distinct and interesting. Revolution duration on the other hand is random and unfun (you lose 2 to 8 turns) if you're not religious.
Despotism debuff is awkward to work with as only a few resources are capable of providing more than 2 food. Republic and Democracy extra commerce bonus is not clearly described.
Your capital's location is crucial for your empire's productivity and corruption makes distant colonies almost unworkable. But at least it can be moved if you can afford the production.

Land is boring as there's only grassland, plains, desert, tundra, hills and mountains. Only flatland is able to support features like forests, jungles and marshes. They serve no purpose other than being removed (forests provide a measly 10 production, allow no improvements and protect somewhat against desertification)
Mountains are passable so it is harder to create choke points. The square grid also doesn't help. You need to make barricades in your border towns so that the AI cannot attack them in 1 turn. 
Improvements are boring, there are only mines and irrigation. Resources need only a road to be connected.
Roads are your empire's financial backbone due to their 1 commerce yield (especially under a Republic or Democracy). This means all land will have roads and railroads, making the landscape very ugly.
The land map is made out of squares which makes movement inferior to hexes.
Cities can only reach 2 tiles away from the city center (they can work at most 20 tiles), meaning there is rarely a reason to go over 20 population.
Late game you can fine tune the exact population number of a city based on its surrounding land (by turning irrigations to mines, training workers or drafting).
Since workers are so cheap you can force grow a new city by feeding workers into it.

Other than luxuries, strategic resources, techs and diplomatic agreements there isn't much to trade.
Espionage is somewhat useful. There is no religion.

Only one unit is required to capture/raze a city. (if undefended)
Units can freely trespass through your land opening you up to ugly sneak attacks. You can ask them to pull out but they might declare war (without being evicted from your lands).
You get a small return of production when you disband units in a city, making it possible to funnel production into it.
Re basing airplanes has unlimited range (OP). You can also re base nukes to submarines.
Armies pillage for free and can attack multiple times in a turn (OP).
Air bombing is realistic. You either damage/kill units, destroy city buildings, kill population or miss.

With the huge number of units in a war, it can get very tedious to control, especially since the game will annoyingly keep jumping between 'random' units. I get war weariness as fast as my population.
Pollution clean-up is annoying since you need to reassign the citizen to the tile.

The game is less complex than 4, 5 or 6. But still has an interesting charm and some unique features.

The 4X strategy genre can be a bit overwhelming and difficult to get into (though not as tough as grand strategy) but there are a couple games that have solid tutorials and less of a steep learning curve. Endless Space 2 and Stellaris come to mind at first, but...

... I'd be remiss to not talk about just how fantastic Civilization 3 is. Widely considered to be the greatest in the series, and one of the greatest 4X games of all time, Civ 3 is a brilliant example of why this genre is so fun. The progression design of the Civ series matches perfectly with the gameplay of the genre, allowing the player to begin at the start of a civilization and build their empire up through constant progression. That progression, however, is entirely up to the player. Want to be diplomatic and avoid wars? You can build your empire to do that. Prefer to just stomp on your enemies and conquer the world? Again, you can build your empire to do that. Want to isolate yourself for scientific progression or build a civilization upon trade? Those are also options.

In Civ 3, you never feel like you're being overwhelmed by a million gameplay systems but at the same time, you also never feel like you're being limited. In general, 4X is basically a sandbox take on turn-based strategy gaming and if you know me, you know I like my sandbox games. You may have heard that the Civilization games have always had that ""one more turn"" sort of gameplay and they are not joking. Every time I start up this game, I end up spending WAY more time than I planned to because it becomes addictive: you always want to take one more turn toward building your armies, or wonders of the world or progressing toward the next scientific unlock. You're always progressing to your goals.

I wouldn't say it's my absolute favorite 4X strategy game; that would be Stellaris. However, it is a landmark game that any strategy gamer should at least check out at some point. For that price point, really can't go wrong!",1647071099,1647071099,True,1,0,0,0,True,True,False

The new games are flashier, more tactical, less strategic. That's my opinion. Civ3 is the deeply complex, tile-based, strategy game that I have been coming back to for years and years, even after playing full games of Civ4 and Civ5.

Let me back up.

When I was a kid, I'd wake up every morning around 6am and play this before school. I was a kid, I played the lower difficulties and over a few years worked up to harder difficulties. I remember having trouble with the higher difficulties...it seemed like no matter what I did there was no way to keep up with how fast all the AIs expanded and they were highly aggressive.

I've found this to be the case. I normally play civ 5 and 6 on the 2nd or 3rd hardest difficulty and can reliably win. On this one, good luck. The AI seems to start off with a significant headstart on number of cities. Doing my best to build settlers and staff them with spearman, I could get a sizeable empire but could not keep up overall. I learned that I needed to keep my gold low or else the AI would bully me into taking my gold. If I ever refused to give them gold or techs, they would declare war on me. I've yet to win a war, even after a few pretty good attempts (barracks in the capital, pumping out swordsmen or horsemen, depending on what I had available). 

I'm beyond frustrated so I'm walking away from this for a long while, but if I had to write some thoughts on what is required to win at higher difficulties...
1. Succumb to their threats, never go to war. If possible, give any money that you have to the AI so you gain their favor, rather than wait for them to bully you for it.
2. Expand as far as you can, then build walls along the outskirts. Make sure you have 1-3 barracks pumping out good units.
3. Build up a supply of 3 catapults, and whatever your unit of choice is (preference for swordsman or medieval inf) and deal a decisive blow before they knew what hit them. Once you attack of them, be ready for every AI to declare war on you.
4. Strike a hard enough blow at 1 AI to be able to overwhelm them, and that may give you enough momentum to encourage the other AIs to declare peace, then let you push past them in tech. This strat does work in later civ games. If it works here, you'll have enough cities to gain a tech lead, and discourage the other AIs from bullying you, until you're ready to steamroll past them in the 3rd era or so.",1641968519,1641968519,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NOW TO CONTINUE!
I absolutely love it. Everything about it is just absolutely great, if you don't mind the graphics. This is my second Civ game, the first one being Civ 4. I enjoyed this one even more than that. Basically, buy the game. It IS worth the $5+tax. 

Sincerely,

UPDATE:
I now have 200+ hrs clocked and I want to update this.
It is still good. Very good. 
Not really much of an update, I'm just bored.

It was the first to add culture, and the civilization borders associated with the amount of culture you gathered. (Although Alpha Centauri, another Firaxis game, already used borders before.) it also added strategic and happiness resources to the game. Additionally units are now supported by gold instead of production. The scenarios are OK, but the real lasting game play is to be found in the random maps.

The various civillizations in the game are now more distinct as they now all have a unique unit, and a unique set of civilization traits. This does impact game play as each civilization now has each own best way to be played. But all the civilizations are still flexible enough that you can play any way you want too, and it is possible to win the game with any one of them. 

The main reason I enjoyed this version above any of the others is that the maps the game generates feel much more natural compared to any of the other games, Civilization II had the strange snake continents, while the maps in IV and V felt much smaller.

I bought the original DVD (or was it still on CD) release of the game when it game out and I used it all the way until my computer was changed to Windows 10. After that I bought the Steam version, as the original release didn't work anymore for me while the version from Steam works on Windows 10. The exception is the sound of the game which now has a repeating tick in the game music and the game sound effects get into continues loops.

The most controversial feature appears to be the strategic resource mechanic, which is argued to give geography a lopsided tactical significance. It‚Äôs a reasonable thing to complain about, but it also happens to be historically and sociologically accurate. Similarly, the use of rigidly-defined eras prevents nonsensical arrangements like developing cars before developing the wheel. Personally, I‚Äôm a fan of anything that shakes players out of complacency, especially in this genre where fans tend to gravitate to a couple of optimal strategies. The other additions brought by [i]Civ III[/i] are more putatively worthwhile, including air missions, bombardment, and especially culture, which allows a faction to expand its borders and overtake cities via overwhelming media presence.

More than just adding new features, [i]Civ III[/i] also removes some annoying old ones like universal zones of control and generally cleans up the gameplay of its predecessors with better mouse support and more direct access to the in-game encyclopedia. The pacing and micromanagement are still weak links, as they drag matches out long after their outcomes have been decided, but that‚Äôs arguably inherent to the formula. The aesthetics, on the other hand, would be problematic in any genre. The music is terrific, and the visuals are more appealing than before, but they still utterly fail to cleanly display the gameplay information they‚Äôre expected to. Meanwhile, the sound effects range from acceptable, to annoying, to just plain odd. Nevertheless, this is my favourite of the first three [i]Civ[/i] titles. The [i]Complete[/i] version is appropriately titled, too, as it combines the content of the two expansion packs with multiplayer that actually works.

When I was 14, I got struck down with depression. This led to me missing a lot of school in highschool and ultimately finishing 9th grade with a single credit.

I spent the rest of my teens trying to play catch up, finally receiving my high school diploma by age 19.

But when things seemed to be going well at 19, I was attacked and nearly raped. By the same relative who molested me my entire childhood. I became suicidal and was diagnosed with PTSD a year later.

At age 20, my mom died from cancer. She was a single parent and raised me all on her own since my deadbeat father left when I was 1.

I was now suffering from daily flashbacks due to my disorder.
Grieving the loss of the only parent I ever had.
And sobbing regularly thanks to the horrific things my father said to me while my mom lay dying in her hospital bed.

At 21, I dropped out of university.
I spent the rest of that year taking odd jobs at factories to pay my bills.

When I turned 22, I thought for sure it was my time to shine and begin living my life...

And then COVID happened.

I turn 23 on Dec 11.

I know I didn't waste my early 20s since I was suffering from so much traumatic shit in the span of a few years that others experience over a lifetime, some never at all.

But as I begin my 23rd year. I feel lost.
My PTSD has been in remission for over a year. And I've healed from the loss of my mother... but I'm struggling to shake the feeling that I lost so much time, and will always play catch up with others in the same life arena.

I don't really know why I wrote all this down, but I guess if there's any other lonely soul out there who happens to see my comment, I just want you to know that you got this.

We didn't choose our life circumstances.
We didn't ask for our lives to go off plan.

But we are alive
We're healthy
We've been blessed with another day

If you're the same age as me, our lives are only just beginning.
If you're older, you too can realize your dreams, escape the rigid safety found in your daily routine, and live the life you thought could never be possible.

If you still got a pulse, God still has a purpose.

If you're still hurting, talk to someone about it.

If you feel bored, get lost in a good book.

If you feel lost or confused, reconnect with that inner child and find time to spend doing the things you loved so much as a little one.

I hope to revisit this review in a few years, perhaps before my 20s are up so I can update how my life has gone since then. Til then...

Civilization III had big ups and downs. It‚Äôs an aesthetically beautiful time sink and similar to Heroes of Might and Magic and X-COM (although mechanically I would say Civilization is more similar to Settlers), it hypnotizes you every time you play it. You lose concept of real life and time and end up playing for several hours non-stop. I‚Äôve had the feeling it plays very much like a board game and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Civilization series were heavily influenced by them.

There is no real campaign. You decide the rules (map, weather, victory conditions etc.) and start your custom game which can easily take dozens of hours. There are many civilizations to choose from but they are diverse enough to offer unique gameplay. You start in ancient times, build cities, research technologies, conquer other civilizations. 

There are some aspects I did not really like though. Firstly, some early strategies have too much influence on your fate. Don‚Äôt build enough cities or invest enough in technology, you may find yourself in an unwinnable state. AI obviously cheats in harder difficulties so you‚Äôll have to play in specific strategies in order to win rather than a flexibility on strategies. Diplomacy is pretty much broken and the AI never accepts your fair proposals, making the entire game mechanic obsolete. Corruption may sound like an interesting idea but in the case of Civilization III, it does more harm than good. Also, in mid to late game, you end up micromanaging hundreds of units and one turn can take quite a long time. I think it would be fair to say a game in Civilization III takes way too long with plenty of downtime. 

I would say Civilization III aroused my interest to the series and I will definitely be playing other titles. On the other hand, I can‚Äôt ignore its flaws and I‚Äôm pretty confident I won‚Äôt return to Civilization III specifically.

WRONG. 

I kid you not, playing any Civ game that isn't 3 just makes me wish I was playing 3. And that's not nostalgia talking! 
Happiness? 3 handled it best. Diplomatic Victory? 3 handled it best. Governments? 3 handled them best. Combat? Troops not getting levels helps to keep things Macro, and instead troops can increase their helthbar. Soundtrack? 3s is best. Religion? Doesn't exist - religious buildings only give Culture / Happiness. That is something about subsequent games that I did like. 

Civ 3 does have one weakness, and it's pretty glaring. Group bombard. The various shortcuts for controlling large stacks works great, right up until you're using bombard units. And that can get    t e d i o u s.

Seriously hard version of Civ! Like music, I think if you played this when younger you need to come back. Younger players will probably avoid the dated graphics and miss the challenge.  

I bought this when it came out, tried it, and got side-tracked by life and Civ IV, which I assumed must be better. Bought it again, cheap, on Steam and just got back into it, and WOW! This is a much tougher game than any other Civ I have yet played. How tough? I have been playing different Civs since Civ I was new. I am used to usually trying to maximize my cities, population, etc., and running up my score. Just to get a viable civ, I had to set AI aggression to the lowest level, even while playing at the lowly ""Warlord"" level. And I am still behind in several areas. Even at such a low level, enemies seek any weak cities to attack, establish cities in any open space in your continent, and are generally aggressive. Even Gandhi is psychotic! 

OK, what about the game? Lots of changes. One is the increased role of random luck. Now certain resources are needed to build units and wonders, even after you discover the tech. No Iron mines in your land? So much for swordsmen, legions, tanks, etc. No horses? No cavalry, chariots, etc. No saltpeter? No firearm units at all (including naval.) Get lucky and have Ivory early? You can build the Statue of Zeus and generate super-cavalry centuries before your enemies have anything close. To get resources you can now build ""colonies"" away from cities. The diplomacy is unforgiving. Also, strategic resources only emerge when you can use them, again if you are lucky. So cut-down your jungles and marshes and your chances of oil and rubber go way down! Also, barbarians re-spawn if you leave any territory undeveloped. 

Each civilization also gets its own special units. Ancient civs get them early, like Aztecs, Incas, and Hittites. Modern ones have to wait for Panzers and F-15s (by which time they may not be around or have the needed resources. Characteristics also determine starting tech and advantages in science, exploration, industry, etc. So picking your starting civ is no longer just a beauty contest. 

Downsides too: Graphics are 19 years old and not much improved on Civ 2 (some versions were better.) City view and wonder animations are pretty dull, as is your palace. Automation is terrible. AI workers always want to build mines not irrigated farmland. So you need to be very hands-on in city management, etc. And, as mentioned, the AI is really almost way too hard. This game is NOT for the casual player who just wants to build a nice civilization and a Hall of Fame score. Even lowest difficulty settings feel 'impossible.' There is an actual 'Impossible"" level which is then superseded by the ""Sid"" level. I doubt I will ever make it to that one. I am not even sure Sid can win at that level! 

Since playing through, I have discovered a serious flaw, at least for me. When I reached the end, only once did the somewhat lame victory screen process. Since then I cannot get to a final screen, HoF, etc. Must lower my rating. This seems be a an issue with this version as it did not happen with CD-ROM. 

Bottom-line: $5 (or less on sale) buys you a whole lot of game for your money with hours of gameplay and even frustration. This is not for the casual gamer, but don't let the age and graphics fool you. This is a great challenge for hardcore 4X gamers! Don't be fooled that 4-6 must be harder than 3. This game makes Civ 4 look easy!",1606197905,1624580225,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons: There are many problems with the game. The first being lack of Steam Play/Proton support with this game. As the GOG version works there is no reason for it not too.

It was the first version that introduced so many of the features that just made sense to me, like resources being necessary to build things. I loved Civilization 1 and 2, but it always irked me to see Viking War Elephants, especially when the Vikings were coming from nowhere near elephant territory. The introduction of strategic resources was a double edged sword, I have often lamented the computer placing my civilization with a unique unit that requires horses in an area completely devoid of horses for instance, but overall their addition to the game has made a more realistic simulation. Late game fights for coal or oil just make sense. Now on to the bad parts - the graphics are dated, it's just a reality of playing older games. It's not as bad as a lot of older games, but it is a noticeable thing. It is also kind of a pain to play on a newer system. Higher resolutions make the entire interface too small to read, lower resolutions do weird things to the rest of my system. Widescreen monitor support is basically non-existent. I get it, why put a lot of effort into an older version of the game? That said, I'd probably pay close to full price for a remastered edition of this version of Civilization. I played this for thousands of hours back in the day, and I would not have upgraded to Civilization 4 if my wife hadn't bought it for me for my birthday.  Civilization 3 also lacks a few features from newer iterations of the franchise. I am cool with it's lack of religion mechanics, I thought I'd want them, and I enjoy them in Civ 5 (Civ 4's implementation was poorly done), but keeping things more generalized seems to make for a better play experience, unless holy wars are really your favorite thing.

Here's some of the reasons why:

- The graphics/visual display are just so clear, everything is so easy to see. It can feel like a lot is going on on the map, but this art style makes it really easy to take it all in.
- While I always felt this base game did lack things like religion, civics, and city-states, I never felt it was implemented so well in the other games that they rise above Civ III.
- Although you can manipulate the pacing of the game, the actual pacing of the game-play always felt great to me. Things like world size, how far troops move, how long it takes to start a war, conquer an enemy, grab a new resource, etc. 
- The soundtrack hits the themes of your scientific age really well. Whenever I was in the modern age, I really felt like my civilization had culturally & emotionally matured, and knew their place in the world. I felt the soundtracks reflected this journey.
- Wide range of civilizations, unit choices, wonders, structures, etc. Without feeling overwhelming.
- The AI are actually pretty challenging. On max difficulty, almost no one has beat the game, especially without trying ""cheap"" tricks. But, that actually makes it really fun for role-playing as a less powerful nation, trying to hang on to its identity throughout time without being wiped off the planet, or technologically backward. It's almost like they bundled ""The Sims"" for cities/civilizations into this game too!

The mod support for Civ III can really extend its shelf-life too. I have sparingly played the multiplayer, I was able to be perfectly satisfied with just the singleplayer. Like all Civ games, it may have a slight learning curve, but you can jump in and start having fun playing immediately. The learning curve is more about how you might play really well against harder AI. Finally, note that this game is not heavily about combat, or visuals relating to combat. They exist, but the excitement of something like a large tank-battle in Red Alert 2 would not be present in this game. It's more about calculated, strategic decisions and movements, similar to a board game.",1614025164,1614025164,True,27,0,0.758033573627471924,1,True,False,False

The small map on the easiest difficulty is very easy which is fine especially for someone learning. However the same easiest difficulty on the largest maps are not even fun. They enemy AI is garbage at times. They team up against you and there is no way to keep up. If you make more troops it just costs more to support them all and you still get out numbered. I want to play a big game with 16 countries but I can't because of this. The game also crashes a lot but the auto save feature keeps the game easily playable. Another thing I don't like is the enemy is always mad if you walk on their territory. However it's okay for them to walk on your territory. Then when you complain to them too much they declare war. Small map it's not so bad because you can keep up with defending. Large map the other civs team up and it is not fun. I don't really enjoy the small map. Game had so much more potential. Especially being a remake. There is a lot to this game and I have much to learn myself. The amount of customization is the game is amazing. Multiplayer can be a lot of fun with friends.

My take on this game is that there is more going on on the board due to unit stacking and free tile enhancements (including roads and railroads), and less going on in the background due to lack of religion and civics trees. I personally like this game more than later entries in the series, but that may be due to nostalgia since I probably put 1000ish hours into the game on disk.

Fair warning for anyone thinking of jumping into this, the downsides compared to later entries are more micromanagement (cities will straight up shut down if there are enough unhappy people in them and you need to fix that on a case-by-case basis), unit stacking can get annoying to some, especially if playing pvp (you can bring 10 knights to a city and your opponent may have 50 spearmen in there), and a lot of the tool tips and advice online is vague. For example, corruption is very vaguely explained, but basically production and commerce will be thrown away to varying degrees based on government type, generally proximity to your capital (though Communism gives an exception), and number of cities in your empire (the more cities, the more corruption will become a factor up to a certain unspecified cap). Also, if playing pvp, if someone gets large enough, turns start taking large amounts of time, so I believe there is a timer feature, but depending on how you look at it, it could be an unfair penalty to someone doing well with a military approach, or it could be a handicap on a player that is doing too well to make the game more balanced.

Also, this may just be me, but the game can and will crash on Windows 10 (usually fairly predictable, though, at victory screen and potentially at startup). Also, there is a feature that's supposed to show events on the world map at the victory screen, but that entire feature was bugged on my last playthrough (the cities appeared on the map prior to their founding, and pointers to events didn't appear at all, though cultural boundaries showed up properly). I haven't had it randomly crash mid game, so it at least seems very stable there.

Still, really enjoy this game coming back to it. Highly recommend if you think that the newer civs feel slow due to little map movement or if you just want a bit of nostalgia or some context on how far Civ has come.",1608533973,1608533973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why? Because once I've played other Civ games I can see it's shortcomings and to be fair I cannot find an excuse to play it other than a newer one. It's not only about missing features or clarity, either.

Firstly, I hate the strategy necessary to beat this game. It's always expanding like a madman leaving everything behind but rushing settlers and workers with enough military to defend them while trading techs to the AI. That's it. You have a wide territory, you have a tech lead, and with so many  towns that you can effectively have hundreds of units out. That takes hundreds of turns and it's kind of boring and repetitive.

It was groundbreaking and incredible when I was younger, but after being spoiled by having to actually think very hard about funding new cities and having everything in order or risking falling behind; and having all of my builds make a difference instead of crapping out settlers... I'll sadly have to say the Classic was improved upon in my subjective opinion.

That said; it's pretty cheap; and still probably better than Civ VI (again, my opinion); but not better than Civ V or IV. It definitely deserves being bought and all of its positive reviews; I simply can't leave a positive one without being a liar.",1608434228,1608434228,False,0,0,0.452961653470993042,0,True,False,False

As soon as any AI meets you, they instantly hate you and turn on you, regardless of the settings, even least aggressive. No such thing as ""friendly"" or ""polite"". It's just ""OH! It's YOU!!!"", then they usually demand something outrageous, and then they declare war and attack you with swarms of units there is no way that they actually built. You can have units that are 3 generations ahead of another player, and it will take 3 of them to make even a dent in 1 of theirs. 1 of their warriors will take out several of your medieval infantry without a problem. Doesn't matter what land your tile is, you get no defensive bonuses. You could have any fortified units on top of a mountain, and a warrior will happily tear through you like you're made out of tissue paper. Not to mention they can build whatever they want regardless of resources, and they don't have to fund or pay for units, so 1 city can create dozens of units every couple of turns. No matter how good you are, you can't withstand a swarm of several dozen units that are overpowered, and have the strength of industrial era weapons, attacking your cities each and every turn from the very beginning. And that's on the easiest settings!!! I'm all for a challenge, but at least make it a realistic challenge that is even remotely in the vicinity of fair. Might also be nice to be able to focus on other areas of the game like culture or science, as opposed to the game just always being one big, neverending melee set to the tune of Slayer's War Ensemble.

The UI simply stank. One simple reason for this is it not allowing you the standard ""right click to DESELECT unit"". So you always had a unit selected - and as a result often clicked somewhere on the map and off it went, moving to that spot when you did not want it to. So you go to correct it. You click said wrong move unit, but no...... can't select it because of ""this unit has already moved"", BUT what then happens is ANOTHER unit has become active, which the map did not autocentre on (so you had no idea it had automatically selected another unit), and it then starts with unwanted movement!
You probably don't understand all that - it's hard to put into words. But the terrible UI had me constantly wrong moving entire chains of units all over the place.
The UI is very ""non-standard"" and it is difficult to get any information regards anything conveniently. There isn't even a proper world map view - the only one you get is a tiny thumbnail sized map that is just a jumbled mess of colours.
You never know where the enemy is. You never know where anything is. You never have the ""big picture"". You never feel in control. You are constantly fighting your own ministers who are obsessed with building unneeded and extremely expensive ""wonders"" in every city!
Then comes the AI sides. Even on easiest level and lowest aggression, they just all gang up on you. They all stroke each other peckers, but give you the cold shoulder, refusing all diplomatic requests you make - and never offering any treaties or trades to you. They only contact you with one or two unfair tech trades at the start, and from then on it's only to make bullying demands and declare war. They all share techs and treaties with each other though - with great gusto!
Once one inevitably decides to go to war against you, ALL the others follow suit within the next few turns. They never go to war with each other.
All AI civs are also BRUTALLY, profanely cheating, expansionists. This kind of AI is anathema to my usual style and I loathe and detest it. In Civ 3 this AI style is *all* you get....... every game ends the same after 100-200 turns, no matter how aggressively you try to expand, the AI teams just fills up the whole world with one giant ""anti-YOU"" alliance and all declare war and crush you.
This unfairness ruins Civ III. I just had to quit/uninstall in frustration. 
The graphics are also rather bland, nay, downright ugly - the civ leader portraits are a joke - and the music is awful.

Extremely disappointing, I expected so much more from this game. Lets not mince words, I loathed it.

And as for 99% of the reviewers around here thinking the sun shines out this game's arse, well they're wrong! It shows how intelligent these reviewers are when hundreds of them are spam that just say ""relaxing"", ""gud game"", ""is fun"", ""classic"" - hell, one spam review even just said "".""! Others tell outright LIES such as ""every game is different""...... no every game ends in the cheating AI civs all ganging up on you.

The graphics and special features are no longer advanced by today's standards, but they're still good enough to capture your imagination. The game starts of slow, but gets more exciting as the game advances. Interestingly, the beginning and most boring part of the game is the most critical.

 It has lots of mods, none of the simplistic, casual-like style of the games that came after it, and a relatively good mutliplayer. The art style still retains that design of late 1990's, early 2000's aesthetic. It doesn't try to be cartoony and I love that. Unfortunately later Civ games were less lucky with that.

After more 10 years, here it stood the test of time....

You can't go wrong with the price of it now. All expansions included and no DLC's or anything. A problem that Civ IV, V and VI face. Well worth your money.

 This is a classic strategy game.

The only thing I feel is lacking is the necessity for a full OST in Steam in a downloadble format! The music is amazing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYHbIo-WL8c

Update: They made Civilization III's multiplayer work on Steam without Gamespy (since that is now dead). Therefore cannot recommend Civ 3 enough compared.

I have been playing the mother of all strategies continuously since 1993 and gradually I went through all her titles and subtitles to V. part. Civilization III. became my longest playing heart affair and I was very reluctant to say goodbye to it as I slowly moved on to the V. part. Personally, I think that III. the part is far better than IV., V. and probably VI., but it is a bit outdated and does not offer such a range of gameplay options. What makes it unique, however, is that this is the last Cvilization where you have the opportunity to create truly gigantic empires with countless armies on large maps.

Sid Meier's Civilization III holds classic status for a lot of people, and for good reason. Given its age, it holds up suprisingly well. If this review was only comparing it to its contemporaries, Civilization III would get a perfect score. Unfortunately, when compared to later Civilization games, it begins to falter. The biggest knock against Civilization III isn't really an issue with the game, its just that later games build on its foundation so well. Now that we are on the 6th game in the franchise, there is an entry for everyone. If people want the most modern, sleek, and optimized version of Civilization, they can play 6. If they want an old school feel they can play 4. And if they want a sort of middle ground, the 5th game does a great job balancing those 2 elements. For Civilization III, it plays a lot like Civ 4 but with some pretty popular mechanics missing. To me, Civ 3 doesn't really have a niche that it excels at, and that's why I can't recommend it. Every feature is done better in a different Civ game, leaving little reason for me to revisit it 20 years later.

This is one of the very first game I ever watched some one play and I have very fond memories of sitting next to my dad watching him play this game for hours so it has a very special place in my heart.

Now that being said this game is the Civilization game you should play if your interested in a aggressive empire building strategy where you want to win through domination or by conquering every other nation in the game. From what I've heard civ six and five kind of drop the war aspect and I can tell form experience that Civ fours military strategy is kind of lacking when compared to civ three. This is in part due to later games kind of getting rid of the ""special unit"". In civ three every nation has a unique unit that only they can build and each one of them is differrent and offers an improvement over the regular version any other nation can unlock. These units can be a complete game changer for you and your conquest and thus choosing which nation to play as is beyond important as you have to decide about important factors such as what do you wan as a special unit and does it come to late for it to make a differrence in my game.  This game has solid graphics for the time it came out and very good music. 
As all other civ games it's a very good and fun strategy game where you can sink hours into with out even realizing.  
To sum up I would recommend this Civilization game for two reasons one its currently the cheapest on steam and it has to best combat strategy. The later game kind of abandon this part of the game. So if your looking for an empire building game and are interested in nothing else then conquering and destroying every other nation then this is the civ game for you.  If not I would recommend you look at the later civ games.",1595011403,1595011403,True,2,0,0.533379733562469482,0,True,False,False

The turn-based strategy games takes lots of consideration and moves at manageable pace (think family or work needs something right now, so you can temporarily stop or save and come back in an hour or the next day.  The AIs are good enough to be present unpredictable challenges and opportunities.  A great game to make you think about all the things that make a winning strategy or a sorrowful second place.

It is a great break from a FPS (first person shooter) game, or is it the FPS is a good break from the strategic thinker game?

It's easy to pick up, and absorbs your time as you race to expand your civilisation through a combination of growth and military conquest. Various civilisations provide different bonuses which cater to different play styles and strategies. For example, you can gain military bonuses to build large armies, scientific bonuses to facilitate technological advantages, commerce bonuses to offset whatever costs you decide to incur, as well as others.

You can customise the game such as map size and type, AI difficulty, types of victories and accelerated production for a quicker game. Note that large maps often end up taking a lot of time and turns become longer and longer as you manage large numbers of cities and units. Also on harder difficulties, rather than implementing optimum strategies, the AI receives bonuses and becomes ridiculously hard.

If you get bored of the standard random maps, you can load various scenarios that come with the game. There is even a quite comprehensive map editor which allows for custom maps and rules. You can create your own custom resources, units, techs, governments and civilisations.

Arguably the most important, if not the best, entry in the venerable Civilization series. While today Civilization 5 may be the definitive version of Civilization, Civilization III used to claim that spot, and is still very much worth revisiting today--especially if you're looking to play Civ on an older PC that might groan and creak under the strain of modern games.

Civilization III is incredibly polished and boasts an enormous amount of content, especially with regard to mods. The 2D visuals still look gorgeous today and a modern CPU can bruteforce its way through that usual murderer of Civilization playthroughs, the late-game slog. Be warned, however, that Civilization III is a very old game, and it shows its age. Mostly this manifests in the UI, which is considerably less intuitive and clear than we're accustomed to these days--and, perhaps most problematically for new players, there aren't any tooltips. If you've never played a Civilization game before, you're in for a steep learning curve. And if it's been a while since you've played Civilization III and you're looking to revisit an old favorite, well, unless your memory is much greater than mine, odds are you'll have a fair bit of a learning curve to muddle through as well. Who'd've thought the most important innovation in the 4x genre over the last 20 years would be something as simple as tooltips?

Well, anyway. It's Civilization III: one of the finest turn-based strategy games ever produced. In many respects it falls short of its successors, most notably the wildly imaginative expansions of Civilization IV and the perfectly polished systems and mechanics of Civilization V, but it remains an excellent title nonetheless.

I regret making the mistake of purchasing and installing this game, believing that I would not suffer the same problems. Not the case. The game, in its current condition, is severely bugged (but it is also specified in ""System Requirements"" section of Steam that the game is compatible with Win2000/XP only).

Second problem: The game's AI settings apparently have been changed greatly since when I was playing the basic version of it from a CD, many years ago. I distincly remember how the difficulty would scale in a reasonable manner as you went up in difficulty settings. Not anymore. Probably due to the influence of the modding community, which I suspect would be hardcore gamers, even at the easiest settings the AI is completely focused on spamming cities and units, without a thought for developing their cities. I remember playing around the hardest difficulty settings before. In this version, even at the easiest settings any other civilizations you play against gang up on you from the get go.

I was still greatly pleased with reading the many civilopedia entries and visiting the nice memories of the old appearance of the game. However, I believe it is a broken piece of software now. And considering that it is almost an ancient game today, and that it has had 3 more sequels so far, I don't think any improvements will take place.

STRICT ALERT!!! The game is going to cause dependency/addiction to it.

Only play if you have many hours to spend on it - don't even start if you have less than two hours of free time!

Shame it still lacks HD resolution support, just like it doesn't have actually ANY graphics settings - although when it got released in 2001 it didn't look bad compared to its age being an isometric 2D-game. Still, some lags/AI thinking times might occur, which I cannot say agreeable looking at its graphics level...

I think this entire game should get an HD remaster - newer than Windows XP operating systems can have serious compatibility support issues with the game.",1565959782,1565959782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing on and off since it's release. I've learned a lot of history and English terminology through playing this game as a kid. The game play is not the best: the next games are superior game play wise. However they eliminated the endless combat that reigns over Civ 3. It is one of these games, uniquely so, that you can hoard military units, stack them up near the enemy's borders, declare war and take 5 cities, big or small, before the enemy gets his turn. Although a lot, A LOT, of micromanagement is required to pull off this kind of tactic, it is really rewarding if somewhat tedious. The technology system is fine, it's slower than later games, but you have more time to play between eras. Most unique units are well-designed. A lot of Wonders are broken (Statue of Zeus, cough cough) and can allow you to cut through early eras like a knife through butter. Early eliminations are common and wonder fights are exciting. 

The OST is BONKERS. I still listen to it, so many years later, even without playing. Jungle sounds, mesoamerican music etc. Really well orchestrated.

it seems as well AI acts with perfect knowledge of map (which is nearly the only strong way to heavily cheat on this without some quadruple bonuses to everything, however all those are a thing on top difficulty i bet; and in those old civs you pretty sure are not winning in this absurd case)

it seems AI doesn't really try to unite against you in case of lead (though maybe does get furious at riches), yet is overly happy to try silly backstabs / 'surprise attacks' or else; it may even try to assault clearly later era stronghold with simple hordes that would almost never win there

oh and there's the quite massive downside in old civ - combat is literally random, so much that it matters almost endlessly, since there are massive terrain bonuses as well and ancient spearmen could very well beat tanks; it's not even a weird and rare case - hopelessly outdated AI hordes may just jump onto your mountains anytime and become unmovable force

there is a lot of inconvenience with units such as limits to upgrading, mostly no true way to skip tons of unit movements and such (maybe in case of railroads it becomes sort of that), while there are tons of units and often clumsy or limited control over them - and then 'same continent' is breaking minds of automated workers, there was a case where they literally rushed through many foreign borders and large lands that are hostile - to sometimes work on nearly or actually foreign volcano that recently exploded - and then instantly all die to yet another explosion, while they stand right on top of volcano

AIs for some reason barely ever wish to cooperate anyhow equally, even if it's them who often try to ally their weak nation to much more advanced one - even if it's exactly they who backstabbed you and awfully need protection now - of course it's you who always should pay army's worth of upkeep in protection treaty; then there's both positive and strange moment - bots can be (furious) at you yet still seriously try to ally and get protection

civ3 is somehow quite confusing and unintuitive i suppose, even when simultaneously tools available + core mechanics are ridiculously simple (but even pacing is very strange); it also seems to take massive time to playthrough even a bit - and without much management i guess (spammy) AI and all those older type mechanics can result in a quick death of civilization

it did have some nice ideas but the rest can simply create rather stupid spammy - defensive-favoring (and as well ruining that for YOU the player, because you lack any extra automation possible) grind, starting even from most ancient times where first of all units can be massed and rushed by population that generally anyone has and some do in massive surplus

overall civ3 has either too serious or too numerous problems to be offset by a few good moments; i'd say in practice it is easily nearly unplayable, inconvenient and quite mindless - while serious business going on against you won't let you be mindless one (or there you could lose on the easiest setting possible); it is possibly not even really challenging since maps feature very inhospitable lands (full of mountains not to even settle or ever grow anything) while as well rich and useful plains

so from the start it seems about all factors are against you; that's somewhat interesting but not for long (and that's a bit too much patience still)

since it is often not even easy to survive - some a bit casual or even a much later civ5 player will likely be plainly outspammed by ruthless AI if they miss about anything in proper setup and management (and when unfamiliar, there must be a lot to miss)",1544926196,1544926196,False,6,1,0.330717712640762329,6,True,False,False

Civ III lacks some of the sophisticated gameplay mechanics introduced in the later games and I consider the combat in particular to be a weaker point of this game, as it usually amounts to just mindlessly building more units than your opponents. Despite this, Civ III gets the job done simply and effectively, which is why I always come back to it over the other games in the series.

I see all these reviews about how this is still the best Civ game, and I just do not see what they're seeing. In Civ 5 and 6, the enemy AI will at least kill and absorb far weaker AI. They will at least every once in awhile do little pretend wars where they attack another equal AI's city (not take it, but just damage it ). The enemy AI in this game will always be permanently allied against you, even if you pick for them to be the least aggressive they can be (useless option). The combat is the most frustrating, rng-based, tedious, time-consuming, micro-managing ****fest I've ever seen. You can have many units occupy a tile, but they can only attack 1 at a time. You would think that means combat would at least be better than Civ 5 and 6, but like I said, the rng is so stupid that you have to make sure you have an advantage of 5x or more, unless you want to just load half the time and try the battle again, cuz you will fail half the time at a 2x advantage. And what I mean by that is this - You can have a unit with twice as much attack as they have defense, they can be wounded, sitting in a grassland/plain, not fortified, not across a river, and there's still a good chance you will lose if you attack him. In addition to that, you can NOT fully kill an enemy by bombarding. This means that you have to rely on rng attacking to actually kill any enemy military unit. Call to Power 2 sucks because you can't set up a scenario where the AI put up any threat (they won't attack you with anything more than a few units ever), and this game sucks for the opposite reason, because the AI only wants you dead and they have huge advantages even on low difficulties. It especially doesn't help that the maps spawn such few horses and iron (even though you NEED them to get anything past starting units in this game), seems to always put them near the AI and far away from you, and punishes you greatly if you build a town far away from your own (through waste/corruption penalties), in which, you would need to connect that town with a road in order to build those horse/iron units in your other towns. If you don't connect that town to your civilization, then like I said, the waste/corruption is so bad that you won't get to build ANYTHING in that town. The enemy AI also destroys your lonely roads in no time. I'm uninstalling this game and never considering it again.

Runs perfectly on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 with 2560 x 1440 resolution monitor).

To run in Linux:

a)
On a steam client go to ""Steam > Settings > Steam Play"" and check option ""Enable Steam Play for all titles"".

b)
Run a game first time - it probably won't start if You have large resolution monitor like me, but thats alright - the first run will create a conquests.ini (~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete/Conquests/conquests.ini) file.

This complete edition concludes of the base game, Civilization III, Civilization III Play the World & Civilization III Conquest. We have many scenarios in this game with examples of them being Rise of Rome, World War 2 Pacific and even Earth type maps which you can either have true starting locations as your desired nation or have the spawn randomized. 

PROS
- CIv 3 has the biggest maps out of any other Civ game.
- We have no limitations on units like we had on every sequel. Units can stack which gave a much more war feeling to the game.
- If you want a game to last at least a week or even a month. On this game you can make it happen.
- For an old game it still runs smoothly.
- Multiplayer still works, so you can play with friends and/or family.
- Gameplay is simple, but you can make mistakes easily and the enemy will take advantage of that 

CONS
- Dated graphics (can be a + or a -)

Overall
This is and always will be my favourite civ 3 game, the sequels are all about fancy graphics and less war. If you want to actually feel like you have a civilization then this is the game for you. If you want the ultimate experience, on an earth map and the biggest map you can dream of. Then pick this map. TETurkhan Test of Time. This comes with various game types that include of spawning with pre-made cities like earth is today with the available civilizations in the game, true location start which allows you to where your country's first capital was. Or have it randomized. So you could have England in India or the Japanese in Africa. This is the biggest map the game has to offer and with the size of it. You are talking at least a couple of weeks to finish, if you plan to go with a total domination game.

I wish Steam had the full version of SMAC, cuz I never was able to get the expansion pack for that one.

I got THIS version of Civ3 as part of a package deal.  I already had a CD-ROM of the original game and played that a lot.  I had plans to hunt down the expansion packs for it as well, but then Steam came into my life.

I compare playing Civ3 to a Poker tournament.  It's pretty easy to learn how to play, and hard to win in the long run.  Despite all the hours I've put into it, I've never won a game, even when I thought I was supposed to.  The point isn't to win, though; the point is to play.  Every time I've done that, I've learned something else.  I've also quit many games due to the fact that it was obvious I had been dealt a losing start.  Replay value approaches the infinite due to the sheer number of variables that go into a game, most of which are customizable, and some of which are procedurally generated (including the map, which will make or break you most times).

I was hoping that Civ4 and Civ5 would prove to be closer to this game and SMAC combined.  That turned out not to be the case.  Because of my love for this game and SMAC, I've found it difficult to enjoy 4 and 5 for what they offer.  They didn't feel like improvements on the formula, TBH.  I say that cuz, well, Civ3 is just that frickin' good.

For me, Civ3 is a fine, and also somewhat extreme, example of how gameplay is superior to graphics.  I can't say that pining for the days of sprites is in everyone's best interest; but sometimes, awesome polygonal renderings are just too much, or they wind up being more of a hindrance or distraction.  That said, Civ3 is not particulary known for its awesome sprites, either.  Still, you know what is what in this game.  Plenty of people made mods for the game as well.  I've seen Lord of the Rings mods, and one or two intended to improve how terrain features looked.  I never got into these, myself, although I do wish some things were easier to see due to design.

PROS
- Each era contains its unique soundtrack, and nore of them are as boring as the soundtracks of civ 5 and civ 6. 
- You want to conquer a city? Go for it, send in a ton of units and take it.. your offensive units vs your enemy's defensive units, no insane bonus for defending a city and no ridiculous penalties for capturing as many cities as you want (looking at you civ 5). 
- The fact that you can stack as many units as you want on a single stack was a vital mechanic that civ 5 should have never taken away.. it makes the game clunky and unnecessarily limitating.
- All units have 2 values, an offensive one and a defensive one, allowing for more complex strategies and making every units a lot more unique and specialized. 

CONS
The AI will be unforgiving and sooner or later, every single one of them will swarm you will armies aimed at ending you.. it can be very challenging for players who like to simply give up when things get difficult, because they will. They progress very quickly with science, just to make things even more difficult. For this reason, i strongly suggest new players to choose the easiest level of difficulty at first, or maybe the one after it for players who played a lot with other civs. 

CONCLUSION
Every mistakes that civ5's developpers made, the ones that we hoped were going to be fixed in civ 6.. well, this game will give you an experience of a vastly more satisfying and authentic civ game. after playing this game and enjoying it, you'll feel like civ5 took the wrong turn and civ6 will no longer be relevant to you.",1518825527,1518825527,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Now this cheat isn't impossible to beat, but the deadly troop stack will sooner or later spell doom for you and your civ. Only real way around this cheat is to get an island, stay isolated as long as possible, and then hold out.

Second is how bad the AI is. The AI is just terrible compared the newer games. Third is that the quanitity of your cities is better than the quality.

Graphics are Good. Even though it came out in 2001.
Comes with Alot of maps and can be randomly generated too. Example (UK Map, World Map)
There is mods out for the game here is the link - https://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/downloads/
The price of the game is $5 which is pretty good asking price. 
There is an Editor so that you can create your own map or scenerio.

-Mixed (Depends on perspective.)
The turns are pretty long for me at late game if I play on Huge Map. It would take 30 seconds to minute to go through in later stages of the game.

When you download the game you have to manualy set the resolution in the files to 1080p  which would only take a minute. You can find a tutorial online.

The game is less complex compared to CIV 4 or CIV 5. For example you can't edit the details of your goverment like you can in CIV 4 and there is no religion system like civ 4.

This is really good civilization game. You can have fun with this game as in any other civ series game. This is not as modern as new civ games, so it does not feel as ""smooth"" as like vic IV or V.

That being said the game is a huge leap foward from a lot of its easier counterparts, though it's still not as difficult at Advanced Civilizations, you don't need to mount your C:/ Drive to play it and there is a manual... Stupid RNG no explanation Civil Wars...

Anyway, long story short:
If you are new to the Civilization Franchise I might recommend starting with  Civ V, its an easier more friendly game. That being said, if you are a veteran of the franchise or of the strategy genre, Civ III will give you a more difficult, more immersive, and more brutal experience, and is well worth the $1-$5 it costs.",1479946943,1510592028,True,1,0,0.502824842929840088,0,True,False,False

The graphics have aged fairly well in my opinion, especially for a game from the very early 2000s. The old map-like aesthetic of the game's empire view is very nice, and the unit sprites are done very well for a game from a time with extremely limited graphical capabilities. One feature I especially love that I think shouldn't have been done away with in future Civilization games is the 'aerial view', which allows you to get an extremely detailed view of your cities.

However, even if the graphics are considered lackluster by some in this time, the soundtrack still holds up extremely well and is possibly the best soundtrack out of the entire Civilization series. From the piano-based melodies of the Medieval era to the jazzy guitar riffs of the Modern era, the soundtrack is extremely immersive and well-produced. Even some DLC scenarios have custom soundtracks, which are just as well-made as the soundtracks of the main game.

The gameplay is also well-done and it isn't too easy, nor is it too hard. The difficulty scaling in this game works well enough, and you are able to even change specifics such as AI aggressiveness, something that appears to be absent from later entries in the series. The advisors in this game are actually quite helpful and their associated menu screens allow you to easily get a detailed overview of your empire in order to best manage it. My only criticism of the more domestic side of gameplay is the way corruption works in this game; it tends to be quite rampant (especially on larger maps, and ESPECIALLY in the later stages of the game) although it can be reduced with wonders such as the Forbidden Palace and buildings such as courthouses.

Combat in this game is based off of an RNG system that works fairly well, although there is the occasional absolutely ludicrous outcome where a spearman will manage to defeat a tank. Unit promotions in this game work on four levels: conscript (the starting level for conscripted units as well as units gifted by villages), regular (the starting level for built units), veteran, and elite. Each promotion grants an extra bar of health. While much more simple than the extensive promotions in games such as Civilization 5, this system still works quite well as Civilization 3 tends to focus much more on wider-scale combat and empire management than single-unit powerhouses.

Overall, Civilization 3 is an excellent -- albeit, somewhat dated -- entry into the Civilization series. I'd probably give up both of my legs to see a remastering of this game.",1405599357,1508618705,True,4,0,0.557972609996795654,0,True,False,False

This game may be old, but I find it's graphics are just right for the genre and it does not have the cartoony look that some later titles are sometimes guilty of. Being an older title, the AI isn't always the smartest and will struggle to perform certain tasks like sea-based invasions. A huge problem with this game is its infamous RNG which has led to powerful units being killed by weaker unit (i.e. spearman kills tank). However, just play without ""preserve random seed"" enabled and you can just save before each battle and reload quickly to get a better result if you feel you have been cheated. Other features missing include advanced diplomacy beyond war and trade and revolutions occuring in pre-established empires (a feature lacking from most unmodded Civ titles).

The thing that makes this game my favorite Civ is the availablity of mods to customize this game to your heart's content. You can play out just about any scenario you can think of. Although a lot of files were lost when civfanatics changed a while back, there is still plenty of diverse content available. I would highly recommend the WorldWide mod for anyone looking for a much expanded version of the game. Whether you want to make small changes like add in one or two units or a custom civ, or install total conversions and scenarios, the tutorials online make it very easy to add such things in.

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Civilization and other empire-building RTS games.


I have logged hundreds of hours on the disk version. The steam version makes it easy for me to carry this game wherever I go without having to bring disks. The only difference (and problem) I have found between the disk and Steam versions is Steam removed a lot of accesory files from the game's files, such as .exe's for vanilla Civ3 and Civ3PTW expansion. Otherwise, I have noticed little difference.

It is a masterpiece that stands the test of time. It is more realistic and fun with huge maps. No religion, but best Nuclear Weapons, artillery mechanic, interface is great for me and Civilopedia is the best out of all Civilizations for me. Clear and Plain to understand.
Easy game to play, yet it is harder to master.
Advisors and Leaders change clothes, depending on which era it is. Interface is more ""realistic"" looking and not too cartonish as the newer ones. Music is outstanding.
A lot is early on about how much you expand, but it is also much easier to get steam rolled by opponents if your cities are not defended. Sometimes less better cities is more productive and efficient. Maps play a big role, and the map editor is amazing.
Diplomacy I found the most realistic of all. World war scenario can happen very quick with mutual protections. 
Never attack anyone however with open borders, they will hate you pretty much forever, lol.
If you are not the leading in technology you can still sell them to the one that have none. If you have a technology noone has, sell it to everyone (Like worldmaps) in the same turn. Extra money is great.
Governments are a very good mechanic too. Made no sense to me Civilization IV Police State with free speech.

I've bought this game exactly 4 times for myself. The first copy wandered off to a friend who never got around to returning it and after a while I realized I missed it too much as I walked past the""Gold"" CD version that was on sale at my local Frys which was promptly purchased. On to copy number 2, Yay! I've played that for a good long time on both Windows and Linux but finally got tired of slapping in the CD every time I wanted to play for its antiquated copy protection. Along came a Steam sale and I said 'Hello' to copy number 3. This version is slightly different than my ""Gold"" version (d*mn volcanoes) but still enjoyable as ever. Finally, just like clockwork, right after I bought #3 ran across another sale on that other game site that doesnt have any silly DRM on it in the first place and I was the proud owner of copy number 4. 

Add this :
KeepRes=1
to its own line in your ini file ""./Civilization III Complete/Conquests/conquests.ini"" to get proper widescreen support (non 4:3 aspect). This line used to be in Civ3PTW.ini but apparently got moved to this file at a later version. Depending on the version you have, this might be somewhere else too....perhaps one more directory down at ""./Civilization III Complete/Conquests/Conquests/conquests.ini""

For Linux, see WineHQ for more info on how to get the ""squaking"" bird sound to stop once it starts. The quick fix is to turn off those sounds in options but slightly less enjoyable as it removes all the environment sounds. The short of what the fix entails is you just have to replace the bird sound file with a silent version which is easy enough to craft using something like audacity.",1498596485,1498635241,True,17,0,0.660244464874267578,0,True,False,False

I guess in attempt to make the map look more realistic shape of the land is blurred so much, that it's hard to see where it actually ends. The result is quite opposite than desired, and you can't easily tell what kind of terrain is there, what would the city be covering exactly, etc. Horrible! Mountains look artificial as hell, as well ;) or, no - most of the map looks artificial and flat.
Had to play with the grid visible most of the time, otherwise couldn't see shit. Didn't get used to the grid so switched it off from time to time... and again couldn't see crap.

Other than that, it is quite good Civ game and feels like much refined C2. I liked the concept of visible and expanding borders, rather disliked the idea of culture as a winning factor (yeah right, like this could happen in this dimension), loved the concept of strategic resources and linking cities by roads/harbors/airport to use them. C3 has a good ""just one more turn"" factor too... but too bad you can't see shit most of the time.

If I try for city sprawl, the AI builds them faster than I do, and still somehow has enough time to also field a more advanced army because it's tech is better.

Civilization III Complete was one of the games I spent the most time with, and really enjoyed it. For me, it's easily one of the best 4X games ever made (at least in the time I type it).

If you did not play Civilization 3 in the past and are wondering if you should buy it - below is some basic info that should encourage you to do that.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The pluses:

+ Lots of civilizations, each plays differently

+ Lots of different units + special military unit for each civilization

+ The AI scripts are demanding (unlike in most modern games)

+ Resources on map force you to play strategically

+ Depending on the size and type of the maps, games might differ quite a lot

+ You can play in really big maps

+ The game has fine mods that you can find on the internet

+ It's hard to stop playing it

------------------------------------------------------
The minuses:
- It's hard to stop playing it

- At higher difficulties the military victory is the most viable option (only)

- When you control most of the map it's just boring killing of the remaining weaklings

- At the industrial age, you probably control most of the map

- At higher difficulties AI is cheating

- Civilizations are not balanced (some are really good, some - really bad)

- After you learn to use workers and diplomacy, it's not that hard (but still fun)

- Old 2D game, so in native desktop resolution units and fonts might be too small

- Old 2D game, so in native game resolution units might be too big (and no widescreen)

======================================

For native desktop resolution in game:

1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder conquests.ini
2. Put ""keepRes=1"" in conquests.ini file (without """")

======================================

Those settings should fix crashes in Windows 7 64 bit.

1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder
2. Rename LSANS.FOT to -LSANS.FOT

If that does not help:
Set Windows compatibility to Windows XP Service Pack 2 and run program as administrator.

If the game runs too slow delete keepRes=1 from ini file (in Windows XP mode the game is slower)

======================================

That's it. You can now go buy the game.",1487879039,1487879039,True,16,0,0.717749953269958496,0,True,False,False

I first came across this game at GameStop and I really hadn't played any games since I was young. But I needed a past time because I was dying of boredom being at home laid up in bed unable to do much. I had severely injured my back and I wasn't going to work anytime soon and the depression started to kick in. So anyways by now the game had been out for about 3 years and it looked interesting so I bought it. Went home and started playing it and it was my first time playing a strategy game so I didn't even know if I was going to like it. I started playing around lunch time by the time I know it was dinner time so took 10 minutes got my food and came back and ate while I played. By the time I knew it was freaking 6am the next day! I had never had lost track of time by that much, but man was I enjoying the game. I thought the graphics were pretty decent, the game play was very good and the UI was also good. Of course it was the first time I've had played a game with an in game Civilopedia and I thought that was awesome. The other thing I miss from Civilization III that has not been added to any other Civilization since is building your capital building when your citizens were happy you were able to add one section at a time until you finished upgrading your building. I thought that was fun, even though it was a very simple and quick thing. By the time Civilization IV came out I had around 3500 hours invested in this game and I still have the original disk I bought, but I went ahead and bought it on Steam because they had a very good deal on Civ III, IV and Colonization which I already have the other two also. But I want to keep those disks from getting any damage and besides Steam keeps a running track of your gaming time. So I can safely say this game is what got me back into gaming and becoming a full time gamer. I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN OLDER GAME.

Picked it up during the Steam Black Friday sale on Thanksgiving. I gave it a whirl. At first, I had the same feelings I did last time I played all those years ago. It wasn't CivII, and the strategies that worked for me then were failing me now. It didn't help that there wasn't a tutorial or a manual of any kind, and the Civilopedia is not the most user-friendly interface, although it's critical to understanding all of the game mechanics the AI employs.

I played on Chieftain for a while, just trying to get a handle on the game mechanics, but now I'm bored of chieftain. Too easy. Once you learn and begin to understand the game mechanics, this is a pretty great game. That said, it's virtually impossible to win if you don't constantly expand and build one city after another. I mean, that is all you will do. Build and build and build. If you don't, the AI will and you'll lose. Pretty much the only way to win is to begin building a ton of cities in the early parts of the game.

I did like the implementation of cultural borders, and how borders clash against one another. The cultural conversion tool was also pretty cool, where cities could rebel and join your forces because they realized that their own culture was lifeless. So it's a pretty good game, and definitely worth the price for my 46 hours (and growing).

I do have to say, though, that a couple of the leader choices are really dumb. Mahatma Gandhi was not a leader of the Indian nation. Although he championed the move for India's independence, making him the face of India is weird, because he was a guru and not a general. And Jeanne d'Arc leading the French? She was a teenager and a peasant who, by her own confession, never even used her sword in combat. They could have chosen Charlemagne or Napoleon Bonaparte, but Joan!

I probably sunk at least 200 hours into my local libraries copy, so when I saw it was on steam, it was a no brainer purchase.

Having played Civ 5, I have to say that the portraits of the rulers convey far more emotion, at least in my eyes, than the full set pieces of Civ 5. The barbarians have multiple AI options and can be absolutly brutal. Certain civilzations have certain traits which affect what actions trigger golden ages. You get to upgrade your palace in a way that actually changes the way it looks on the city screen. Also there is a city screen where you get a detailed overview of your city and all the wonders you built. As opposed to Civ 5's jam packed 3D model of your city.

Age helps, in a way, since with todays operating systems the turns are lightning fast, even with troop movement.

I know I have my nostagia blinders on, but I really like this game, despite whatever flaws I cannot see. I suspect that anyone who likes these kinds of games and doesn't mind the lack of 4k graphics, will definitely get their money's worth.

First off, the game takes some time to get the hang of the concept, but it also just takes time to play. A game could last anywhere from 30 minutes to multiple years. I first read the manual for the game which did help out. It told me of keyboard shortcuts that I never actually used. It also explained to me the basics of the game so when I started my new game I wasn‚Äôt completely lost. (This is coming from somebody who hasn't played any strategy games.) The first 30 minutes of my first game I wasted my turns walking around then finally building a city. I played as the Iroquois, they are proficient in agriculture, though I started producing warriors and getting very aggressive. My neighbors killed me and within an hour my first game was over. My second game ended much quicker, within 30 minutes my tiny city was captured. I felt very lost within the first turns of my first game. I felt the game didn‚Äôt do a very good job explaining what to do. I just felt a desire to discover the dark parts of the map because it didn‚Äôt look very good to me. However, I did find the advisors that would pop up and tell me information that I found very useful and helpful. In this way the game was able to help me assimilate myself with it‚Äôs complicated mechanics. 
One interesting mechanic in the 4x strategy game is its robust diplomacy system. There are many treaties, alliances, trade opportunities, agreements to be made, and wars to be waged. On my current playthrough I am a militaristic expansionist Roman empire I encountered the Aztecs and began fighting a war with them.  Upon seeing the I could overthrow them the Aztecs asked for a peace treaty which I agreed to. From there on out the Aztec and I created a rite of passage where we would be able to cross each other's land. However, I plan on expanding cities and surrounding them then I will take over their cities and kill them. This diplomacy system is a major part of my strategy to win the game. This will play a consequential role of my playthrough of this game. 
In general I have never been a big fan of strategy games, however I did find myself enjoying this game to a certain extent. I don‚Äôt expect to be putting too much time into the game anymore, but I can say that my time spent with it has not been all negative.",1479182609,1479182609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In all seriousness, this is a great game. It is 100% worth the $1.24 you pay when it goes on sale! It is very easy to manage your cities' happiness and production! With Civ III, you can que production items, unlike Civ V, which makes the game enjoyable. As well as allows you to have very productive cities. The way it makes that aspect of the game more enjoyable is that you don't have to click on the choose production icon every few turns. However, it sometimes likes to just switch to needless outdated military units after it runs out of production items in a que. Another nice feature of this game is the selecting how you want your game to be set up. It allows you to choose how old the earth is when you start the game. As well as has a few more features that are absent in Civ 5.

The only cons to this are the aforementioned AI, and playing it on a newer computer. The AI are typically kind of crazy when it comes to deals, and get really annoyed if you decline them. Which typically leads to war with them eventually. I seem to have a problem where the AI all declare war with me. Also, the AI expand their civilizations really fast, so if you buy this, make sure to settle as many cities as possible in the beginning of the game! Although that really applies to any Civ Game.

AI is kind of not really good, but it's challenging on high levels due to bonuses to AI. Also, there is a city count limit on a map which is 512 I think and the game has kind of built in minimal turn waiting time. I have tested this with some members on the community, and it seems that game code doesn't allow for faster operation, regardless of PC hardware one is using.

Music: Both Civ 5 and Civ III have fantastic soundtracks as with pretty much all Civ games. CIV 5's soundtrack is better, but that doesn't mean this soundtrack isn't worth listening to. 

Diplomacy: The diplomacy here in Civ III, in my opinion is better. You can trade maps technologies, change how agressive the AI is. The AI does get quite a bit agressive once you get to medium agressiveness although.

Scenarios: The scenarios here in Civ III are quite interesting. We have Rise of Rome, Fall of Rome, Napoleanic Europe, WW2 in the pacific, etc. I honestly can't choose between Civ 5 and 3 in terms of which had better scenarios.

War: And here is where we start to see the flaws of Civ III. There are certain units made for attacking, defending, and seige units. The seige units must be protected otherwise they will be either captured or destroyed immediately, and the attacking units are vulnerable to counterattack. Defending units ensure your cities are protected and your attacking armies. This part of war, I liked, It made sure I don't just build completely one type of unit. 
Cities are instantly captured if there is no unit inside. I wasn't as fond of this as the unit diversity, but it was tolerable at least.
But then their's the battle system. It's luck based, which I have a burning hatred for. I could attack a spearman one time with an archer and not take any damage, while another time, a defending spearmen exactly the same as the other one could take out my archer, without taking any damage. How does that make any sense? I get it it's an old game an all, but come on.
Also the AI seem way too powerful. I met Scandinavia on turn 2 and it already said his forces outnumbered mine.

CIv 5 definetly, has better war mechanics.

Barbarian encampment and ruins/friendly encampments: Whether you love 'em or hat 'em these guys are around, some encampment are friendly and will give you something like gold or a settler to give you a huge early game boost. and of course the hostile. You can make the hostile encampments non existant, sedentary, normal, roaming or raging. Since there is more option than Civ 5, I'd say these are slightly better.

Civilization balance: Civilization 5 isn't exactly balanced, (Babylon is much better, is pretty much better every aspect compared to let's say the Iroqouis). Civ's are more balanced here. Each Civ have a unique unit, 2 free technologies and 2 bonus'. Military bonus' allow you to build stronger armies faster, science allows you to build science buildings faster, religious allows you to build cultural building faster, etc. In my opinion the two best are science and religious (Which Babylon ironically has both XD). Besides that Civ's are quite balanced besides early game Unique units (I'm looking at you bowmen)

Victory types: Time victory is always on here, which I don't like (although you can push back the counter for time victory to kick in) cultural victoy revolves around how much culture you can get in either one city or your entire empire, dominatuion requires you to own at certain percentage of the world's population or land area, conquest is to eliminate all rival civilizations., wonder is to build a certain amount of wonders, diplomatic is to get people to vote for you once the UN is built, and space race to leave this filthy planet. All good, although most of the time you will win by either cultural or time.

Graphic: I don't really care for graphics much, but the graphic here are at best, pleasing to the eye and at worst, tolerable.

Conclusion: CIV 5 is obviously better, but Civ 3 is extremely enjoyable also, I have many hours into this, and many more will be put into playing this. I know the flaws I listed here aren't going to be changed unless everyone at Firaxis gets high. I haven't seen any bugs, just a great game.

Now, Civ 4 was a good game, and while the less that is said about Civ 5 the better (if you ask me), in my mind Civ 3 was the epitome of the Sid Meier vision for the series and the greatest achievement of aesthetics, style, pacing and general gameplay - as far as Civ gameplay could go.

I think this has a lot to do with the predecessors. Civilization: Call to Power was an epic computer game, surpassing and extremely entertaining. Alpha Centauri was of course one of the very greatest titles the genre has ever seen, encorporating gameplay additions and features - so much recorded voice acting~ - that still feel fresh and ingenious to this day. It was into this setting of established 2D, top down turn based strategy excellence that Civ 3 had to plonk, and what a plonk it was.

How did it work so well? Well it was the way the game juxtaposed itself against it's lineage as much as the way it reproduced and refined it that really rung true with me. Civilzation 3 was all about resolution, refinement, aesthetics and staid excellence. The pacific colours, the fantastic drawn visions of your cities, the subtly faux-3D border markers, the movements of the characters, sounds and the pacing of the game were all just totally lovely touches that made this experience feel high quality and timeless.

Playing it today reveals a game that is completely succesful as a final installment in a series, even though the series itself continued on into the age of 3D. There are flaws of course - in end game especially the dominated maps completely cede any kind of influence over gameplay to your railways, aircraft and ICBMs, the voice acting of Alpha Centauri would have been really great here (it was used for Civ 4, famously, with Leonard Nimoy granting that game degrees of cultural magic that few computer games enjoy) and one could say that consequently the gameplay gets a bit stale towards the later stages of a long game, but it is what happens in the interim - especially the first three quarters of the span of civilization you navigate - that is a really wonderful experience, worth any price.

Definitely worth the buy ($1.37 on sale). Not having the culture group stuff from civ 5 makes the game alot better. Another up compared to civ 5 is that it doesnt have the fancy graphics, so I can run it on my work laptop (which has no dedicated gpu) [civ 5 to go? lel].

The time it takes to finish a game is both a pro and con. If you are a time sensitive person I would suggest you turn off move animations for all units because you will leterally have your eye pop out waiting for allt he units to move at the end. Some of the other default settings also made the game annoying to play. In particular, if you have units which are fortified or in alert stances, the turn may very well pass away under the default setting unless you do some annoying repetitive camerfa movement. There was a setting to wait at the end of ever turn to make this easier, I'm totally fine hitting space bar or enter at the end of every turn then watch things happen in a way i didn't want it.

He has no interest in 4, 5, BE or anything like that. Says they're not interesting like this one is. I'm inclined to agree.

There are a few things here and there that I think could have been expanded on- such as plague- and the fact that some civilizations simply have uninspired Unique Units with bland mechanics.

I want to use the 'Communism' government and have my advisors refer to me as 'Comrade' as I free to the proletariat of the world from the bourgeosie and the 'Fascist' Aztecs!

When I was a child, I played this on and off constantly and never figuring out what I was doing. I played Diablo 2 around the same time and also didn't know what I was doing. 

This complicated empire micromanaging game is an old classic that many people remember, be it from watching one of your relatives playing or being that relative playing. You must manage large armies and cities while trying to expand your kingdom across the world. Disease, famine, civil unrest and poverty are just some of the factors you will have to deal with with trying to be the greatest empire. Doing things all the time is what will get you ahead, and failing over and over learning what does and doesn't work is the tutorial. Hardcore RTS is defined by the Civilization franchise.

I never really understood this game and I still don't. I never really enjoyed micromanage games as they posed too much stress for me to correctly enjoy them. This is personal and won't sway the game itself. 

This game is for people who love watching massive amounts of action going on at the same time with rediculous difficulty options and really good customization for world generation. For being this old, it holds its complication and difficulty really well. If you love this kind of stuff, then it's a no brainer and if you have never heard of this or just faintly remember it from long ago, make sure you Youtube some videos to make sure its your type of game.

It's not my kinda game, but it might be yours.

Lost the game at some point and didn't play the other CIV games until I bought CIV4 during a Steam sale. While the graphics improved a lot from the first game I did not enjoy the game as much. It was rather simple and straight forward. So now during another sale I decided to buy CIV3 as a lot of people are saying it's the  best version. A few hours in and I have to say I like this one better then 4. The game is a bit more challenging even on easy mode and I am just having a fun time creating my own civilizations. That however doesn't mean there aren't any downsides. Some things do not make sense like older units being stronger then newer units. Then there is the little glitch that you will constantly be aware of and that is that it looks like the game is freezing at the end of every turn. It just freezes for a few seconds and then continues but it is a bit of a pain. So far I have no had it shut down on me completely like I am reading in other peoples reviews but who knows it might just happen at some point. Honestly for the money I paid for it I won't complain much. It would have cost me more to get the cd version though I wouldn't have the glitch. My opinion? Totally worth playing and if you don't mind waiting a few seconds at the end of every turn get the steam version. If you do then buy the cd version. Have a lot of fun with it!

It includes all the basic mechanics that define a Civ game. But it hasn't aged very well. The interface is archaic and it's all 2D (except for leader animations). Not that it matters much for a strategy game, but still. 

Civ4 and Civ5 have much more to offer, so it's probably worth playing Civ3 only for nostalgic value. Although, I miss palace customisation and City View with wonders in the later games. Another cool feature is that the leader appearance and title change with each next era

Anyway, if you can get over occasional crashes, you will still spend hours building your empire, but, as I've said, with newer version on the market, Civ3 is mostly for veterans and those who'd like a more challenging game than Civ5.

You have to make use of the terrain around you, which itself can be a gamble.  You might get everything you need under one generated map, and then get completely fucked by another generated map.  There is a lot to cover, most of which I'll leave you to see for yourself.

In the end, there's a lot of content, and for its current price, its a great game.  If you like strategy games, then you'll probably love this game.  9/10.",1450391327,1450391327,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While not deep, this 4x experience is very refined, you really do have to play exactly to your Civ's strengths if you want any hope to succeed in the higher difficulties- there is no real catch all method. People may have complained about bombardment and bombers being Op since they can straight up kill units but I find this adds a lot more tactical complexity to war, especially in the mid Ind. age where it really reflects how much warfare at that time was based around defensive positions.

The campaigns within are straight up the best of any vanilla Civ game, Rise of Rome, the Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery are excellent, and hell the Pacific Theatre almost could've been its own game!

Finally, it may be a personal thing, but I've always preferred the isometic display here to the 3d graphics of 4, 5 and Beyond.

And as a small side note, because of how cheap this game is now it can be an effective litmus test to see if you'll even enjoy Civ games, so there's that.",1450123090,1450123090,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The army movement and combat isn't deep, but there is enough that you need to be sure where you want the armies to go and make sure you have enough strength at the places you need them.

The graphics aren't enivable at all because, well, it is nearly 14 years old. It crashes sometimes too. There is quite a learning curve, but after a while you do get through it. The AI is random or too predictable at times, if they plop a stack randomly into your territory and refuse to leave, they're 90% going to declare war. Playing on easier levels, outsmarting the AI is fairly formulaic, aggressive expansion for the first half, strategically stealing all resources and then ploughing through them all. Small maps are too small, and if you create a massive map (which you can do in the editor, which itself has a learning curve) there is a city limit of 450. The game reaches its limit, but by that point each turn is so long, why bother. Naval conflict is always a bit piddly too. 

But really the base game has a simple enough format that its almost like a PC version of Monopoly. You can play it again and again, no fancy 3D experience or anything, the graphics really don't impede gameplay. 14 years later its still perfectly playable and, importantly, provides a fun and varied experience. Each game comes out wildly different from the last one, and every time you play a new challenge will arise. The randomized earths created offer nearly infinite variety and eliminate any boredom you could experience with similar games. I can easily play this game for hours and hours. Similar to Paradox games, once you start a campaign its hard to finish, there is enough variety in maps you always want to do something else. Games can easily go far into the future, and with some mods you can add some variety onto the existing game's timeline.

The player starts off in the year 4000 BC with a small group of settlers and some basic knowledge of road building, irrigation & farming. After choosing the site of their first City the player then has to explore and expand their empire to other locations. The ideal placement of a City would be close to natural resources & luxuries, this will help increase trade, production & happiness of the citizens. Connecting City's via roads also increases trade and the sharing of resources / luxuries across your empire. During the early game roaming Barbarians may cause problems along your borders and any unprotected units or land will be either captured or pillaged. As you progress through the centuries you will eventually meet other Civilizations. Some of these will be friendly and willing to trade, others more hostile and may attack you completely unprovoked. You have the opportunity to influence the opinions of other empires by your actions towards them, giving them gifts or trading technology is usually a way to get on their good side. Later in the game you can also forge an alliance with certain empires in the form of a mutual protection pact. This is especially useful during times of War to help seal victory over your enemies. The game ends in one of six ways, the most traditional being conquest (destroying all opponents). The Space race victory occurs when any Civilization completes and launches a Space Ship to Alpha Centauri. Other victory types are Cultural, Diplomatic & Domination. If the game ends and no one is victorious by any of these, the game uses a ""histograph"" to determine the winner by points.

This is one of my all time favourite games, though Civ IV has more depth by adding religion, unit promotions and other special abilities. I still prefer this version to any other.

This could be due to the fact that the Civilization seies simply soars while civilization itself seems to soar and stink in equal measure. Then again, it could be that the game of Civilization simply appeals to the inner narcissist lurking somewhere within us all. After all, how often is it you can be elected ruler of your nation by popular acclaim, rule them in a governmental form of your choice, eventually rise to rule to world, establish Earth's first off world colony, and live for centuries. I have to admit that is slightly more ambitious than my own real world expectations, but I do have an eye on the North American continent. Consider yourself warned.

Now don't get me wrong here. I am not trying to say that Civilization is the best turn based, civ building, strategy game ever. That would be unfair to all those games I have not gotten around to trying. What I can say is that it is by far the best I have ever played, and narcissist that I am, I will try most anything that gives me a shot at world domination.

The Civilization series is up to Civ-5 at this point, but Civ-3 is a game which endures the times, remains comparable to like games of more recent production, and holds a special place in my heart when compared to the newer versions of this long running classic. Later editions of this game introduce elements which alter the play style and base strategy of the game, but while I believe that Civ-4 & 5 remain true to the original construct to a large degree, it is Civ-3 which most closely  resembles the original. In fact, it is exactly like the original, but with greater user options, and smoother game play. 

If you have been thinking about giving this series a try, Civ-3 is a great place to start. With the release of Civ-5, the Steam price for Civ-3 is a mere $5.00 which in my opinion makes it one of the best bargains in the entire Steam Library. Just one run through of this game will keep you occupied for longer than the run time of a long movie, and when was the last time you got into a movie theatre for &5.00 eh?

Sid Meier's Civilization is one of the greatest game franchises ever, it's a landmark for every turn-based strategy game. The name itself tells what the game is about, you pick one civilization, select a location to start, select CPU controlled civilizations and settings for that specific map. Your job is to make your civilization meet any of the victory conditions, which can be through science, military, culture, diplomacy, points, etc. The first game of the series I played was Civ II, back in 2001, which instantly made me a fan since then. However I skipped Civ III at its time, and that is what made me buy it many years later. I paid around 1USD for the game just to see what I missed, and unfortunately, not much. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but if you played Civ IV, in my opinion, there is nothing in Civ III that will be better than in the later game. It's only worth playing for saudosism purposes. It's heavily outdated.

Content - 8.5
Steam version is a complete version, which includes both expansion packs released. You have a vast number of civilizations to pick and you can adjust some major settings for a location, like temperature, umidity, geological era, water level, etc. You can also chose the victory conditions for a game, which you can fit into your play style, along with difficulty level. The Civilopedia is a tool of great educational value, it contains real data about the civilizations, technologies, unities and almost everything you can find in the game. There is a highest scores table too, but I believe it only displays single-player scores. I don't know if steam is providing some sort of multiplayer support at this time.

Gameplay - 4.0
Like most Civ games, you start with a settler, a worker and/or a warrior in most cases, from this you have to build your city and administer it's growth with the resources gathered around it, which can be selected in the city radius. Each unity you create in a city has a better use, and through the years (turns), as long as your cities and citizens are productive you'll eventually discover technologies which improve your unities and your cities buildings. You can focus your whole civilization in a few aspects or diversify your knowledge. Every civilization on the map have it's own personality and choices, from warmongers to pacifists. What you have to do is to secure your civilization a place in history. But why I give 4.0? It won't help you get started at all. I'm not asking for a strategy guide, I just wanna learn the basics of the game, what's unique to it, what options I have and what they do. I couldn't find a tutorial or at least a checkbox to display tooltips, even the options in the main menu don't have a basic description. It's one of the less intuitive game I've ever seen, unlike it's predecessor ou sucessor. Of course after sometime you'll start to get used to the controls, but they still feel weird. The UI is not friendly even for games older than it is, Age of Empires II is older and has a much more friendly interface and controls.

Graphics - 2.5
The game looks very bad even for its generation, Age of Wonders and Medieval Total War had much better visual quality. Civilization III looks so bad that if affects gameplay, you need to often take a closer look to identify some terrains and unities. There are no options for good graphic enhancements, you can not adjust resolution, it's based on desktop resolution, and even tweaking can't get satisfactory results. I know it's an old game, but the ones I cited are old too and are from the same genre. At least the game showed an improvement compared to the previous title, texture quality is better and there are movement animations for the unities.

Here you are!

This is a basic turned based Real Time Strategy game based around building a civilation from a tribal state to a modern age.

The Charm of this game really comes from your opponates, how they'll mock you, or try to threaten you to give them what they want. You can completely civil, or you can be a thorn in everyone's side, which can get to the point of the entire planet trying to destroy you.

A problem is that the mechanics can be confusing, heck it took me a solid three hours of reading to get a basic grasp on the game. but once you learn it, it's down, and it become second nature.

Another problem, if you can call it one, is that this game will burn hours of your life without your consent, seriously, you will play 4 hours stright and swear it was maybe 30 minutes.

Do not waste time on this unless you are one of those wonderful few who enjoys reading 5 paragraphs of text about how best to utilize workers only to realize there is absolutely no explanation on how to use them or even make them. 2 turns in and city starts burning, without fail. 
4 tries on easy mode and either I'm the dumbest creature to ever roam these parts or this game is a waste of money, take your pick.

Here you are!

This is a basic turned based Real Time Strategy game based around building a civilation from a tribal state to a modern age.

The Charm of this game really comes from your opponates, how they'll mock you, or try to threaten you to give them what they want. You can completely civil, or you can be a thorn in everyone's side, which can get to the point of the entire planet trying to destroy you.

A problem is that the mechanics can be confusing, heck it took me a solid three hours of reading to get a basic grasp on the game. but once you learn it, it's down, and it become second nature.

Another problem, if you can call it one, is that this game will burn hours of your life without your consent, seriously, you will play 4 hours stright and swear it was maybe 30 minutes.

8/10 
PROS:
Great RTS game play
Aged nicely
great freedom to choose

CONS:
Quite a few things to learn to even start playing
Will sink hours without you knowing it.

This game is fun, that said it is fun for a certain type of people, I tend to enjoy the early game most(I have trouble actually keeping large militaries)
First off you have to micromanage to be effective for longer than a few dozens of turns. You have to at least a thousand years in the future to avoid dead ends. You will at some point have to deal with long stretches of nothing to do but click the next turn button. Which WILL leave you paranoid that your enemy is pulling ahead. (On higher difficulties they are)
That said seeing a strategy work when you weren't certain it would, or looking at the 5-6 techs you have on EVERYONE can be amazing.
So if you like a game that makes you fear idling, an AI that won't give you a break, and some amazing victories, pick it up.
If you have the dosh though pick up one the later ones first;

I had to lower the screen resolution to avoid the 'tiny-litle-units' making my ayes go into pain. :-) But after all these years, I really enjoyed again the struggle to build a sivilization. There are newer versions of the same game nowdays. But I really believe that each of the Civilization games has its unique satisfaction to offer the strategy gamer, even if Civ IV is my prefered one.

I definetly recoment CIV III, especially moded with mods like ""Rise And Rule"", which add many new units, technologies etc.  The problem is, I can not clearly identify what is this 'different gameplay aspects' that kept me playing CIV II all these hous and not starting a CIV IV or CIV V campain... The differenses on units, wonders, railway inprovements etc, should not be enouph to get me playing a game as old as this one... On the other hand, I got myself missing the real-movie councelors of CIV-II, but I don't think I will play that old love again :-)

In any case. Considering the very low price that you can purchse this old game (Civilization III), especially in a bountle together with the newet versions, I definetly believe that any gamer that likes turn -base build-expand strategies should give it a try.

   But anyway the reason your reading this is to learn weather or not this game is worth 5 bucks to buy. To answer that you must ask  yourself some questions.
1) do you like running your own country and mercilessly clicking other countries to death?
2) do you like exploring randomly generated worlds and clicking other countries to death?
3) do you like sending hundreds of units at enemys to make them fight to the death with other countries units by clicking?
4) do you enjoy classical music while clicking other countires to death?
5) do you care that there are 3 newer versions of the game?

If you answered yes to 1-4 and no to 5 BUY THE GAME
If you answered yes to 5 don't buy the game you nostalgia hater
If you answered no to 5 and yes to 3 of the first 4 questions then BUY THE GAME
If you answered no to 5 and yes to 2 of the first 4 questions you may want to consider waiting untill the game goes on sale
If you answered no to 5 and yes to 1 of the first 4 questions you may be looking at the wrong genre of games

Civilization III (or Civ III for short) is an argricultural war simulator, in which you build wheat, farm iron, and thresh people in a significant battle over land and cities.


Should you take too long to murder your foes, the game may decide to just let you win by saying you're so cultural that there's no way they can challenge you, and they automatically forefeit. Which is stupid, because a rich culture like that is not as likely to have the vast killing potential an uncultured brutish army nation would, but alas, not everything in life, or Civ, is logical.

Here are a few topics that I wish to highlight:
- It is a low-paced, turn-based strategy game with a significant amount of historical content.
- There are a few variables in the game that the person should learn before starting to play. Luckily, steam provides us with a manual, so DO read it.
- For beginners, this game may become tough, even at the lowest difficulty setting. Even after learning the basics, there are many things one can do wrong.
- This game can take MANY hours of your time, and once your civilization has more than 10 settlements, it may take more than a minute to play each game turn. In addition, there may be dozens and dozens of turns before a victory condition is met.
- Although it DOES seem to work on my Windows 8.1 machine, there are a few frustrating issues, such as window switching not restoring the original resolution until the game is terminated. Also, the game may occasionally crash on some particular user, and so far it has always crashed after the end of a game. This means that the game could have had a better preparation for modern systems.

Therefore, it is both hard to recommend and unrecommend this game. Take this as a midline evaluation. If you have time to spare, go ahead and give it a try.

That said, It' s a solid 4X title, Graphically, it's obviously not going to be State of the Art, but I've never found that to matter with this genre; and apparently neither have most people given that one of the most popular 4X games around is Alpha Centari, which came out in 1999. 

Sorry, got a bit off topic.

Like all the Civ games, Civilization 3 puts you in control of a settler and warrior, kicks you into the oceon that is its game play and tells you to swim. The tutorial is there, but it's basically a series of tips that pop up when you start doing things. well written and concise, but they don't force your hand. Also like the other Civ games, there is a large tech tree and ages to advance through as your empire grows. The main appeal of the game is that no two playthroughs [which can take weeks to months if you play casually] are ever going to be the same. One game History may play out as you destroy the Aztecs as the Spanish... but in the next game, Gahndi might nuke your American ass into oblivion. 

Ultimately, 4X games aren't for everyone, but everyone should give the genre a try and at the price they're asking for it, Civ 3 is an affordable, still good looking, and complete introduction to the genre as well as a game that experienced players will enjoy for years to come.

[[A note on the CIv Franchise: those of you who started civ with 4 or 5 should also give 3 a try, the three titles are honestly different enough that they could be said to be equally good in their own right, assuming of course that you have the DLC for Civ 5, otherwise.... *shudders*]]",1403328482,1403328482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're new or interested in Civilization games, I HIGHLY recommend reading further and/or watching videos to understand what you are getting into:

Pros-

This game is highly detailed and allows for a significant amount of strategy-management decisions. Learning the system and ""how to beat it"" itself was an enjoyable that I still can't fully claim to have achieved.

Cons-

There is no help in-game in actually learning the game. This will either add hours of patience in learning the game, or frustration.

The computer AI is abhorrent for trading.

Fair Warning: This game is SLOW. I am okay about slow games, when I am mentally prepared for it. This game is so slow, whether due to micromanagement, organizing your thoughts, or constant unit/city decisions. In my opinion, the pacing of this game is not evidence of a detailed well thought out game (which yes, it is), but of a poorly designed game. Even in ""speed-mode""...just ugh, it's still slow.


I suggest that if you are interested in a strategic, decision-making game, and ok with long games, the Civilization games will suit your needs. Furthermore, I suggest looking into Galactic Civilizations, at the least for the sake of a real tutorial.

First off, if you bought Civilization Revolution for the Xbox 360 or iPad, that is nothing compared to this old but fantastic game.
Secondly, make sure you play this when you havn't got anything else to do in the next 24 hours because this game takes some time and patients and you are guranteed to get 100% addicted.
However, if you want to go online, nobody will be on there and if you host a server nobody will join (unless, of course, one of your friends have the game and you invite them). Also, on your first game you ever play, make sure you make it so it's on the easiest difficulty and do a little amount of Civilizations otherwise you will get brutally battered like a Cod fish.

10 features Civilization 3 has that Civilization Revolution Doesn't

1. You can alter the map size between Tiny and Huge.
2. You can alter the settings on how to win the game.
3. The Middle Age is included.
4. You get workers to build Outposts, Mines, Barricades, Irrigation (farm/food resources) etc.
5. There is more research.
6. More units.
7. Create your own map in the editor.
8. Edit the map properties.
9. More Civilizations.
10. More Civilizations allowed to be active in game.

Keep in mind that Civilization Revolution is newer than Civilization 3.
I can't really think of anything you can't do in Civilization 3 that you can in Civilization Revolution.
I cannot compare Civilization 3 to Civilization 2, 4 and 5 as I do not have those and I have never played them. I would assume that Civilization 4 and 5 are better though.
I completely reccomend this game and I'd say it is still a brilliant game now in 2014 and that takes a lot for a game to be that good!

Hope this makes you want to buy Civilization 3 because it deserves more buyers. This game is also very handy if you have have a bad Graphics Card and Processor like my computer.

I was hoping that Civ IV was that point where the devs went through a 'lets temporarily sell out and fuck up the franchise for a while' phase, but it turns out Civ III is shitty as well.

Okay, it's not as silly as Civ IV.  In may ways, I still despise Civ IV, but I'll admit it's a nitpick.  I'd give it the same rating otherwise, because it's almost the same game.  Civ IV's interpretation of religion is silly.  Read the other review for more about that.

Okay, enough about fucking Civ IV, lets talk about Civ III.  But what is there to talk about really?  I tried to have fun, but it was the dullest 5 hours on chieftain (easiest difficulty) of moving around a bunch of soldiers and workers (that's all this game is, soldiers and workers and building ROADS) with the scandinavian vikings that I used to conquer the Aztec empire (ultimately a game of city tag), while fending off Japanese and Romans, I've ever had.  Eventually, I resigned, because Sumeria was really big, Persia entered a 'golden age', and I had to end it at some point.

There was no way to end this game properly without playing for another 8 hours, and that was a standard size map.

MAJOR IRRITATING PROBLEM:  From the origional, after a unit moves, the game jumps to the next (not nearest) unit that may be half a world away.  There is no way to stop and look at what your just-moved unit saw without scrolling to find it.  This becomes very irritating after a while.  I had forgotten about it.  It is not a bug, it is programming design.  This got fixed in later games so the game paused after each unit moves, allowing you to stay in an area and complete a battle before moving on by hitting a key when YOU are ready.

First of all this title still holds up tremendously well nowadays, it runs on newer operation systems and you can tweak the resolution in a file making the game really great to play. There aren't any issues at all.

Civ3 is not as complex as Civ4 and doesn't have such intricate indepth mechanics but still manages to keep the player busy, you have to manage several aspects of your empire. The more streamlined gameplay makes this Civilization my favorite, it's easy to understand but yet very hard to master. You get down the basics really fast but in order to be good at it, you need some serious practise. There are tons of different civilizations to choose from and many different scenarios. The included expansion offer even more content. The AI is really good and easily challenge you, even on lower difficulties.

I would say ANY Civilization game so far is a buyer and a keeper, if you are into turn based strategy games.
The only reason Civilization 1 is missing from my collection is the rareness of finding someone having and willing to sell his/her copy, I woud jump at the change;)

every Civ Game adds a little and removes a little, the one that you like most is personal flavour.
To me this one certainly ranks higher than the later Civ 4 and 5.
This game was and is the height of ""classic"" Civilization games.

For you people ariving at this from Civ 2 : you only will miss the old advisors (civ 5 and they still not have returned them sadly enough)
For you people ariving at this from Civ 4 and 5 : no religion, but instead you will love the stacks of doom, army units, and other things that were removed in later game.

This game is also somewhat older and a lot lighter on system requirements than later civ games, making it great to play on any device you want to.

This is another one of those titles that you might have grown up with as a kid and have had nostalgic value to you. This is at least the case for me. I remember that the game took a chocking 700 MB of space on my hard disk and it was generally tanking my late 90's computer. I have sunk a huge amount of hours into this game and for me this is the best game in the series.

Civilization is probably the most dominating Turn-based strategy game in the gaming industry. The Total Wars games for example are RTS/TBS hybrids, while CIV is completely TBS. True Civilization enthusiasts probably rank Civ3 pretty low, compared to Civ2, Civ4 and Civ5 which were very well received for their times. For me however, Civilization 3 is the favorite among the ones I've played (Civ3, Civ4 and Civ5). Again - because of it's nostalgic value.

All Civ games start out the same way unless you play a scenario or campaign. You start off with a settler and a warrior of some sorts. The settler can build a city, and as you find a suitable location for your capital - let your Civilization begin! Beware though, once you have started a game you won't be able to leave for at least 4 hours. This game is honestly best played during the night and is mostly a single-player experience.

There is a Campaign/Scenario mode, where you play historical events or just silly settings. As well as a multiplayer mode, but I have never enjoyed these ones at all. Nothing beats that random map mode, select the terrain, the climate, map size and your opponents/allies. Let the history get rewritten as you choose the path of the righteous, or the path of the tyrant. Through exploding expansion, racing technology, crushing warfare and cunning diplomacy you must stand victor as the one and only dominating superpower.

It starts out with a somewhat mixed feeling. Some of the great ideas from Alpha Centauri has been brought over creating a much more versatile playing field with a living map and more unique factions but many of Alpha Centauri's greatest assets, such as the ability to build your own units and terrain elevations are notably absent. and others, such as unique factions, are only half implemented.

These improvements however do still manage to increase the interactivity of the game substantially particularly when combined with the many new features, such as culture, that Civ III brings to the table.

Factions are not longer defined simply by their city names but now have a few unique units of little consequence and civilization traits of great consequence. Unique units are simply beefed up versions of regular units that give a faction a small military advantage during the time period in which the unit is present, this can be a nice boost if you happen to go to war in that time but it can also be ignored completely if the time for war is not right. The traits each faction receives now however are of a much greater importance and can range from getting a free technology every age to a half off cost on religious buildings. These traits are big enough in effect that they tend to define your entire game.

A new and important feature in Civ III is culture. Each city generates culture through it's various buildings and the culture in turn defines the size of it's borders. A heavily cultured city can even envelop the city of an opponent and flip it to your side. While the realism or historical accuracy of such a device is laughable at best it does provide players with a new means of expansion and a way to deal with those pesky resource stealing late game cities that the AI is so fond of placing in whatever unoccupied corner of your empire it can find.

Graphically Civilization III is passable as always, the city view is pleasant but the rest of the game gives only a mediocre visual experience. Nothing pretty but nothing that'll ruin your gaming experience either. The soundtrack is still mostly orchestral epics and works very well although the rest of the sound effects in the game are pretty forgettable.

All in all Sid Meier's Civilization III is a good sequel. It doesn't create quite the same feeling of amazement and enjoyment that going from Civ I to Civ II does but it manages to provide a good solid experience with enough innovation to justify the purchase.",1370435089,1385408748,True,14,0,0.657431483268737793,0,True,False,False

The strategies I had developed for 1&2 no longer worked (the catapult is quite different, for example) and it took me a few minutes to grok the culture concept.  Once I did (and learned the unit differences), I never went back.  The AI is sooo much better than before and unlike CIV4 (which despite buying and forcing myself to play, I never enjoyed), you still get to micromanage a great deal (but you can also automate quite a bit - the ability to choose is awesome).  Buy it on sale if new to the franchise & start with a tiny world.  If you are used to another CIV game, don't wait for a sale, buy it now & get to know the differences in the tech tree as well as the unit differences - I bet you'll like it!",1338835954,1338835954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
