They released the game like that on purpose and they listened to the feedback, any issue or idea the community had was 1 month later in the game. As of right now the game features an enourmous open world island that changes every season. The building mechanic is insanely detailed, it reminds me of minecraft only imagination can hold you back what you want to build. There are many items, weapons you can gather which can make you kill basically anything but it only last till you have resources, making you collect loot if you wanna survive long enough. The game looks so beautiful and immersive that i would have a hard time telling if it's a screenshot from the game or just a picture of a forest, i couldn't take a single screenshot without any bird, turtle or whatever animal just chilling in the background. Also improved ai which makes the whole journey more mysterious the ""people"" living on the island usually are not hostile unless you make them or just feel like that.

Some of the issues have been fixed and there is hope some others get adressed too.
---
Some not so important but annoying things:
- The building system is great and I enjoyed it much - but it has issues that need to be fixed, acceptable for early access, but not for full release (e.g. things are prevented from being removed that were not needed before). 
- It is impossible to hold a torch AND a weapon - but the extremly dim flashlight may be held?

Some really messy things:
- The inventory is very overloaded and spotting a recently found new item is a challenge... a and dropping things is only allowed for certain objects - so wanna give your multiplayer friend a pot? No, you need shelf to exchange it properly...
- Things are available for every character in multiplayer - picked up a pot? Your friend can also pick the same again. Leaving you with three times the resources - survival? Same with weapons and ammo....

Story is ... not very captivating, but ok like it was in the first part but with less emotional motivation. I liked the innovative building system and the idea and concept of Kelvin is nice, reducing the typical grinding to a very acceptable amount. I was totally not ok with the survival aspect - with ""Green Hell"" being my reference and having done this way better. I also lacked a bit the horror aspect of the first game, the cave design in the first part seemed much better and horrifying to me.
So summary: Recommended in general but for fans of the story, horror and the first part. You can have fun with exploring and the building in multiplayer but far from the perfection other comparable games try to reach.",1708701979,1708864364,True,0,0,0.45333331823348999,0,True,False,False

When i cut a tree with my axe, i feel like I am actually chopping the tree and moving around the trunk as i would in real life. I can use my crafted spear that i made and stab fish for food which i can then place on the fire and cook. I actually play this game on peaceful mode and enjoy the survival aspect of it rather than for the horror aspect. Graphics and sounds are beautiful. Animals behave like animals and don’t glitch or spin in silly directions. 

Also, giving Kelvin jobs to do is awesome and frees up your time, delegating those tedious tasks to him. 

Exploration is really well done too along with the story.

The map is 4x the size of the original but that isn't a good thing when 90% of the map is nothingness. Traversal is also awful, the vehicles get caught on the geometry constantly and walking is far less annoying. The design of the caves look cool but most are just confusing labyrinths with an item at the end.

The game play is no different than the original other than the addition of guns. The guns aren't good and the view models are absolutely atrocious. The iron sights are so far away from the camera and are held from the bottom half of the screen which just makes aiming challenging not to mention looking ugly. There's also the modern axe weapon which clips through the GPS when you block which is just immersion breaking and obviously blocks what you need to see, probably isn't the only weapon that does this either. 

The original game is far better in my opinion and this game is a huge let down. The first game has a way better map that isn't congested with hundreds of thousands of trees and you could get across it in 10 minutes. This game tries to give you a wide range of weapons but most of them aren't good. It tries to ""improve"" building but now it takes hours upon hours to make a basic structure.

I tried to hold off on making a review of this game till I spent enough time with the content I could find.

At this time, I cannot recommend Sons of the Forest. This may be subject to change as the game is developed.
The reason is the content is still lacking. I can only hope it gets fleshed out as development continues.

The game as it stands, is the most beautiful forest environment I have ever seen in a video game. The foliage looks astonishingly real, and the caves finally look like a real natural cave system. The graphics really have been given an overhaul, which is great as I always found The Forest to look off.

Honestly beyond this singular aspect, I struggle with finding more positives to list here, as each eventually stems into negatives after longer scrutiny.

Yes the building system is a refreshing new take on how to do it in survival games, but what is available is not intuitive, and lacking in depth. I encountered a few of aggravating issues with building:
1. Certain full log posts I placed for my defensive wall would not be able to be cut into pointed tips, only cut into a 3/4 log. Even after picking up and replacing said log, still could not be cut into a defensive post.
2. Building a sloped roof requires leaving gaps where an angled wall needs to be, I had tried to put 1/4 logs, 1/2 logs, 3/4 logs and full logs into varying positions to fill the angled gaps, but nothing seems to work.
3. Firewood is apparently useless in it's current state(?) After doing enough building, I was left with a bunch of ""scrap"" wood logs, which I found out could be cut into firewood and stacked into piles. This seems to be a purely aesthetic purpose, as I have found no use for the firewood after that.
4. ""Repairing"" a damaged staircase removed a log and put it in the wall vertically. Was required to dismantle the entire wall and roof above it to remove the vertical log and replace it as the angle for the stairs.
5. Building a bed in a home you built doesn't appear on your GPS/minimap as a building icon like the tarp shelters do. I assume this is also a ""home"" mechanic as, after a reload, Virginia was stuck at one of my tarp shelter locations, and did not leave that shelter, even when I was at my main base for several days.
6. Certain log placements show as white, but when you go to place the log, nothing happens. It seems this might also be tied to a potential duplication issue as well. Building on certain slopes with snapping positions just do not work together no matter what you do.
7. To not have a bunch of dynamic objects around, I decided to stick extra 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 logs in the ground as posts. Doing this I noticed they could be stacked on top of each other, but after a certain amount of time, they could no longer be stacked. This also happens with the firewood stacks, if you left one unfinished for a while, you cannot place any more on that stack, you have to dismantle it and rebuild if you want to put them all together.

Yes they detailed the A.I. system, but it is woefully underdeveloped in this current state.
Kelvin will chop down the tree you're building a tree shelter in. 
Kelvin will stop filling log holders and eventually just drop logs in random spots near empty and full log holders,
Kelvin and Virginia's pathfinding is atrocious. They continuously walk into/over, stand on, and lay on the firepits, log holders, standing crop plots, and basically any other object in their path
Kelvin trying to navigate a semi-open area to locate a single log holder is a winding maze at best, and a parkour climb fest at worst.
The cannibals have a degree more of A.I. than what was in The Forest, but in the end it all still boils down to whether or not you're getting in a fight at that time. 
You can't befriend any tribes, you can't have them fight against each other (as far as I could tell, at least) and once they're aggressive, there is nothing you can do to reverse it.
Some advancements in those areas would go extremely far I think.

The story, is incredibly confusing, vague, and absolutely unfinished.
There is so little there, and what is there is missing pieces, with extra bits that don't make sense.
I won't spoil it, but really, the only gameplay to speak of is exploring the environment itself, not the story.

After running as much of the map as I could, I find it to be a little too empty.
It's not as empty as most people seem to notice, as they think the majority of places to explore are marked on the GPS, which I will tell you now, there are multiple P.O.I. locations that do not appear on the GPS. I have found a crashed plane, an entire golf course, campsites, survey sites, not to mention the cannibal camps.
Though, it still feels too empty to be engaging enough.
As far as I can tell this island is meant to be, to some extent, a resort of some kind. Though I think it needs a bit more to represent that. Only the golf caddies and golf course really show a resort type of P.O.I.
Also, the caves are mostly empty, just 3 are actually worth going to, the rest being small (just a single room typically) empty of mutants and only containing crates of basic materials.
The cave system in The Forest was far more vast and complex than what we've been shown here.

At this time, I can only give Sons of the Forest 3/10, and do not recommend buying.

I first played this game a year ago when it was released in early access and now have almost completed the game in 1.0. This game has evolved nicely and met all my expectations. 
Safe to say that this game is my favorite of the genre and definitely one of my favorite games of all time. It's the type that you don't put down once you've started it.

Also, I recommend to turn off AA if you're on 1080p. Your eyes get used to the lack of AA but the reason for this is that DLSS, FSR and all the anti-aliasing techniques are poorly executed with the upscaling techniques and AA looking blurry, except SMAA.

The game just doesn't respect your time. My partner and I spent hours to build a cabin on the beach only big enough for a bed. We set up fishing traps, and started drying some fish. Seagulls come and start eating them. Set up scarecrows. It didn't do anything. Decided to make another cabin just for the drying rack. Seagulls fly through the walls to eat the drying rack meat. Moving logs with the log sled. Log sled gets stuck in floor. The game just doesn't feel fun like the first game. These issues with how long it takes to build things (even when not on beach) along with the bugs just make this game hard to recommend.

Here is exactly why in a bulleted list why (Spoilers)

TLDR: 
- Travel is slow even with vehicles (doesn't feel like the game respects your time)
- You are punished for killing enemies instead of rewarded
- The open world can feel very empty especially before you get the re-breather/shovel(which good luck finding those without the wiki)
- You can only save at a camp

Expanded for those those on the fence about the game and for the devs if they'd like to read 
(love the devs btw, every game just isn't going to be for everyone)

1. The map is huge and travel is slow (I am aware of the golf carts and glider)
To expand on this, no one wants to have to run 30 minutes north, get excited that they are about to find something new and then realize that they need a shovel... this was one of the worst feelings and totally killed the exploration spirit. 
""Should I run to the next GPS marker... nah its probably something I can't even interact with yet... guess Ill go kill some more stuff.. oh wait that will make the enemies stronger...""

2. You are punished for killing enemies... the new scaling enemies makes it so now when you kill an enemy you feel like you screwed up instead of feeling like you accomplished something.

3. If you miss a key item in a cave you have no way of knowing it so that you can go back and find it. 
For example, with the re-breather in the cave up north, I felt I had explored the cave and continued onward to the next cave. 
This limited what items I could get as I ran/drove/flew around the map trying to find the re-breather (which you need for multiple other caves). This was extremely frustrating until I finally looked it up online (feels bad man) and realized it was in a cave I felt I already explored. 
To be fair, the path is probably obvious to the majority of people but it was not for me.

4. Still not a fan of the saving system, wish it was skyrim style (especially with the long distances)

For these 4 main reasons I cannot recommend the game in its current state. I did ""beat"" the game when it was originally released on early access with friends while this attempt I am describing was solo.",1708828637,1708831310,False,5,1,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

Devs have created a running simulator with useless building mechanics, useless enemies and useless survival mechanics.

Let me explain: 
The story requires you to run from cave to cave, bunker to bunker to unravel the 'story', gather essential items til you hit the last cut scene.

Not once during this running around did I need to make a single building. Just used the first tarp they gave me to sleep in.

I just ran past every enemy, no need to fight at all.

Drinks and MREs littered every where so no need to hunt/cook.

Winter came along, a cold waning came up but nothing happened. No need to warm up.

Devs talked about hiring a movie actor to play a character. In game he has maybe 5 lines LOL. 

Very disappointed considering graphics are top notch. Crafting and building is solid, just pointless if your playing the story. Huge wasted potential. Do not recommend. This is not a survival game.

I haven't beat the story since I've been too focused on messing around and building to get through it, so I don't exactly have any insight on that...

GAMEPLAY aspects, however... the survival is great, and the building is awesome and diverse (you can build anything... cabins to huts to mansions. Your companion Kelvin, however, can't help with those unless it's a blueprint from the book)

Animals...? They're mid at best. You got squirrels, deer, rabbits, turtles, and a bunch more (less predatory) animals. Unless you count the sharks. The new raccoon is a nice step towards the possibility of land predator animals being added. 
I'd LOVE to see bears and wolves in the next updates.

But overall this game is a must-try even if you aren't a horror-person like myself. You can always disable specifics in the settings and it's nice how some things are optional to have.

TL;DR: If you're a ""The Forest"" vet and need more forest, the game is solid enough now. If you're not - it's still fun, but you need to go into this game with the idea that this is a ""Forest"" game, and not similar-looking survival games. The engine is enhanced vs ""The Forest"", but this game still has pulpy-jank that isn't for everyone, and is particularly geared toward co-op and fighting rather than wilderness surviving. You will either love it or hate it.

Initial impressions from an early EA build to 1.0:
- Performance is a little better, but still needs tweaking. Considering most of EA ended up being what feels like 70% content patches and 30% bugfixing based on the content patches, there's plenty of room for optimization - I'm sure that will come with time. I have trouble getting the outside world to run smoothly more than 60-70% of the time, but I am still tweaking my settings as I play.

- The huge world now has much more stuff in it. A lot of it is a bunch of static props that you can't actually interact with, but I'm okay with that. Environmental storytelling has and continues to be a staple of ""The Forest"" series. Certain caves have markers that help point you towards story locations, which I greatly appreciate. Too much of the map is revealed out of the gate, I feel, but I can understand balancing exploration with people who are genuinely bad at navigating massive game worlds. Having some caves revealed at the start is probably for the best.

- Survival still isn't that difficult due to the abundance of food / berries / low penalty for unpurified water, although now that containers don't respawn (they did before, cartoonishly trivializing survival) the difficulty feels more organic. Scarcity is a thing for the first time and it makes for a more interesting time!

- The soundscape is still a little off. Enemies often don't make any noise despite running at you like professional athletes through bushes, bats are still an inch over ""tinnitus triggering loud"" but not as loud as they used to be, and audio from certain enemies alerting to your presence sometime feels off - in that occasionally I'll hear them from MUCH further away than I should be able to, but sometimes it works correctly and I don't hear them due to distance.

I'll revise my review once I finish the story and collect most of the items & achievements. I recommend this immediately to ""The Forest"" veterans who want prettier graphics and a new island, but newcomers should not approach the game alone, or expecting another ""Green Hell"".",1677604527,1708813579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Better Play Resident Evil or similar!
They're finished, bug-free, have a good story, and these games don't even pretend to need a base!

Almost the same!
Bugged Campfire already after 2-3 Hours Gameplay, can no be lit anymore...

pretty cool so far i played 2.6 hours but i really like how the game looks. i have not explored all of the features but once i do i will provide a more detailed review.

3/2/23
 I have finished the game is here is what I have to say: Sons Of the Forest is definitely missing a lot of things.

 First, why remove the water collector? It was fine as it was in the other game and I do not think anyone would complain if it was a ""repeated"" thing and brought back here in SOtF. It worked well and was interesting in an aspect of survival; so why remove it? It makes the survival more realistic in my opinion. Also, getting sickness/damage from drinking water from ponds and rivers in the other game was a nice survival addition. Why is it not here? Is the water in this game all disinfected and cleaned?

 Second, I do not understand the removal of the log sled (as others have also said); it was something that worked fine and was a great concept. If the devs really didn't want to keep adding the same things into this game from the other one, then why not improve on the concept?

 Third, the AI doesn't *SEEM* to have improved. Maybe it has and my reptile brain cannot see it, but the cannibals and mutants do not have noticeable differences other than maybe a clan hierarchy or something. Something has to be said about Kelvin and Virginia. Kelvin is overall a good companion but can get stuck in rocks and other objects, and also completely do the opposite of what you want him to. An example I've seen of this is when you tell him to chop some wood for your tree house, and he instead chops down the whole ass tree you're building the tree house on. So much for advanced AI. Virginia has some interesting AI programmed with her interacting with you and slowly befriending you. I don't really have a bone to pick with her AI; there isn't really anything bad I've seen with her AI.



                                           !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




 Fourth, the story is so fucking confusing. Who is this silver jacket guy? Why are we shown a futuristic alien city? Why does he randomly show up with other people when you are about to enter the cube? WHERE WAS HE THE WHOLE GAME? Why was Timmy and Eric Leblanc randomly fighting a giant ass monster in the middle of nowhere? Why are they here even? The silver jacket guy is shown at the beginning where they almost kill you, but don't. They are never brought up again in the game until the end where the magically come running down a few steps behind you when you head into the cube. There are so many loose ends and just things in the story that loosely are connected but overall just don't add anything nor make sense. It's a lot worse than The Forest and it's like only kinda connected to it lore-wise.

 Fifth, there aren't many new survival elements added. What I mean by that is: the survival aspect is not really improved upon. I understand it may be difficult to do this. But honestly, there just aren't many new plants that are different from The Forest, barely any new animals, and the seasons change wayyyy too quickly. There isn't even new buildings that help you survive or add a new cool survival element. It isn't that much different to The Forest in this aspect.

 Sixth, the game needs to be more optimized. A lot of people complained about its performance in the game.

Bugs I've experienced:
When Virginia is given a pistol with all your attachments on it, all your attachments are gone once you take it back.

Logs bounce way too fucking much in water and don't just gently float along it. I reloaded once and they started flying towards the stratosphere.

Some items still make a ""kerplonk"" sound when hitting the surface of a frozen body of water.

Sleds can be used to go into mountains sometimes.

You can walk into certain parts of the mountains because the textures go invisible for no reason.

My tarp tent randomly breaks when walking near it.

 Also, do not play hard mode. It's way too difficult. Monsters are just copy pasted EVERYWHERE and deal unfathomable amounts of damage. I got hit once by the twin mutants once and half my health was gone. Babies take 1/5. Oh and they are also damage sponges. They deal a shit ton of damage and take like none. It wasn't even the challenging type of fun. I just suffered.

In conclusion, this isn't to say the game cannot be enjoyed at this state. I had fun even with all of its bugs and confusing elements. I believe with some time and community feedback, the devs can truly make this an amazing game. But as it stands now, it is not finished and is missing a lot of things. It feels empty in a way and like there is nothing else to really do other than the story (which is also kinda shit :/..)

5. At least one enemy into the minicaves, and fishing huts caves, and the final cave.

The first and primary one is an action/shooter where you explore caves and bunkers. They are always the same and have to be played in a predefined order due to each being locked behind a key item only found in the previous one, as a result replayability does not exist. While in theory it's supposed to be a survival horror experience, saving is trivial, dying merely respawns you inside the cave or in the nearest cannibal village, and resources are effectively infinite as loot respawns every time you load a save. Combat itself is not particularly fluid or engaging, and enemies mostly pose a threat because of how weak and clunky most of your weapons are. And the reason I said primary is because all progression in SotF is tied to those caves and bunkers - weapons, all kinds of resources, including a lot of basic ones, outfits and schematics can only be obtained there. While you can explore the open world instead, it's big enough to make sure you'll get stuck if you don't know what you're doing. Which is why SotF is played with a bunch of wiki articles and interactive map routinely opened.

The second game is the base builder, which is a pointless and entirely optional affair. Your inventory space is generous enough to make you never want for storage space, and everything you need to complete the game is readily available from caves and bunkers (you can live in either, making the need to build anything even more questionable) - and 9 times out of 10 is not obtainable by any other means anyway. All the crafting is done from the inventory, and the only crafting station capable of creating new stuff (3D printer) is located inside bunkers as well. While it's possible to do some base building purely for fun, even with the help of an AI buddy Kelvin this turns into a grind. Case in point: you want to build a small electric fence around the entrance to your bunker, about 30 segments, each requiring a piece of wire. You can't craft wire, so your only way of obtaining it is getting a respawnable one from the bunker. As such, you'll be able to get the fence done after mere 30 save/loads... yeah.

As a result, SotF tries to do two very different things at once, failing to merge them into a coherent gameplay loop. It lacks refined combat and resource management you'd get from Resident Evil or Dead Space, and its overreliance on getting stuff from caves and bunkers turns base building into a useless (even if somewhat elaborate) gimmick.",1708796131,1708796131,False,8,0,0.533090114593505859,0,True,False,False

I'm referring to a character that can accompany you in the caves; preferably, a mercenary similar to the one shown in the 2019 trailer. They don't necessarily have to assist in construction but should be a defense companion accompanying you in dangerous places, providing significant assistance.

It would be great if you consider this feedback, especially for those who enjoy playing solo.

[My Opinion on This Second Installment]

Regarding my opinion on the game, I believe it delivers on its promise as a good survival game. However, concerning the story, I find it ridiculous and unrealistic. Despite the game having great narrative potential, it seems that opportunity was wasted. The ending of the first 'The Forest' is, in comparison, ten times better than those offered in this second installment.

I understand the game doesn't aim to be extremely realistic, but they leaned too much towards the fantastical in the endings. Compared to the first game, which maintained a more realistic and enjoyable approach, this second installment lacks that coherence. The endings are disappointing, and although the narrative has potential, it fails to materialize satisfactorily.

If this comment reaches any developers, I want to express that there's still an opportunity to adjust those endings and make some modifications to the story. While it may sound bold to suggest this when everything is already well advanced, I believe it would be beneficial since I'm not the only one with this sentiment. I've seen many people criticizing the plot and endings, unfortunately.""

""Additionally, I hope that in future updates, questions are addressed, such as: What happened to the rest of the team that came in the second helicopter? Who is flying the helicopter that hovers over the mercenaries' camps? Why do you only find the pilot's body and not that of your other companion, [FishEye]? Did they die or survive? And, I know this may sound trivial, but why doesn't our character wear a vest when in the introduction it is shown that they have one? Similarly, it should be worn and visible in multiplayer. I see that this is set aside and not discussed. Lastly, I would like to add that they improve the character voices a bit, specifically Timmy's. I noticed that the voice actor doesn't put in enough effort or get into the situation.""",1677322086,1708789871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1326470,159147081,76561197983601366,430,85,909,156,909,1708730711,"It is with great regret that I have to say that Sons of the Forest is a complete disappointment and went into a direction that essentially removes everything that the Forest so unique and special.

To be frank, Sons isn't necessarily a bad game but it is a lackluster sequel. The Forest managed to blend survival, action and horror together but in a unique fashion which enhanced the narrative and exploration of the island. Unraveling the mysteries of the island and exploring the vast interconnected cave network was an absolute blast. The added horror gave it a nice spin.

Sons looks marvelous with lush environments, offering superb vistas combined with an atmospheric soundscape. The island is large with diverse biomes and seasons which can be some absolute eye candy at times. Thankfully, the overall gameplay feels smoother with refined controls and animations. Some of the quirks have been alleviated and there are plenty of QOL features.

Despite this, Sons completely fails to capture the sense of dread and exploration of the prequel.Sons puts a larger emphasis on base-building and combat but I'd argue that these mechanics were never truly great to begin with. Combat is still clunky due to the AI being rather awful and with jerky animations. Enemies get easily stuck or float about, sometimes they won't really react at all.

For some baffling reason, the building has become more obtuse and needlessly difficult. Sons introduces a new system that allows for more complexity and player freedom. However, it's finnicky and borders on being esoteric when attempting to craft basic things such as doors.

Exploration feels flat as the island is simply too large and actually quite empty. The amazing and interconnected cave system of the first game is barely existent. Players have to contend with boring small caves devoid of any decent rewards. Even when exploring for the sheer sake of curiosity, there is barely anything to see. The Forest managed to create quite a mysterious setting with the various hints and clues strewn about the map. Sons has almost none of that and there is no real mystery here.

It's serious downgrade from the first game which always had enticing locales, caves and points of interest. Sons simply lacks the charm and intricacy. Locales are lazily scattered around with identical campsites with dull caves (with some exceptions). I cannot stress how dull the island feels compared to the first game.

One could argue that this game is more about survival with the objective of setting up a base with solid defenses. I admit that I never bothered much with base-building in the prequel mostly as there is no real incentive for it. Sons is no different and makes no effort in giving base-building some actual substance. The inventory size is still huge so there is no real use for a storage. Tents can be easily built while exploring and resources are abundant which renders most base facilities useless. Furthermore, the game actively punishes the player because building will cause the cannibal raids to drastically increase.

Perhaps Sons is more of a survival defense game where you fight off sieges with your buddies? In theory yes but the execution is flawed. The raids are manageable in larger groups but otherwise you will never have be at peace once you start building a fort. Pairing the less intuitive building system with the constant barrage of attacks ends up being an exercice of patience. In solo, it is a major pain as you have to juggle all these mechanics with the clunky combat. With a buddy, it's alleviated but still a struggle. It's decent in mp groups but then you have to wonder what Sons is all about.

This may be the core survival challenges of the game and a personal skill issue. Still, it doesn't feel like a gameplay challenge and more like a constant wrestling with awful mechancis. This aspect may be entirely subjective as some players will truly enjoy the advanced building system with the siege type attacks but honestly there are better alternatives to play.

Admittely, building could be ignored in the Forest. However, the exploration and mapping of the island provided a completely engaging experience. With Sons, you're being left with a game that has an inferior plot with a lacking mystery factor. Your map indicates all the important areas. Building can be entirely dismissed or is a rather frustrating experience. All the new gameplay additions are welcomed but don't provide a substantial upgrade to the first game. Sons isn't even [i]more of the same[/i] as it is just barren. The beginning hours are exciting but this feeling quickly fades. 

You may get a few good hours out of it when playing with a buddy. Nevertheless, I don't think that Sons has enough content or a decent gameplay loop to keep players hooked for an extended period of time. Your mileage may vary but I think it's a shallow follow-up to the first game. If Sons was intended as an open world multiplayer survival sandbox, there are better alternatives. If you want something akin to the first game, Sons is definitely not it.",1708780099,1708786464,False,9,0,0.58687293529510498,2,True,False,False

I've spent hours on youtube and in game trying to fiddle with it by rebuilding/redesigning structures only to end up with the same issues.

First off, the performance in multiplayer is just not up to par. I encountered constant stuttering and lag, which made it really frustrating to play with friends. It's disappointing because the multiplayer aspect was something I was really looking forward to.

Then there's the audio design, which feels almost non-existent. For a game that's supposed to immerse you into its world, the audio doesn't do its job. In a survival game, sound is crucial for creating tension and alerting you to dangers lurking around. Unfortunately, the audio here is so minimal and bland that it fails to enhance the gaming experience.

The enemy AI also leaves a lot to be desired. Their movement feels off, and they seem to have little to no recovery time between attacks. This often results in feeling overwhelmed, as enemies can continuously attack you without pause. It could be a matter of needing to improve my skills, but even so, it doesn't feel rewarding to keep trying, given the other issues at play.

I'm holding out hope that with more time and updates, ""Sons of the Forest"" could evolve into the game I was excited for. But as it stands, I'm left feeling disappointed. Perhaps in a year or so, with more development time, the game will reach its full potential.

I would like to start off and say that this is one of the best open world survival games out there. The graphics are beautiful, the atmosphere is spot on and the game itself looks like it just got made by the unreal engine program. When i played the first game i liked how the story progressed throughout the whole exploration i went with. The Forest map were very interesting with the amounts of caves you could go into, and interesting buildings and structures, the inbuilt facility and of course the mutants and the monsters who were lurking in the shadows. The new sequel though is really good for it's early stage of development and even for an early access point it still holds up today with many things to do! This is very satisfying for me to see how serious this team is when it comes to their game and community. They are willingly to listen and have us help with their game by using our ideas and make it even better than expected, compared to when it came out on the first day of launch.
Important features that needs to be added to the game:
I think there are some ways to make this game even better. The island is pretty empty so it needs some buildings of course. Basically things to check out when found but still, for an early access i am very impressed indeed for it to have some content around, special areas to make you excited, but that depends on how long you actually walked towards this place unknowingly. They need to add more cut-scenes to the game and more voice acting. It is necessary because it will guide you to an easy understanding on what the game was actually about in the first place(going through videos and watch people explain it to you will ruin your gaming experience). More possible ways to build things too would also spice up some things. 
End of review:
I hope that the game will turn out super great when it's finished and i think this game deserves an 11/10 because of how great and awesome the story goes, how the game is built and why my graphics card hasn't been burned up yet when running this game.

EDIT: New dedicated server update broke the saves and potentially broke gportal server in general. I don't know if that's the game doing or the server provider. They also don't have auto server backup on by default.... Feels like early access all over again.

EDIT 2: We eventually somehow got a recovered save but this sh*t is annoying and messing up this whole experience of this game.

The game in general looks great visually with the graphics and animations but why the f*ck don't we have an auto save feature still. I was playing coop with 4 mates and I haven't played the game since early access release so it's been a bit, I played for 5 hours or so and it was late in the night, getting tired af and I was done for the night so I logged off not thinking there wasn't a autosave since that should be the norm these days in games but nope, lost a few hours of progress. Completely forgot this game has a manual save at every sleeping structure (beds/tents etc). 

Yes it is somewhat my fault for not realizing but also a bit stupid that a game in this day in age we don't have auto saves for survival games that take hours to do stuff especially exploring and games these days are prone to crashing. Also with the prompt of leaving the server, why don't you make the prompt more obvious and tell you that ""Hey, you haven't saved in *such and such* are you actually sure you want to loose this progress?"", which I thought was just a normal prompt saying ""Are you sure you want to leave the game?"" like every other game so you don't accidentally press quit.

Now this just in, my mate literally just messed up his save somehow when joining our dedicated server. He's not sure if he press New Game or Continue but he joined and it started him off in the helicopter again, and he 100% sure there was no prompts of starting from scratch. This game really loves to not tell you important sh*t. So I'm assuming we can just get our mates character save and import it to both of ours from the server files but I guess we'll see when he gets on since he owns the server. Again this game is great and all but cmon man, just give us quality of life things that actually matter. I experienced nearly the same thing in the early access game, this sh*t shouldn't be experienced again. So again this review is staying negative.

And wtf is this new jump pad thing, it launches you up in the air and kills you if you don't have a glider. Ok sure I can probs get away with that but it's absolutely not realistic but the fact you can use the unicycle on it and travel 1km vertically, no man that's fkn stupid.

And this just in again while typing this, my mate saved his game as a fresh character, left the game, rejoined and he's got all his stuff back from the previous save... Yeah this game makes sense.

vvv Early Access Review vvv

EDIT 2: The game is a weird somewhat polished letdown. The building system is really well done and the AI companions are pretty cool but the story is fucking dogsh!t. The end doesnt have a boss and it doesnt even feel like there’s any story at all. They show you this glimpse of this “story” but then it ends suddenly like it really doesnt matter until either the next game or update. So what was the point of putting “story” in in-the-first-place. Melee mechanics are still clunky af as the first game which makes it really annoying trying to kill mutant babies. Guns are cool but makes the game too easy. Overall it’s alright, they done a lot of things that are innovative then threw the rest out completely. So I'm still gonna keep the review negative since my overall experience was pretty meh.

EDIT: I've managed to use my mate's inventory save slot into mine and it works. I've tried enabling the dropped backpack in the config but as soon as I pick it up, it still has the no backpack issue. There must be a boolean somewhere in code that completely stops me using my broken inventory.

After 13 of playing 4 player coop I currently cannot properly progress in the game due to a game breaking bug.

I'm at the part of progression when I've got the shovel, keycards, pistol/shotgun, chainsaw and after running to my next point-of-interest; I got damaged while eating and stopped me from accessing anything so I died and after respawning and picking up my backpack some of my items were missing and some things I have that I haven't have before (felt like I was using someone elses inventory). So I saved the game and restarted to see if I can refresh but in doing so completely removed me having a backpack at all.

I've tried killing myself by either fall damage and by the mutants; and got one of my mates to kill me also but nothing worked. Everytime I try to access my inventory, it just says I need to retrieve my backpack. Tried restarting my game and validating but nothing works. I can still pick up stuff which says some things I'm full in and I can look at my gps; so my inventory is still technically there I assume but I'm being blocked due to not ""Having a backpack"" because of a random bug and it's impossible for me to progress any further unless I get someone to do everything for me which is impractical for myself.

At this point in time, this review will remain negative until it's fixed since it's literally stopping me from progressing.",1677318126,1708771359,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

The building mechanic feel unfinished at best. Spent 2 hours building walls and then when I tried to build a roof to stop snow I sundenly:
-> Can't place a log there
-> The logs are of different size
-> Can't put anything to level them despite having a bunch of pieces of wood lying around.
-> Can't put a roof if the logs are not leveled.
-> End up using an absurd amount of logs simply because whoever coded this couldn't be bothered  to let the player use a piece of wood to level another. 

The enemies:
-> Enemies appear out of nowhere and attack me because they somehow have GPS to track me despite killing all the previous attackers.
-> Dude takes 10 arrows to the face but guess what: he has a skin covering his face so it's alright.
-> 10 arrows in the enemy's shoulders? Just a scratch, I can obliterate this stone wall because I'm 10 cm bigger than the other enemies because that's definitely how flesh works. My friend who weighs 100 Kilos can stop bullets and all.
-> Player can be covered in full armor but little stick destroy everything because in enemy hand.

Either fix this shit or explain your mechanics because this is just a giant waste of time as it is now.

The full release brings countless new additions that were much needed and really make the game better, however the misdirection is still the main issue. You will get a marker on your map for a bunker you cannot access, but you will not get a marker for a cave or bunker you need to do first to access said bunker. It leads to unnecessary amounts of ""running around in circles"", which is certainly a fault. Also hit boxes have not been fixed in full release, hits feel cheap and unfair, and your offensive hits will often not connect, melee is a mess still needing to be fixed.

(Solo)
-Enemies are way too hard to kill now on normal. 20 stabs with a spear to a naked person is absolutely ridiculous, and they can kill you by slapping you 3 times.

-Enemies can just continue attacking you now even if they are taking damage. They also have action animations that can't be interrupted. 

-Weapon damage goes unnoticed by enemy/wildlife AI. ex. Throwing a spear into a deer's thigh only for it to sprint full speed into the woods, costing me a spear. Enemies largely do NOT react to having a spear penetrate through their torso or limbs, certainly not hindered by it. There's a few second knockback animation and it's back to business as usual.

-If you die you get one chance at a comeback then it's game over.

-I just spent an hour building up my base, just to watch an enemy walk into one of my traps and die, and instantly crash my game. All progress on my base lost entirely because saving is only done at beds on command.

-This game has to have the absolute worst vehicles I have ever seen. The golf cart handles like no one even bother testing it before putting it into the game, the Knight V is somewhat better but it's still a big yikes. The glider? Haha, good luck...

I've really enjoyed this game and playing with friends.
The map is really big and can take awhile to get around, as of the addition with the Knight V and the Glider that's not the case anymore, it can kill off like half an hour and drop it down to like 10 minutes or less.
The graphics are really good and I can run the game at a solid 60+ fps (Capped at 64) I run this with a AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, AMD Ryzen 3600-6 Cores, 32 gigs of ram at High - Ultra settings.
The story is kind of meh, I don't really understand it this much at this current time.
Cannibal's have just baffled me, im amazed at their AI and what they can do.
Kelvin is 100% the best NPC I've ever seen, and Virginia is a great combative, she shows no mercy to crying cannibals and just shoots them three times with a pistol.
This game probably has one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard.

In general.

Positives:
- Animations are way better
- Moving around feels better
- Controls are better
- Graphics are improved
- Audio is a good start
- Gameplay is good fun
- AI are creepy as hell
- Base Building and crafting are great
- Good atmosphere
- There is actually alot of depth to this game under neither the top layer, tons of caves, lots of exploring, building tree fort bases, getting a 3d printer and so much more

Negatives:
- Performance needs work
- A few bugs


Overall its go its issues with bugs and what not, but for day 1 early access release its in pretty good shape. Performance needs work, but other than that and the bugs I am loving everything else about this game. I am excited to jump in for some more and explore some more! It is early on but its a good start.

This game has some of the best basebuilding around to, I would put it just behind Valheim and Enshrouded's basebuilding, as the 3rd best in the Survival genre.

**Coming back for 1.0 today and its in better shape no doubt, performance is better, can use golf carts now, bigger map,etc.. lots of new stuff since I last played in Early Access.

2 weeks before the game was supposed to release in a complete state they reveal that it will be in early access instead.

If they respected their customers and were responsible they would have let us know way earlier than 2 weeks.

The game is not finished, there are some bugs and issues, the ending is apparently a placeholder and it's supposed to be finished in another 6-8 months. However it does much of what we want, it fulfills the ""The Forest"" formula and mostly only improves on it. Some gameplay elements from the first game are missing, hopefully they'll be added until the games full release.

Update: The game is better now than it was in Early Access. However the development time still took longer than promised and promised yet again, they said it would be complete 6-8 months after the original planned release. It took a year.

Let’s get this part out of the way, the game is not enjoyable on steam deck. “Unsupported” for good reason, the control mechanics don’t work properly which completely kills the immersion. I’ve tried every community layout and only 1 kinda works but you still need to tweak it further and even then it’s just too much work pressing buttons and holding buttons etc. 

The game looks amazing for a handheld, I can play a pretty solid 30FPS on medium graphics which is a huge performance improvement since early access. That being said, the devs don’t plan on making this steam deck compatible so that just confirms to me that I will have to put up with the clunky controls. 

I’m still recommending the game but just not on steam deck. Play this on a PC. The story seams interesting, the environment is great, graphics are great, horror elements are fantastic. The game is good, I won’t write a negative review about a game that’s not designed for steam deck, if it even said “Playable” I would argue against that but it clearly says “Unsupported” which is exactly true. 

Don’t buy this on steam deck unless your willing to put up with cluttery button mashing or Bluetooth a keyboard and mouse.",1708725049,1708725049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One notable improvement is building itself. While a bit more tedious than before, placing down individual parts does make it easier to build custom structures, (although fences are hard to keep straight and placement targeting can be finicky). Having a helper can help reduce the tedium of collecting materials so long as you're mindful about what you tell them to do and where. Do not order him to cut trees in the area you plan to build tree houses.

Defensive buildings and traps feel more potent and useful than they were in the first game (in first game, wall spikes seemed entirely for show.) Making it easier to defend your holdings. Although you do have to make sure to maintain them after battle (your helper can be handy for this.)

Exploration feels more challenging than the first game. Caves are not the ""clear and safe forever"" simple jobs they were previously. While more linear in design, they can open up to very large areas unexpectedly and that can be disorienting. The island itself is far larger than the old penninsula, though there are a lot of interesting ways to help get around, like a motorized unicycle, and a foldable glider. The GPS helps a lot for getting around and avoiding getting lost.

Story, however, is where the game is at its weakest. While a ""breadcrumb"" narrative of mystery and discovery worked for the first game, the first game was much simpler narratively. Here, it feels like a considerable amount of context is not established or explained and that left me feeling a bit lost. I have yet to find every bit of story in the game, but some basic exposition that I feel should have been provided about key plot elements and devices: what are they and how do they relate to what's going on? Hopefully that's on some missing documents I've yet to discover, but if they're going to have voiced cutscenes, that stuff really should have been in at least one of those.

Still, the game remains a fun survival horror experience. I should caution people to keep their expectations reasonable, as this is one of three games so far flooded with people who had absurd demands. As a result, there is a considerable amount of misinformation. I can safely say what the trailers showed me, I ultimately found and got. And if you played the first game, you should have a reasonable idea of what the second game offers. Consider that and make your own best judgment.",1708723714,1708723831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What makes it stand out from the rest of the survival games I have played is that the visuals are fantastic. Each tree, shadow, rock, and animal is designed very well to make you think the game is real, even though the required specs for a computer may be a bit high its very much worth it. The games design is incredible and with how big the map is compared to the forest you always have something to explore even when you have completed the game.

On top of the exploration a huge part of the game for me is the building, it is very different than most games I have played with premade buildings that you cant edit onto or premade structures which you can attach onto but in both they are very limited. Sons of the Forest brings the flaws of both out and allows you to custom structures however you want but also making it realistic in the sense you need structural support and a bit of knowledge to make something even as simple as a cabin.

One last thing I like about the game is how the setting works, there is no one set season, weather, or even AI path, everything revolves around how you play. The seasons change dynamically and AI paths change all the time according to where you go and where you have been to never give you the sense of safety. In the winter water freezes and makes it a challenge to find a fresh source if your not near a river, animals don't go out as much meaning you need to stock foods. Everything in the game is so perfectly put into place it always give you a sense of ""what will happen next"" just like life and your constant battle to stay alive.",1708720796,1708720796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Atmosphere is fantastic. 

Graphical fidelity is great - running surprisingly good on my relatively old hardware of i7 6700K and GTX 1080.

An option for a purely survival playthrough would be great. Like an alternate mode where you don't have (or don't start with) the GPS.

But yeah, if you liked the first, this is overall an improvement. If you like survival crafters then this already has enough content to while away some hours.

Edit: 1.0 is here!

The Story additions seem great so far, the extra 'things' (there's a lot) on the map are a welcome addition.

I still hold the belief that there should be a little less on the GPS right now (maybe as a toggle option in settings), intentional mission markers and lootable GPS tags are more than fair enough. But the 'vehicles' show up way before you actually discover them, and it kind of ruins the exploration. They're almost if not always by PoI's so you'd stumble upon them anyway, but as it is now you can just run about a bit with the map open and easily track them down. Because they add so much to gameplay, it'd be like putting map markers on all the weapons. I kid you not, within maybe 10-15 mins of spawning at the beach, I'd already found a golf buggy and glider that I otherwise wouldn't have know was there.

FSR 3.0 is a great addition. I don't know my exact FPS, but I now have the game set on ULTRA (1440p) with FSR 3 on Quality, and get very little if any stuttering and smooth frames, and my CPU and GPU are like 7-8 years old at this point. Endnight have taken an already beautiful, and wonderfully optimised game, and made it even better. SotF is really putting other current games in the genre (Enshrouded, Nightingale) to shame on these fronts.

The few new additions to building are welcomed, especially those platforms. I am greedy though, and would always love to see more to both prefabs, and the custom building, as the building in this game is an absolute highlight.

The new upgrades to the golf buggy are ace, but I feel like they should've been things we as players do, rather than them already being present. You find a golf buggy barebones. You then get the options to slap a solar panel on the roof, a radio in the front, an extra gps to the dash, hell, maybe even take up a back seat slot to add another battery. It'd go a long way to making a great addition to the game even better, and more personal. People would value the buggy even more if they had to put some work in to make it even better.

TLDR; I echo my previous closing statement. If you liked the first game, this is better in a lot of ways. If you like survival crafters in general, you're going to like this. It's all-round just a great game. And be it updates or new projects, I look forward to whatever Endnight gives us next.",1706185709,1708711976,True,1,0,0.505230128765106201,0,True,False,True

Hey, so me and my friend did the update this afternoon and so far all we've had is issues?
firstly he loaded in the the cut scene and landed on the snowy mountain with kelvin,  however i joined and didn't have any cut scene and loaded by a pond, we the discovered animals floating, kelvin was floating too.
we both shut the game down and started again, the same thing happened, only he too didn't have the cut scene. we tried a again shutting the game down, only for it to load up and there's no animals or cannibals....i shut the game down and loaded back up and thought to try single player, only to still have no cut scene and still be placed by a pond, no heli crash, no kelvin, no animals or cannibals.
we have both tried to see if anyone else is having this issues or if its already being addressed but we've found nothing?..we were looking forward to playing since the update yesterday.

resulted in me posting here and i did not know where else to post for advice.
we have been enjopying the game up until now.

Are there some areas where things could be improved?  yes.  There are some features that the first game had that have not made the jump to the sequel--all mostly QOL type things.  But who knows what the future holds.

And game mechanically some of the WORST ive ever seen. Started writing about the inventory system but i ran out of space, so ill leave it to someone else.


This game is/was severely handicapped in building
Inaccurate, clunky, slow grind, apparently this got an update so i cant say for sure now.
Hardest difficulty does not make the game hard AT ALL. It makes base building impossible though. You have 5 minutes in between every wave of enemies (that will tear anything out of the ground), to get materials, build base, build defenses. 
Fun is the exact opposite of how i would describe my experience building.


storytelling 
You could not write a less interesting story if you tried (subjective). The cutscenes are horribly done (objective) and i felt taken out of whatever immersion the first game left you with. I havent seen worse cutscenes in probably any game ive played. Not to be mean just to give an accurate measure.


And exploration
I REALLY don't know how its expected to figure out, which cave, among 40 others on your map that looks identical, is the one i haven't explored. Travel by vehicle is/was torture. Travel by hook is generally completely unnecessary and in the rare moments you need to use the hook gun its neatly stashed away behind some bushes and plants and backpacks and boxes and everything else you picked up.

Sons of the Forest, the long-awaited sequel to The Forest, beckons players once again to enter the dark wilderness, a place saturated with tension and danger. As a fearless adventurer, I embraced the challenge to discover whether this game could live up to the lofty expectations.

The atmosphere of Sons of the Forest is truly impressive. The thick, ominous woods exude an elusive threat, with every shadow and rustle of branches keeping your nerves on edge. The developers masterfully utilized light and shadow to create a sinister ambiance that consistently gets under your skin. Even after hours of gameplay, the oppressive atmosphere remained undiminished, a testament to the power of immersion in Sons of the Forest.

The story is subtly interwoven into the environments, and the exploration slowly unveils the history of the island. As I roamed through the vast forests, I found cryptic clues and abandoned camps urging me to discover more. The narrative depth fueled my curiosity and motivated me to press on, without ever feeling forced.

One of the most striking aspects of Sons of the Forest is the enhanced graphical beauty. The island's flora and fauna are breathtakingly rendered, with realistic details bringing the wilderness to life. The day-night cycle adds to the dynamism of the environment, with the nighttime hours adding an extra layer of tension and danger. The moonlight reflecting on the trees and the subtle shadows swaying in the wind enhance the overall visual splendor of the game.

In terms of gameplay, Sons of the Forest offers a well-balanced mix of survival, exploration, and horror. Building shelters, gathering resources, and mastering survival skills remain core aspects, but new elements have been added to increase the challenge. Encounters with the local inhabitants feel more terrifying and intense than ever, and the struggle for survival is further intensified by innovative AI and an extensive crafting system.

The multiplayer options add an extra dimension to the gameplay, allowing you to survive together with friends in this ruthless wilderness. Cooperation between players is crucial, and sharing resources and strategies enhances the social aspects of Sons of the Forest.

Sons of the Forest has exceeded my expectations and firmly established itself as an immersive and challenging survival-horror experience. The combination of breathtaking visuals, immersive atmosphere, and improved gameplay makes it a worthy successor to The Forest. For enthusiasts of the genre, Sons of the Forest is a must-play that will pull you deep into the wilderness and quicken your heartbeat.",1708697903,1708697903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, it's in Early Access.
Yes, it's unfinished.
Yes, I recommend it!

This is probably the most polished Early Access title I've ever played and I've only had good times with the game so far! Flawless co-op experience from the very start and that's hard to come by nowadays. It took the original title and cranked up every single aspect of it. Everything is just better!

I enjoyed the game at the release it was something that i was dreaming for a long time.
Especially when ""The forest"" was such a banger even at the release.
But in reality...

This game is total failure not gonna lie, why?

There are a couple of reasons.

Firstly the map
That is huge, yeah huge but empty even after 1.0 update you walk and walk and walk through the map and find absolutely nothing.
Also you need to run whole map to get something that storyline requires then run again to the other edge of the map to do the same XD.
They added a knight V and golf carts which are useless because if you want to travel you have to drive arround this big mountain.
We cant even attacht the log holder or something else to golf cart to make it usefull somehow.
They should add Helicopter or i dont know maybe the plane to be able to fly over this mountain. 

AI which is not even improved in over a year the NPC's are still dumb and the enemies are more stupid than you can think.

Combat system that is embarassing and terrible and even worse than this from original ""The forest"". 
The initial idea to add the modern weapons to game was great but cause we're livin in XXI century.
Its kinda funny cause when you get the pistol which is so simple to achieve you're becoming OP not gonna lie the weapons are OP
but the problem with them is that u need to have a lot of ammo which is not that easy to find.
Yeah weapons are extremely strong so when you gain a pistol or a shotgun or even a sniper rifle the melee weapons are completely useless.
Cannibals can block ur attacks when you cant block theirs XD.

The idea of building system was also greatfull but in reality it sucks because you have to use the patterns to build something.
The building system is just limited in ""The forest"" you could build whatever you've wanted without fear of limiting your ability to place logs.
New system just makes building harder.
Also the basic structures from the first part of the game are not implemented in the second part for some reasons.
The electrical system that is incomplete and its not what we need ingame.

Endnight games is focused on the story when the gameplay is the thing that as a players we want.
It has to be improved who ffs is playing SURVIVAL GAME for story. 
We need gameplay features cause game is just boring and repetitive.

The game has such a big potential but we need updates we need specific updates to make the gameplay more enjoyable that it is right now.

If you want to buy the game i advise you to wait one more year cause is incomplete.",1700795020,1708688933,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I launch with tears in my eyes. This might be the last game I ever play in my life and I just know that Endnight Games will deliver. As soon as I open my inventory after the intriguing intro, my game suddenly crashes. I go to close the game proper but my mouse freezes. A nagging beep sound echoes from my laptop. Doctors rush in believing my vitals have gone dark. Instead they find me sitting there dumbfounded that the sequel to my favorite game is this broken. I go to open the game a few more times and the same thing happens. 

This very well might be the last thing I write. The Sons of the Forest will most certainly be the last game I play. I just wanted it to be an unforgettable experience, but the game is just too buggy at this stage. Unfortunately, this is my final stage.

Building, while similar to the Forest, is alot more diverse and interesting. In all fairness it's been years since I've grinded some hours out in Forest, but still, the nostalgia factor was there. Just something about making communes in the woods with your buddies is great. Graphically, it's a step up from the original, firing this bad boy up for the first time was certainly an eye opener, and made me glad I'd just upgraded my graphics card. Settings cranked, didn't skip a beat and i was honestly impressed.

The downsides: Combat. After day 30 in game, combat becomes really becomes rinse and repeat-y. Cannibals get bigger and stronger, mutants become more abundant but... its not exactly engaging like the first game. The first one's combat was alot more ""adapt-or-die"" to where as this is just ""lay-traps-and-build-walls"". Doesn't make you get creative with ways to start mulching cannibals. Next grievance: [spoiler]the final boss. Man. MAN. That was such an underwhelming fight. I remember spending literal WEEKS researching new strats to try and merc her. The feeling of accomplishment afterwards was honestly something to hold onto for a while. But this one? Killed him in two minutes. The final cutscene? That had me at the edge of my seat. Then Mass of Flesh comes out and I was just kinda like ""... well thats something."" I was so let down by the final boss. So much so, it left a sour taste in my mouth. Lore-wise, yknow, in the first one it made sense. Fighting to save Timmy or fighting to save yourself. But from a storytelling standpoint... why was Jianyu even the final boss in the first place? What was his driving force? Besides being a Saharan op, but.. is that it? Honestly let down by the ending. The end is supposed to be the cherry on top, the final clash,  but this. This one does not spark joy. For me, anyway.[/spoiler] Overall though, multiplayer is good fun and pretty seamless, the walkie is a good system, hang gliders and golf carts are busted. Shout out Virginia. Kelvin, the only reason I kept you alive was because I needed a stick bitch.

almost everything from the first game has been improved upon and the addition of more guns/tech doesn't feel overused and pull away from the core aspect of nature survival. well except that golf cart but that's easily my favourite part of the game, its too fun to hate.

if i had to say anything negative i guess some parts feel easier than the first game for example when i die in a cave i re spawn right at the start next to my stuff so death doesn't feel like a negative or something to avoid at all costs.

1 - Bounce from POI to POI. Collecting food and drink as you go. Go straight to caves to collect needed items. Kill mutants, beat game, done.

or

2 - Try to actually build something, and play like it's a survival game.
Get harassed by locals. Stop to kill. Killing needs calories, so eat and drink. Go collect logs. Get harassed by locals. Repeat past steps 8-10 times, until ugly log cabin is built. Go get canteen, hunt food, get harassed by locals. Kill cannibals, burn bodies, get harassed. Stop, burn bodies, kill cannibals. Burn bodies, collect logs, kill cannibals, etc, etc, etc...

Actually trying to enjoy the game's survival mechanics is the most unfun and monotonous activity I've ever experienced, in a game. Which is a shame, because the game is so beautiful. AND NO, I DONT WANT TO TURN OFF ENEMIES. It's part of the game. It just doesnt need to be this excessive. Hell, the enemies aren't difficult, AT ALL. It's the constant pestering while you're just trying to enjoy what the game offers you to make.
It literally forces you to just... do the story, and thats it. The game rewards you for just cave hopping. It gives you endless supplies and you never get harassed, coz you're never in one place long enough.

I really wanted this game to be fun, but it just isnt. It's very thematic, ominous, and sometimes breathtaking. None of that matters, though, if all your game mechanics are designed to push you into content. Let me decide when I want to do stuff. Don't send your endless hordes of respawning mobs at me.

I'm not gonna lie I was starting to get worried maybe this wasn't going to live up to the Original game while watching it grow in EA, but I'm glad I was wrong. They stepped up everything that made the OG Forest good and fun and made what is shaping up to be one of my personal favorite survival games, just like The Forest was in it's day. 

The combat is a big step up from the Original as there are more enemies and weapons and traps to kill them with, as well as traversal being more engaging and important in this sequel because the Island you play on is HUGE! (There's a foldable Para-glider you can use anywhere, Electric Unicycle thing, a Hand Gun, Shotgun, Tazer, Clubs and etc.) So Getting around is easy and fun even though the map is very large. The Island is also full of detail and interesting POI's that often tell gruesome but sometimes funny stores.

Negatives: AI Pathing and behaviour can be frustratingly stupid i.e tell friendly AI to collect wood to build a treehouse on a marked tree -> ai proceeds to knock down the exact tree that the blueprint is highlighted on.

Storyline is a bit of a mess because you will undoubtedly explore and come across random segments of storyline and have little to no idea what is going on.

Cave side events (Whether you died and were captured or if you found a hidden cave entrance) are great; cold, dark and ominous however certain AI are extremely difficult to kill even after exhausting the little amount of ammo from your handgun, bow or grenades.

If you don't like that, don't play this. I played for about 50 minutes before getting bored. The start was the same: wander around and either make a base that will be useless or go into a cave for a bit. The biggest issue I still have is traversing. I found a golf cart and drove it, but it controlled awfully (and I somehow manage to send it flying away). I might update this more if I feel like playing the game again. So if you like The Forest or any ultra-super-duper-realistic survival stuff, get this. If not? Don't buy the game.

pros
1. graphics is this real life
2.building is really interesting to mess with 
3.the GPS is a fine tool to have this time
4. guns and bullets if you can find when you can get them
5.Calvin helps with resource gathering

Cons
1.performance is horrid at times on high end hardware
2.combat is just imbalanced and asinine 
3.movement is that of a 1000lb life guy trying to get away from an enemy
4.swimming to get to the raft the shark just lingers and kills you instantly
5.beware of the bone sickles seriously they can block cosmic rays as well as a nuke maybe even hulk
6.most things like logs C4 (sometimes sticks rocks) etc fall through the ground rendering it useless
7.multiplayer needs a super computer with nasa internet to run somewhat smooth you can forget about combat
8.hardly any materials like tape rope etc because that makes you go in to combat just to get those
9.chopping a tree takes a fort night.
10. calvin seems like he has the case of bad diarrhea walk
11. calvin cant hold more than one log
12. calvin getting confused walking around the walking into traps fires any that hurts really
13. calvin looks like a walking corpse that can read
14. caves are set up to make you go through them a specific way like a zipline you need to use from the other side which that other side needs lets say a keycard that kind of thing
15 this bring me to the other thing not much to really do if combat is Roached out and imbalanced


honestly good thing endnight put this in EA because this would have flopped so hard if it were fully released in this state. Like i said calvin's Ai and facial feature is that of a walking robotic corpse with diarrhea waddling
combat is horrendous 1 or 2 hits and you're a sneeze away from holding nothing in your gut and falling over like pov in a porno to wake up at their camp to then precede to die getting your bag because of long animation and cannibals watching over you like you're in a prison shower.
 
P.s cannibals running around confused looking just attacking anything you, Your base calvin the trees i've even seen them just randomly start hitting the ground. also they will also just not attack you which confuses you thinking that they're friendly to then come up to another cannibal and get 1 or 2 hit and die.

also the audio is basicly earrape as most to all sounds are extremely bassy and loud also some sounds are sounding like there is a pillow being forced to your face and ears completely muffled. this game needs some seriously tlc. I still recommend it though because endnight dev team are great at patching out all the bad stuff.


just tried the 1.0 update and i immediately went to a cannibal camp with one spear took out 4 or 5 cannibals even though they were damage sponges and then i found 3 more spears grabbed those went to take out the big oaf mouth breather that can run like superman on radiation pills and my spear that i through directly at him i watched as my spear went right through his torso disappeared behind him like it didn't exist so i through 2 more spears at him all the while he just ran at me like nothing happened with 2 sharp ass spears sticking out of his torso. continues to club me in a millisecond before i can quickly grab my spear from his body so i respawn right in the same camp which he is still toddler walking/running around with spear lodged into him so i go to grab it and run away to not be able to get my spear because i have to dry hump the cannibal to get the activation for the spear which is not really possible unless the AI glitches and does not attack you. this game feels like a bunch of Gen Z built it. clearly no one over at endnight are the same devs as the first game. 

why are people complaining and being so negative well because they want to like this game obviously, But its a total mess of just randomness nothing works well together and its like the devs didn't actually know what they wanted to do with this game or where to go with it.

its not worth the money don't even bother. nothing has any real meaning in this game its completely random the things that have been added enemies are still damage sponges golf carts can plow snow riding a unicycle while shooting or stabbing cannibals i mean what next fly to the moon on a umbrella like mary poppins with jet boots shooting and stabbing imploded meat sacks from cannibals being launched into space that are still somehow alive while also being able to breath in space. this game is just absurd Gen Z Vacc brain garbage. the only time i will play this is maybe if i wanna dick around on peaceful mode and build gather etc.",1677282892,1708638125,False,0,0,0.474853038787841797,0,True,False,True

I'll be rating different parts of the game while comparing them to the first one.

Story and premise:
 
""After the ending of The Forest where the player revives Timmy via crashing another plane (and the subsequent talk show), an apartment scene is shown from the adult Timmy's perspective. It appears Timmy has decided to research more about the Peninsula, and discovered another island which he designated 'Site 2'. It is assumed this is where Sons of the Forest is taking place. At the end of that scene, Timmy is revealed to still be suffering from side effects from the Resurrection Obelisk but fortunately has not fully mutated like Megan Cross.""
""There are three openings to the game. One in which the player's helicopter crashes over the forest. The player is stuck on a tree. Shortly after, the pilot attempts to leave the helicopter and falls to his death. Another opening involves the helicopter crashing in the snow. The pilot is seen dead while the helicopter is crashing and rolling down a mountain. The third opening is the helicopter crashing into the ocean. The player wakes up on the shore. Each opening involves a man in a silver suit hitting the player rendering them unconscious.""
-Sons of the Forest wiki ""Story"" page. https://sonsoftheforest.fandom.com/wiki/Story
I find this premise very interesting and I'd like to see how it progresses, I'll update this section more when i finish this game.
Overall 7.50/10

Map:
SOTF has a map around 4x times bigger than the one in the first game. This an upside but also a downside, the map is more detailed and has more zones but I often find useless caves or zones who seem important but aren't also, I may not have gotten to that point in the game yet but I don't see an objective that is as clear as in the first game. In The Forest you could tell from the beginning that the sinkhole was important but in SOTF the objective isn't as clear even with waypoints and stuff.
Overall the map get a 8.5/10

Enemies:
The enemies in SOTF are similar to the ones in The Forest, you've got cannibals and mutants. The cannibal AI is a bit better but the fact that they 1 shot you is pretty annoying and most of the times they just sneak up on you with no warning or even any way to tell. It also kind of annoying seeing 1 cannibal destroy and entire mansion you spent 5 hours building in 5 seconds.
The mutants are also kind of the same as in The Forest but they have slight changes, the mutants are much more on the scary side instead of the gory and gross side that was in The Forest. The mutants still do gross things but they aren't as macabre and now sneak up on you and you barely get time to see them in their fullest.
Overall the enemies get a solid 7/10

Survival:
In this game resources and water sources are more well distributed because of the bigger map, you won't have an actual mental breakdown while looking for drinkable water now :)
Cutting trees and gathering rocks and sticks feels more realistic in this game with more in depth mechanics.
Food is an active problem, you have to build your house near a pond or lake or else you will just die of starvation if you don't go out hunting.
In this game you also have a companion, Kelvin. He is one of your fellow comrades who lost his ability to speak and hear so you have to give him commands using a notebook. He can search for items and food, help you build, make you campfires and shelter and best of all be your loving companion :)
Overall the survival part of the game gets a very respectable 9.5/10

Building:
Building in this game is much more in depth and improved than in the first game. You can make your own houses with no blueprints and much more. The only downside is the fact that at least up to the point that I got to in the game there are no roller coasters like in the first one but i guess it's fine since they got replaced by ziplines.
Overall the building aspect gets an 9/10

Combat:
The combat feels faster and much more focused on just surviving then actually having a fair fight. Most of the times you'll find that running is much more efficient than fighting. There is a large selection of weapons that are good at different things. Cannibals can also be scared off and be worked around a lot more. With all that the combat still is based on how fast you are and how accurate you can get.
Overall the combat gets a 8/10

Multiplayer:
The game is more fun with friends but if you don't have any Kelvin is still good company. The game feels more fluid with friends, you can all work together and go together on adventures or you can all be on your own and try facing the dangers of the island while trying to race against eachother.
The multiplayer is a bit better than in the first game and it gets a 8.5/10

Sound/character design and graphics:

The characters and enemies are interesting and the enemies have scary designs, the sound design is good but ti can be improved in some places. The graphics are amazing but you need a pretty beefy computer to run it well. I have an GTX 1070 and an i7 6700k and with a bit of overclocking and some settings changed in the Nvidia control panel I can play on High settings with around 60-90 fps. I can do a guide on the settings I use for overclocking and on the Nvidia control panel if you want. You need the latest drivers to run this well.
Overall: 9/10

Fun:
It is just an all around fun game, I really don't have anything more to say than that.
Overall 9/10.

The game overall:
This game adds to the first game perfectly and improves most aspects of it refining mechanics and adding new and fresh stuff. This game is still in early access and isn't yet finished, but it gets regular updates and I think that the finished product will be really good.
Right now it depends on if you liked the first game enough or if you like survival games enough. If you do the price is fully worth it.
The game gets and overall score of 8.4 I am sure the score will improve after I finish the game and it gets more updates but until then this is all I can give.

Love, Pancake :)

MANY UPDATES AND EVEN THE 1.0 RELEASE LATER:
  The game is even better and worth every penny, contender for GOTY for sure!

Sons of the forest, has a good foundation but it def got issues and quite limited in some areas right now. If you liked The Forest you'll like this too. Issues I have tho:

-The game doesn't have what the forest had like locks on doors, e.t.c.(just an example bec we be here all night)
-Backpack seems glitched or seems to not be working at all rn.
-Slight performance issues i.e. performance gets worse the more you play (maybe memory leak?).
-Very limited amount of what you can build like no boats(from my knowledge) and many other things I can think they could def add to make sense and be useful, ofc fun aswell.
WALKIE TALKIE NEEDS TO GO!, but seriously you could still keep the walkie talkie has a simple on off mechanic for the mic but it should always be on and be able hear/talk to people,(if you want it to be realistic then why does my character have to use his left hand while using it could just have it strapped on back pack/vest like normal person would irl) but bec of this u need the ability to mute people individually which u already have a players tab.
-^Additional thing to add to VOIP, is why doesn't this game have Proximity voice especially coming directly from the character themselves, why can I talk to others on radio but not when they are next to me without radio in 2023?
-Options/settings def think needs some work, add more options.
-Wish you could have a hotbar for quick changing to things(maybe another item idea to make/have in game) annoying having to constantly change things having to open up inv just to a one time thing/use A item. GONE IN Hotfix 2
-Book ""Mode"" pressing x, needs to just be an extra tab to click on labeled DIY.
-Kelvin gets glitched/trapped a lot with around/inside player made buildings.
-Some things seem to be client/player side in terms of certain world items/events, i.e. like colliding with items (falling over/moving by players body) also the event from the PINATA Achievement seems also to be client/player sided tho this one might be on purpose.
-Player gets stuck holding an object and can't change unless relogging terrible in multiplayer, to add also player gets randomly stuck in place have to kill them/selves to move again(never had these issues personally but seen it happen)

Those are all things I can think of that def needs addressing, fixed and/or to be looked at right now. (24/2/23)
Hoping and can't wait for this game to shape up into something unbelievable overtime just like the forest keep at it endnight games!

- Didn't seem like building a base was very useful or important.  It was ""fun"" I suppose but no real point.
- You can effectively beat/finish the game just by running around to objectives and stopping to make a quick fire fill your bars up.
- Seems like you can find enough food/water and other supplies to finish the game without actually using the building/crafting system much at all.

I think this game could have a lot of potential, but it feels like they spent more time making some cool systems and features and forgot to tie all of them together into a full gaming experience that requires you to use all your ""tools""  (building/crafting/etc) to survive and escape.",1708628948,1708628948,False,14,0,0.482092142105102539,0,True,False,False

I think they need to add more survival elements and add more ALPHA predators/wildlife as well as more medical problems/solutions for the player. They also need to add like a horde mode/ every 7 day attack your base feature (7 days to die/Shadow of War but with cannibals attacking player base). I am a big fan of replay for games so randomizing were items are found would help as well as random events in the game to keep it fresh. More random events with roaming hordes would be fun as well.

First impressions are huge, and I'll be honest: the loading screen SUCKS. My system is 3800x ryzen 7 w/ water cooling. X570 mobo, and as of a year ago, the fastest nvme drive on the market: wd black pcie 4.0 nvme. I also have 32gb of Corsair vengeance ram, so when I say I have to wait about 5 minutes on the loading screen for my game to load, you KNOW it's slow 

With that out of the way, there are a TON of positives. The new free building mode is a MASSIVE upgrade from The Forest. Seriously, I can't state how good this feels once you understand it! It did take me around 15 hours of tinkering to become ""decent"" at building. Some things take forever to build, and would benefit greatly from being able to 'queue' actions -- like making sharpened fence posts. You have to cut them all 1x1 which can take forever depending on how long your fence is.

Combat feels satisfying, and the AI has been beefed up too. This time around there are WAY more ranged options -- and you can customize most of them. This makes the weapon system feel more immersive vs the forest which felt more like ""stat sticks"".

All in all, I'd definitely recommend this game. I'm personally hoping they add the UI scale slider from there first game as there is currently no way to customize the size of any UI elements",1708610789,1708610789,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The game is beautiful and the monsters are still scary. This island seems much bigger than the last. I hope to see more building choices, turtle water holders, more traps, and better lighter. The UV lighter is okay but a bit dark than I want it. Overall, I LOVE this game and cannot wait for more updates. Just please don't do an EA and put out ""DLC"" and make us pay for them. UGH that is so annoying. Anyway the forest two is SO worth it.

EDIT: Many hours into this game and I still love it! I know it's been rough and yes it lacks in a few areas but all the updates are good.

Yes, the graphics are beautiful and the crafting system is like nothing I've seen before. However, the plot is actually GARBAGE. The ending makes no sense, and the lore you collect throughout the game doesn't explain anything. To make friends with certain individuals is something that I couldn't do until day 43, even though I was doing everything that I was supposed to. The weather sucks, not enough mobs spawn when you're past day 40, and there is no motivation to hunt, craft, dig, build, collect, or literally do anything.

*OLD REVIEW* As the game stands right now the game is nowhere near ready. The animations are beautiful but become more of a burden when 10 cannibals are attacking you as you take 15 seconds to make a stick covered with tape. Just give this game a year or two, and play The Forest if you have an itching for cannibals to chase you on an island.",1679075121,1708462942,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are some issues - Virginia having 3 legs and arms, but a normal one piece bathing suit - it's weird. The knight V thing - constantly falling off it - the cannibal dudes are annoying and show up out of nowhere, they don't seem to have a culture or anything which could be explored. I HATE the cave bits, I find it really depressing. There's only one kind of fish you can hunt, small animal traps are never explained and don't work. Creating a defensive wall takes about 50 hours, and it doesn't work well. You can't drink water from any natural source without sacrificing health, even if you boil it, so the pot you collect seems to make no sense. There are large areas of the map that seem to have nothing - they're just there for the sake of it. Finding your own bearings is difficult. The best parts are Kevin who can collect resources for you but is absolutely effing useless for anything else, Virginia can fight people, but it's very buggy. You can collect x10 aloevera, which would not exist in this Alaskan inspired landscape, and not get a seed to grow it your own, at least on my playthrough. The survival guide is really odd, some of it you have to create from scratch, others you can place down a shadow thing of it, and Kevin can fill in bits of it, since he can't work out how to use tape or rope, and seems to have suffered a severe head injury given the blood outside both of his ears at the beginning. 

This game could benefit from more NPCs or some kind of narrative that you have to discovers from pamphlets. You are essentially thrown into this world with nothing and have to gradually figure out what happened. 

For me. I enjoy killing the cannibal guys and burning their bodies to get their bones. If I could torture them and try to learn their dumb language (I guess it's Serbian) that would be cool too, but for now I just walk them into traps. 

The Cannibals seem to be based on Serbians for some reason, it's not entirely inaccurate but I imagine is offensive to Serbs.",1708416652,1708416652,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Most of these cases were referred to US attorneys for prosecution, but only one of the individuals was ever charged with a crime. The rest of the cases were sent back to the CIA to handle internally. No arrests have been made and no follow, Buzzfeed in 2021 wrote an article alleging that the gov was scared to go after the CIA for this.

A former CIA officer, Brian Jeffrey Raymond, was accused of sexually abusing more than 20 incapacitated women in Mexico City. He pleaded guilty to federal sex abuse charges.

A woman whose whistleblower account of being assaulted in a stairwell at the CIA’s headquarters prompted a flood of colleagues to come forward with their own complaints of sexual misconduct. She was terminated less than six months after she filed a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging the CIA retaliated against her for reporting the assault.

A senior-level CIA officer told House committee leaders that his agency tried to pay off six analysts who found SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in a Wuhan lab if they changed their position and said the virus jumped from animals to humans.

Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Chairman Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) revealed new allegations that Dr. Fauci went to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Headquarters to “influence” its COVID-19 origins investigation. This revelation comes on the heels of recently acquired whistleblower testimony alleging that the CIA potentially skewed its COVID-19 origins review by offering six analysts significant financial incentives to conclude that the result of its investigation was inconclusive. Dr. Fauci’s questionable presence at the CIA, coupled with recently uncovered evidence that he, Dr. Fauci, “prompted” the drafting of “Proximal Origin” — the infamous paper that was used to attempt to “disprove” the lab leak theory — lends credence to heightened concerns about the promotion of a false COVID-19 origins narrative by multiple federal government agencies.

The primary thing I don't like is....what am I supposed to be doing? Like why am I here? What should I be doing? What is the end-goal? Feel like I'm just wandering around aimlessly and mostly finding copy/paste camps. Occasionally there is a cave with something more interesting. Is that the objective? to explore all caves and get their unique loot? Why is all the interesting loot only in caves? Aren't there other geological structures that they could have done anything with???

The other thing that bothers me is that the crafting system has zero tutorialization and doesn't follow a standard template. You just have to mess around to figure out how things work. Every item - try left clicking and right clicking, and holding click, and using it against various structures or the ground. A simple log can be used dozens of ways depending on where you are standing in relation to the log, what you have equipped, what you are looking at while holding the log. I wouldn't mind if I was holding the cooking pot and it just told me straight up - left click to drink, right click to dump, E to place on campfire to cook, E to fill at water source. But no, you just have to figure it out. And some actions are somewhat counter intuitive against the actions of another item. Like some melee weapons can right click to block, others can't. Electrical items, like stun baton, how do they recharge? Not with your solar panels. Well they just expend consumable batteries automatically and don't ever tell you they are using batteries.

If you are new to The Forest series I still recommend this game. Get your friends together and try to survive in the scary but yet hilarious forest. It is the perfect combination of tense creepy moments and funny moments when trying to build your base, hunting for food, or just exploring.

The only negative I have to say is the amount of content. First playthrough is great, but once completed, there is not much left to do. I hope this will be changed when the full release arrives. And add more achievements! It is always fun to get achievements.

Wow! Sons of the Forest is an absolute masterpiece! From the stunning graphics to the intense gameplay, this game delivers on all fronts. The survival mechanics keep you on the edge of your seat, while the atmospheric soundtrack immerses you completely in the experience. The storyline is captivating, filled with twists and turns that keep you engaged from start to finish. Whether you're exploring the lush forests or battling terrifying enemies, every moment is exhilarating. Sons of the Forest is a must-play for any gaming enthusiast!

Request :
Game that is early access but already fun to play, hope the developers can fix bugs and add some additional features (give fishing rods, more decorations, more building features, more treassure burried).
For caves that still have a little to explore, it would be nice if you added a few branches, like the first game the forest, which was like a maze, it made players confused, but it was very exciting to play with friends on an adventure.
A little boss feature please add more mutant bosses in this game, lowering the damage on shotguns and bombs is too overpowering it's not fun if special mutants die so quickly or are divided into several game modes with Normal Medium Hard Extreme or more
For more crafting, it seems that adding the steam workshop feature will help the developers in fine-tuning this game, I have enough complaints, this game is highly recommended to play.

So, it's a great game like it's predecessor. I bought it in december of 2023 when it was in the final version of the early access. Many people has said that this game is a running simulator. Yes, that's partly true. The map is VERY big. Four times bigger than the original The Forest map. On the first playthrough of the story I really didn't mind running across the map exploring it at the same time. The map offers you SO many exciting places with great graphics. The woods and the overall nature looks so good and it's fun to explore.

The story will change when 1.0 version releases but in early access it was still great. I will update this part of the review when I have completed the 1.0 story.

Gameplay is very good. Movement is great and controls overall feel good. There is veeeery much different equipment and items you can collect from all around the island. The game has many guns etc. to help you out in killing enemies. I even stopped using them at one point because they just made the game too easy. In the early access it was possible to farm ammo and therefore I had over 500 rounds of each ammo type. 

Graphics could be better. I mean they are so so so good and I play on ultra settings but still I feel like they could be better. Maybe they will upgrade in 1.0.

Couldn't really think of many downsides :D Some bugs. For some reason when you press crouch, the character won't sometimes get back up and he stays crouched for some seconds even though I have released the crouch button.

Idk how to write good reviews but overall a great experience. I RECOMMEND YOU BUY IT B)",1708299852,1708299852,True,3,0,0.539955198764801025,1,True,False,True

This is the third day review. So far, the optimization is such a piece of trash so if you're considering about buying or not just hold your money and play the previous Forest. Graphics are better of course. Difficulty is a little bit easier than last one. I've already finished and is impressed by the concept of the cube. Well done.

The original Forest is in my top 10 favorites, I think it is absolutely brilliant, and while I had my reservations about the abundance of guns in the sequel, I was excited about all of the other features the devs promised. 

The devs announced this game would only be an early access release less than a week before it came out, which blindsided everyone. Even worse, the game released in a very very basic state. Not even a fraction of the things you can build in the first game are available in this one, the number of blueprints is so limited that it feels pointless to play when the first one holds up so well and has SO MUCH more content. Their strategy is to slowly release items one at a time, which means there is NEVER a good time to jump in-- what are we going to do, jump in build the one new thing and then go back to waiting? Many of the new items are janky and barely function, like the hang-glider which is not even worth messing with. 

All of the above could eventually be forgiven-- presumably the game will eventually release and have sufficient content, and the bugs can be fixed. However, what cannot be fixed is the massive, bland and boring map that is difficult to traverse and feels auto-generated. The island in the first game is the perfect size, and each area has unique landmarks to help convey a sense of space. This island is utterly empty and the mountain in the center makes it difficult to get around what is already too large of a gamespace. I don't know how they could fix this problem, but it is bad enough to potentially be a deal breaker for me. They had the chance to make a lovingly crafted or at least curated space that you get to know through exploration, but they chose to take the easy route. The map is also just vertically too tall, you have to skyrim up many of the slopes, and even the top of the mountain itself is just a blank texture with 0 landmarks, like they hadn't even realized the player would go up there. 

The other absolute miss with this game is the new building system, which is truly awful. Instead of the sleek Rust style construction, they have chosen to go with a realistic and highly complex custom system which is utterly tedious and difficult to use. I find myself dreading building anything because you can't even just lay out a custom blueprint and add to it like before. Even simple objects need to be crafted via a needlessly obtuse and intricate new method that is just time consuming and not fun. I wish they had just improved on the system they already had. 

There are a lot of positive things to say about the game: it looks absolutely incredible, the weather effects are great, the combat is satisfying, and the new enemy and ally AI is vastly improved. However, these visuals and mechanics are all wasted if the most important central aspect of the game - the forest island itself - feels like a generic featureless unity asset. 

I wish the devs the best of luck, I really hope they can turn this around and make something great, but it seems they have focused their attention on all the wrong things. They had a perfect formula, all they need to do was update the graphics and enemy AI, create a more dense and detailed island, and add fun new stuff to build and do. Instead, they decided to reinvent the wheel, and the most important and fun elements of the game have suffered as a result.

The game is beautiful, regardless of the crazies on the island; I like how the developers are continuing updating and keeping to their word and even listening to us for things we'd like to see in the game (such as drive-able golf carts). Even though there are a few bugs in the game, it does not stop the fun and some of them actually make for a pretty funny and enjoyable experience. 

My only gripe about the game is that I wish there was more wildlife in the game, specifically more predators like wolves or bears. I know it is an island but it feels sort of empty without other wildlife and it would add an extra challenge to the game trying to avoid this. I also wish there was more environmental factors like the ability for your character to develop frostbite if you are wearing something ridiculous like summer clothes on your character during the winter season.

If you are thinking about getting this game, I encourage you to do so; however, I would strongly recommend you not complete or start the actual story mode yet as more things are being added to the game and the actual story; more caves, more mutants; more boss battles, etc. With that being said, the story is kind of short and is pretty broad at the moment and does not feel well thought out yet. I would definitely encourage the developers to think about adding more details into their story to make it more immersive story-wise.",1708041882,1708041882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In SOTF, I felt that the food/resources are a bit too readily available (eg: MRE packs, energy drink,) that hunger/thirst did not really become an issue (which somewhat removes the challenge of trying to survive). And we see mutants/cannibals rather frequently and regularly, so much so that it lost its 'horror' when we see one. Also, it feels like there are lesser variety in terms of enemy type compared to TF. 

Overall, there are room for improvements, but still a good game to play together with your friends to build a nice base, and explore caves together. Hope the 1.0 version will be better!",1707999875,1707999875,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

And was treated to a scripted, one-shot player autodeath/capture.

Happened a few more times whenever most enemies get within reach of you.

It includes more content, more enemies (both cannibals and mutants, with the addition of demons), bigger map with more things to do, more items, better graphics, improved interface, completely overhauled building menu, better animations, companion system (2 companions in which 1. Kelvin, works as a dog who follows you everywhere and obeys orders and 2, Virginia acts like a cat and helps you but has her own routine and behavior)., and a lot of other great improvements
Considering at the time of this review the game is still on Early Access and hasn't been 100% finished, it is amazing the amount of content this game has. The premise of this game is the same as its predecessor, only that this time you are looking for a special operations team and uncovering the mystery of the Puffton family instead of looking for Timmy, although [spoiler] you will see plenty of Timmy in this game as well [/spoiler]
On the negative side, there a a few things that do require fixing. The game crashes every once in a while which can be frustrating, the AI somehow feels worse than in the previous game, cannibals are more abundant but all they do is raid the base every 15 minutes, and random encounters become more of an annoyance than a scary or special experience due to their frequency, the slug ammo for the shotgun is completely worthless, the attachments fit in the dumbest ways possible (take the flashlight for the shotgun as a clear example of this), corpses despawn as soon as they are out of your FOV if you kill more than 2 enemies, effigies have no use whatsoever, getting stuck in terrain can happen randomly, and finally Kelvin can get stuck too (had to play the entire game with Kelvin stuck on a lake, unable to move even when given specific commands). Overall Sons of The Forest improves in every way over its predecessor, and it is an amazing experience if you haven't played the first one, it is easier than the fist one in every single way (combat, vitals, construction, item availability and resource management) but it makes up for it with better atmosphere and more content. Bunkers are AMAZING to explore and markers make cave exploration more intuitive. Completely worth it. Considering the way this devs work on their games, I am 100% sure the final product will be even better with tons of fixes and new content to be added soon.

Enjoying the new updates they are adding and loving watching the new stuff be added.
Achievements have now been fixed so you can 100%.


OLD REVIEW:
Pros:
- Game is fun with Friends 
- Exploring the world feels fresh and the graphics are beautiful
- Enemies are actually tough, which is very refreshing and always keeps you peeled
- The Weather Dynamics and seasons look like they are very good

Cons:
- This game feels very stripped back from ""The Forest"". What I mean by this : 
- Lack of building options, even when you have to switch mode to the old style.. There is a lack of things in the game.. Whether this is intentional or not I am not sure.. but it is not a good move
- Combat feels a bit Static here and there
- AI doesn't really feel like it has that ""behaviour"" system they were talking about.. Every person I have met has wanted to eat my face
- The New building mode is good, however it lacks so much functionality that you end up having to switch to the other mode to get few bits done
- Inventory size and system is nice, however the panning from left to right is way too slow, especially when you are in combat!

I do feel like there is a lot of improvements to be made and I think over time these issues should be fixed. However 100% having a lot of fun playing with people!",1677200176,1707933119,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I've played both solo as well as with friends and I enjoyed it either way. I do recommend though if you prefer building most of the time to recruit a friend or two to help with resource gathering and keeping enemies at bay while you work. Otherwise, unless you have the difficulty setting set to peaceful you'll be taking frequent breaks to chop up some enemies.

 Started playing this game around two weeks ago. Finished the story section pretty fast, with guides. The game and the dynamics are great, the graphics are beautiful to spend time in the island. The combat dynamics are fun and enjoyable enough to keep you entertained, but killing enemies still lacks some incentive beyond some ok loot you can get from them. I kept in mind this is early access but still, it comes to a point after a certain time that enemies are no longer as challenging to kill and after a while, I mean a while 80+ hours the game is repetitive. I would love to see new challenges and a sense for survival a bit more interesting, spending hours on a base and have a raid that lasts three minutes makes building the base kind of anticlimactic. As of today, the game has little incentive to explore the island beyond the loot you already now is close to your base and the main objects (which are really fun to get). That being said, the building dynamics are extremely fun, you can spend hours just building and rebuilding a base. I would like to have the cold address by being able to craft your own clothing from hides, feathers, etc. 
All this being said, this is amazing, cant wait for the full release. Congratulations to end night on making an amazing game. 
Cheers.

--{Conclusion}--
The gameplay is great and the graphics look awesome, the devs at Endnight are adding new things monthly as of now. The only thing that takes away for me is that sometimes I just run out of things to do (aside from chopping trees and building houses) when I'm not working on the main story. They are continuously adding new things for me to do so i still hop on for a few hours after each update. Starting from the beginning i would say it takes roughly 15 hours to complete the story without stopping for things like building, exploring the map, etc. In total id say you have at least 40-100 hours of gameplay before you run out of things to do. I would highly recommend you pick up a copy and play it for yourself. Im really exited to see what they do for the full release of this game.",1707713454,1707713454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, the story feels like a dumbed-down, diluted retelling of the first game but now with some tactical guys with guns. Some story beats fly by so fast even if you played the first game I feel the game doesn't do a good job elaborating on any of it. Environmental storytelling is good but yet again... Endnight somehow manages to trip and fall over itself having such a neat concept and rushing over all of it for a boring, lackluster resolution (wtf even was that ending??). The difficulty isn't really much of an issue either as even on the hardest difficulty it still feels like a breeze, making the enemies become just a minor annoyance. While I loved the variety of enemies in this game all that fear disappears when you have a gun, I feel this game did itself a disservice by including them and that's really disappointing.

*Potential Spoilers*
While the exploration is fun, and some areas of interest are actually really neat none of that intrigue pays off in the end. I felt the scale of the island also could be reduced and nothing would have changed overall. However, I understand this game is 50% story/exploring/combat and the other 50% is base building, but those soil and water physics, tree destruction, and snow deformation, etc. is all cool.... but why? why not add that later on in polish phase and make a better connected story that makes sense. Impressive display of tech in this game but if the story sucks, who cares? Especially if you have this type of story with a time paradox, why establish this story and not play by its rules? it makes no sense. Beating the game within the time trial established (29.5 days) the reward should be the artifact is destroyed and THEN given free reign to explore if the player chooses to. Why make it a choice if there was no consequence anyways (my character was on the island for 60+ days)?.... again, creative ideas but poor execution.

Building is still about the same but with the new lumber system Endnight has somehow managed to make that more annoying. Mix that in with the friendly Ai that loves to casually stroll in front of you while building can cause the game to crash due to the buggy conflicting collision boxes. Some of the buildings and schematics are really neat though and are fun additions to the game (some I admit are even more inventive than the first game, and I love that.)

You get killed in three hits, but they take like ten hits to kill with the starting ax. The companions are really fun and honestly at times are better than my friends lol. The biggest problem I have with the game is mostly just the cannibals from the start because they are overpowered and are hard to kill while dealing boat loads of damage. And when you die, sometimes it spawns you in the water right next to the shark, and I've died to that twice now.

game is creepy and fun to explore the cannibals have a lot more in life to them.
 the caves are really freaking scary even with the flashlight. I got a jump-scare at least 1 billion times. I got jump scared by a deer I thought it was a buff cannibal lol.
 I have lots of more to say but this is just a great game 10/10

One of the most fucking annoying things in this game is hard mode. There's no change in enemy placement, no change in their armor, no change in the weapons they use, the only things that change are the INSANE buffs to their health and damage. A single cannibal can kill you in 4-5 hits if you have no armor, and they only use their fists. What makes this EXTREMELY frustrating is that I have played this with my sister and we shot a single cannibal with slightly over 20 arrows and once we ran out, we speared him to death. It was no brute, it wasn't the blue skin guys in the caves, just a regular non-mutated cannibal. They're such fucking sponges in hard mode and every single encounter has impossible odds stacked against you. They can kill you in 4-5 hits with their nails if you don't wear armor, and it takes 20+ arrows to kill them! Holy SHIT.",1677376877,1707615490,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Although it's very buggy in its current state, It has improved a lot since release and is still in early access. (at time of this review). Its multiplayer mode is well implemented, though rather exploitable. The graphics are amazing, but they require a powerful computer. The AI interacts with the environment rather well.

I just finished the game today with a friend of mine, and we absolutely loved every tiny bit of it. There are a couple bugs and flaws, but they are easy fixes along the way. It took us 30 hours to finish the game, we took it with ease to enjoy the beauty of it.

This game was my #1 wish listed game a year ago. I think this has proven both very positive and very negative for myself as well as many others. 

The game is beautiful. Fantastic visuals, weather, scenery, etc.. Once again Endnight has redesigned the building system just like the original game. possibly a slight tedious, but customization is through the roof. 

I want a game that i get engrossed with, that i can loose hours and possible days with. The original Forest gave me that. There was something about that game that grabbed my attention. I remember when I downloaded the final release and was finally able to use the key card at the underground bunker. Seeing that red hallway was such a complete 180 from being in the woods for days that it was amazing to experience. The story was something I could relate to. You felt connected to LeBlanc and to experience the moment he found Timmy and tried desperately to revive him was definitely a heartfelt moment. 

I font feel anything like that in this game. Its more cold in a sense. Like so many people have said, theirs something missing in SotF. Sure it has great visuals, its a decent survival game, the building mechanics are great, but something inst there. Sure, many people don't care about story elements, they just want survival or combat and this game has that. But for me, theirs just something off. Maybe my anticipation about the game being something amazing ruined it when I played the game. 

It was actually hard when it was first released. People complained the enemies, especially the muddies, were too difficult. This has since been nerfed. Enemies are easier and that cautious,calculated play style I loved so much is gone now. 

This game can be so much more. I want this game to be its absolute best. The devs can do a ton to make it interesting. They have before. Its a small team, but they can be creative. They've already proved that. I really hope the full release is worth it. I want a jaw dropping experience just like the first game.

Gameplay wise it has some things I do not find a joy to play through. A lot of the locations and items you are required to find and collect are hard to locate without searching it up beforehand. Travelling to each location can take up a fair amount of your time as well. Despite these issues, I have found that the frequent updates to Performance and Gameplay keep me coming back every now and then. The building mechanics are satisfying to toy around with.

Even though it can take a long time and be hard to build stuff (especially tall structures), it's definetly worth the cool and creative way you build. 

I love the AI behavior and intelligence. The tribal cannibals seem like they have feelings and desires and they'll sometimes cry when you kill their friends. Some enemies will also dodge and block your attacks. Also I love how you can blast and cut off tribal cannibals' limbs while their still alive and they'll sometimes survive for a little while before they bleed out.

- Not much survival mechanics is used through the game, either used once or never.
- Story is less interesting and more confusing, no clues what is going on and who is who. Only having to find out through online wiki....
- Game is shorter than the first.
- Only a few enemies variety and not as creepy as the first game enemies.
- Gunplay is meh (Can be a pass since it's a unity survival game)
- No auto-save at all so your progress will be lost if you disconnect. Host and all players must save by themselves. This is so annoying especially in this age of gaming.

Overall, this game is not worth it unless it's on sale and if you're looking for something to play more of the first game but be warned, it's short and shallow.

Gather 'round the campfire, because I’ve got a tale to spin about a game that’s more thrilling than a monkey juggling bananas on a tightrope. Enter Sons of the Forest, where survival meets mystery, and the line between sanity and slipping on banana peels blurs. Picture this: You wake up on a lush, temperate island, surrounded by towering trees and the occasional coconut. Your mission? Survive, explore, and uncover secrets. But beware, my friends, for this island isn’t just any island—it’s like the love child of a rainforest and a banana plantation. The story? Well, it’s as elusive as a chameleon in a banana grove. But who needs plot when you’ve got bananas, am I right? Grab your banana-shaped pickaxe and start building! The crafting system is clunkier than a gorilla trying to peel a banana with mittens. But fear not, because nothing says “survival” like constructing a banana-themed fortress. Walls made of banana leaves? Check. Banana-powered generators? Double-check. And when the cannibals attack, just throw banana peels at them. Works every time. The environment in Sons of the Forest is downright a-peel-ing. The lush vegetation—more diverse than a fruit salad—makes you feel like Tarzan on a banana diet. The changing seasons? Imagine autumn leaves falling, revealing hidden banana caches. And the lighting? It’s like the sun peeking through banana leaves, casting golden rays on your banana-hunting escapades. Now, let’s address the elephant in the banana grove: performance. My trusty RTX 3080 chugged along like a banana boat in a storm, occasionally dipping into frame rates lower than a limbo dancer. Pop-in? Yep, leaves and rocks appeared closer than a bunch of ripe bananas. And the glitchy sound during rainstorms? It was like bananas arguing over who’s the top banana. But hey, it’s Early Access—like finding a half-peeled banana in your lunchbox. Sons of the Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better. Exploring this huge, beautiful, deadly island through the changing seasons is a treat. So, my fellow banana enthusiasts, grab your vine-swinging gear, ignore the lack of plot, and dive into this banana-tastic adventure. Just remember: when life gives you bananas, make a survival game out of them! 🍌🌴",1707102779,1707102779,True,0,1,0.471204221248626709,0,True,False,True

The natives on this island actually seem to learn from your actions and use them against you later. If you go into this game guns blazing they will become more aggressive faster as a result and if you're like me and largely remain peaceful they will attack less. The building mechanics are all satisfying (if a little wonky at times) and it's very satisfying to watch seasons change the forest around you. Everything is visually stunning even as I turned down the graphics settings a couple notches.

Now with those good notes I need to add, If you are looking at this game for constant action, shooting and slicing, this is not the game for you. This game wins in its slow burn effect. Surviving on an island, building up a base and protecting said base with various traps home alone style are the main appeals I've seen. You can just rampage though but you'll find not much gameplay that way. The main storyline can be completed in just a few real life days.

Survival is a lot easier in this one and a can be customized to cater to how you want to play which is a huge plus. Cave systems are a lot larger in this game compared to the first and they have a lot of unique things about them compared to the first game (which just contained items to progress to other caves, same thing in this game too but there's also pretty cool extras in the caves now). Companions are now here to help build bases, collect resources, and defend your bases. Lot's of new weapons and items that shake up the gameplay from the first game. Lots of returning features from the first game that get expanded on which is always nice to see.

What I REALLY enjoy is the free building you can do! No more building with blueprints to make a house. If you think of something, 99% of the time you can build it!

Early access was a bit of a rough start in terms of content, over the course of a year of this game being out the devs have added a lot of things to make this game really enjoyable to replay. The have added new structures, new caves, new outfits, new building plans, new ways to get around the map without having to craft (like the hanglider from the first game), new items, new traps, and improved the mechanics of the game since the first game.

When the full version comes out later this month (Feb 2024) I will be definitely giving it another go, making it my third time beating the game after the full release. Pick this one up, excellent game to play with minimal bugs that do not even effect the game since you hardly even see them happen.",1677886383,1706947930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Would recommend, there's  lots that's new. The AI on these new enemies is kinda wild at times. Creepy factor is definitely higher in this game imo. I will say though, the new building system is kinda suck. Just makes it harder to build things. I appreciate the ability to customize buildings/structures but they should have left the basic structures on the old build side. That's really my only complaint. Expect there will be a lot more new stuff/story once the complete release comes out.

Multiplayer: I think the dedicated server side needs a lot of work yet to be considered completely playable. Notice a lot of glitching/lagging/disconnecting for no reason. Hosting a game for you and another person locally seems...ok, but notice similar issues. Not sure if I would recommend it for this just yet.",1706321681,1706929138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I waited so antsy and gitty for this games release, when the first trailer dropped. I ended up caught in a predicament of not having a way to play the game as I was on console. I had been wanting a costly personal item for years and had the money to finally purchase said item however I ended up buying a pc instead solely so I could play this game. I do not regret it at all! Endnight is one of the best companies in the gaming industry. Listening to their player base, and always knocking out the bugs and glitches. Sons Of The Forest is an absolutely astounding game! By far the most beautiful game I have ever played. The map is absolutely amazing and huge. Almost every part of it feels hand crafted and polished. I can tell so much hard work went into the world space. The animations for use of items and even weapons is very well done. The gunplay is better than most shooter focused games, and melee combat being very difficult yet rewarding. The enemy types are very unique, and perfectly designed. But where this game shines is the story. Creating a very overwhelming start. You are thrown into the dangerous horror filled world with nothing. No info, no weapons, food, water, etc. All you know is you have to survive. Personally I am a huge 80s slut and having a game that is modern set, with an 80s theme really makes it bad ass. They've done an absolute amazing job of making this game feel immersive. I felt so uneasy and uncomfortable going into bunkers and caves. You could almost feel the horrible things that had happened on this island. Being a Christian I love being able to build a giant illuminated cross at my base to represent my faith, and using a cross to burn demons. Protected by my creator I am in life as I am in this video game. Where most games being blasphemous against Christianity, and mocking it, this game makes me feel like it is supported in at least some way. (A demon from hell being set afire by just pointing a cross at it proves the existence and holiness of the Lord, and the promise from God that I will always be protected.) I love how the story is tying in Christianity and other fictional scifi aspects!

Finished the game in single player. (Within the first week)

Restarted, and started playing with friends (Around mid January 2024)
With the amount of updated stuff, and friends to play with. This game is a whole different ball game.

I can see how this game might feel like a chore, or tedious when played alone.
But with a group of friends, it's more like an outing / hang out / fuck around in nature where murder isn't punishable by law.

Sons of the Forest isn't without its flaw, but honestly I'm fine to overlook it with a sale tag.

So first of all, the most apparent improvement that they've made in this game is of course, the building. It feels a lot more immersive and hands-on compared to the previous game. And that includes the crafting in the inventory too. However, there's still the old ghost-outline builds that you can do for things like storage and decorations, but I wouldn't say it's too much of an issue.

Another thing I feel like has been improved a bit is the combat. Sure, now there's guns that make it a lot easier, but that's besides the point. The melee still feels almost as fun as the first game and there's even the return of stuff like the machete and katana (and also some new weapons like a literal guitar and golf club.) Although, I feel like there's a couple times when the enemies will kinda f*ck you over with their attacks at times.

The animations also feel a bit more fluid than some of the ones in the first game. More notably, the swinging and tree-chopping animations look noticeably better. However, at times it does feel a bit stiff. Mostly in a couple of the cutscenes, to be more specific. Sometimes it looks pretty solid, while other times it's kind of... strange looking.

An unfortunate downside to all this stuff is that there were a couple things that aren't really present in this game that were in the first. Most notably, a couple of the builds. This mostly includes stuff like boats, ziplines, and a couple more. But, the zipline builds are pretty much redundant now with the inclusion of the Rope Gun.

As of Jan 31, 2024, the full game is still about a month away from release, so some of my opinions are subject to change, but overall I think this game is pretty solid. I'd give Sons of the Forest an 8/10.",1678512118,1706738958,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

If you're looking for a good survival horror game, play this one.

The story for Sons of the Forest isn't ""bad"", I just had very high expectations coming from the first game. 
However, I do enjoy SOTF more than The Forest. The building can be annoying sometimes and it does take a while to build a base, but I personally enjoy it. You can be really creative and make your own cabin from scratch or you can use blueprints. I do wish there were a few more cabin blueprints to choose from because the ones we have are quite small. 
Sons of the Forest REALLY brings out the horror aspect, especially if you're playing alone. It's terrifying. The cannibals are a huge upgrade from the first game. They're so much smarter and stronger and will ambush you. The caves are horrifying. The mutants are horrifying. Everything is horrifying.
My main gripe about the game is that the map is huge and it's hard to get around though you do have golf carts and the Knight V. I just wish there was a better way to get around the map because it can take forever and the vehicles can be annoying to find and annoying to drive.

Building is just as fun if not more than in the first part and the overall atmosphere doesn't get enough recognition, especially at night. Your companions can come in handy. It does feel strange to constantly tell Kelvin what to do and takes some time getting used to. Frankly speaking, in the beginning and looking at this guy's face, I wasn't too sure whether his ineptness was caused by a head trauma or general stupidity but you do grow fond of the boy (even though he just won't fight). My recommendation: Take a friend or two, play this in co-op and enjoy the experience...",1706552639,1706552639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[h3]Repetitive[/h3]
For example, I really like using my shotgun to kill enemies, but I also dread it because I spend ammo. Then after I am out of ammo, I have to go back to a cave I already explored just to restock. But then at that point, what is the point of being resourceful? Just go to a cave, loot everything, save and quit, and effectively duplicate everything until you are fully stocked up.

[h3]Unrewarding[/h3]
Same problem as the first game: Building a base is pointless. Don't get me wrong, it's fun! And you can decorate it a lot more in this game. But what is actually the point of it? It definitely isn't storage because every item you ever need will be in your inventory at all times. It also isn't for shelter because you are safer on the move, placing tarps or hunting shelters whenever you need to. In fact, it's worse to build a base because it attracts enemies to you. Though in my playthrough, enemies disregarded my base. So much so, I never utilized a single trap. Apart from building, every new thing I found wasn't dramatically useful (with the exception of the shotgun). For example, there are 3 different axes in the game that each offer equal utility. I think one is better at chopping trees, another is slightly better at attacking but is super slow, and another has a higher block stat. This theme is found throughout most of the items in the game. Why can't there just be an item that is directly better in every way? That would make finding it very rewarding. But instead, it's just another item to collect.

[h3]Boring[/h3]
My biggest complaint is that this game puts me to sleep if I play it for more than two hours. Everything is just so, [i]painstakingly[/i], SLOW. Opening the inventory lags the game for a few seconds, then finding an item in the inventory takes forever! Panning around in the inventory is super slow. Equipping clothing is omega slow! Those last three points I made combined actually makes it slower to equip the wetsuit before diving underwater than just jumping in, even though swimming isn't as swift without it. Next, I hate when I pick up a book because then my character takes a stupidly ridiculous amount of time to inspect it and I cannot do anything within that time. And then walking and running is very slow! Even when I have the best mode of transport in the entire game (hang glider), the map is so huge that it takes such a long time to get anywhere!

I was honestly about to give the game a good review until I played it today. What happened? I beat the game. The story is the most convoluted piece of narrative I have ever witnessed in any media in HISTORY. I swear there were more coherent plots to Resident Evil 6, Polyball, f*cking idk, RAFT (2018) than this sh*t. It was actually atrocious beyond a reasonable doubt. At the very least, I think the game was more fun than its predecessor and I was going to give Endnight Games that. But I don't know anymore. Maybe it will be better when the game finally releases out of early access, but I doubt it.

I have a ton of suggestions for this game to improve, but I'll list a few of them. First of all, why do they not implement useful and fun features from the first game such as the cave map so you can actually see where you need to explore or the climbing axe so that all the verticality in the map can actually be utilized instead of acting as some annoying obstacle? Secondly, if they are going to make a survival game then please add resources! I'm not talking about logs, sticks, rocks, and leaves with their primitive building mechanics. Instead, it would be cool if there were sites throughout the map with limited (or replenishing) resources that you could use to restock your ammo or generate electricity. Something like oil that you can suck up or unrefined ore that you can mine. Because right now, it feels like a half-baked survival game with DayZ mechanics, where there are structures around the map that you loot and that's all you get in terms of resources. I want to make my own equipment and items so that my base can actually be useful.

I don't know man, play it if you want. I guess I just expect too much out of games.",1706515189,1706515189,False,33,1,0.596341490745544434,3,True,False,True

I played for a month before having my lobby ruined by a cheater and saving before noticing what had happened. When you leave a cave and want to save, you're base may have been absolutely wrecked by other players. I stopped playing after this out of frustration. Tried the game again recently due to all the updates, and it is amazing. Feels like a new game again! Imagine my surprise when my day 48 Lobby is ruined by someone joining the game and just killing Virginia and Kelvin. Full dead, no revive. Then bragging about how this is good content for their YT channel. So we are a year into early access with the same major problem as 8+ months ago. Very frustrating, yet again, to see there is no way to combat this kind of toxic player behavior. An auto save feature that could be used to revert back to would be easy enough. Suppose I am done with this game until release with fingers crossed that there is some remedy to the current issue. If it was a rare occurrence, it would be tolerable. However, it is a daily encounter.

Farket a creator over on you tube recently recorded the length of time it takes to travel from the lowest spawn location on the map to the south end along the sides of the map and it can take upwards to 40min the player is once again punished for just wanting to finish the game by taking away everyone's time to just walk to another side of the map. vehicles don't help much either with the knightv being far to unreliable crashing after going over a tiny stone in the road. the golf cart you are currently unable to look at your gps so you can end up wasting more of your time for going a route that may be the slowest way possible and its not nimble enough to go through trees so the reliable way of traversing with the cart is the roads which will take forever. this game needs more work than the 1.0 update will be able to achieve and not only that but i doubt the devs will be willing to delete a third of the map to make traversal more plausible. this game had everything going for it day one crashing steam the day it went on sale for early access but over time its most loyal fans have all taken a step back including creators and the modding base. these are symptoms of a game that just isnt captivating. The Forest did all of these so much better and with the devs unwillingness to copy the forest i dont thing this game has a chance of bringing back its core fanbase. i hope im wrong",1677206777,1706404334,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Instead of being a walking storage unit make it so you have a normal backpack that can only fit 1 to 3 weapons/tools of your choice while also limiting resources unless crafted a stick/rock bag. making it so that you would have to stash the important weapons/tools you find around the map in your base, this would make base building a lot more worth while defending and building.

2. Making The Map Smaller - Like number 1 people are not gonna build bases for the reason of the map being the size it is leading to people being just nomads but this is where the bag size comes into play limiting the amount of weapons/tools you are carrying but who is gonna do that when the map is so huge!? Well make it the forest map size but 2 and a half of that size. depends on amount of caves, bunkers, etc.

3. Add Ocean Caves - The forest had them why doesn't Sons of the forest And yes there is exit ocean caves but why not ones like the forest for example in order to obtain a crossbow you have to go out in the ocean and find floating marks of wood it would make more use of the shark and add more scary moments.

4. Combat With Some Cannibals - Although the combat is good, fighting some cannibals isn't for one ""muddy"" cannibals. trying to fight these guys are fine nothing hard about them except the fact you have to be looking down and swing at them, I wish these guys were more like the ""skinny's"" from the forest as they crawled, stood up, and twitched while walking around this gives them more character and gives the player more of a creepy feeling. it would also be more enjoyable slashing them while they are standing up.

another would be the ""Heavy"" I would gotta say the only change would be how much he should be able to knock you down. that's it.

5. Mutilated Cannibal Types - How cool or terrifyingly interesting would it be to see a cannibal with battle scars, burns, or missing body parts. I think it would.

6. Lizard Armor - When starting out this game I think and others probably think that Lizard Armor would be your first obtainable armor since Creepy armor was only obtainable through Mutant types in The Forest comes to find out the roles have been switched except the fact they scraped lizard armor completely and made it where creepy armor is the new Lizard armor and made it super extremely easy to obtain(I'm saying its like Lizard armor for the fact it breaks like it and is easily obtainable like it) They should of had the Armor like the first game. and yeah I know about the hide armor but dears are more scarce unlike Lizards were.

7. Remove Electric Lighter And The Map Phone While Also Changing up the HUD - replace it with The Forest Lighter and homemade map with the addition of the compass I would also like to think of having The Forest HUD instead of Sons Of The Forest's HUD. This would make you feel more primitive and like your in a survival situation.

8. Spread Out Gun Parts - Doing this would make you have more of a incentive of having to go and dig/blow up spots to find gun parts. again just like The forest where the musket gun parts were spread out. this will also make players use more of traps in addition of making/using Molotov's, and bombs a lot more often.

as I'm a player who loves The Forests as well as Sons Of The Forest as I have gained all achievements for both games I do think both games are worth getting Since Its very atmospheric and the graphics are beautifully stunning With game-play being fun on top of that.

The end of the game is so bland and boring, after we get a pistol/revolver and a shotgun i feel there should be some kind of boss that is a pain in the ass to defeat... right? Id like something interesting to fight like the boss at the end of ""The forest"" oh and lets not mention the fact you can be a damn Mountain Goat and climb up almost vertical walls lmao

Good work Dev team but id like to see some more content to the story and an ""Endgame boss"". Overall Nice launch for the game atleast is better than cyberpunk lmaooo

AFTER UPDATE 15:
the game is still amazing, details are even more crisp, and the building system is still insane. the introduction of more story has led me to come back many times to play the game and acquire the new items, as well as the addition of extra locations to the island with huts hidden in the forest or even little details of tarps over cut trees it feel refreshing to play this game and find new locations. the fact that they added a boss to the end of the game made my gameplay feel more exiting, And yes you can still mountain goat your ass up the huge mountain in the middle of the map. Now what i would like to be added is some kind of helicopter, i mean there are abandoned helicopters over the map so why not be able to repair them and fly it? the map is still huge even with the addition of the golfcart and knightv the map is still huge and a pain in the ass to traverse.

Set in a mysterious forest teeming with hostile creatures and enigmatic threats, the game challenges players to navigate its treacherous terrain, scavenge for resources, and fend off relentless adversaries in a desperate bid for survival. The tension and atmosphere are palpable, with each encounter ratcheting up the stakes and pushing players to their limits.

[*]Central to the Sons of the Forest experience is its emphasis on exploration and discovery.

The reliance on trial and error can lead to moments of frustration and repetition, as players struggle to adapt to the unforgiving nature of its gameplay.

[*]Furthermore, Sons of the Forest's narrative and pacing may leave some players wanting more, as the story unfolds in a fragmented and cryptic manner that may leave them craving a more cohesive and satisfying conclusion.

[*]In conclusion, Sons of the Forest stands as a testament to the power of survival horror gaming, offering players a heart-pounding and immersive experience that pushes the boundaries of the genre. With its visceral gameplay, atmospheric world-building, and haunting narrative, Sons of the Forest invites players to confront their deepest fears and embrace the unknown.

Decided to play the game in ""realistic"" mode and find the golf carts to be pretty useless.  They run out of power during mid-day driving and take real life hours to recharge.

Introduction:

Sons of the Forest, the highly anticipated sequel to The Forest, brings players back into the unsettling world of survival horror, blending elements of suspense, exploration, and terrifying encounters. As a long-time fan of the horror genre, I eagerly plunged into this eerie wilderness to experience the next chapter in the unsettling narrative crafted by Endnight Games. Here's my detailed review of Sons of the Forest, a game that goes beyond jump scares to deliver an atmospheric and chilling adventure.

Graphics and Atmosphere:

From the very beginning, Sons of the Forest captivates with its hauntingly beautiful visuals. The forest is rendered with a level of detail that immerses players in its unsettling ambiance. The play of light and shadow, coupled with the dense foliage and eerie weather effects, contributes to an atmosphere that is as atmospheric as it is terrifying.

Character models, animations, and environmental details are all meticulously crafted, enhancing the overall sense of realism. The game's lighting design plays a crucial role in creating tension, casting long shadows and illuminating the mysterious creatures that lurk in the darkness. The overall result is an environment that feels genuinely alive, in the most unsettling way possible.

Gameplay Mechanics:

Sons of the Forest retains the survival mechanics that made The Forest a standout title while introducing new elements that elevate the gameplay experience. The crafting system is robust, allowing players to build elaborate structures for defense or exploration. The sense of vulnerability is palpable as you scavenge for resources, knowing that danger could be lurking around every corner.

The introduction of new tools and weapons adds depth to the gameplay. The bow, in particular, becomes a crucial tool for stealth and survival, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic use of resources. The dynamic day-night cycle and weather conditions further add to the unpredictability of the environment, creating a sense of constant tension.

Story and Exploration:

Sons of the Forest weaves a mysterious and unsettling narrative that unfolds gradually as players explore the island. The game introduces a compelling mix of environmental storytelling, audio logs, and visual cues to piece together the events that led to the current state of the forest. The sense of isolation is heightened by the enigmatic nature of the story, leaving players with a constant desire to uncover the truth behind the horrors they encounter.

Exploration is a key component of the experience, with the island offering a variety of environments to discover. From dark caves filled with ominous echoes to abandoned structures that hint at the island's troubled past, each location tells a part of the story while offering new challenges and horrors to face.

Horror Elements:

Sons of the Forest excels in delivering horror that goes beyond mere jump scares. The game relies on a combination of atmospheric tension, unsettling visuals, and a haunting audio design to create an experience that will leave players on the edge of their seats. The creatures that inhabit the island are both grotesque and terrifying, and encounters with them are pulse-pounding experiences that test your nerves and strategic thinking.

The horror elements are not limited to the creatures alone; the game introduces psychological horror elements that play with the player's perception and sanity. The result is an immersive and psychologically intense experience that stays with you long after you've put down the controller.

Multiplayer and Cooperative Play:

Sons of the Forest introduces a cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing players to team up with friends to face the horrors of the island together. The cooperative experience retains the tension and atmosphere of single-player, while also introducing strategic elements as players work together to survive.

The seamless integration of multiplayer into the core experience is a welcome addition, enhancing the replayability and offering a different dynamic to the horror. The shared experience of facing the unknown with friends elevates the emotional impact of the game, creating memorable moments of both terror and triumph.

Technical Performance:

In terms of technical performance, Sons of the Forest impresses with its polished visuals and smooth gameplay. The game runs smoothly on various hardware configurations, and I encountered minimal bugs or performance issues during my playthrough. The attention to detail in both the visual and audio aspects contributes to a polished and immersive horror experience.

Conclusion:

Sons of the Forest is a triumph in the survival horror genre, delivering an atmospheric and chilling experience that goes beyond the conventional jump scares. With its hauntingly beautiful visuals, intricate gameplay mechanics, compelling story, and relentless horror elements, Endnight Games has created a title that will linger in the minds of players long after they've left the forest. Whether you're a fan of horror games or simply looking for a truly immersive and unsettling experience, Sons of the Forest is a journey into the unknown that is well worth taking. Brace yourself for a thrilling and terrifying adventure that redefines the standards of survival horror gaming.",1706129209,1706129219,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

> Graphics are way more beautiful than The Forest, it's a decent upgrade.
> Gameplay itself is more diverse specially when it comes to using different weapons. You can now use more ranged weapons besides the bow.
> Building on this game is tedious but it does allow you to personalize to a nail everything in your house including using stone as a building material. I just wish you could also choose to build a full wall instead of doing it step by step by step... etc.
> The new followers! It's a great addition, Kelvin adds an interesting help for those who play solo without making it too OP and Virginia adds an interesting point of view to the history that wouldn't exist without her. She also fights and uses cute dresses! Who in the world did we find a three legged suit?!
> Ways of transport! Having one is good enough but it could be less buggy. You bump a tiny rock and are yeet all across river.
> The story is up to you to find and combine. As the old fashion Forest.
> Price is fair but if you never played The Forest or are unsure, wait for a better deal. I believe it's quite a niche to enjoy this game. 

Overall, I'd recommend and rate it a 7/10 for now. I'll update it after 22/02/2024 when the final version arrives.",1706121317,1706121317,True,1,0,0.501850724220275879,0,True,False,True

Almost a full year at this point.  I still only have 14 or so hours because of the issues the game has. It is completely broken, and I've found no way to work around it.

The audio glitch from release is still there. Nasty, overloud, corrupted static blasting from my speakers and headphones anytime wind goes through the trees or I am near water sources.

Janky, stuttery frames regardless of settings. I've even tried mods, INI edits, undervolting...you name it.

And all topped off by every single machine I try to run the game on tries to cook it's graphics card *AND* its CPU. I predictably get temps in the range of 96 to 104 C. Unacceptable, especially since other newer and graphics intensive games run in perfectly stable temp ranges of 68 to 75.

I suppose that if you have some kind of NASA supercomputer you might have an easier time. Maybe I just somehow have 3 lemon machines that will run any other game in my library but this one.

But I doubt it. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck...it's probably a bad and broken game.",1706111135,1706111135,False,1,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,True

EA Feedback:

Building animations can force you to place yourself in a compromised position, causing instant death by sharpened stick.

Unforeseen inconsistencies are frustratingly present within building mechanics, (ex. inability to connect two parallel walls that form a hallway). 
It is one thing to have to rebuild, it's another when you can't discern what the architectural error responsible is. Things should better ""snap"" into place to ultimately facilitate what would ideally be a grid under more consistant units. The ""laws"" are just not intuitive, and relatively uneven when practiced. This really needs to be fixed as a core-mechanic somehow, so new players can more easily build what they envision without any awkward hiccups in their creative expression.

The entire animation for writing down instructions should be sped up exponentially.

Player takes inexplicable damage after drinking from stream. If the water is unsanitary, maybe make damage over the long-term.

The scenic introduction is too uneventful prior to the action sequence.

A Doom-style ""kick"" stun ability would be a very, very cool addition.",1705882228,1705957146,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True

For this review I will split it into two bits
non-spoilers (gameplay)
Spoilers (story)


To start off with, the gameplay.
It is so fun, the way the building works is easily the best building mechanic in any game ive played.
The combat is alright, nothing special but I felt myself getting use to the fighting.
The enemies are really good, and very scary at times. However it can get tiring in the later game.



However

SPOILERS




The story feels very plot-holey (I understand its early access) but I found that the final boss, the science guy, just kinda felt unfinished. Weve seen him roughly twice before, and both times hes not really had any role. No real connection.
The ending itself feels rushed as during the last cutscene, when you enter the cube, suddenly Virginia and Kelvin show up, along with the scientist. But the final fight was fun, even though I felt that we needed more of a connection to the bad guy, and more love for the protagonists side guy who appears in the later game and becomes a mutant.
However, I felt that they need to focus more on the story personally.
Maybe I was not paying enough attention but I found that the bad guy was very lacking and sudden. Just kind of no real drive to kill him.
The side guy who helps you find the cube (NOT KELVIN) has no real connection to the player, as you only really meet him at the end.
As for Kelvin... I love him. I wish he had more of a role, maybe appearing to help during the final fight. Or maybe even replacing the side guy.





But all in all, a great game.
I hope they keep working on it.
I just hope that we get a more conclusive but understandable story with less plot holes.
But I still recommend it, its a fun game regardless.

 Besides from those and a bit more the good stuff overtakes the bad stuff, for example building in this game is hard but it feels quite realistic in a sense and the combat is fun it makes you want to fight most of the time.

The story really feels like your trying to discover a mystery and most of the story is shown through little items you can find around the map.

The games graphics are done really well for a survival game of this kind, and small details like the butterfly landing on your backpack or random gore props around the map, they really add to the immersion.

This game is a nice break from all the repetitive survival games that already exist like Minecraft or Subnautica. This game is great I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a new game to try out. 8/10",1705925633,1705925633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

they lack of programming skills, communication skills and even lying skills, because we customers already saw right through it. the excuse to go into early access was to finance the project itself (there was no ""near finished"" version, they started almost from scratch in 2021 ... you can check that easily by looking at their employees LinkedIn profiles which state that the majority did not work for endnight before 2021). 

they delete critical comments in the discussion board without any notice to the poster, got caught and still lie to their paying customers that this behaviour would be steam moderators, not endnight moderators. what a blatant lie, i've got affirmation directly from steam support that endnight turned off the automatic report function. to a certain point, they moderated the discussion board all by themselves but still refuse to admit it. 

but the biggest bummer is the paid fake positive bot reviews.
AND STEAM DOES NOT GIVE A FLYING SINGLE F ABOUT IT. shame on both of you.

It is in my opinion, WAY too EARLY to be releasing the game. The game needs more time in EARLY ACCESS to mature and develop before calling it a release candidate. There is much work to be done before calling this a real game.

BUILDING SYSTEM
A fairly robust, and yet often aggravating, building system allows you to build bases throughout the island world of the game. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no point to building a base at all in the scope of the game, other than simply for the ""joy"" of building something. There are no advantages to building one. There is really no challenge when it comes to inventory management, so the base doesn't provide REAL help with managing inventory.  Planting and growing stuff seems like more of an afterthought than a valid part of the game. Bases offer no real benefit when it comes to sleeping, saving or really surviving in the game. Prop up a little tarp with a stick, make a little fire - and you are able to sleep, save - and aparently none the worse for wear sleeping on the cold wet ground.

CRAFTING
Crafting is ""OK"", but with limited range and scope. Crafting animations are clumsy and clunky, and the game lacks any real crafting depth with progressive technoligies, unlocking new crafting stations, progressive materials, etc... basically, crafting isn't really developed - like many elements in this game.


THE WORLD
The world itself is pretty enough to look at, but largely devoid of substance. The island feels so very very empty, and almost devoid of life, despite some animals and the baddies you encounter. There just aren't enough of anything to make the island an immersive environment. There should be animals on the island that add another layer to survival; making encounters with dangerous predators a new challenge would be great. The cannibal camps are silly, and don't offer much for the story or the gameplay - neither do the ""hunting parties"" that come to visit your base. The NPCs feel clunky and buggy (Kelvin and Victoria), as do the cannibals and demons and whatnot. The caves add a level of creepy factor to the game, but even the caves feel devoid of real substance.

THE VEHICLES
These are the biggest joke of the game, with the Knight V, golf cart, hang glider, and the ridiculous sled. None of these ""vehicles"" really works well (in practice or in the scope of the environment). Golf carts would be more expected if there were paved areas and drives on the island (which is strangely devoid despite having things such as the golf course), the Knight V is totally out of place on an undeveloped island. Taking an electric monowheel through the woods and on the beaches isn't practical. The hang glider proves to be the most useless of all.

Basically, there is great potential in this game - but it has yet to be realized by the developers. I hope they will put in the work to finish this game and make it something great.",1705859731,1705859731,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Now that it has an ending and you can play the full game I would say it has a pretty good story line and a good ending but you need to be paying attention otherwise the big picture is a little vague,however there are still a few minor things to be done before it gets out of early acces.

The graphics are really good but nothing more special than other games released in this era of super realistic details,I would say it's well optimized for early acces,I never had any crashes or lag spikes (I also have a high end PC).

Overall I'd say it's worth to play and it would keep you hooked for a while but it would be more fun to play it with some friends than just with Virginia and Kelvin.

Building is relatively tame and simple to gauge however when building with both stone and wood, parts can intersect improperly and then look incorrect.
The storyline is at first glance quite simple however there are more details that are hard to miss and are ultimately irrelevant to the story but add a nice bit of backstory.
The game's physics are usually quite tame although when placing a large number of logs in one area, they can sometimes react unexpectedly.
Survival is quite balanced between health, hunger, water and sleep. Enemies scale quite well with progress.

Sons of the Forest, the highly anticipated sequel to The Forest, invites players to embark on an enigmatic journey into the heart of banality. From the creators of the original survival horror game, Endnight Games, comes an experience that will leave players questioning the very essence of their gaming choices.

Let's start with the groundbreaking graphics that defy the boundaries of pixel perfection. Sons of the Forest introduces a stunning array of colors, mostly shades of beige and taupe, that will leave you questioning the meaning of vibrant hues. The realism is so palpable that you may find yourself lost in a sea of neutral tones, wondering if you accidentally stumbled into a digital interior decorating simulation.

The game's soundtrack, composed entirely of ambient sounds reminiscent of elevator music, adds an unparalleled layer of ambivalence to the gaming experience. You'll find yourself yearning for the sweet embrace of silence as you navigate through the uninspiring landscape. The sound of footsteps on grass is so meticulously crafted that you might mistake it for a symphony of white noise. Who needs adrenaline-pumping beats when you can have the soothing melody of monotony?

Sons of the Forest introduces an innovative crafting system that will have you pondering the meaning of life as you collect an absurd variety of twigs, rocks, and leaves. Forget about the excitement of forging powerful weapons or building elaborate structures; instead, revel in the joy of crafting the world's most lackluster stick. It's survival of the blandest, and you're the unsung hero armed with a collection of underwhelming tools.

The game's AI, a groundbreaking showcase of mediocrity, features enemies that are eerily adept at mimicking the average person's daily routine. Watch in awe as cannibals casually stroll through the forest, occasionally stopping to pick virtual daisies or engage in uninspired small talk. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to realism, showcasing the uneventful existence of fictional cannibalistic creatures.

Sons of the Forest boasts an open-world environment that will leave you questioning the very concept of excitement. Explore vast landscapes filled with indistinguishable trees and marvel at the breathtaking sameness of it all. The game's dynamic weather system, featuring a perpetual state of overcast skies, adds an extra layer of monotony to your digital escapade. Prepare to be captivated by the sheer lack of visual diversity.

In the multiplayer mode, team up with friends for a social experiment in shared boredom. Engage in riveting conversations about the meaninglessness of your in-game existence as you collectively question why you chose this over more exhilarating alternatives. Sons of the Forest is not just a game; it's a communal exploration of the mundane.

In conclusion, Sons of the Forest takes the survival horror genre to new heights of tedium. From its uninspiring visuals to its lackluster gameplay mechanics, this game is a masterclass in the art of pointlessness. If you're seeking an adventure that will leave you questioning your life choices, look no further. Sons of the Forest is the epitome of gaming mediocrity.

2 cups all-purpose flour
▢2 cups sugar
▢3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
▢2 teaspoons baking powder
▢1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
▢1 teaspoon salt
▢1 teaspoon espresso powder homemade or store-bought
▢1 cup milk or buttermilk, almond, or coconut milk
▢1/2 cup vegetable oil or canola oil, or melted coconut oil
▢2 large eggs
▢2 teaspoons vanilla extract
▢1 cup boiling water
▢Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe
Instructions 
Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.
FOR THE CHOCOLATE CAKE:
Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.
Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.
Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely.
Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.
Notes
The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate cake I’ve ever tasted! xo
Freezer Friendly
Let the baked cake layers cool completely. Wrap them well with plastic wrap and then with foil. Put each layer into a freezer bag and freeze up to 2 months. To serve, thaw in the refrigerator overnight with wrapping intact. The next day, the layers are ready to fill and frost.

the down sides affecting the game are because its still early access and so duhh but i can say that its still fun and with a few more updates and some more time this game will be sick 10/10 worth the 24.99 whats not to love about wanting to build a tree house and asking Kelvin to build it. to them chopped down the tree that I was building it on. you cant be mad at that face as he thumbs you up :D i will miss that in some way but glad we are moving forward great work Endnight keep it up there is so much you can do and CAN do it

Aside from that if you're ok with the game changing (possibly a lot) before it's 1.0 then yeah it's good.  Think of the game Satisfactory: there's tons to do right now before the game is completed, that's what this is like, if you like chopping up trees and cannibals.

This game really needs some sort of perk or points system for killing enemies, as right now there's no point other than getting ""skin pouches"" which usually carry a roll of tape and a battery. I am saying that these Perks can be used to improve I don't know maybe weapon attack speed, gun rate of fire, overall health, stamina, and maybe a tiny damage boost like 5-10% or something related, like I stated before there's no point of killing enemies in this game other than just them getting in your way of everything such as building, hunting for food, etc.  I am not saying that they're shouldn't be enemies just there should be an actual purpose for killing them. I'm aware that mutants drop armor on death but the scales are just off, your telling me comparing a puffy mutant is going to give the same amount of armor as a 15+ foot demon?!?!?  for the demon at least make it 3 pieces for all the armor that takes to kill it.

The horror element is definitely refined in this one, they absolutely nailed the caves, although there needs to be more loot spaced out in them (maybe have mutant cannibals drop skin pouches since they no longer provide creep armor). Would be handy to have a way to check your strength level also. Armor needs a buff (perhaps damage reduction while wearing any armor at all) feels like paper most of the time, which I suppose is slightly offset by a scaling health pool. Survival elements are a  great improvement from it's predecessor, the seasons are beautiful and well designed, enemy variety is refreshing. Building is a little ridiculous at times, as you will often get into situations where you have to redo the exact same design in a slightly different order to get the click system to register, I see what they were trying to do but seems much more limiting then the first game. Combat is good, well balanced with priority on range being the limiting factor of ammo, and melee when that fails, it works, sucks not having as much upgrade variety like pumping speed or damage on certain items for freedom of choice. 

This game is breathtaking, though seems to have an odd habit of capping utilization of GPU/CPU/RAM without giving max allowed frames, despite being able to push the hardware 30% further, haven't figured that out, could just be my setup. All in all a great purchase, the map most definitely needs to be filled out more, but I imagine this is coming with the full release.

All joking aside, the game is pretty damn good. The graphics are amazing, the build system is one of a kind, the setting with the season changes is absolutely beautiful.

My only complaints would be that sometimes the AI is a little janky (looking at you Kelvin), sometimes the build system can be buggy (not often but still), enemies can sometimes spawn inside your defensive walls, and the lack of having a long term water storage.

1. Building mechanics are much diverse and depending on creativity.
2. The Ai companion is good to have (however the path-finding needs improvement)
3. Less Buggy and laggy compared to the previous game when entering caves, 
4. Un-aliving cannibals with different weapons are satisfying. 
5. Un-aliving cannibals with Traps are also satisfying & Hillarious. 

What i don't like : 
1. The AI companion path-finding sometimes gets stuck under a log house 
2. I understand the pitchblack darkness during night time can bring alittle horror but alittle brighter would help. 
3. Light bulbs are less bright than torch walls, from my pov, i think the illumination of light bulbs need to increase and further range. (hope the devs sees this) 
4. Couldnt interact with Virginia like how we interact with Kelvin. I guess there's a good reason. 
5. Story wise, i dont feel connected to the characters we are being introduce, unlike the previous game, We play as father who's looking for his missing son. (I still haven't completed the story, but founded the CEOs)

Even though the game isn't done yet, full release is only a month away at the time of me writing this review, and there are still some things that to me, are problems that I feel may not get fixed. The first problem is the fact that the enemies just aren't scary or threatening enough. The second problem is that it's kind of pointless to do anything. Survival is too forgiving. It is impossible to starve or die of thirst. Being cold doesn't do anything either. The enemies, again, are just too easy to put down. There is no sense of urgency regarding anything. The game is also too inherently bright and clear, I had to put my brightness to 0.00 in order to feel a little more scared. Endnight did a LOT of things right. Combat is extremely dynamic, they revolutionized the building system AGAIN, caves are easily the scariest part of your gameplay experience (Which in this case is both a good and a bad thing). I just want them to maybe give a little more purpose to ALL of that in the future.

The problems (that I have) with this game are:
No purpose/urgency to do anything
Most enemies aren't as creepy/scary/threatening as one would like them to be
The default settings are CRAP. (Brightness is too high, too easy to see and therefore removes further anxiety, boxes refill when loading up saves like the first game)
TOO EASY!!!! Even hard survival feels extremely sugar-coated compared to the first game.
Cannibals are also too easy, they go down in 2-3 hits in some circumstances and I would like to see them be much more tankier (Perhaps nine to even fifteen hits for a regular cannibal).
Creepies, even the gigantic ones from the first game, are really small and unimposing.
Story isn't very fleshed out (Though that could just be because the game isn't finished)
The map is four times as big as the first game, yet it is very empty and lacks character
The sound design just isn't as great as the first game. In the first game you would grunt and emote and scream while doing activities such as attacking or chopping down bodies, and the cannibals sounded terrifying. Here, you sound lifeless, and the cannibals sound like dogs. (I do like the sound design for the creepies though, and the composer for the game's music is amazing).
Visuals are too bright and too clear, having it be darker with less fleshed out colors and more ""fog"" would really help set the atmosphere even more.

Absolutely loved The Forest and I was SO excited for this game and it's just a disappointment.

The graphics are wonderful, lots of weapons.
Crafting is annoying, building is annoying but also a little more unique so at the same time it's alright?
Hit reg is terrible on enemies/animals.
The caves are absolute sh*te, so many caves that do nothing and go no where. The caves were such fun in The Forest and these are so disappointing, they look amazing but they're just boring for the most part.
Story seems to be random and not really articulated well at all, mostly we spent our time saying 'what's happening?'

We are about about to finish the 'story' section and for the 14 hrs we have in the game, probably about 4-5 have been any actual story progression/useful caves/findings.

It's EA so bugs expected but it's so poorly optimised, getting terrible FPS for all of us with rigs more than capable to play the game on top graphics and even on the lowest it constantly takes a shit.

Oh, and Kelvin has such low health and dies much too easily. :(

All in all, it's nice but massively disappointed and not really worth the price tag currently.

Maybe this will change in the future.
Right now, we're about to finish the story and just be done with it.

Sad about it really.

Edit:

Finished the story and it is so poorly written. 
The game just doesn't make any sense, had to watch a 10 minute video on the story to understand it all.

Such a shame.

Edit Edit -

Played almost a year later after a few updates have been done.

It's better, but they still have some bugs which is bound to happen, that's fine.
There's things missing that were in the first game that I think..why have you removed this? 
Such as farms for farming.. or decorative items like the couches for inside buildings/bases.

It's enjoyable, but I loved The Forest, and it's better but it's now where it should have been on release - or even still missing something, I just wish they'd pushed it back a bit more and been more realistic. They released an unfinished product, sadly. ",1678056208,1705348646,False,5,1,0.559006214141845703,0,True,False,True

The Forest was great! The Son's fallen pretty far from the tree. Minimal story is one thing, but trying to decipher what's happening via scrawled notes and emails if frustrating. The Forest Managed, but this one was pointless to try to follow. And getting jumped by the two surprise cut scenes? Who the hell was that guy with the jacket? 

Don't bother building, there is no point. They'll drown you in bodies where ever you go, and good luck fixing any walls, the logs hate you too and refuse to line back up. 

The golf carts were fun, though. The monowheel could have been, but you spend too much time dumped on the ground from mouse turds on the trail.

However, from my experience so far, the Sons of the Forest is simply not as good as The Forest. I've played many hours in the original and it's clear when comparing these two together what's missing from this. 

The world is much bigger and provide more verity in landscapes and building areas, yet the map is incredibly empty and lacking in content to explore.

The cannibals unfortunately have lots their spark. The original cannibals were much scarier, covered in blood, dirt, tattoos. They've scream throughout the night and run around your base with Molotov's and attack you relentlessly. In The Sons of the Forest, they're simply lack lustre. I've only come across a limited amount of them, all of which just looked like normal people, removing the horror aspect. They don't scream anymore and they move very oddly and aren't considered as a threat to the player. 

The base building although is good and has been improved on, is painfully unless. Without a serious threat of cannibals, building a base is simply not needed. You no longer need to stash bombs, armour and arrows to survive the onslaughts, because there aren't any... 

The world looks stunning and the layout is interesting but caves are simply very small, lack any content within them and have lost the horror atmosphere they once had.

Kelvin, your disabled team member, although is useful and a great addition, ruins the horror aspect of the game with his calm manor and excited responses to collected the 100th log. His silent character is almost humerus and pulls you out of the immersion. 

Following on with immersion, the players movement animations are over the top for the simplest things. Instead of reacting naturally to your environment, all hand gestures are flamboyant and over the top but more frustrating, painfully slow! 

Key changes to essential mechanics, I understand the need to change the crafting areas from the original as more space and clarity was needed whilst managing resources, but the current system is slow, clunky. In the original, the game was smoother for the player, there were simply less buttons to click to do the same thing. Managing campfires now has it's own UI menu, making the process laborious. UI changes to the crafting book are similar to the previous.

Traps have been removed from this entry as well, limiting the fun dynamics which the first game had. 

Unfortunately I could go on, but I'll wrap this up: The game has lost a lot of its atmosphere and doesn't challenge the player like the original. With UI over complication, an empty map that's far too big, laborious menus and animations you have to sit through painfully... It simply needs more work to win me over and for now, I will be sticking to The Forest until further updates.",1705263307,1705263307,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

This is from the perspective of exclusively multiplayer sessions with 4 players.

I will revisit this review after Early Access and adjust as necessary. I am hopeful about seeing improvements.

PROS:
[b]First of all the game is beautiful and the environments are brilliantly realized[/b] from the deformation effects on the snow and sand to the trees losing material as you chop away at them and the high fidelity models for everything. The weather and god rays are also top notch and not overly emphasized. Exploring under a full moon at least once despite the dangers is a must.
To be brutally honest this feels like where most of the budget went, and for the returns on visuals to drive sales makes sense.

[b]Minimal and/or seamlessly integrated UI.[/b] Like the GPS item for a large map, although the controls are very unintuitive as I will cover in more detail later.
Interacting with your inventory, or the ""quick"" version, is unique and while it can be a bit of a chore to locate something the first time quickly becomes second nature and overall looks great.
The HUD gets a pass as it is mostly out of the way and provides only essential info.

[b]Vehicles.[/b] They are a blast and mostly indestructible in their current state which is great for when you inevitably wreck and get forcibly separated from them (except the golf cart).

No progression/game breaking bugs to speak of in 15+ hours of playing.

CONS:
[b]Death tis but a scratch[/b] (in online sessions). I don't know if there are plans to make dying more punishing, but currently your bag always appears right next to you, so why have it separate at all? Feels like something was cut here or is still to change.

[b]Controls.[/b] I personally would appreciate an auto-sprint feature on double taping forward or simply the ability to toggle sprint by pressing the button once until you let go of forward or run out of stam.
The scroll wheel is not seemingly used for anything, however middle mouse clicking is... for the GPS zoom levels of all things. I would really like the ability to use scroll to flip through my hotkeyed items or at the very least be able to quickly flip the pages of the guide book which goes into my next point:

[b]Unskippable animations.[/b] The worst of which are when crafting from the backpack or flipping pages in the guide book. This could be a personal failing, but would it be so unbalanced or unrealistic to be able to bulk craft multiple arrow sets for example if there are enough materials selected for crafting?
Of course we want to see the excellent immersive animations, but after the dozenth time of waiting 4 seconds to proceed it is pretty old. Since the guide book must be used to place blueprints it would be great if the buttons to flip pages did not depend on the previous page flip having completed.

[b]Minor bugs.[/b] None of which are a deal breaker in Early Access mind you, but it would be nice to see them gone.
- The minimap compass indicator does not work when you are sitting down [i]including[/i] when you are driving/riding the golf cart.
- Speaking of the golf cart you cannot pull out your GPS to navigate and must stop, get out, check GPS, then get back in to resume your journey. Possibly related to the above point.
- Inconsistent shared (can only be picked up by one person) vs instanced (can be picked up by everyone) loot. For example the guitar, certain harvestable plants, and creep from slain enemies can only be got by one player while almost everything else is able to be got by everyone.
- Additionally about creep harvesting and butchering in general if all players start the process at or around the same time, before the first person to do so finishes, everyone is able to harvest from the one corpse. This feels like an unintended duplication glitch.
- Minor multiplayer de-syncs. When the season changes, like to winter, the clients see the full change immediately while the host is just starting to smoothly transition. This also resets all GPS markers for only the clients which never re-syncs with the host as I assume this, and exploration/progress in general, is part of the local save file.",1705186843,1705197787,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

    Incorporate more furniture sets.
    Address various issues (though I understand it's early access, and improvements are expected).
    Without giving away spoilers, I'll mention that the story isn't particularly compelling and is confusing. I completed all available tasks before reaching the ending, but it seems this aspect needs fixing, as it significantly impacted my overall experience.
    Introduce more types of cannibals.

Great game, great storyline, great development, great AI, I love the season switch, and how realistic the game is. Like even though its frozen everywhere else, it doesn't freeze the rivers because rivers dont freeze in real life that easily. It's just the immersion that is essentially the pinnacle of this game.

The actual gameplay itself is mediocre. The shooting is pretty nice, but anything with melee is buggy, and slow. 

Plus, only way to get ammo at a reasonable pace is to do the crash site glitch. Even this can take 30-60 minutes to just farm 50-60 bullets.

Updates flow consistently and have a countdown, which is something very few developers can achieve. They have an extremely well-designed AI system for this game. It's clear that lots of blood and tears went into this, and it's visible from a mile away. It isn't easy to do what Endnight has done.

If I had any say in it, I would love to see some changes. For example, some of the hand/equipment animations are a little ""stiff and clunky."" Weapon attachments such as the Pistol Rail could either be removed to make room for the iron sight or add a small holographic sight. This would mean the Laser Sight would need to be remodeled to fit the pistol but would remove the unconventional rail that blocks the sight.

Flat sights should be changed to a holographic diffraction sight instead of the flat transparent emission texture.

Did I mention this type of enemy spawn in no smaller than a group of six?

Edit: The ranged weapons are so fucking useless at range they should be classified as melee weapon that require ammunition, it's literally easier to hunt deers by chasing them down with an axe.

Well hmm. I guess I'm torn up over this one, still. I finished the game, took maybe 12 hrs, all told, to get through the ""story"" sort of deal that the game has going on. It's a bittersweet feeling, honestly. It seems that's how beating endnight's games feel. [spoiler] In the last game, there was at least a little bit of explanation after the storyline was complete... But not here. [/spoiler] Excellent ""replay"" value (of sorts) in their games, though. They're a bit like minecraft and the like, where even after you're ""done"" playing them, you're not really ""done."" 


[spoiler] I got both endings to it as I chose one, and then promptly walked into helicopter blades, dying instantly. I then completed the last boss fight(s) again. Don't really need it to be THAT that realistic. [/spoiler] 

[h3] B*tches, gripes, comlaints [/h3]
link between previous game and current game could be better fleshed out in the ""main"" story, without collecting the [spoiler]artifacts.[/spoiler]

Also who the hell were [spoiler] the non-kelvin guy at the end cutscene; the guy trying to get in the box with you but who was pushed out? etc. etc. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] The boss fights were ok. With enough grenades, anything is possible, it seems [/spoiler]

However: [spoiler] It took me waaaaay too long to realize that the ""demons"" were demons, and that ""bad kitty-ing"" them with the cross would work on them. I don't know... I guess I was literally expecting lil' red guys with horns and tails as ""demons."" Pale blind guys ""full scorpion-ing"" you, as Rob Dyrdek would say, were not what I expected. [/spoiler] 

Similarly: [spoiler] I also didn't pick up on that you can just ""bad kitty"" the penultimate boss to death. I kept trying to shoot/explode the thing and it just wouldnt work. [/spoiler] 

So... yeah. It is what it is, and it was good, tbh. Begrudgingly, I'll say that. I guess it's the difference in how I wanted to play the game, and how the game wanted me to play it. As I say below in my original review, the game wants you to play stealth. I just don't do that. They want you untethered from a base, running/creeping through the forest from the various fetch-quest caves to get the several items you need to progress. 

I will point out, though, that the rebreather and grappling-hook-gun were nigh-on useless for me, save the couple instances you need them to progress to the next item. Shovel, too. So, it kind-of hurts to have to go through hell and high water (literally) to get them only to use them once-ish. The rebreather use was more or less forced on the player... By the end I said every time ""gah, another fkn water portion"" (*Swims downward*). 

All in all, good job. But I will say, beautiful revamp of construction. It still has its flaws now, like little log placement quirks and problems every now and then, but you took everything I didn't like about The Forest's construction and made it a zillion times better, and into a game where I actually want to build, as you can get resources back from things you've built, finally. That's hard to do as i'm not really a ""building-centric"" player. 

Looking forward to the release.



[h2]ORIGINAL REVIEW:[/h2]
Eh... I put ""recommend"" for this game as I can't stop playing it, but... it's tough. 
One of the issues it has is balance. Enemies in the game infinitely respawn, however... ammo doesn't. Thus you're forced to use spears, bows+arrows to take down the cannibals that constantly harass you. It's a little tedious. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it, but I almost don't see it as being possible to beat in the state it is. If you check the subreddit for the game, it had steady posts up until about 10 months ago. Reason being, that was when the devs released an update to where boxes/crates didn't respawn ammo. It seems that killed the playerbase. 

The problem is that it bills itself as a base-building survival game whereas the way to play through it best seems to be to be nomadic and constantly running around the island between the places you have to go for story progression, and not building a fort/stronghold and going back and forth. It's about a month off from being released, and I don't see them ""fixing"" the changes they made (which were for ""survival"" and ""realism"" reasons). See what I mean? It's also a game where mutants exist, so ""realism"" shouldn't be a huge huge concern. 

I beat the original without guns and only poison arrows, molotovs, and prox bombs, but the same doesn't feel achievable with this one.

I mean, like I said, don't get me wrong, it's fun, but fun in a way where you get attacked, die, try again, get attacked, die, try again. If you were trying to play permadeath and not load a save, I got news for you... youre gonna have a bad time. V hard mode? Forgetaboutit.  

Passive mode is ok, if not a little too boring, ironically. I would prefer a gamemode/option like the ""Vegetarianmode"" of the previous game where the enemies only spawn at night, minecraft-style (didn't need to use it in the previous one, but definitely would now). As for ammo/resource spawn, the suggestions I read on the subreddit that seem best would be crates that wash up on the shore or helicopter crashes (with no survivors) containing ammo/meds/food; or an option to have refreshing containers, like the first game did. This would fix the issues the game has with ammo scarcity and infinite enemies. Others suggested being able to craft ammo.",1704477394,1704909835,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

however, as stated below the game is currently still in early access and it still has its issues.
mostly some minor bugs and the lack of content

there are a lot of improvements though, namely:
- the map has been replaced with a GPS that tells you how late it is, and tells you your exact location
- the enemy ai has made some improvements
- the graphics have improved substantially
- the gore is a lot more visceral
- cave exploration feels better
- a lot more mutants to kill, skin and make clothing out of
- basebuilding animations are fun (although it can be a bit slow
- the progress can be sped up by making your hearing impaired ai companion gather resources
- mutant girl companion

overall very enjoyable, am excited to see more of it in the future when the game fully comes out

I've absolutely wasted my time starting game after game after game trying different strategies out. 

Anyway... The visuals are amazing, it is absolutely stunning being in the thick forest with the morning sun pushing through the canopy, the forest feel alive!

The base building is top drawer I normally couldn't care less about this, but there is a certain level of tower defence going on here. If you're minding your own in your base preparing some supplies for the next run, you will have to defeat waves of increasingly strong and deadly enemies. I turned structure damage off because I was stuck in a loop of gather resources->fix base->defend base->eat/drink/sleep->gather resources->fix base etc etc. This does make defending your base super easy though, just get high up with a load of spears and you're golden - each to their own. The base building is as open or closed as you want it to be, be warned if you started building your own structure I would strongly recommend having a read through both versions of the book, there are some useful techniques for layering and scaffolding.

Kelvin is very useful once you understand how he works, when I first started playing I had just constructed my custom building, then went for a quick excursion and told Kelvin to collect logs and fill the holders I made. I came back one in-game day later and my holders were full of logs from my building that he dismantled!

As with the first game, the survival element is only really relevant until you've figured out the mechanics. Once you've got it down thirst and hunger won't be a problem.

Great game - I'm going to start my unknownth run, this time I think I'm going light. Storerooms in each corner of the map, no base, no defences, just a room to store stuff and move on.

So I've played the first game like, alot, and I love it to death. I was so excited for this game when it was announced. The hype surrounding this games release was insane. It's release crashed the steam store, it had one of the best launches for a game on steam in nearly as long as I can remember. 

So, what's wrong. Or should I say, what went wrong along the way? This game has been getting regular updates since release. That's great. My issue, is that none of these updates have changed the game significantly enough to where I feel the game has enough replayability to be considered fun. There are glaring issues with this game compared to the first game, and I was hopeful, from release, that the devs would be able to mitigate this issues over time. But there's only one more update left. It doesn't look like the game is gonna get much better.

So what are the issues, specifically? 

#1 Map is way too big. If the map was more filled in with things to do and things to find and interact with then this would not be a problem. But this is not the case. The map is empty. They have been adding things to the map since release, but they have not added anywhere near enough to the map, in my opinion, to feel like they made any kind of difference.

#2 The building gets really boring, really fast. In the first game you could build relatively quickly at an expense to realism. You could make very unique custom structures too, structures that this game's building system will not allow. Every structure in this game, is based on a grid system and each log must be placed individually with an animation for each log. This is cool at first, but the charm wears off very fast. Basically, building is a lot slower and less creative in this game when compared to the first.

#3 Balancing issues. Some items are literally pointless. Good example is berries, in the first game they were actually useful but in this game you are better off forgetting they even exist. They are no good. Regular stone arrows have an insanely short distance as well compared to first game. Shooting a stone arrow, feels like you are just throwing a stone. To be fair, many of the balancing issues have been fixed, but some remain. Oh yeah, and armor in this game sucks. They need to make it better. Even the good armor can get whacked off of you like it's nothing sometimes. How tough it is to get versus how easy it is to break just feels wrong.

#4 Story sucks in my opinion. The first game had a great story with a great cliff hanger. This game disappoints in comparison. After you beat the story there is very little to do. You can go into any caves you may have missed to find some blueprints to add to your base, and just build more of your base. Other than that, and killing random enemies, there's nothing else to do.

#5 Enemies/mutants in this game suck compared to the ones encountered in the last game. An enemy that is most commonly encountered is actually the most annoying and frustrating enemies in the game. There is another one that's probably more annoying, but its far less common. The mutants in the first game were also just way scarier and much more fun to fight.

#6 Caves in this game are much worse than the caves in the last game. The way they advertised caves when they talked about the game before release was that mutants wandered from one area of a cave to the next and just clearing one section of a cave didn't necessarily make that area safe. While this is true, I have never seen mutants wander between sections of caves unless you bring them over. They can re-spawn in areas you've cleared, as in I can walk down one corridor, come back and there seems to be a chance that they have re-spawned but most of the time they are gone until I leave the cave and come back a few days later. Also the cave layouts are such a disaster in this game honestly.

#6 A lack of water craft/islands really hurts this game in my opinion. One of the worst things to be removed from the last game. Just takes even more variety away from the map.

Okay, I can probably talk about other issues, but my head hurts so let me at least address what the game does well. Here are some points I really liked about this game over the old game.

#1 The addition of Kelvin and Virginia as friendly NPC's is a good one. Being able to tell Kelvin to collect logs for you while you build does speed up the building process somewhat if you are on single-player. He can also catch fish for you, collect sticks and stones and perform other small tasks for you around your base. I find him quite useful, although he does happen to get stuck in places quite a lot. Virginia doesn't really provide much use. She will occasionally present you with a gift, but these gifts are often useless item with little value (like BERRIES). She can equip guns that you give to her and if she has guns, she can effectively help you defend your base against enemies. She is a decent shot. Problem is she likes to run off into the wilderness a lot so often, she is never present at the base when I get attacked. Got I am trying to be positive here lol. Kelvin is good though.

#2 Graphics are phenomenal. The game is absolutely gorgeous. While the map is empty as hell, some of the scenery is jaw dropping. The lighting is great and textures are realistic. Way better looking than the first game. Not much more to say other than that though.

#3 The addition of guns is a good one in my opinion. While they are very powerful weapons, the game does a good job at limiting the amount of ammo you can find. So you will refrain from using it, but when you need to use it, it's epic.

#4 Grappling is much better in this game. For late game, this is very essential. The grappling in the first game was quite annoying as you could only grapple at a downward angle. Now you can grapple upwards. This is good.

To be honest, that's it. Everything else is just the same from the last game but with a new paint job. Until the game's issues are fixed, and until the add more things to do in general, there is very little reason to play this when the last one, in my opinion, is a better game. I say all of this as there is one final update to be released soon, so if that update changes my mind then I will update my review but I am not very hopeful anymore",1677934066,1704736843,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Sons of the forest just simply does not live up. 
Pros: lore and multi-player is fun.  The camps and tunnels have been revamped and you can find little scooters and hang gliders which is cool. Building is still fun.

Cons: there's no consequences. If you die. You get your stuff back no worries. If you starve you just get slow you don't die. Same with dehydration. Unlike in the first game you can eat the human meat without getting the madness.  There just simply isn't any fear of dying or death or consequences of anything. It truly takes the stress/pressures out of the game. 

It's fun for a little bit but picking up wierd emails and fighting mouth bodied creatures just isn't enough.

The safe feeling i got when i first spawned to absolutely pissing my pants when exploring my first cave is just magical. The forest had this magic, but sons of the forest turned it up to 11! 
I'll now give you some tips to get the same experience as i had.
1. PLAY SINGLEPLAYER IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THE GAME.
Playing multiplayer is not a good idea if you want the game to be challenging, plus people are gonna rush the caves for the items and not let you admire the view.
2. Do not rush this game, take in the amazing views, listen to the wind blow through the trees, and piss your pants when you hear a scream from somewhere around you.
3. do the story by yourself, other people won't take it into account that you are new, they just want to build and have the stuff to do it.
and most importantly!
4. Play the way you want, even tho stronger monsters spawn when the days progress, that just makes for a good challenge.

⭕ - Conclusion -:
I waited a long time for the sequel to the forest to release and expected a lot as a result. The game is good and really does follow the same game style as the forest. I still dislike how impossible it is to find your way around through exploration alone. Without a virtual map the game is far less fun. The game play itself is interesting and I like a lot of elements which were added to the game. There were a lot of bugs when I played the game but i assume most of these are solved now.

Review (Jan 2024)

     Bought this game almost a year after the previous review, this game is great. Since my previous review, they optimized it much better, fixed so many bugs, and added log carts back, even made it better. So far its been so much fun, and I got a new PC so it looks beautiful at max settings. If you are unsure about buying this game, just go for it. 


Review (Feb 2023)

     I'm going to be honest, I played for about 25 minutes, and in that time I learned that there is no log cart, it's insanely buggy, and it is optimized terribly for PCs on the lower end scale. I understand it's in early access, but even for those standards, it sucks. I was excited too and I was completely underwhelmed. I'm going to refund the game, but I'm sure when it gets out of early access it will be a great game. But for now, stick to TF1",1677365411,1704585876,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Let me say, if you're coming over to see if this one is any better, or the same, here you go.

- The gameplay. Honestly, it plays the same. BUT, there are a lot more elements from the first game that are different.
You get a map with you at all times, it's great because it tells you where your companion is, where the cave is, and is not a piece of paper. It's a GPS.
Like seasons, Winter, spring, all of that.
You get tarps, meaning everytime you're outside running around, you don't need to cut down a tree and make a temporary shelter, you can just put it down from your inventory, and sleep and save. It's a huge thing from the first game that makes this game so much better.
The AI companion. It's honestly amazing. Huge thing that makes getting logs and sticks, and just building everything better. 

Oh yeah, building in this game is SO much better. Snapping, windows, consistent traps, and traps that actually HIT the enemies? Yeah, it's actually amazing. This is one of the best building games, not gonna lie. It's really fun to build. Building in the first game was fun, but man, did it suck sometimes. This game made it even better. The updates added stones to the game and electricity, so you have a lot to work with. 

- The story.

It's a sequel to the first game, so yeah. If you haven't played the first game, please do. I won't really spoil this, so. It's simple, you play as a squad and come in looking for some dudes. Your helicopter crashes and you got an AI with you. Kinda the same as the first. 

But this game when it comes to the story, it's a lot better than the first. It plays like the first, but it also adds a lot more than just the caves. There are a lot more areas that make you question the story more. It's just nicer and you can tell if you've been in this area yet. it's really expansive in this game, and with more updates coming, the story is being expanded. It can be understood even with the game complete. There are cutscenes mid-game and it's pretty rad.

Overall, the game is great from the first now. From release, there was some things that didn't feel better from the first, but now? I think it's in a better state than the first game. I just wish it had VR. But in the future, maybe.

This was my game of the year.",1677184027,1704575682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The contrast between the struggle of early game and taking out 4 mutants with a shotgun in that many seconds helps the player to truly appreciate how far they have progressed. With ever-increasingly powerful and violent enemies, a myriad of objectives to complete throughout the world with various levels of valuable loot, and a building system that is not perfect by any means, but is still quite intuitive and mostly works well in all ranges of game play.

In mid-game, you have the option to take it slow and just work on your base, or get aggressive and march through all objectives and get looted out. Sitting back and building an arsenal and extra supplies between missions is as simple as building adequate defense mechanism and waiting for the mutants to come knockin'.

And is capable of capturing your attention for hours doing even something as mundane as building a large stone wall to protect you and your companion(s) from the many forces that wish you harm.

At the time of this review I have not played The Sons of the Forest to the extent that I could explore many of the new features this game offers but despite that I can tell already that the game is quite the improvement over the first game, and is still only in early access. 

But alas there is one thing, one crippling flaw of The Sons of the Forest, one i can not forgive, but I will touch on that detail later. For now I will tell you about the things that I have come across that I like.

 - Building: The new building system introduced into this game is miles better than the first, although I do not have problems with the building system present in “The Forest”, it’s ultimately boring by comparison and is not as involved. The ability to cut logs into different sizes and shapes opens up so many possibilities to explore your imagination and create magnificent structures.

 - Kelvin(I think that’s his name): Kevin is a great addition to the game, he is very handy and a nice companion, although he’s only an NPC controlled by a basic but still intelligent for a game AI, he really feels like a real guy with feelings and wants. You almost want to kiss this incredible person through your screen, so then you lean forward and purse your lips touching them to the glass of your monitor and you are instantly reminded that he is only a NPC placed into a video game and you’ll sit in front of your computer for a while after almost ashamed of yourself, but will still find yourself determined to pursue a (completely platonic) relationship with this spectacular creature seemingly made by god himself, despite the obvious limitations.

 - Combat: Combat is an improvement over the first, it plays a lot smoother and the enemy AI is more intelligent. Combat definitely seems more difficult and intimidating compared to the first game, it feels like you have to be more tactical and use more resources to your advantage to come out on top. Although, I wish Kelvin would come to your rescue whenever you get downed and carry you back to your base and care for your wounds and lay by your side and tell you bedtime stories and gently caress you when you are in need of some [strike] Super Romantic [/strike] completely platonic companionship.

 - Inventory: Inventory system is still unique and cool and is expanded from the first game giving it a visual makeover with this new and tidy mat fitted with lights and bunch of other cool stuff, the first game provided you with some sort of sheet of fabric that you would bundle all your items in, and it fit well with the setting of being stranded alone on an island with not much resources but the new inventory is pleasing to look at even if it ultimately doesn’t matter. I don’t even know why I brought this up honestly, got a little side tracked.

Alright and now I’ll reveal the one thing that I alluded to previously, the one thing that’s holding this game back from it’s potential to be the greatest game of all time, listen close Endnight Games, this could very well determine the future success of this incredible title that is only missing one crucial thing. I think you should be able to sex Kelvin, I honestly find the audacity insulting, the developers ended up creating the greatest character in fiction and didn’t let you f*ck him, talk about blue balls. Kelvin deserves the love of the player after all he's gone through, but Endnight Games in an act of extreme cruelty have denied him that not only to torture poor Kelvin but the player too. Kelvin and every player to play The Sons of the Forest knew from the very moment they laid eyes on each other that they wanted something together, something incredible, something that will transcend time, something the historians would document in great detail but still fail to capture the essence of their boundless love for each other. Now it brings up the question of whether it’s unethical or not to have hot steamy sex with someone that just received brain damage recently. Even if it is unethical to f*ck someone that isn’t mentally all there, love always wins ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

And for that reason alone, I cannot in good faith give this game more than a 5/10, barely passing my threshold for recommending the game instead of not recommending.

I sincerely hope Endnight Games has learned something from this review and will act accordingly.

In all seriousness, the game has improved immensely since it initially came out. Although the story has developed a lot more, it's definitely not finished. So, if you're invested in the story aspect maybe wait? There's enough story currently that you can probs figure it out/spoil it.

Everything about this game is top notch! I've been playing games, well, as long as they've existed! So I've seen it all.  The thing about this game that's amazing to me is that everything is photo-realistic.  The water, the trees, the people, the wildlife, even the fleshy...well, I won't give anything away, but it all looks REAL.  The density of the forest (something you might not necessarily think about) is realistic.  You have to contend with dense trees, brush, rocks, boulders, rivers, snow, storms, night, etc. all represented like you are really there.  OH!  AND THE CAVES!!!  Simply amazing.  
Sounds too are realistic, from crunching snow, to chopping wood, to flowing water, to picking berries, to wildlife trotting through the forest. I'm very glad I played this game.

A few months ago i played this on a server with some friends. My server is Limux so i had to figure out how to run a windows application on the server. After that, the gameplay was enjoyable. 

Building is probably one of the main focuses of this game. I like building so it worked out for me. With a few people you can make pretty big structures. 
Exploring the caves was fun and intense, reminded me of The Forest so that was good.
Models are better looking, more detail. 

One thing that irked me what putting heads on spikes, it turns into the same head model, at least it did at the time of my playthrough.
The story line is not complete. There are cut scenes that dont make a whole lot of sense. 
There isnt much story either. I was disappointed with how short the story was over. Was in the last cave, not knowing, but suscpecting it was the last cave. Tried to play as much as i could but only got 90 hours in. 

Ending was decent enough, it will be better once the game has been completed and polished up.

So glad i only recently came across this after recently playing 'The Forest"", as i couldn't imagine actually waiting for this game for years like the majority of people just to be handed this lazy pile of sh!t.
So much potential wasted by terrible writers, and incompetent devs. 
All thats left is to hope, hope that come 1.0 release,, what's currently the game, is only a tester for the actual planned release of Sons of the forest and they actually release something worthy of spending any amount of time playing.

The mechanics are basically all the same although I do really enjoy the log building quite a bit. If you compare with the first one, it is really similar. Same mechanics for the most part but the log building is really the best thing this game has. As most people mentioned, its not really a long game. After the main story line is complete, it's repetitive, boring and I think that's where most of the ""survival"" players are disappointed. Many  games we play have a story ending but we keep playing for long hours after to build massive bases that fend off hordes and push the boundaries of the game. This game has a story and a sliver extra to mess around with. Nothing super exciting  to  keep you playing for years. Even the hordes just get repetitive.

- Enemies are alot stronger. When you first begin the game, enemies are impossible to beat if there is more then one. They are stronger and tend to run away to alert others more often. They dont stop either when running so unless you have a good shot your done for.

- Base building is alot more fun. Added alot more chance for creativity in the new game, Being able to split log into about 6 different ways offers alot of experimenting.

- Caves.. omg... hate them, they are much harder when compared to the old game, only ever been in one and died both times i went in. You need to be PREPARED for going into a cave with heals and ammo.

- Kelvin is a absolute G, he makes the game alot more entertaining but you feel like a dad with a child with mild problems. He does take some of the more boring aspects out of the way but make sure you dont have building damage on if hes cutting down trees nearby...

The building system is fantastic though, I guess playing on peaceful mode would be pretty decent, then you only have the enemies in the caves to deal with. The caves themselves are pretty atmospheric, pitch dark and good fun to dive into. It's a middle of the road game, some really good mechanics on top of some really poor combat... but normal mode or harder, the way it is meant to be played, involves lots of the combat.

Maybe it is just me, and I am not aware of dodge or parry mechanics that are in there, and I just need to git gud. Either way, it is a no from me.",1704278929,1704278929,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My son got this game for Christmas in 2023 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

#1: Building can get tedious and has some annoying rules.
#2: AI feels weird at times. A group of cannibals are staring at you and you shoot their friend with an arrow and they don't immediately attack you or run away from you. It can feel strange.
#3: Story is rather short and hard to piece together.
#4: Once you have all the weapons in the game you feel a little op.
#5: In some situations the amount of enemies feels lacking.
(I've heard some people complaining there are way too many enemies but I have not experienced this.)
#6: Combat isn't too special as you simply slash, block, parry or shoot.
Now onto the pros.
#1: Atmosphere and setting are great. You really get the feeling of a dangerous, mysterious island and the dense forest makes it hard to know when you will be attacked.
#2: Massive open world map. You can go anywhere and build anywhere you want and while walking can get tedious various game mechanics to alleviate this are in-place.
#3: Building is SOO much fun. From building spike walls to giant houses or waterfall fortresses to mansions on a lake or great walls of china you can let you're imagination run wild and build whatever you want. I had that same feeling I had years ago playing Minecraft building whatever I want when I was a kid.
#4: As previous stated combat isn't special but it is fun. Dodging, slicing and parrying with swords, chopping and blocking with axes, shooting with bows and slingshots (Slingshots btw, lol) and shooting creepy crawllies with guns is all a lot of fun anyways.
#5: The variety of enemies is great. While you do eventually get used to them all, the variety of cannibals you fight and the variety of mutants makes this interesting and scary.
#6: The quirks and interactions from the AI with you and each other are fun and interesting.
#7: The survival aspect of needing/gathering food and water and creating shelter is present without being annoying.
#8: Highly customization. The settings and well as ability to create custom games with custom difficulties for individual aspects is great.
#9: You have a personal helper who follows you around who you can tell to do all the annoying stuff you don't want to do.
#10: The island really feels alive with animals weather and changing seasons, each bringing unique challenges and advantages.
#11: Good mods. Game does not have a steam workshop at time of review but the mods on other websites I've found have been virus free, (however still use caution as all downloads and websites have potential for malware) and been high quality, quirky add-ons or QOL improvements.
#12: Game feels appropriately gory and violent for the setting and situation without feeling over the top, forced, or exaggerated.
#13: Game doesn't use cheap jump scares to scare you it lets the monster and atmosphere naturally do it.
#14: Reliable, easy to use incredibly fun multiplayer.
#15: Lots of tutorials to help you if you get stuck,
#16: The music is great.
Random note: It feels very satisfying cutting downs trees in this game. Undoing all of Mr Beast's work is actually kinda fun.
And finally a feature I'm going to call neutral: An easy to use command console. Some people may hate it because it allows the potential for ""cheating"" and it ruins the survival experience. Some may love it as a means to focus on building or adventuring or survival or whatever it is you want out of this game. Also you can choose just, not to use it. Do not be fooled by websites that say you need to download their special ""unlocker mod"" or whatever to access the console, you do not. It is completely default within the game.

This game is very much many games rolled into one and done very well at that.
Whether survival, horror, building or adventure is you thing this game's got it all.
Like everything in life it is not perfect but I have really enjoyed myself playing the game and I recommend it to anyone who likes survival, horror, building or adventure games.

I don't know if its just me, but half the time i hit an enemy, they are unfazed and proceed to one shot me. Another issue I have is that, as far as i can tell, there aren't weapon upgrades. From what I've played, there's the ax, the club, the spear, and the katana for melee weapons, and the guns and bows for ranged weapons. If there are stronger weapons beyond the base forms, I haven't come into contact with any. 

There's also the issue I have with building. For the most part, the building is immaculate. The issue stems from when other mechanics are added to the equation. Its not fun, to get one shot by an enemy, have to run all the way back from a camp, only to find half of my buildings are gone and whats left of them are swarmed with cannibals. If the issues with the combat weren't present, then the building wouldn't feel as temporary as it does.

-always make sure you have enough materials to make bone traps, you can clear all cannibals and entire caves with just kiting them through a bone trap and resetting it.
-bow head shots will kill almost everything in one shot, so practice it and land them
-you can max stack bone armour and its fairly easy to amass them early, just burn the bodies of the cannibals for bones
-middle clicking while holding the map will zoom it in/ out
-build a base and place a GPS tracker on a stick in your base to always locate where it is
-build your base near water with fish, build a fish trap, build a drying rack, build a storage shelf and you'll have an almost unlimited source of food/ water except during winter

- The graphics in this game are one of the best I've seen so far, at least for the scenery.  

- The building mechanics take a little getting used to, but make the game feel more immersive 
   for a realistic survival game. 

- You can hunt, fish, forage for oysters, mushrooms and berries and can wield modern 
   weapons such as cross-bows, pistols, etc. P.S. Yes you can deforest the forest.

- There're seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter). Throughout the Winter, some 
  bodies of water freeze over which makes you find other bodies of water to live next to or 
  travel more frequent to, during the Winter months.

The Bad

- If you have an annoying friend, this game is not PvP friendly. If you ""die"" in multiplayer, you 
  will keep re-spawning to the same post/encampment area every time. If you decide to run 
  away without grabbing your bag, you can't pick up anything and you will only have a knife to 
  defend yourself with. 

- It seems as if there're no male deer, so your mostly killing baby deer/their mothers. The 
  deers' survival instinct is severely lacking which may be good for you surviving, but it makes 
  the game feel less realistic than what it's trying to be.

- There is very little directives on what/where you should be going or doing. If you go to a 
  marked location, the map doesn't unmark it.",1701048107,1704082044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is like Minecraft in that it drops you into the game with very little direction. That was nearly enough for me to uninstall it within my first 20 minutes... I'm really glad I didn't, because this game is so cool. I ended up grasping the basics of building only to discover that building is 90% useless and just for fun. I sort of kind of got okay at actually hitting targets with a bow. I learned to put certain things together to craft items I need often, and I once I was officially enjoying the game I got my two teenage kids to play it with me too. That was when it really became fun, as we all helped each other learn and make things and explore freaky places in the forest as well as outright terrifying caves. My youngest daughter screamed out loud more than once to turn and see an unexpected crazy cannibal lurking behind a tree near her or a really creepy monster in a cave running at us. Some of the best times though were us just sitting by a camp fire at the log cabin we built together in the chairs we made listening to the surprisingly good tunes from the radio we found and put on top of our house while just talking and watching the cute mutant gal with 3 arms and 3 legs dance and eat human body parts we hung out on a drying rack for her. Family fun. 

The graphics are great. Game is a real treat for the eyeballs when horrific gore and monsters aren't around. Default difficulty was frankly too much for me in single player, mostly due to the scarce ammunition and maybe from me trying to explore places I just shouldn't have been yet, but that difficulty was mostly fine playing with 2 other people. You can change the difficulty, but I think you won't get as much out of this game if it is too easy. I'm not a fan of horror games but fear of what's on the island is a big part of the thrill here. Still, it can be frustrating if playing solo where you don't just respawn every time you die like you do when playing with friends.

Pros:
-Kelvin is great at filling holders and bringing resources... plus he's a goof you gotta love him
-Building system is unique and immersive
-The map is gorgeous... if you've ever been in a Northern forest you'll be a happy camper
-Virginia is great with a gun
-There are a few options for travel around the map... all of which are fun
-The traps are brilliant and hilarious
-The new mutants are unique and have incredible designs
-The sound design is amazing as long as you aren't near a waterfall (waterfall sounds seem to bug out a lot)
-Many, many unique cannibals, some with very specialised combat skills
-The weapon upgrade system is amazing and unique
-The music is amazing and sometimes reveals hints about the story
-The ending is intense and exciting
-The comedy that's in the game is great
-Guns are great but melee combat is still relevant
-Caves/bunkers look gorgeous and are mostly well designed
-The visual storytelling is brilliant
-Points of interest are worthwhile and rewards for exploring are adequate
-The cooking system is great
-Big head mode

Neutral: 
-Virginia wanders and only visits from time to time... she's more likely to visit if there's a waterfall near base
-The cannibals are very human, takes away from the horror a bit but also adds a bit of psychological horror in my opinion
-The new mutants aren't gargantuan in size... takes away from the horror element a little bit but in my opinion they are still scary
-There's no real incentive to build a large base other than for storage and the fun of building
-Certain enemies only spawn after endgame
-The hang glider is kind of useless since it's almost impossible to carry up to high vantage points after being used... hoping it gets replaced with a paraglider that can be found and stored in the inventory
-Cave D is still a bit of a maze even after it's re-design
-Armour is weaker than it was in the forest but is mostly easy to replenish

Cons:
-Kelvin is a bit buggy if working on something for too long
-Kelvin and Virginia tend to get in the way
-Kelvin and Virginia tend to get stuck really easily
-The map is huge and has a large mountain in the middle that is hard to travel over... hoping that endnight adds paths or  zipline system that is part of the map to get up the mountain. Even perhaps a ski resort with a gondola the player can power
-In winter gifts from Virginia tend to fall through the map

Overall I love this game, upon full release it may become my favourite game of all time. Despite how Kelvin and Virginia have some bugs and the AI pathing can get annoying, I love both of them and still find both to be useful. The story in early access is fascinating and it will be expanded upon full release.",1704048715,1704055571,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

You want to heal ? gotta wait until he opens his god damn pill bottle
Want to craft ? gotta wait until he slowly turns around in his inventory to find the right item

Having stronger enemy is nice but the character is really slow to heal or hit, the enemies are rushing you a lot more than on the first the forest. In the first game, some of the little ones would flee for a little bit after taking dammage, here they rush you like if you were B site on dust 2.

However, I felt like this game fell short on pacing, I felt like I blinked and the game was over with a very underwhelming boss fight. Also, the idea that you can basically jump from one green dot to the next isn't as fun as needing to actually explore the caves to gain access to the other dots. The combat is fun but once you get the shotgun the game goes easy mode. In the first game you basically had to rely on your own crafting to do well in combat and it made it feel more satisfying when you killed large enemies and bosses. The story was intriguing and I see how it ties in to the first game but I do not think that you are involved with the father and son nearly enough. This game lacks the mystery that first one had.

-Items always respawn so you won't run out of resources and that kills the fun because its a story game and especially there is a lot of guns with infinite respawned ammo which makes the game unjustifiably easy.
-Building in this game is painful and full of glitches.
The game shouldn't have guns and infinite resources, it should be fun and simple with the same difficulty as the first forest game with better story writing.

Now sons of the forest failed in every department 
0 in survival you legit eat uncooked all day without a worry 
you got Kelvin and Virgina 
and around 8 guns 
every cave has unlimited amount of ammo 
after saving and leaving the game going back to the same sites that you just looted everything is back to full ammo grenades etc, 
shield to another shield from creepy to bones it was very easy to an 25 fps player to play this game with ease 
story wise failed just dont get me started wallahi you are not ready
and then the worst part of all of this Timmy exists which means in the story of Leblanc where we had to end on either good or bad ending it didn't matter, I wasted time to think of which ending to pick just to see Leblanc picking the bad ending no no no Timmy should be dead just as sons of the forest project, you guys exceeded one thing only which is the graphics and that i give u 10 outta 10 but you improved the only thing your own fans never cared about because we cared about the story and survival part

The way the mobs work firstly, has caused me to quit. They attack you at any time of the day, they attack you straight after cutting yourself free, no time to collect your bag, as the animations for some activities are ridiculously long! I died after taking medicine, because the animation took too long to finish, so the medicine was just wasted. Why are there so many cannibals so early into the game, why are they so brutal?? I know you can do custom games, but I don't want to have to change settings just to make it easier, just kinda ruins the fun...the small amount of fun I can be allowed by this game! I want to give this a positive review, but in this state it's hard to even enjoy it...also why is tape an extra ingredient to make a bow, when it wasn't before??

Oh and the loading times suck, and please turn the menu music down!? I like the music but it's actually deafening!

Just so you all are aware, I've been playing this on normal, not easy, not hurt me plenty, just normal.

While the gameplay has seen notable upgrades from its predecessor, the narrative takes a disappointing dip. The graphics impressively cater to a broad spectrum of hardware but, unfortunately, occasional stutters mar the experience even for players equipped with high-end systems.

In terms of gameplay, Sons of the Forest excels, building upon the foundation laid by The Forest. The survival mechanics, base-building elements, and cooperative play options create an engaging and challenging experience that surpasses its predecessor. The Forest, known for its unique story, had gameplay that could be described as merely okay. Sons of the Forest, on the other hand, manages to elevate the gameplay, offering a more polished and immersive survival experience.

However, where Sons of the Forest falls notably short is in its narrative. The Forest was praised for its unique and intriguing story, which added a layer of mystery and excitement to the gameplay. In the sequel, the narrative lacks the same depth, leaving players wanting more from the unfolding events. Sons of the Forest missed an opportunity to build on the success of The Forest in terms of storytelling, resulting in a less compelling and emotionally resonant experience.

Graphically, Sons of the Forest impresses by accommodating a wide range of hardware, including older systems, without sacrificing visual quality. However, even on high-end machines, players may encounter occasional stutters and performance issues that, while not game-breaking, can be disruptive to the overall experience.

In conclusion, Sons of the Forest represents an upgrade in terms of gameplay when compared to its predecessor, The Forest. The survival mechanics and cooperative play options have seen improvements, offering a more refined and enjoyable experience. However, the narrative takes a step back, failing to capture the uniqueness that made The Forest stand out. The graphics, while accommodating older hardware, suffer from occasional stutters on more powerful systems. Despite its shortcomings, Sons of the Forest is recommendable for fans of the survival genre, particularly those who prioritize gameplay over narrative depth. The game's mixed bag of improvements and setbacks warrants a somewhat harsh 5/10 rating.",1677930612,1703948987,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

I'm perfectly happy with the quality and frames and everything but then the random freeze crash has left me not travelling further than 10min from a save point.

Now that it has an ending and you can play the full game I would say it has a pretty good story line and a good ending but you need to be paying attention otherwise the big picture is a little vague,however there are still a few minor things to be done before it gets out of early acces.

The graphics are really good but nothing more special than other games released in this era of super realistic details,I would say it's well optimized for early acces,I never had any crashes or lag spikes (I also have a high end PC).

Overall I'd say it's worth to play and it would keep you hooked for a while but it would be more fun to play it with some friends than just with Virginia and Kelvin.

The building back in The forest was very was and snappier and the blueprint system worked very well. In sons of the forest they are trying to make it more realistic which I appreciate, but in my opinion that takes the fun away from the game. The animations for putting logs are long and not as snappy, it just gets really boring really quick.

Pros:
- Graphics. Easily Better than the first game.
- Guns. Makes combat more versatile and allows for different approaches to enemy camps and base defense.
- Golf Carts/Knight V. Makes travelling easier and allows for funny moments and group travel in MP
- Seasons. Adds dynamic elements to the world and makes the world feel alive in an other wise dead map.
- Enemy Density. Found that I was being jumped by more than 5 enemies at some points and made the combat more fun.
- General Animations. Chopping limbs off and other role-playing animations make the game feel more immersive.
- NPC's. made delegating boring tasks and defending the base more fun.
- Demons: Fingers, Twins, Spider-Mans, and Slinky guy were cooler than the original Forest demons. 
- Cannibal Variation. fun to fight cannibals with different moves/armor/weapons. 

Cons:
- General instability/Load Times. Really slow and buggy at times (Although I don't have the best PC)
- Re-breather. Hate using this thing in caves and think it's not useful outside of them.
- Night-Vision. Make is clearer and have it use up more batteries.
- Inventory system/Storage System. Having a max of 10 ropes/X items and then having to store them on stupid ass shelves which takes so long is a horrible system. Simple Chests or a faster storage process needs to be implemented.
- Building System. No custom builds/foundations destroys creativity in building and limits Kelvins true potential. Long animations and overall build time being slower is more realistic but also bores the fuck out of me after an hour or 2.
- Food system/Drinking system. So many MRE's and Soda's which made hunting and eating cannibals practically useless.
- Lack of story outside of collectibles. More cut scenes or audio logs to give background would be better for overall interest in the story. 
- Hanging Skeletons/Bats. We can more creative Endnight cmon now.
- BIG and EMPTY map. Map is massive which is fun to traverse for the most part but my god there is basically nothing but trees for about 90% of it. More camps. More small caves that provide loot or less trees would make the exploration and discovery more satisfying. Mountain in the middle = bad traversal obstacle.
- Armor: Clothing and Armor is basically useless.
- Force uncomfortable encounters. We need to be forced into scary situations that test our skill as survivors. Have our flashlights go out or our guns jam when we are being surrounded to provide us with different approaches.
- Stealth system. Useless. Give us stealth take downs on normal cannibals and make stealth a true viable option to avoid cannibals.

Even with the cons list partially out weighing the pros I think that I can comfortable say that the game is a 8/10 and with the full release and another play through I can improve this rating. If you played the original you will def like this one.",1703830535,1703830535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

the game was great, and while it lasted, the ending could not have been more disappointing. 

Its the most rushed and just beyond confusing ending ever, the storyline makes no sense. Even though the map is 4 times larger than The Forest's map i found literally everything within 18 hours of gameplay. 

They did the same thing activision did the the black ops trillogy, it stopped being good after BO3 because it just got too easy, they give you the POIs to every single location and they show every cave within like a 1000-mile vicinity it feels like. 

I've said it again but please the ending is so bad, the whole game is empty, 90% of my gameplay is building a base where I didn't even do anything in as you have nothing to defend against, some cannibals and embarrassing ""mutants"" that die with one fire axe swing if you target it. Me and my friends spent about 3 hours trying to find something at the top of the maps, the only useful cave out of 3 caves, which we were given to with the free gps phone thing, we found one good cave and all that had was the door to the VIP keycard. However in the bottom/main part of the map we immediately found everything we needed, a rebreather, every gun, shovel, you name it. From a total beginner's POV if you didn't build a base or anything just focused completely on finishing the game you could genuinely finish this in about 3 hours. Everything is quite literally handed to you. 

In conclusion, huge cash grab, beyond rushed, developers were in molly while making this game, game-breaking glitches (i understand that as its just-released but you can duplicate things without even trying ) I dont believe endgame cared fully on the money but i wish they just delayed it for as long as it took just to get an enjoyable game, the seasons were cool, the building is amazing and killing kelvin is funny but it just feels empty.

I have more to say but it just isnt worth it, reading the reviews on this game is more enjoyable than even playing the game.

Worst £25 of my life i would have rathered to spend it on 5 big mac meals blend it all up and send it down my sink rather than play this.",1677288330,1703797533,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

I would like for them to add smaller islands in the ocean surrounding the main island bringing back boats for players to build and not just the same ones from the forest but new variations. The shovel mechanic is really fun but under used in the game I feel we should be able to make traps using the shovel & they really should focus on hiding items all over the map making the shovel more of a focus. Also there is not enough caves to explore. With this being the sequel to The Forest you would think there would be an enormous amount of caves making the caves from the first game look like Childs play. Also there's not enough crafting options so that needs to go way up. The map is huge but nowhere near enough points of interest to keep players occupied. The story is way to short and need to be expanded. Also cannibal camps are downright awful and feels rushed together. I like to be able to make poison weapons and to increase damage output like the forest. There's not enough enemy variety. And kalvin needs to be able to use weapons. You might as well say that every aspect of Sons of the forest needs to be improved in a big way... with the game getting ready to be fully released i cannot recommend buying it. its just to empty and little has changed since i made this review,1677434225,1703676667,False,0,0,0.47215580940246582,0,True,False,True

[h3] CONS: [/h3]
The game is prone to crashing so you could have spent a long time away from base gathering resources and the game crashes you loose a lot of progress. Also enemies do too much damage, on normal you die with two hits. (((HEAVY CANNIBAL ACTIVATE)))
Compared to the previous game crafting armour is way more difficult. You will have to find 'tape' and 'rope' from scarce boxes around the map in addition to burning enemies for bones. In the original game you only need cloth and bones which is easy to find, also luggage / boxes seem to be way more common.
I don't know if its just me but seems the island map is much bigger which makes it a pain to get around. Once you have a base and get food farming going [strike]its okay[/strike] some obese guys will come and ram headfirst into your buildings in an attempt to wreck. You thought you'd be fine in a tree house? SIKE toxic cannibals will come to your tree house and wreck.
You wanna fight them? 2 cannibal [b] bonks [/b] and you dead.

Sons of the Forest is a really unique game. I love the idea of a survival-based horror game where you end up on an island and strive to survive against the elements and cannibals who inhabit the island, and being able to build your own fortresses and bases out of your surroundings. It especially makes for a lot of entertaining and memorable moments with your friends. This game can be a little bit on the demanding side, so make sure you have the right specs to run it. SotF can also be a little challenging, especially for newcomers, but before long you'll eventually figure out where everything is and it won't be so bad anymore, and there is also a peaceful option (w/o enemies) if you want that. The only real gripe I have with SotF is with the ingame bugs, since they can be quite abundant, with clipping out of the map and weird object collision/disappearances being examples. However, I wouldn't let that stop you from having a good time, and in the end the game itself is enjoyable.

as a semi-dedicated fan of crafting survival and a completionist of the previous game its apparent the dedication that sons of the forest has to its world and gameplay, thus my need to comment. 

The abundance of equipment to utilise in game (something The Forest lacked) allows a broader way to play and fight throughout the game allowing for choice of playstyle and greater enjoyment, this compliments new and creepier enemies generously scattered around the environment that make the horror element it promises, realised and very present. The improved enemy designs and behaviours make the game far more intense that its predecessor, with touches of realism in passive and hostile creatures it makes the mobs feel more alive with more unique and individual movements, fighting and interacting with these creatures feels far more calculated and less mundane than the first game. (the inventory can get really messy so for management make sure to hover over an item and click a 1 through 10 to bind an item to a key, so you can quickly switch.)

Exploration is the heart of this game, writing this while still amidst the earlier stages of the game I can attest that progress in the game is at the pace that you set, while this type of gameplay doesn’t suit people who want to speed to the end, it allows for your own path through the vast world. With google telling me main story is “12 hours 45 mins” it doesn’t have a extensive story to drag people along, but it makes up for that fact with it being a crafting survival, navigating the world yourself is paramount to enjoying the game this way. As a person able to enable maximum graphics, the beauty of the world and the minute details it has in its environment that make you think “wow they didn’t need to add that but they did” is the exact reason I believe the map they’ve created deserves praise, changing seasons, beautiful water and natural landscape to admire while being chased for your life, just what everyone wants. Did it live up to its trailers? I can say it differs from the cinematic trailers that shocked us before release, but it does live up to them. It grants what was promised.

In terms of creation, and the grind that gamers seek so dearly sons of the forest has a more customisable building mechanic, still with the base blueprint fill in ability as the first game. Meaning, if you want large custom builds at unique angles or just want a pre-built home both are available, given you collect the copious amount of resources, naturally. As a player, I enjoy having the ability to have a level of organisation and protection, as if it’s a wave by wave defence on my base. But if you don’t care, then you don’t have to bother with many save points around the map making building merely an option for those who want to prolong their experience. 

While earlier versions may have lacked finesse and been unstable, a cause of distress, the game in its current state has improved and is in the last stages before being out of early access. Crashes for my higher end performing pc is no longer a plaguing issue as it was near release, however for those that may have lower specs save regularly as a precaution. The minor bugs make the game more fun, in my eyes, with the funky physics and clipping sometimes causing a laugh but nothing that inconveniences progress. 

Overall, despite imperfections as all games have, I believe that this game is worth buying and playing, especially with friends. For lovers of The forest, and lovers of open world crafting survival horror (I swear that’s not a niche as it sounds) give it a look over. I recommend this game, but that’s just my preference.

The map is huge. Too huge if you ask me, and the creation of it was not thought through in my opinion. Most of the important storyline places and cool POIs are on one side of the map while the other remains rather empty, unvisited and hard to reach because of the amount of walking it would take. There's a giant mountain in the middle that is dreadful to pass through by any means (glider/knight/sled and you'd have to be crazy to drive a golf cart there). The golf cart gets stuck on tiniest rocks, stick bushes and trees and destroys wooden player-made bridges ¬_¬ (and gets stuck on them too). The knight V trips over nothing on the beach. The best means to travel around the map fast is to cheat or make zipline towers but that's too much boring work (glider is cool but you need to get up high for it ofc).
I wish there was a way to mark things better like with colorful cloth sticks/icons in the Forest rather than the GPS tracker with limited pictures. Maybe customized signs with writing to point a way or mark a knight, radio or a pot would be a good idea too. I also wish we could make roads that'd stay on the map like the ones used by cannibal troops. I'd love to see more fauna. I miss aggressive/neutral animals like boars in the Forest. Could use some predators like wolves or bears in my opinion. I'd love to be able to collect different kinds of furs and make some decent clothing against the elements (winter jacket for winter season is terrible and has next to no resistance). 
You eat berries one at a time T_T It takes 5 minutes to sate hunger/water with all the berries in your inventory. Friends call me crazy for even eating them (and they're probably right). They should also give a bit more food imo. Same with shrooms.
There could be more things to build and more pot recipes. I'd love to be able to put things on a table. Especially something decorative that isn't a damn skull or other gore for once -_- Would love to be able to use the furs I mentioned earlier to decorate the chairs and make custom rugs (btw hide sofa blueprint still MIA).
I was hoping by the time it releases out of early access, we'd have more scary mutants instead of constant AI tweaks to cannibals that are basically 2 shot late game. I miss the Forests very aggressive mutant raids on our bases - that made the late game interesting. 
Caves are very well done - dark and creepy and filled with jumpscares. Wish that remained for the bunkers you go to revisit (killing all mutants there removes them forever atm). 
The main story is still kinda unclear if I look at it through eyes of a player that's never played SotF. I personally was just curious and kept digging for info and explanations on YT to actually understand it fully. 

I hope the game will still be worked on as it comes out of early access. I still feel like there could be so much more to it.",1677938877,1703541712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ok… now…

Being a HUGE fan of The Forest I am really missing hunting animals for their hide and having a main objective in the game which was to save Timmy. It was so amazing and fulfilling at the end when I beat it for the first time. An absolutely crazy ending, and the anticipation for the new game was substantial. 
I am finding this game to be quite boring. I really hope the game devs add a different objective other than… finding the billionaire and seeing the emails between him and his team randomly. 
I want more excitement in the story line since I’m not huge into building. I tried building a base with my friend and the cannibals got through the defensive wall every time. I could improve on my building but I felt The Forest was so much more user friendly. Also in The Forest the cannibals had very specific paths and you could build in certain places to avoid them. Here they seem to be running around everywhere with no real path.
The map is super empty as well. It’s like 3x bigger than the old map with virtually nothing in it.",1703505109,1703505109,False,62,5,0.64297795295715332,0,True,False,True

Honestly, you can run through the main story in about four hours. 
After that, all there is to do is base building. Once or twice a day between four and eight enemy NPC's will come to attack your base. Its usually the cannibals in the afternoon around 14:00 and two or three times a season at night around 23:00 the mutants come out. 
There's no hunting, in fact, there's barely any wildlife. No quests or side objectives, there is actually no reason to explore almost 80% of the map as all of the story objectives are on one side or 15 -20% of the map. They did spread the inventory items around the map a little better than they were for early release, but once you have them there is no reason to be on that side of the world unless you just want to be.
I wound up making a save where I flew around the map spawning thousands of extra enemies just to make it interesting for a fresh play through.

I do think this would be a great game for groups to play together, especially if one person is acting like a DM. 
Using the DEV Commands to summon enemies and adding or removing things.

Well i didn't expected to have finished product, because of course its a early access stage. Basically the progress seems similar to the The Forest, most of cutscenes and animation ( especially ending ) is still like in Alpha.

Design is overall good, same like gameplay, however there is some things that i miss from The Forest.

- The island of the Sons of the forest is unfortunately worse than The Forest island, at least for now.
Island itself is big, but mostly is empty and you have repetitive locations like abandoned camps or villages, they are not really unique to each other, exploring outside of the map seems boring, there is lack of The mystery of island and there is no really memorable or iconic places like for example sinkhole in The Forest.

- Some known features has disappeared, like for example log cart, some structure recipes or sickness, you don't need worry to get infected by drinking water from the river, because there is no even a feature to boil the water, there is also lack of the upgrading melee weapons. I know its early access, but for me it seems weird that something what was created before, couldn't appear in the next title

- I like the idea of having friends - kelvin seems useful sometimes but not in everything, his AI is a bit junky from the time to time, it would be nice if he get some of voice lines in future. Also character Virginia is quite interesting, however i see here a bit wasted potential letting her just randomly wandering near of your camp, it should have more interesting background view of this character, maybe some of unique quest, before getting her?

- Main Story line seems confusing - you are not sure when you exploring or progressing further, don't wanna spoil anything, but if you see ''Bronze metal doors with hand print on it'' its a final stage of the game, so if you think you didn't explore enough the game, just stay away from them.

However i enjoying playing it and I keep hoping that the final version will be better than the forest in every aspect.",1677498922,1703441205,True,184,3,0.846682965755462646,0,True,False,True

The game has had major biome overhauls and the caves have been extended and detailed with new hanging bodies, hidden pathways and more gore props to give them a scarier feel. The world outside of the caves is beautiful to look at and is full of cannibal camps, abandoned shacks, bunkers and random camp sites to loot. Though it could use more variety in the cannibal camps as they don't have a unique feel about them. With the updates we have got new types of cannibals that throw spears, others are armoured and some can pounce onto you in a flurry of melee attacks. Though my only complaint is they don't really have that scary feel they had from the first game and look to clean and short in appearance.

The game seems to think that there is a controller attached, while there is not. This Linux has an input remapper but it's not injecting anything. It has no profile set but it comes up in Steam's controller settings. Enabling/disabling Steam's controller support doesn't change anything.
If I plug in a controller, I can play the game with that and also access the options menu of the game. There is no way to turn off controller support/detection, or even look at the keyboard bindings. (EDIT: found out that while using the keyboard in the options menu, the keybindings flicker over the controller bindings, like mentioned below, but you can't change the controller bindings to keyboard bindings, it doesn't recognize the key input)
Once in the game, the mouse actually works and the keyboard as well, but the ui, of course, still thinks you are on a controller and shows controller key hints. When you press a keyboard key, it's own hint actually kinda glitches into the controller key hint and sometimes you can make out what key it wants you to press. However, once it wanted me to do some stuff in the inventory, wich I guessd was the ""i"" key, I was completely lost.
Inside the menu screen there is similar bevavior but it also includes the mouse. When you move it, it shows a pointer but it gets reset to the middle of the screen like every frame or so.

So for now I unfortunately won't play this. :(

EDIT2: If I understand my issue correctly, it might be resolved by uninstalling that pre-installed remapper. But since I plan to use similar remappers in the future, and no other game has this issue (only recently switched my main/gaming pc to Linux), this is a bad option. You should be able to disable controller detection in the game or force it to use kbd + mouse.",1703375866,1703378114,False,0,0,0.468464791774749756,0,True,False,True

Defenses need to actually do something, currently most enemies leap right over walls, that makes you not want to invest time building a base.

Plus we need more handgun bullets to be found, maybe 20% more. I find rifle/shotgun more than handgun currently. If you are solo and run into 3+ enemies it can be over for you.

Pros: Basically a vastly improved version of the first game. At least so far (I am in first part of game). The graphics are awesome. The tweaks to the building system are great.

There were many different things I found while playing... the slingshot wasn't very effective. lol The electric unicycle made a good escape from the cannibal camp after they took me prisoner. Built a tree house and a cannibal mutant destroyed the whole thing in one swing and dropped a ton of logs on my head. Went in some caves. Saw some creepy creatures that made me want to leave those caves.

Outside of that this game really sucks at being survival game. It doesn't promote surviving, instead you get all you need to survive from caves and building a base just means your shit is going to be destroyed pretty often. The controls, inventory and crafting are all really clunky for controller users. The world, while beautiful, feels very empty and sometimes doesn't work with the building causing you to spend 10 minutes trying to get something to place. My biggest complaint is the extremely outdated save system. There is ZERO auto-save and you have to manually save by building a bed or a trap tent. This has lead to me and friends losing entire days of progress due to crashes. 

Overall it isn't a bad game but every-time I play it I find myself getting frustrated with all the little stuff and putting it down for months at a time. Maybe buy it if you want to build but honestly it isn't good enough alone to sale this game.",1703252831,1703252831,False,5,1,0.517298400402069092,0,True,False,True

I am happy to say that 2 of the 3 issues have been resolved, and it is clear they will be adding even more content to keep you active. There are still some small issues, like poor controller support, and just minor jank that never got ironed out, but it is not enough to warrant a bad review.

I will say, that I think an emphasis needs to be made on creating a more active and connected community. Games live on for 2 big reasons: Open source code, and community cultivation. Endnight already said they will open up modding on full release, but the community for this game feels fractured, despite evidence of a large base. I think Endnight needs to add better matchmaking, and make it easy to find groups of people that are in the stage of the game you want to be in. The official discord needs overhauling and moderation so that activity is encouraged. Lastly, there needs to be better tools for server hosts/owners to police and control their games, so that trolls and griefers get filtered out as fast as possible.

I love this game, and all I want is more community. I am on the verge of starting one myself if Endnight doesn't start doing it. I want to play with people, but it is so hard to find groups. This game would be in my top 10 games of all time if they made it easy.

I like the achievements but with the lockups, crashes, overheats its unplayable.

Also NEEDS an autosave so when it does crash and lockup and whatever, you didn't just waste a whole heap if time and back to the last save at home.
Either you dont go far so you can keep saving or you need to make a new save camp every 10 mins, thats if your lucky enough for the game to last that long. I usually got about 5 mins before the console locked up, rebooted and died.

When its optimised for Steam Deck then I'll get it again. Till then its refunded.

I tried the latest with the FSR 2.0 update and that made it worse. Its still crashing every 5 mins with no warning. Just a sound glitch then the console locks up and reboots.
The temp isn't hot, its not even high usage. I was at 30fps and temp was in the 70s and usage was about 60% and it locked up.
That was at medium to low settings. If I put anything to high it instantly locks up.

Excellent base-building mechanics.
Intelligent AI behavior.
Well-balanced weaponry.
Cons:

Insufficient content in the later stages of the game.
Persistent bugs.
Scarcity of ammunition across the map.
The game loses momentum after the first winter, offering limited activities beyond expanding your base and sporadically defending against cannibal raids, which occur roughly every three days.

Additionally, the absence of AR-style weaponry is puzzling, considering the player's role as a PMC. Given the scenario of being deployed by a well-equipped private military company, the lack of modern firearms seems weird.
In summary, the game delivers an enjoyable experience up to the point of achieving self-sufficiency. Beyond that, the excitement fades due to a lack of compelling content.",1703209108,1703209108,True,55,2,0.804498970508575439,6,True,False,True

I'm happy with the regular updates that bring alot of the features that we saw in the original game The Forest. Lately, it seems the focus is to release more types of mutants that want to mutilate and potentially devour your corpse. I find it frustrating at times when I'm trying to build my base up, I am attacked only to end up on a pole at a cannibal camp, cutting myself free, I grab my survival pack and run back to base, and be attacked again unless i kill the hoard of menacing mutant meat munchers. The games cannibal dynamics are broken. At times I am knocked out and taken to the cannibal camp where I am greeted by cannibal's that want to InstaKill me as I try to make my escape towards my survival pack, only to be tied up again, WTF. The building dynamics are nice, but it would be nice to be able to build the stone walls like we were able to build rock walls in the first game. I need to piece makeshift stone walls around my base that conform to the terrain because you cant build contoured stone walls. Over all, the greatness of the game overrides the headaches of dealing with broken mob dynamics.

[h3]Graphics[/h3]
What can one say, it's beautiful, probably the best of all games. You need a powerful computer to handle it, but you definitely need to optimize it.
You could add ray-tracing, i.e. the icing on the cake.

Edit: They improved optimization compared to the post-launch version; now I get around 2 times more fps. They haven't added ray tracing yet, but they should, to make the game even more beautiful.

[h3]Map[/h3]
It's even big, a bit boring, there should be some random events. There are few caves, 3/4 of them are small and the rest are really well done and interesting.

Edit: They added more caves, interesting and large ones, but there aren't any where you can get lost, which is a shame. Surface villages are boring, and cannibals often appear in front of your eyes.

[h3]Mechanics[/h3]
The seasons are great, but they should be more fluid, the snow could fall and on the ground it should increase over time, as well as its melting.
Windstorms should break trees, and even badly erected structures should destroy them.

[h3]Kevin[/h3]
Great idea for him. He himself adds great publicity to the game. He's a bit silly, but he's cute and funny.

Edit: They added a bit more intelligence and commands to him, but sometimes he still doesn't know where to go, likes to walk through walls, and enjoys fishing for fish on the grass. They should add more human-like instincts to it, such as gathering food for itself, drinking and eating, adding wood to the fire, washing off blood, and so on.

[h3]Virgina[/h3]
They should add more human instincts, and also go for ammunition for weapons by itself. Currently, it takes ammunition and batteries out of nowhere.

[h3]Bugs[/h3]
There are few of them: copying logs when building, monsters that go through walls, Kevin who does not know where he is going or for what, Virgina who is lost.

Edit:They fixed most of the bugs, but sometimes the log sled likes to shoot into the sky, cannibals walking through walls, and Kevin and Virginia still have a tendency to get stuck and pass through walls.

[h3]Ideas what to add:[/h3]
Added food for farming (it's survival, after all) Cooking food on a bonfire, more interactions with Virginia, new caves, new settlements and map objects, new building objects, harder to get weapons and items.

Edit: They added things like cooking in a pot (I haven't figured out how it works yet), introduced new caves and storyline, and added new building structures.
They should add larger caves where you could get lost, introduce new cannibals (even though they said they wouldn't), and include more unexpected events in the world.

Updates are so far apart and the changes they make are so damn small. They have zero communication with the playerbase. Right now, getting this game is like throwing 30 dollars in the trash. 

This game is 6 months passed its release date, so saying ""this is early access"" is brain damage.

Edit: Stone is really amazing. But all of the issues are still present. I take back the 30 dollars in the trash statement. Get the game on discount, it's worth it then.

Edit 2: They added the Hokey Pokey trap and some other really cool things. But most of the main issues are still present. The length of time between updates progressively gets longer. Each subsequent update gains 7 extra days from the last. This game is STILL in EA with no roadmap or end in sight.

Edit 3: Despite the last update having landed, they haven't fixed any of the issues. You can make corner ramps now. Amazing. But the foundation still buries itself into the ground and doesnt allow you to build in certain directions still if you are trying to make a big base. And I don't mean massive, I mean more than 7x7. If you try to make a 9x9 or more, you will find the logs bury themselves into the earth and limit expansion. You will spend a LONG time building your base just to find out a section of it cannont be built because of this garbage design. Mobs still spawn inside your base and can clip through the walls. Kelvin still cannot pick up small stones. You expect me to run around and find hundreds of tiny rocks for arrows? Pass. Ammo is heavily limited, even outside of hardcore. Seasons change too fast. AI are still garbage, they get stuck on everything and if you build near water, you will eventually find them at the bottom of it. Kelvin still gets stuck inside of bases, ignoring obvious doors and openings. You have do deconstruct the entire wall just for him to realize he can exit and perform his tasks. Bodies still despawn in seconds. You can't even collect them onto the same fireplace without them just disappearing. I had a whole group of bodies despawn before they could burn into bones. If you are full on a resource, you will still try to pick it up even if you DO NOT WANT TO. Small rocks are the main issue. They are everywhere, and all you want to do is pick up a stick or a log and instead you juggle a stupid little pebble instead. They added a lot of traps and visual stuff, some new building features and world visuals. But they didn't fix the root issues.",1683047000,1703026569,False,3,0,0.443343579769134521,0,True,False,True

I loved the first game.  My group and I were eagerly looking for the second some to come out, and when it did, we pounced on it.

Sadly, the things that were expanded upon from the first game didn't add anything to the game, and other things in the game literally didn't matter.

As has been said in other posts... there is ZERO reason or need to build anything, or learn to cook anything as it adds nothing to the play strategy.

Where the first game had a ""figure it out as you go"" feel to it, which was fun, this game had a ""You pretty much know what you need to do if you played the first one so...   we're just going to make boring time sinks between the things you need to find""

It literally felt like ""OK so.. to progress, you're going to need.. THIS TOOL... where is it?  Out ""THERE"" (motions to the entire island)!"" ... and that's the whole game.

No linear drive, no plot/story development.. just... ""find.. the THING!""

What made it worse, was we were so eager we jumped right at the beginning.  Imagine spending $30 on a movie, you press play, and it's opening credits...  static... then closing credits...  only to find out 4 months from now there's going to be a SMALL piece of the story added to your movie that MIGHT make it worth the money you spent originally!

That's a terrible way to create a game.

This game is the perfect example of what a Early access game should be. Endnight released it and told people it was early access and told people they would be updating it and wanted feedback. They did that plus more. The game as it is now is 1000% better then what it was on Early Release. Everyone getting this game at release is in for a treat. Not only have they fixed things and added things that the community has wanted, they have done numerous bug fixes and quality of life fixes. Now onto the review.

This game is beautiful and an absolute blast to play. I have not really played with friends that much because they have been waiting for the full release. Almost all of my 156 hours have been solo. There is always something for me to do and find. Even if it is just walking around and looking at the beautiful graphics. I love this game and cant recommend it enough if you love exploration, survival, mystery, and horror. 

Something to be aware of. This game has a steep learning curve with the building. It is not like the forest. It will take some time to get used to it. Also this game is not for the squeamish. There is a lot of gore and violence. If you have played the original forest you have an idea of what i'm talking about. All things considered tho after playing this game i can not go back to the original forest and this game has climbed to the top as the best survival horror game imo.

S'good!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is far from a state which should reach paying customers - 8 years to learn how to inefficiently use the Unity engine. CPU Utilization is a joke.

Random events being triggered which are not happening to the player. Random gunshot sound effects, nobody nearby, day 2 on the beach landing site. The game is pretty in appearance and horrendous in execution.

The mandatory companion NPC 'Kelvin' while a novel idea, is broken, to the point of being a joke in memes now. They did not make a way for the NPC to identify a tree as 'off limits' to being destroyed if player assets are associated with it, literally breaking the use of those recipes for player-built assets. This is a laughable amateur error which should have prevented the devs from adding Kelvin to the game, or done their actual jobs and released the NPC in a functional manner which was not destructive to elements of the game offered to the player.

When in-game the 'days remaining until the next update' is just a 'Gone Fishing' sign and fat middle finger to paying customers but made okay under the guise of 'Early Access'.

Endnight and other devs following this common 'Early Access' money grab should  be embarrassed and ashamed.

I regret having done so and would recommend not giving Endnight a cent until they have a product worthy of asking the public to pay for it.",1677300623,1702957187,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Sons of The Forest was probably the game i was the most hyped for in 2023, and it did not disappoint at all. The game is absolutely gorgeous graphic wise. I feel like if the game was developed in Unreal Engine 5 though, it would've looked EVEN BETTER, and i was also sort of hoping for it to be on UE5 but its understandable why Endnight wouldn't want to do that, now that they've learned to master Unity.
The map is HUGE, like REALLY HUGE. That is not really a bad thing but the map is also somewhat empty. You can find an occasional campsite, maybe some ponds and lakes and of course, the bunkers (and the old huts on the east-side of the map). And not just that, i feel like the game doesn't really try and make you explore the map. Caves are shown on the map already, and so is the whole geography of it, although in a past update, they did make it so that you have to discover bunkers by having to find certain laptops, which i think was a good choice. I feel like Endnight should've put some radio towers around the map, or something of that sort, which you then have to activate and it will show you some points of interests and unfogs an area of the map (similar to far cry i guess?). It would maybe make for some cool moments, like if you'd just be walking through the forest, and you're completely lost but then see a radio tower in the distance, knowing that you'll actually be able to read the map now.
To finish off about the map part, The game has a few different types of trees but its mostly needle trees and very rarely you can find leaf trees. It would be really good for the map, if Endnight would add different types of forests/biomes into the game, like maybe a birch forest, some flat plains and stuff like that, which brings me to the next point, BUILDING.

The concept of Sons of The Forests building system is amazing, being able to place the logs you've chopped wherever you want. Unfortunately, that is not the case, or at least not for the most part.
Most of the time, you can just pick up your log, and choose wherever you want to place it. But once you've placed the first log down, you are very restricted to a grid. The Forest was also very known for its unique building system, and it gave you a freedom which other survival games didnt have. Sons of The Forest, sadly took away a lot of that freedom with the grid system that they've added. You can only make a square foundation, unless you use some sort of bugs and methods. In The Forest, you could make your foundation any shape, you could even try and make it somewhat circular. I feel like this can be fixed, by being able to turn the grid on and off. Of course there is more to it but since i don't know much about programming myself, I don't even know where you would begin. There are also some bugs that I've found with the building system, like if you wanted to make your rooms a little taller, by adding a quarter log on top of a full log, you can put a ceiling on it, but for some reason, the rain will still pass through the ceiling, same goes for the snow.
To make building more interesting, i think Endnight should/could add different wood types, that all look different and can maybe be used for different things. For example, you could use the birch logs to make thinner walls, since birch trees can be smaller then something like a pine tree.
Also, maybe having a paintbrush and a bucket to paint furniture and logs/rocks would make things look even more interesting.
Lastly about building, maybe some more prebuilt cabins and blueprints would be really cool, which Endnight is already doing anyways.

Caves are a slight downgrade from The Forest. While they look visually better, they still all look very similar. Many people have mentioned, how Endnight should add different types of caves, like maybe granite caves, limestone caves and so on would make cave exploring more interesting. But the biggest problem with the caves is the fact, that they are all disconnected. This is something that was so good about The Forest, the fact that all the caves were connected with each other and you could sometimes get lost sometimes. Of course, adding back the climbing pickaxe would help with that, and would also make spelunking more interesting.

Those are probably about the most important parts in my opinion, that Endnight could improve upon and also maybe add.
Nevertheless, i am REALLY hyped for the full release of Sons of The Forest and i know Endnight is cooking up something good!",1680433596,1702941659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am sure most people whenever they host, either griefers will come in and destroy your base or people come in with cheats because they think they are gods. But that isn't my issue. One of my other issues is joining lobbies. If you are lucky, you may find some lobbies that will accept you and play together. Unlike some open lobbies where you can join in and either the host will ban or kick you, even when you haven't reached past the skip scene. Now of course you can host or own world or play single player but I myself and others enjoy playing with other players. What irritates me the most is when people have open lobbies where you can join them, but then kick you right on the spot. If they are already playing with someone and don't want anyone else, that is fine. Just make a fucking private lobby if you don't want people joining your world and invite the ones you want to play with. I hate wasting my fucking time trying to find someone to play with. They just are the dumbest fucking players I have ever seen.

[b] Rating: 9.0/10.0[/b]

Summary: I completed Sons of Forest and left the island on normal mode, so I may not have full context, but ready to write a review. It feels like a survival game, and seem to force player to be resourceful and rely on crafting to survive. Ammo for guns, grenades and bombs are less plentiful, and I often had to rely on crossbows and explosive arrows to get the job done. Each enemy feels meaningful and threatening, as they could potential end any game if not careful. The island is full of cannibals and other disgusting monsters. Sometimes the cannibals come from nowhere while you are cooking something, and I might have had to run for my life. There are NPCs that are helpful, and many caves to explore. As I explored, I also felt myself to be more powerful and sustainable. It feels like an adventure. I did not play ""The forest"" which this game is the sequel to, and perhaps now it is the time to try it out. Also, this is an early access game, so a lot of things may still be patched.

 

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] Surviving on the local fauna and critters feels like you can self-sustain yourself
[*] Crafting is fun. They are not redundant, and can help make a difference in survival, which I tend to see less in other games.
[*] You feel like a survivor in the forest as you pick up stones, sticks and plants which can be edible or not.. 
[*] Guns feels powerful, especially as you collect the more poweful ones and you can choose to bring them out at the critical moments like boss fights.
[*] Bows are especially fun to play with, and can help you fend off irritating cannibals with a variety of arrow types.
[*] Local cannibals are exciting to deal with, as they can be very menacing when in big numbers and living in proximity to camps you set up.
[*] Game feels like a mystery if you are into such things. How did the cannibals and mutants came about, why there are so many dead people on the island, etc.
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] The quality and sound of guns is a bit inadequate as compared to what I hear from other games. 
[*] Selection of items feel too clunky if I had to go to the menu, or manually assign numbers all the time within inventory. This is especially while fighting enemies, since I often end up not knowing where to reach for that Molotov when I need it. Can use a UI improvement.
[*] Guns are also hard to aim, like other weapons, but I feel that's part of game design. However it makes a little less sense for why a pistol have good aim but not a shotgun with sights. Perhaps this will be patched.
[*] Some of the notes seem a bit too cryptic or useless, but I also do not know if they are supposed to be by design.
[*] The friendly NPCs can be useful but even if they are by design very docile, I don't understand how they can just sit around cowering when cannibals are threatening all our lives.
[*] Cannibals feel a bit overpowered and feels like they spawn out of nowhere and in unlimited quantities. This may depend on the difficulty, though.
[*] Torchlight and night vision googles can feel more useful. Especially night googles feel a bit too dark in caves, and don't really help you see any better than simple torches. 
[*] Nit: How come those camping tents cannot be reused by compression? Maybe game balance, but too unrealistic considering other aspects of the game.
[*] The game can make you feel extremely lost, and without adequate time, you might not know what to do next. When you are stuck: [spoiler] go look for the following: 1) maintenance card ; 2) VIP card; 3) golden armor. You have to find (1) and (2) in bunkers, and you have to find the golden armor in some cave. Try to explore each cave a bit more so you could find critical items like rifle, can-opener and other things like re-breathers and grappling hook. The internet is full of guidelines as to how you can find them , like: [url=https://sonsoftheforest.fandom.com/wiki/Sons_of_the_Forest_Wiki] Sons of forest wiki [/url] Good luck! [/spoiler]

They are way too much and there's no way limit the quantity, they constantly spawn and slap you to death?? For some reason an axe does zero damage against their bare hands. 
It's also really hard to keep your health up, so it's a constant cycle of being ambushed by illogically strong cannibals, dying and having your base ruined.

This game....i guess your character is some ""cosplay"" anime girl or something PRETENDING to be a ""soldier"" because NO soldier (that i've ever known) was this weak, this incapable, this EASY to put down.

 You attack the warriors and stab and stab and stab and they just keep coming and knock you out in ONE hit. WTF?!? Why don't they just put a dress on you and @#$% you because your character, compared to these (must be) SUPER-HUMAN warriors, is SO weak.

You have a spear and you're BARELY a match for the women in the game. WTF?!?

I definitely feel like this game is weaker in terms of gameplay. While this game has beautiful graphics, an awesome AI system, and provides better building utility, it is lacking something to make it spark. I think it's awesome that Endnight Games wants to make a more proactive approach towards survival. They give you a guide on how to build and you have to follow the guide to make it work. But going through the guide is a little confusing. I think that The Forest had a much better guide, where it was easy to find everything you needed. I also wish they kept some crafting mechanics, like making snow boots or something. It kind of saddens me that animal hide isn't too necessary anymore. 

I also don't like the unnecessary details and slow scroll through the inventory. In The Forest, everything is done quickly, where you don't have to watch your person assemble bone armor, molotovs, etc. In SOTF, you have to view EVERYTHING. While it makes it more immersive, I feel that it is unnecessary. It takes a lot of time and with the amount of time it takes to scroll through your inventory, craft, and then go out your inventory, you're probably half-way dead, if not dead already. And why aren't there anymore hotkeys for your inventory??? I miss those; please bring it back! While I understand that you can just hold the I key and equip a weapon, you can only have 2 slots for weapons on it and it's not enough. I also want to quickly access other items while I'm running, not stop and hold I and pray that a cannibal will one-shot me in my attempt to switch out my weapon or heal myself. 

With all of that said, I actually like this game and I do like that it is much more difficult than The Forest. I really enjoy the unique AI features and the difference in behavior between different cannibal tribes. It's not a complete game, so I'm looking forward to seeing what is coming in the future!

I just want to wind down and build something in your beautiful landscape.

IT IS IMMENSELY TEDIOUS TO DO SO.

It's almost like you want gamers like myself to hate you.

Just let me build freely. Put a creative mode it. YES- I KNOW THERE ARE MODS FOR THIS.

It's disappointing.

Want to place a stone/wood floor? Even at your quickest, it takes 1-3 minutes just to fill out a single f**** floor panel. There should really be an option to bllueprint-select a;

 FLOOR PANEL. WALL PANEL. STAIRs/RAMP.

I love the new ""freedom"" to build. But it is limited by it's own lack of angular precision. 

BRING BACK MODULAR BLUEPRINT PLACEMENTS

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.

STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking

I don't play this game for the story line.  I like to build bases and ziplines all over the map. It is a creative outlet that is so much fun. Compared with the Forest, some of the tedium is removed with Kelvin. He is useful, especially with the new ""maintain base"" command. 

I have a large base (just sayin')  that is surrounded by a stone wall. Parts of the stone wall is also surrounded (nearly) by an electric fence. Its so much fun toying with enemies at the fenceline. Its very satisfying seeing them fry.

After nearly 400 hours, I'm maybe 1/2 way through the story line. This is the weakest part of the game. It is not really that interesting to me and you only do it to get better weapons. However, I get by with stone arrows and the shotgun if I'm gang attacked. You don't have to go far in the story to get the shotgun. (I thought it would be good to get the crossbow, but meh.) 

For my play style I like the game mostly as is. But I think there could be improvements. I think it would be better if some of the items were necessary for progress, e.g. some enemies can only be killed easily by fire, spears or the crossbow because of armour. Or, if you needed to learn a skill such as rope bridge building to cross a path to a critical item or place. I think you should have to earn a lot of the weapons by finding blueprints or the weapon its self. Too many are just given to you. And, it would be more challenging if the enemies learned how to make better armour through the game and therefore became harder to kill. Essentially, the easier levels should get a bit harder as you go along. Perhaps hard should remain the same.

  
TIPS. 

There are two ways to create a safety zone. 
1. Build stone walls or log spike walls (two layers of logs thick). The enemies can't bust through these as a general rule (you may get a freak event where several attack a wall and bust through but its the exception). Adding electric fences makes for additional fun. You can watch enemies die and then go collect stuff. Deer run into them and die. Add traps in your base for fun, but they are also not necessary.
2. Enemies drown. build a base or platform over deep lake water but just the right distance from the shore. When attacked, retreat to the platform. Enemies will try to follow you and will drown. You can have a lot of fun with this.  

Most enemies cannot jump electric fences. To keep everything out you just build extra height to the fence (above the electrified bottom rungs). To get out of the base you need to build a zip-line to get over your perimeter fence. Virginia and Kelvin find their way across electric fences, taking some damage but not dying.

The swat traps are great for taking out babies. Fun to watch. 

You can eat food raw and you are fine. Put it on a drying rack if you want it to keep longer.

Use hotkeys for all your main weapons and healing/energy mixes. 

***To enjoy the game, you need to teach yourself how to build with logs***. For building, read the survival guide carefully. It shows you a lot in pictures. Teach yourself to build flat platforms on uneven ground. Start at the lower ground and build toward higher ground. This is easier. Put in a pillar, then add a log at 45 degrees sloping down. This only works if it slopes down to higher ground or the same level. Use the game feature of placing a log under the end of the sloped down log. The game will cut the new upright log to size.  When working from high to low ground it's trickier. You need to place a pillar log on the high ground then use two logs on the lower ground. After placing a pillar on high ground, place one pillar on the lower ground at a suitable distance from the uphill pillar. Then, use your eye to cut it to the same height as the base of the uphill pillar. Then you add another log on top of the cut pillar, and place a cross-beam that will be level.",1701903676,1702449802,True,1,0,0.501940488815307617,0,True,False,True

Let's start with the great things about this game!

- Rotating seasons creates A LOT of diversity within the game
- The new AI system VAIL is extremely intimidating making the game a really fun challenge
- The graphics are phenomenal
- Improvements of certain mechanics that were in the last installment

Unfortunately that ends there and as this game sits I cannot recommend it. So I figured I would come here to share some thoughts and feedback for Sons of The Forest's.

I wanted to start with an item that has created a lot of displeasure in multiplayer sessions. Upon getting knocked down by an enemy, if a teammate revives you, you can get knocked down AGAIN quicker than you can get out of the animation, leading to very annoying and very aggravating sequences of getting knocked down 2, 3, 4, even 7 times in a row before being able to get away from the enemy. You are not given any protection while locked in the animation. Another is that upon being revived you DO NOT get up with your last used weapon. Leaving to a very aggravating dance of trying to get into the slow inventory system to get your weapon back out.

[strike]Moving onto bugs, there is a very weird water rebound bug with loose logs. If you throw logs or if logs fall into a body of water they will bounce (sometimes to the stratosphere), kind of like Black Ops 2 launch day care package bouncing. Another agitating bug is one where you get injured and then you are no longer able to access your inventory without being knocked down.[/strike]

Now for necessary quality of life changes that have to happen. Decrease enemy hitboxes. I am so tired of hitting spooky's or regular mutants from behind and getting knocked down if they swing in any direction that isn't my own. It happens ALL THE TIME. [strike]Another is the lack of a log sled. Now, the log sled doesn't have to carry nearly as much as it did in the last entry, but we need SOMETHING. Maybe it wasn't added due to collision issues that were prevalent in The Forest, but we certainly need something. Also, GIVE US BACK THE ABILITY TO BIND OUR NUM ROW TO WEAPONS WE CHOOSE.[/strike]

Now with all of that being said, I am hoping that with updates and additions to this game that it will change my review but as of this moment I cannot give it a good review. I hope that Endnight takes advantage of this Early Access and brings content in a reasonable time manner.

EDIT 02/28/2023 Number Row Binding has been added in Hotfix #2

Love the building concept and fighting and crafting. But i wish there were more markers on the map. and fast travel cuz all I have is a electric one wheel scooter. The horror part is def there AND after surviving in the wild and building you forget there are enemies until they invade your base or a chainsaw man pops out the woods lol (was hoping i could take the chainsaw from him after i loaded him with bullets). Highly recommend if you are looking for survival/horror game to play. Just doesn't feel safe with my mental health lol.

Some friends started a server and inspired me to play, but I honestly have just as much fun playing by myself as I do with others. The atmosphere is terrifying. The dark is DARK and if you don't know what you're doing, things can get rough for a while. 

The game is gorgeous. The building (while kind of janky - again, early access!) of bases is really fun, trying to strategize what areas would make good spots and what spots seem good, but are actually awful. The cannibal AI is complex and adaptive, which really just makes the game feel that much more real. I can't express how terrifying I find the caves - especially because most light sources don't equip with good defensive weapons.

Awesome game. I don't know why that one wacko reply said the island is empty, it isn't. It is massive, but once you find one of the knights, exploring becomes so much easier. There is a ton of scattered camps, crashed things, buildings, caves, bunkers. They're spread out, sure, but it's an island. You should have to work a bit to get to point A to point B.

I love playing abandoned survival games like this one.. something about exploring the forcibly abandoned is so fun to me. Especially because there's evil things lurking in the dark.

To new players that want hints: Make armor. You can learn how to craft things by right clicking on a material in your inventory and hovering over the gear, it will show you what you can make. This game got much easier when I figured out how to make armor. Don't attack the cannibals day one or two, they'll leave you alone (the crawling ones being the exception but you can kill them). Only fight when you have to. Build defensive walls, and choose where to build CAREFULLY! Natural defenses are so helpful. Stone walls work better than Wood ones. Use Kelvin!

(Spoilers)
To the devs: You all are awesome. My only wish is to get to explore more of that beautifully abandoned resort. I love what I have explored so far and I can't wait to see this game when it is finished. Also, the story feels very vague and easily missed. I felt very confused in the end, like I had missed a ton. Fabulous job either way. Thank you for this game!!",1702427391,1702427391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The overhauled building system is good it allows you to build what you want with no constraints.  The crafting animations are good and the additions of the guns is amazing they are not overpowered and the scarcity of ammo make you save them for fights against big mutants.  It’s easy to have 100 9mm ammo then enter a cave and leave with 7.  This is an amazing 2nd game to the forest and I would totally recommend it.  It is easy to pour hours into this game in a single session
