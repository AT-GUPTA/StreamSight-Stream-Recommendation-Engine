It feels like there's a lot of bother here and there but the feeling of the game and how it scares the player lead me to forget about the Steam Refund policy (2 HR limit).

I believe the game needs a little bit of reworking around how the enemies AI react to the environment and players. I think something like proximity chat for this game would make the mechanic of interacting with enemies much more immersive. I PERSONALLY believe finding candles should feel a little more daunting. So I believe a difficulty increase via something like puzzles to be able to light the candles would make unique aspects to the game!

Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself but larger and new maps for this game would be a great addition. Overall however, this is such a great start to a game with decent potential!

We pretty much traverse a school while scavenging for supplies in order to escape it. It also features a perk system for ur survivors. The graphics are solid and the atmosphere is quite creepy. The mannequin like creatures are definitely a good choice for a school setting. Doesn't hurt that the price tag is not bad either.
