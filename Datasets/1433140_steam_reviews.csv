Johnny can hit you a mile away, this is a bug since release not yet fixed, This was confirmed on the reddit where the devs confirmed this. Countless buffs to killer, countless nerf to survivors.

I see lots of people complaining about not enough DLC or something. I don't really know what they're expecting from a game based on a single movie about a very specific storyline. Games like DBD will always have tons more content because it's a bunch of random horror crap for horror fanatics. Completely ridiculous stuff like Chucky killing people in the space ship from Alien. But Texas Chain Saw Massacre actually has an artistic vision. It's a great mix between feeling you're in a movie and in a video game. I LIKE that the devs don't do silly stuff like Twitch streamer cosmetics or holiday events.

People asked for the grandpa cutscene to get removed. It got removed. People asked for bone shards to be limited so victims couldn't stun family forever. They did that. And there's plenty of other fixes/changes they made because the players asked. These negative reviews talk about the game like it's unplayable and abandoned by its devs. The modern gaming community has gotten very ungrateful, entitled, and bratty. If you see an issue, reach out to the devs or publisher. If enough people have that issue they will do something. If you have an idea post about it in their forums. You don't have to go giving bad reviews and trash talking them on social media because of a glitch or because a cosmetic doesn't look a certain way.
All that out of the way the game suffers from a very noticeable flaw. It bills itself as 3v4 but if leatherface is in the family then 50% chance a victim is killed immediately at the beginning.

F13 lasted years and only within months this games future is looking very bleak. I still love this game more than F13 though.

Edit: The devs were absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to this beautiful game, ironically... I did all I can to support this game. I played since Day 1 and bought every mediocre DLC. Now i'm kinda looking forward to when they announce they are shutting this game down. It will probably happen this year or next. It will be kind of bittersweet. I never wanted it but I think it's what it deserves. Wes and Matt seriously ruin the reputation of this game so much

EDIT 02/22/24: With recent updates, lobbies have been smoother.

Don't buy this scamware it's going to be the exact same as Friday 13. Keltner is going to milk this community like his wife milks my cock and then he'll make another half baked movie adaptation bullshit to scam more people.

TIP FOR FAMILY PLAYERS: If you're willing to fund crap interactive then get Nancy. She's like release day sissy. You don't even need to sprint to keep up with victims, just hit them once and they'll be stuck in place due to your poison. (Who would've thought they'd make the paid killer OP when their game is almost already dead xD)
Johnny is also still OP since he can easily 3 shot any 30 toughness victims, even if all of the whiny crybabies on this game subreddits would want you to belive otherwise.

UPDATE4.1:
Struggle mechanics are currently bugged. Some characters have an ability to insta-win struggles in a second, both on victim and family side. You can insta-lose a struggle game to a sissy as a full HP Leland with 50 strength!

UPDATE4:
Never ever sneak attack. Most of the time you'll teleport in front of the killer and die in a struggle instantly (because killer struggle got buffed or is bugged?) Wes Keltner will probably tell you that's because you don't have your internet cable plugged directly into your cerebral cortex.
(Feel free to scroll down to the bottom, almost all of the bugs I noted on release are still in the game. SIC!)

UPDATE3:
New update only fixed minor graphical bugs, most game breaking bugs are still in the game such as bubba chainsaw overheat cancel, killers having attack range that's two times as large as it looks and many other bugs like that. Nothing changed except the victims get ""tagged"" for almost any action they perform giving family wallhacks.
Also they are extremely scummy when it comes to announcing changes. They said they'd add and tinker with perks... and it was only technically true because only the DLC characters got any new stuff. Glad to see game still has game breaking bugs while they continue to push that 10$ per character crap

UPDATE2:
Game is still an awful buggy mess and Keltner company is more concerned about selling 20$ skins than fixing this game. Instead of investing money into the game he invests in some shitty merch and chinesee TVs (Hisense)

UPDATE:
dead game, devs removed crossplay because their anti-cheat is shit and they just keep being passive aggressive about PC players being all cheaters




The game is buggier than it was 2 months ago during the beta test

(Adding to this list as I play. Most of these things get completely ignored by devs)
5 days after release:
- no roadmap
- no updates
- bugs bugs bugs
- credentials invalid
- PhysX crash
- interaction points disappearing
- interaction points not working
- character randomly stops running and crouches getting you killed
- F button mash minigame (macro goes brrrrrrrrrrrrr)
- When struggling with a killer another killer can come and insta-kill you (huge risk for small reward but ok I guess), however you can also just get insta killed by losing a button mash minigame, even if they don't get any help XD
- ""Press LMB to sneak attack"" > enters a struggle instead... > You'll likely die due to another killer grabbing you
- Sissy (her base slowdown on hit is so strong she can stop sprinting and regenate stamina AND still close distance to you)
- No stats cap. You can level utility killers into ""killing killers"" meaning that killers like Sissy can both poison you AND deal Leatherface-level damage
- The bleedout mechanic makes absolutely no sense. Sometimes you bleed out when sprinting, sometimes when stationary. It's insane how many games I've lost because the game decided I won't be bleeding out until I start a chase and then I just randomly drop to the ground
- Killer animations are desynced (killers can get multiple hits in one attack animation, or there's something else going on that the game doesn't care to explain)
- Killers get pulled to victims when they attack. Sometimes they don't even need to sprint or move. They can just spam LMB and keep up with a victim",1692636696,1708489161,False,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

[16-2-2024] Edit after 100+ hours in this game:

When I got this game at launch, it was truly an absolute joy for me to play, and in all honesty, I can still squeeze some joy here and there out of this soured lemon. However, the game is currently in an extremely buggy state and I'm very disappointed in the attention it has received from the devs in the past few months. Not only is the game very unbalanced in many aspects, but many of the changes the devs have applied via patches are simply mindboggling. Buffing characters that no one said needed buffing and nerfing characters that no one claimed to be overpowered. It's like they just throw a dart in the office at a board filled with bad ideas written on postnotes and whatever they hit, they apply.
I mean, they completely skipped Halloween AND Christmas in 2023, not even popping a little christmas hat on grandpa's noggin. Talking about grinchin' a game... yeesh...",1692538064,1708125258,False,0,0,0.556891143321990967,0,True,False,False

However if you have a 3-4 man party to play it with, go knock yourself out, you'll probably enjoy it better.

UPDATE 15/02/2024

Game still bad. Developers are getting worse in all aspects. They keep adding more DLC than fixing their game and surprisingly enough they both take weeks to months to do for some reason, part of their big patch involved 3 bullet points stating they fixed a typo in Nancy's biography.... what? Real glad they patched that out and took months to do so, saved the game with that one!

First and foremost, this game is not beginner-friendly. New players are at a severe disadvantage due to the necessity of leveling up perks and gaining map knowledge. While seasoned players enjoy the benefits of fully upgraded perks, newcomers are left struggling for at least 6 hours, putting them at a significant disadvantage from the outset.

Moreover, the developers' behavior towards negative feedback is unacceptable. Instead of addressing constructive criticism, they choose to attack players on their subreddit, dismissing valuable input and fostering a toxic community environment.

Another glaring issue is the sluggish pace of updates. Waiting up to two months for an update is frustrating, especially when crucial issues remain unaddressed. Additionally, the lack of communication from the developers further exacerbates player frustration and disconnect.

The limited roadmap, only extending until August 2024, raises concerns about the game's longevity as a live service title. Charging $40 for a game with such a short-term roadmap feels unjustifiable, particularly when considering the myriad of unresolved issues and lack of transparency.

Furthermore, the introduction of pay-to-win characters adds insult to injury. Characters like Danny, priced at $10 each, offer significant gameplay advantages, creating an uneven playing field. The reliance on such characters for essential tasks, like opening the fuse and pressure gate, further undermines the game's integrity and fairness.

In summary, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game fails to deliver a satisfactory experience due to its steep learning curve, developer hostility towards feedback, slow updates, lack of communication, short-term roadmap, and pay-to-win mechanics. As such, I cannot recommend this game to others.",1707939066,1707939066,False,163,9,0.855767965316772461,0,True,False,False

Old Review: THEY DISABLED CROSSPLAY FOR PC BECAUSE THEIR ANTI-CHEAT IS TRASH. 0/10  game now, avoid if you have console friends.


IGNORE BELOW THE LINE
------------------------------------
Eh, fix the bugs and we'll talk.

Fun game, but I wouldn't suggest it if you're not used to a buggy game. 

Bugs you may ask?

Victim:
- Can't vault, crawl or well sometimes

- Lelands power says he CANNOT shoulder bash Leatherface. But what can he do? Shoulder bash Leatherface.

Both:
- E key stops working sometimes

- Disconnecting from server

- Game crashes because they don't let you actually lock your FPS without V-Sync.

Killer:
- Victims can spam doors non-stop, meaning you can get stunned locked forever if another killer doesn't help you.

- Get stuck in the wall.


Not a bug but very annoying:
- Johnny on gas station with cook, both spawn on the same side of the map. Meaning you now have to run across the map to get to car battery. I'm assuming it's the same on Slaughterhouse.

- Hitchhiker and Sissy spawn by gen instead of car battery on Family House, why? There's nothing to do at the gen. So now you have to run all the way to battery, turn it all, and go inside, to then PLACE your traps. Chances are, victims are already moving around inside so it's harder finding time to place traps.

Suggestions:
- FPS limiter, not V-Sync. I don't need to play on 144fps when your game cannot constantly stay at 144 and drops frames like crazy. I'd gladly drop down to 60fps to stop the framerate drop.

- Optimize the game better. I took it off of 4k, which is fine, but I should NOT be lagging sometimes with being on 1080p. 

- Let cook padlock doors that have been lock picked. Literally, what do pad locks do? Lock doors. I don't understand why you cannot pad lock doors that have been opened....

- Skins for killers that AREN'T leatherface ffs. I'm not sure why survivors have multiple recolors and yet we can't get any recolors for killer??? The fact that the next update has ''bloody skins'' is eh and yet leatherface is getting ANOTHER skin already is actually jokes.

- Make fusebox a bit harder?? Shouldn't be the fastest AND easiest way to escape. Also maybe allow Cook to padlock fusebox? They do it IRL, and if this game is based off of IRL / movie, then why not make it more realistic? 

- Add more DLC for cosmetics / executions, let us support the game more ^_^ 

Like I said, it's a fun game when it works properly and no one is abusing the bugs [like hitchhikers trap to glitch survivors]. I'm sure my review will change again, it was positive before endless bugs kept happening.",1692455293,1707775735,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

- There are more bugs now, like ones that will prevent you from even moving. Not server issue since everyone else would still be playing, but literally just stops you from playing at all. I had it happen to me THREE times in a row. cmon. I sat through lobby simulator three times for the same bug to happen. All three times were on Nancy's house.Then two matches later, I find a Leeland who got the same bug.

- Grandpa mechanics feel unfair. As family member, you can level up grandpa in literally less than a minute. As victim, you have no idea where Grandpa is, and then you suddenly get the message ""Grandpa at maximum there is nowhere left to hide"" before you can even find him to do anything about it. At least Highlight Grandpa for victim when he screams, when grandpa wakes up, make the wake up scene a small video that plays in the left-hand corner. Victims need something to help them locate him in time to be able to actually fight back.

- Victim is way too hard now solo. Only play victim if you have friends to play with you or else youll get annoyed of being curb stomped every match. You get killed in about 3 hits ( im exaggerating a bit, but it feel like it without no sell perk, and everyone using poison claws), everyone runs poison (most annoying perk/power in the game) youll get one shot by Bubba, and annoying bugs make teammates have to quit so they can play.

- DLC for characters is way to much. buying victim and family member is half the price of the game, it just doesnt sit right with me paying $10 each. cosmetics are expensive as well, where its just one outfit, with multiple re-colors. Like, I paid $5 (which they want per character, pretty greedy ngl), can i at least get more unique outfits, or at least mix and match clothing?

- I hate the perk tree, so so much. you will spend alot of time re-rolling everything to get the perks that you want. Just, I wish theyd replace it with something else. Maybe a tier system where you lvl up and unlock perks once enough points are invested, and whats unlocked is random until you unlock all tiers. NO ONE WANTS to spend an hour trying to make a build, do you hear me Gun interactive!!? Delete the effing skill tree!

- Danny is kind of a pay to win character. Once you lvl him up completely, he can instantly get knowledge and then instantly open valve, fuse box, turn off gen, battery, etc. it sucks going to valve and not being able to turn it off. Theres just no counter play atm, at least with Connie's ability you can re-lock an entrance with a padlock from Cook. And some of his perks like ""fast hands"" is broken. Once leveled up, fast hands is basically Connie's base ability. Yes, Danny is better than Connie. 

- Nothing to grind for. Theres nothing really to unlock, besides lore. I dont get a feeling of accomplishment from leveling up, No one is even able to see your lvl anymore (they did this to help combat lobby dodging) just nothing really. I hope they add something in the future, I want to feel like im working towards something. ive already lvd up my victims and family members. 

- Players rage quitting the game. I think there should be a DC penalty when leaving a match prematurely. If you dont like how a match is going, you can just leave, and theres no incentive not to. Ive had family members rage quit to where im all alone against victims that wont leave, to half my victims team leaving 1 min into a match. Its demoralizing on the receiving end. You just want to play, but some people will only stay if the match is going their way. 

This game can be special, and very fun. Its authenticity to the franchise is amazing. The atmosphere is great. I love the interactions between the family and the victims. Most matches dont feel the same as the last one you played. Its just these things that are holding it back in my opinion. And the Devs dont seem to care, theyd rather push out expensive DLC than unlockables, troll online rather than balance dlc characters, and roll out updates that make no sense. Why not just shorten victim win animation instead of no insta kill? they didnt fix the lobby issues, all they did was hide it from view, lobby will STILL CLOSE once timer ends. 

edit: I think I give up on trying to play this game. I had such high hopes, I played this on day one, and loved it, but they dont know how to balance their game-play. Updates take WAY too long, playing victim feels unfair, and playing Family feels way too easy. until there's some kind of massive miracle update, i'm keeping game uninstalled, good luck everyone else.",1692595885,1707686982,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is in a dying state and the devs didn't even fix the lobby problems. In recent patch notes, they said they got rid of the lobby timer but they just removed us from seeing it.

 Definitely not worth $40. There are super prominent issues and bugs that do not get fixed for long periods of time, horrendous developer decisions that impact the way the game is played, overpriced DLC that so far has been fairly pay-to-win, and a dwindling playerbase due to all this, making getting into a match a chore as well. 

I have no idea where to begin with prominent issues, there have been SO many since I started playing this game on release. Some get fixed here and there, others get ignored for months, and new ones seem to pop up every patch. Remedies to some of these are completely mind-boggling sometimes as well. 

Some examples of issues include: 
- Pressure Valve taking a long time to turn off as family, almost instant activation as victims, and no regression to punish victims. This has FINALLY been remedied in a good way as of last week-ish, family doesn't take as long to deactivate and victims need to spend more time activating, and it now regresses when it's turned off.
- Johnny, started off as a weaker member of the family at C+ to B- tier, has been nerfed time and time again into his current state of unplayability, now unironically making him D to F tier. The devs are calling it ""fixes"" to Johnny's ""bugs,"" however, they nerfed his power (why???) and killed his lunge attack, which made him a pretty scary family member to have to chase against because he could catch up quite well and did considerable damage, but now he stops dead in his tracks a lot when attacking.
-   Blood trails being buffed on console over PC. For some reason, console had really well working blood trails when family injured victims, and victims could bleed quite a bit, allowing for family to retain chase easier. However, PC did not see trails, but instead, droplets of blood every now and then, which made chasing harder for PC for no reason. So the devs must have fixed this for PC, right? Nope, console now has the awful blood trails that PC has too, which could be seen as intended... if the family members didn't voice line at random, empty areas indicating that they've seen a blood trail, making it seem that the original intention was to have console's blood trails on all platforms.
- Hitchhiker traps at ladders used to bug out the victim to not be able to go through cracks or crawlspaces, so instead of fixing the bug, Hitchhiker is no longer allowed to trap ladders, as there's an invisible area in front of ladders that block trap placement. 

If you notice, there's a trend of straight up removing features and mechanics that should absolutely stay, but since there's a slight problem with what they are connected to, they have to go. There are way, WAY too many issues, both to list here and because I'm getting fatigued. These are just 4 out of dozens, and these aren't even the worst ones. The point was more that developers are not understanding their game.

The game was incredibly fun at first, but like some other multiplayer games that have been ruined for me (random example: Escape from Tarkov), the developers do not understand their own game, whether that's due to how they do not play their creation or not I have no idea, but they just don't get it. It's really frustrating and it's getting to a point where I'm debating dropping this game entirely, which, even though I'm just one person, I will end up contributing to the dwindling playerbase problem. 

Not to mention, so far, the expensive DLC has unironically been a bit pay-to-win, even the Cucktero skin (which is $16 USD by the way, not including tax) gave a really big advantage for a bit by making the chainsaw way more silent at range and only months later was that fixed to be moire in-line with the regular chainsaw audio. Now, Nancy and Danny have been released for $10 USD *EACH*. Putting aside the fact that $20 for 2 characters could easily go into buying a full fledged game on Steam, they are also pay-to-win. As I understand, once Danny has been leveled up enough, he can permanently open an exit making it next to impossible for family to play effectively at all for the rest of the match anymore, and Nancy can reveal your location no matter what if they're knowledgeable about the map, and can even place infinite traps with the correct build. So, overpowered characters/DLC (Nicotero skin) that will later be nerfed only *after* the developers get the sales they need. IMO this is pretty scummy, super akin to LoL.

End of review, I have a lot more to say but I'm bad at articulating my thoughts and wanted to keep it from becoming an essay either way (which kind of became one anyway). I'll leave it off by saying, if you DO want to play anyway, Game Pass is what I'd start recommending to people, since access to the game is dirt cheap.",1701851314,1707564610,False,6,1,0.563460588455200195,0,True,False,False

Outlying from the center of the center of the action, the game is surrounded by a plethora of wonderful performances and gorgeous details. The voice acting, writing, soundtrack, graphics, and maps are all extremely pleasing to the senses. Notably, the cast of characters and presence of the gas station and the family house also are reminiscent of the original 1974 film. New to other asymmetrical horror experiences, and frankly video games in general, the game features a unique three versus four player vs player game play which works surprisingly well. In addition, the game genuinely feels horrifying. The tension of unpredictability that plays throughout a match, and the looming threats of family members roaming the map touch really well with elements of the game mentioned above guarantee a frightening, exciting experience. Although matchmaking and bugs in the game play were an issue at launch, the developers have sent out large quantities of patches that have effectively cleaned the game up.

However, it is difficult to justify any of these upsides as a reason to purchase this game when they're a handful of impacting downsides that overshadow it.

Unlike its predecessor Friday the 13th: The Video Game and similarly to its neighboring asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight, the raw game play is extremely dependent on the current meta-game. That is, the game feels much less like a family-fun sandbox that was Friday the 13th, and leans more towards a competitive, sweaty showdown between players utilizing the games best perks and upgrades in their load out. There is almost no room for creativity when customizing a load out because of said meta-game, which indirectly forces players to continue playing in repetition, else winning chances will plummet. The existence of near useless or simply outclassed perks in the game is not the only issue, as they're unnecessary features in the game as well, such as the character Sissy being able to use hiding spaces or interactions with lamps throughout the map, which feels silly.

Playing as the family may potentially be fun, however, it is difficult to come by. Family members must be in constant communication with one another to discuss rotations on victim exit locations, and their movement plans in general while roaming the map. Else, victim players will take the opportunity to slip by and escape. There is no room for error, which makes game play very unforgiving and tedious, particularly irritating as family members are dependent on having competent teammates if playing in solo queue. If playing in communication with participating teammates, players are still required to have good map awareness. In general, family has a much higher learning curve than victims. This is unlike playing as a victim, which accommodates for both single player and multiplayer experiences; victim teammates are not dependent on one another to succeed. Consequently, because of this, rage-quitting is commonly seen in players who play family. For the remaining family members in a match who choose to deal with the lack of a teammate(s), they're more often than not forced to endure a backbreaking loss. As of writing this review, this has made family queue times extremely fast, and victim queue times ridiculously slow.

Lastly, micro-transactions. If the cost of the base game wasn't overrated enough, or the outrageous expense of the measly skin packs, the pay-to-win nature exemplified in one of their characters, Danny says enough. Updates for this game have been rather sluggish, and although they have tackled many technical issues and perk tweaks, there has been no free content except one map. Everything else have been skin packs and two characters, all which cost money.

It is difficult to recommend Texas Chainsaw because of these negatives that plague the game play, however, I believe it can be enjoyed with friends to a reasonable extent, making queue times significantly shorter and matches much more bearable. The micro-transactions are regrettable, but not unusual, as many game companies are money hungry nowadays. Perhaps future content updates will be free, and not pay-to-win content or overpriced skin packs. Recommended to buy on sale.",1707318755,1707318755,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The lobbies take way too long to get started after you already waited 10 mins in queue. The game is unbelievably buggy (opening the chat while the tab screen is open will softlock you for example). The future content planned is overpriced and will not work in a game where you cant have duplicate characters. 

The fact that you need a leatherface to start a game but doesn't auto assign it when no one wants it leads to standoffs between morons who refuse to switch and make the lobby shutdown forcing you back into a queue and another 7 minute lobby when you get it. 

The cutscene of grandpa waking up was funny the first few times but it is extremely annoying and unnecessary. It can cause some bugs and animation cancels that completely throw the game for you (Leatherface chainsaw will stall during it sometimes making you useless for awhile, if you are opening a lock it will cause you to start the animation for closing the door which opened during the cutscene which has killed me a few times, and plenty more). 

Extremely fun when it works and you can play it! Its not looking good for its future considering every time I go to play it the queue times are getting longer and longer. Needs some serious care and change of plans to save this game, so sad it is being done like this

With friends it is fun for a few matches, but even then the wait times can be pretty atrocious. People don't ready up and just rundown the timer. Pretty sure my friends and I finished a whole episode of Goblin Slayer before we genuinely found a match and we are in a hotspot region for players.

But even then, playing solo hasn't really been all that much fun. It is alot of roaming around trying to find people as the family. Or roaming around trying to find items as the victims until you learn all of the routes and blitz the game in 2 minutes while the family is still fondling grandpa's balls. Matches can go on for a long time without much, if any, interaction between the two roles that it makes for less of a tense experience and more of a snoozefest. Or they can end in an instant. Again, without any interaction.

I know it is a new game and there is so much I don't know, but I simply cannot see this game lasting for very long without tweaks. It is confusing at first and then shallow much later.

There really needs to be less deadtime in a game like this. More forced interaction between the two groups. Better hints and visual cues for both sides, but especially the family side.

Micromanaging grandpa so far is my least favorite part of playing the family by a considerable margin...... I really....really...really hate having to goober around looking for blood sources to come back and pour down my ancient generator of a patriarch here. It is absolutely mindnumbing and I wish there was some sort of passive implementation for him.

The implementation of stamina also makes for a really clunky experience that leads to more frustration moments than anything on top of being another thing you need to manage in a game where matches are already so lacking in engagement.

I can't recommend it unfortunately. I'll probably still play it whenever my friend group hops on, but so far the only fun I had was during the beta on another account with my friends, and now live playing it solo the novelty has really wore off and I just don't find it that grasping. Which is a shame, because I really want it to be a big successful game for the assymmetrical PvP genre.

But this isn't it. And sadly because there are no bots and no plans for bots, this game is on a time limit as far as lifespan is concerned. Which I consider to be the only really MASSIVE blunder by the devs.


If you are a really hardcore TCM fan, then pick this up, preferably on sale. But if you are not that, then I would give this one a pass for now.

Edit: Also...no capacity to rebind keys... In a 2023 game...really? Also there are still numerous bugs... I got stuck in a door already as Cook and couldn't do anything. My game also randomly switched resolutions in windowed fullscreen mode and wouldn't switch back until I restarted the game.

One shotting leatherfaces that can kill almost everyone with a overhead swing and a normal attack, with the overhead causing a stun that guarantees the other hit connects

Hitchhikers that can trap whatever they want, whenever they want, and chase you for literal hours.

Cooks who make going anywhere practically impossible in some maps

Johnny's who can kill you in 3-4 hits maximum

Sissy's who can hinder your movement speed and options severely

Nancy's who can also make getting anywhere on some maps impossible like cook
 
Connie's who can break through any defense with the click of one button, and normally blazes through doors anyways

Leland's who can keep stunning you over, and over, and over, and over again

Ana's who can tank so much damage you'd think they'd have a dead ringer on standby

Danny's who can instantly unlock any exit and keep it open for literal hours, while having some of the most broken perks in the game

Maps that are almost impossible for victims to win (family house) and maps that are almost impossible for family to win (Slaughterhouse)

Listen, I still really like this game, I've been part of it ever since the PTB where they added the slaughterhouse for the first time, and I still like it.

Regrettably, at its current juncture, I cannot endorse the game, primarily due to several critical issues that notably hinder gameplay enjoyment and balance.

[b]1. Excessive Escape Routes:[/b] 
The game's design includes an overwhelming number of escape options for survivors, both on the ground level and in the basement. This abundance, coupled with the vast distances between exits, makes it exceedingly difficult for players assuming the role of killers to guard these points effectively. A notable point of contention is the presence of exits in the basement, which, given the already extensive map size, seems unnecessary and further complicates the killer's task. Escape in the basement should be removed.

[b]2. Oversized Map with Obstacles:[/b]
The expansive nature of the map, while ambitious, introduces a myriad of obstacles that disproportionately challenge the killers in pursuing survivors. This design choice not only makes the chase sequences less thrilling but often tips the scale unfavorably against the killers, detracting from the game's intended balance and sense of fairness.

[b]3. Survivors' Speed Advantage:[/b]
A glaring imbalance exists in the speed dynamics between the wounded survivors and the family members (killers). Despite sustaining injuries and bleeding, survivors can still outrun their pursuers, undermining the threat posed by the killers and reducing the overall tension and strategy required in gameplay.

[b]4. Lack of Capturing Mechanics:[/b] 
The game currently misses an opportunity to deepen its horror elements by not incorporating mechanics that allow killers to capture and subject survivors to various forms of in-game 'torture'. Such an addition could enhance the game's entertainment value and immersion, providing a more nuanced approach to player interactions beyond mere chases.

[b]5. Voice Chat Dynamics:[/b]
The absence of a 3D voice system that allows survivors to hear the killers adds to the game's shortcomings. Implementing such a feature could elevate the psychological thrill of the gameplay, fostering a more intense and engaging atmosphere that leverages auditory elements to heighten suspense and player immersion.

The game harbors the potential to carve out a niche within the horror game genre, its current state is marred by significant gameplay and balance issues. It is my hope that the developers will take these points into consideration, making necessary adjustments to unleash the game's full terrifying potential. Until then, I advise potential players to approach with caution or await future updates that may address these critical concerns.",1706631641,1706631835,False,0,0,0.461538463830947876,1,True,False,False

i dont rlly write long reviews but i loove this game

[b]movie accuracy[/b]
before playing this (tcm) i hadn't watched the movie, but still had lots of fun playing it. although after seeing the first movie (which is the only one they have rights to i think) it's cool to see how they incorporated a bunch of the stuff into the game. Examples: (spoilers for what's ingame obviously) [spoiler] the map the movie takes place in, chickens, killers, outfits that the people had in the movie (or similar to), generator, bone stuff (traps, noisemakers, furniture, etc.), etc. even grandpa plays a huge role [/spoiler]

[b] creativity [/b]
while keeping generally true to the movies, they also expand with their own characters and environments (maps). the devs try to make the stuff they add make sense in the realm of the first movie. the characters they added have strengths that are each important for different parts of the game, including the killers, which i really really like. cause of this it supports tons of different play styles, the characters are even personalized to your own play style with perks n stuff

the devs put a lot of work into making the game, with a lot of attention to detail and a lot of effort into making tcm a good game. already mentioned in the above examples are examples i would also add here. theres a lot i could say but i dont want to

[b] pricing and danny [/b]
the game is very fun and i think its worth the $40, but i understand if some people think it's over priced. especially because it's $10 each to buy 2 extra characters ( some outfits cost money too but yk). i wasnt waiting for the game to come out, but i read that it was planned for you having to pay for certain (or each) maps and characters, so it's good that that's not very true right now (excluding 2 characters)

one of the characters, danny, is desperately in need of being nerfed. i played victim mainly when danny was released so i didnt notice how bad it was, but after playing family i see how rigged he is. he opens exits that you cant close (for the most part) letting the victims escape fast and easy. is this so people buy him before his nerf comes?(confirmed to be coming) idk maybe. i think it is kinda fun trying hard to prevent him getting to an exit opener tho, but there's too many exits to guard danny from and the game kinda sucks for family once you realize he's tampered something

[b] graphics [/b]
tcm looks really really good if you have a good computer, especially if you don't turn the brightness up so you can see more. animations are mo cap so they're natural and work well. game looks so cool that my eyes hurt sometimes and will hopefully improve

[b] balancing [/b]
not including danny the game is generally balanced in my opinion, but it could be better sometimes. i dont think about it enough to write a full review, but i think the game is a little more victim sided sadly. which even if it was balanced perfectly i think people would go for victim majority of the time, so its not great that victims are already favored ( i still prefer victim thooo)

[b] updates [/b]
from what i've seen the devs are listening to players to a degree. they're nerfing danny, trying to balance out victim and family, adding maps and apparently a new victim and family, etc. this being said, big updates take some time to come out which  makes sense to me. some people disagree with this but idc i like what the devs do with the game

There are so few items (2) to use (screwdriver for locks and bone shards to fight back ONE time - wheel and fusible are just another keys to specific door) that the gameplay is poor and repetitive.

And good luck trying to play the character you actually want.

EDIT: BEWARE: Every piece of content but the maps and something they call ""etc""? Will be pay to play in a game you have to buy to play to begin with, this includes: Premium skins 16$, new Character 9,99$, New Execution 6,99$, Normal Cosmetics(clothing, weapons)Which will probably be recolors and slight changes in costume> 4,99$. And after a you are leveled enough to max out 3-4 characters the level ups become pointless really, and that does not take that many lvls. Progression just kinda ends quick. The passive point trees are too small for build variety and force you to always build the same if a certain passive is on the wrong end of the tree, locks you out of options since some passives are so strong that they are a must have or else youre a gimp(running speed boost, more stam, some character specific passives to boost their skill.... etc). Just falls short. And they way things look all they will do is release more paid content from here on out and new maps, when the progression is in need of an overhaul to be actually interesting.

2) There are STILL game breaking bugs in the game that have gone FAR too long without patching out.

3) The game has almost ZERO futureproofing so if you're looking for a long experience this isnt it.

4) Small DLC with Big Prices.",1693752651,1705869085,False,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

But after the first few days you see all the problems.
no exp after certain matches on both sides.
killers earn considerably less exp.(fixed)
Lobbies are a waiting simulator that never start half the time.
Some maps are problematic on both sides once people know what there doing.
Skill trees are ridiculous very little useful perks plus random system is a joke respec for hours just to get certain perks. 
Also a lack of decent variety in perks for each character.
Some of animations take far to long to complete for example healing and struggling(mainly a victim problem.)
Bubba's overheating chainsaw during grampa cutscene.(fixed)
Bubba's fov is very janky in the basement.
Bubba's chainsaw extremely annoying when playing him due to the speed mechanic causing you to rev it continually.
Poor server stability.
Last of all the levelling system very annoying to deal with if you just want to quick play either side. Requiring you to respec either victims or family depending on what role you got a minor issue as you could just choose either side but i do not like this system very slow and tedious.

Matchmaking is terrible as well, my first ever match of texas i got in a match with lvl 60-80 family and around lvl 20 victims, how is this balanced? my first matches should realistically be facing people up to lvl 20 at most as getting god gamers on your first match really removes any fun since they just completely wreck you.

Leveling in this game also is really unfriendly since if you want to go a different path in the skill tree you have to reset from the BEGINNING which sucks since many perks are completely random so having to spend possibly 5 minutes just respecing a character removes a lot of fun of the game the game. leveling the perks and characters are fine but because of matchmaking you really feel like you're bringing down the team because of being low level.

theres also a myriad of bugs and problems but one i want to point out is the fact that there are no way to check ping and because of that i get kicked out a match while its going because my ping is too high because i got sent to the other side of the globe since there appears to be no servers around australia, so it just feels like there isnt a point to playing sometimes because i could just get kicked because the devs decided that would be a good idea.

Anyway i will end this review saying that the game in general is fun and enjoyable with friends however with the problems this game has i cant really play it without wanting to just uninstall.",1705392951,1705392951,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Meta really hurts this game at the moment if you have a coordinated team Killer or victim sided Its either Rush meta for Victims or Killers coming into the basement killing Victims games can end so fast while you have to wait a queue for about 5-mins, But there not much for a Solo Queue player like me to play Family because you really need good coordination to play with Family and having people not using their mics you can't tell what other's are doing, There must be other ways for people to communicate without just using their mics not everyone wanna use their mics and i understand that but for this game its really a game changer with or without mics sometimes, Also i find playing stealth sometimes for victims just annoying because i could be hiding in a bush or even in plain sight but my victims voice lines goes off and gets me caught and it feels bad for stealth players but you can avoid this by looking away and not having the family on your screen but that just added extra annoyances and to not play stealth also there are numerous Bugs and glitches i had my fair share of bugs and i reported a few of them and glad that most of them are fixed but hopefully in due time we can have maybe more perks for both Family and Victims to change the meta into what it isn't rn or maybe i don't like using another game example but like dead by daylight where perks don't get stronger but or useful but sometimes you won't use all your perks in one game but there's some really Op and one sided perks in Tcm. Perks i feel should not change the whole game entirely for you but give a extra boost but not guaranteed your survival Tcm is made to not be a competitive game but its a Team V Team Matter not much you can do when you know there is gonna be a side of Winners and loser's and i'm in it for the lore Formatting but i never even watched a Texas chainsaw movie or anything about the lore before buying this game, I just happened to love the Friday the 13th style of gaming and was hoping this game would be at least a modern day version of that game, Perks that could be like start with a health bottle or Bone shivs , One time use you get the item but the perks is done used for the rest of the game perks like that really made me enjoy the Friday the 13th game because after you even use the perk its out the water you gotta find out what to do next but things like extra drip i have free extra heeling when ever i find a bottle and things like Fast hands on Danny even rewards me for rushing and having Family near me to unlock doors. I don't have much knowledge on Game design or even lore about Tcm but maybe the virtual Cabin like Friday the 13th game would be great its a place for people who wanna see the lore could go but players could still play and experience a balanced game without all these Op Perks, Like Poisoned claws , I actually really enjoy Stunt double because its a great example of taking less damage but still at risk to die at any moment , Its not so gaming changing but still helps a little bit to give you extra seconds or chances to get out of a situation your in. Alright i won't go much further but i do love the game and i wanna keep supporting its growth but i wanna see some balancing back as well, I'm sure many players would not mind Testing or even seeing perks out early to see if they fit or are to op and should be changed like the TTB for DBD. Cheers to a Brighter and greater Future to TCM, Hope to see some updates soon.

( Needs and Changes )
- Fix Balancing on perks see whats used a lot in the meta and change that 
- Fix the time Family can come into the basement and Victims can leave the basement 
- Don't be sad or mad if your game gets Comp, That's called building a game base that still loves your game for what it is
- Make certain objects unique like fuses can be 1 or 2 on a map or same for valve 
- Add more features to the game ( People are dying for content, Battle pass or not people want things to do and grind for )
- Just have Fun make perks for unique for play styles ( Chaser, Runners, Seekers, Hiders, Baiters, fighters, ) Even funny derpy perks can make communities , take a look at No Mither for Dbd the Legend the myth.
- Thank you for putting the time and effort into reading this review, But We still have a long road ahead so lets get to work.

Most matches are over in 2 minutes (or less) because a Connie instant pick locked every lock for her team and they're just t-bagging in the exit until you run over.

If they're near a well, which are on EVERY map, they're going to run straight to it and jump in and they're gone forever as you have to guess which one of 4-5 basement exits they are leaving from and then which 4-5 map exits there are. You're supposed to be able to be able to see survivors with Grandpa, but the game notifies victims when Grandpa is going to yell for some reason(survivors need to be moving while he is yelling), so you NEVER see anyone except people brand new to the game with him. The only time you are guaranteed to see someone with Grandpa is when he is level 5, which takes forever and all survivors are probably gonna be gone before then. The leveling system is really goofy also, you can max a character in like an hour or two, and then after that it takes FOREVER to get enough account levels to do anyone else.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre game takes players on a spine-tingling journey through the iconic horror franchise. With faithful visuals that capture the essence of the original film and a relentless atmosphere of dread, it's a must-play for fans of the genre

Visuals and Atmosphere (4/5):
The game nails the 1974 film's look and feel, immersing players in the eerie Texas landscape. The setting and visuals are a hauntingly accurate recreation, pulling you into the heart of the horror.

Gameplay (3.5/5):
This survival horror game leans into resource management and evasion, mirroring the film's spirit. However, some may find the gameplay repetitive, with occasional frustrating moments. The lack of combat might leave players longing for more interactive engagement.

Story and Narrative (4.5/5):
The game's storytelling is a highlight, staying true to the film while adding depth and context. The voice acting and dialogue effectively convey the characters' fear and desperation.

Horror Factor (5/5):
Where the game truly excels is in its ability to terrify. The tension is relentless, jump scares are expertly timed, and the horror is both psychological and visceral.

Conclusion (4/5):
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre game offers a chilling experience for fans and horror enthusiasts. While it has gameplay quirks and pacing issues, its commitment to the source material, relentless scares, and authentic atmosphere make it a standout horror title. Brace yourself for a nightmarish journey into Leatherface's world.",1694124263,1705196088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ""Making Grandpa Proud"" achievement is currently broken and will not pop because the ""Unlockable"" tied to perfect wins for Family side is also broken.  If you don't care about achievements then let all the other reasons I've given be the reasons you pass on this game for now, but let me also say that a company that can't even get their achievements to work properly isn't a very good company.  Even indie ""developers"" who do it for a hobby with RPG maker can make their achievements work properly.  It's not rocket science and somehow GUN managed to screw that up too (shocker)

Let me preface this review by saying I bought two copies, one for me and one for my girlfriend, and we have fun playing the game together, however we're really just playing to get our money's worth; 80 dollars for the two copies of the game and that's with the Christmas discount. If you don't want to read my whole review then just take my word for it. I have over 100 hours in this game and it's not worth it at all to get into.  The game is dying. The player base falls every week and in a few months it'll probably be dead unless a company with a proven track record of failure fires literally everyone and replaces them with actual developers (and they don't have the money for that)

I can't honestly recommend the game in it's current state.  When I bought the game the reviews were mostly positive, they have since fallen to ""mixed"" and had we known about all the issues the game has we would have probably waited to get it, or avoided it, which is unfortunate because the premise is great and when the game is fun it's extremely fun but I have to be honest there are a few major issues and for that reason I say either wait until the game gets patched into a more stable state OR avoid it altogether.

1. The price doesn't justify the game.  You're paying for the IP not the experience.. which again CAN be fun but usually isn't.
2. Matchmaking is a crapshoot whether you'll get 3 or 4 leavers/queue dodgers and finding a game can take 10+ minutes. This is something that can easily be fixed by just making the matchmaking system like literally every other game of this genre but that's up to the developers and the game has been out since august and clearly they see no issue here.
3. Balancing issues.  Family Members are extremely overpowered and the mechanics of the game can be very frustrating. If you get chased you're almost certainly going to die.  The only way to win is to avoid detection but this can prove nearly impossible in many games due to the map layout and the 3 family members camping around.
4. Perks and abilities are mostly useless except for a few, there's not a lot of balance 

So all in all the game needs to be retuned, and balanced, and matchmaking needs to be fixed in some way.",1703774635,1704779894,False,3,0,0.41094014048576355,0,True,False,False

and even if there are 1 or 2 assassins missing to enter the Lobby, let the game run, it's very annoying to wait and when there's a family member or survivor missing, the game simply doesn't start!!!
Seriously, I already spent 30 minutes waiting for another game to start!!!
This is annoying, you enter a match that sometimes lasts 2-3 minutes, go back to the lobby and spend about 30 f$cking minutes to enter another match!!!
It makes you feel discouraged to play a game like this!

I do not like the state or the direction the game appears to be headed in. Upon release, the game seemed to be intensely unique, and offer a very cool experience. Without any significant updates, it's become terribly stale and boring. Wins are now determined by who has the best ""sprint to the exit"" strategy, heavily favoring one team. There is no variety or uniqueness left to discover for me in this game, with very few hours.

The devs disabled cross-play for a significant period of time, and seem to have everything under their own interpretation when it comes to what would be fun or best for balance. Updates are RARE(!) and usual very non-substantial when released (minor tweaks, tiny bugs, small number changes, etc). The updates that do occur always have a new paid DLC for a cosmetic skin (sometimes not so totally cosmetic, sometimes game play enhancing for the user!) with NO REAL SUBSTANCE for keeping the game alive or the longevity of replay-ability.

I had to upgrade my GPU to even be able to play the live game without constant lag, freezes, stutters and crashes. Victim objectives are too risky half the time and take too long to do sometimes. If a family member finds you, forget doing objectives. You're pretty much just going to be running the whole time until you run out of stamina then its game over. If 2 family members find you then they can easily corner you or cut you off and eliminate you leaving you feeling like you didn't have a chance. For me it felt like if you didn't make a fast escape then you're not going to escape. This wasn't the case during the beta but now that everyone playing pretty much has the whole game figured out its just all about the speedrun strats.

Other things I don't like about the game:

Your character as victim is auto placed into crouching all the time. The last time I played there was no way to turn this off and it was literally the most annoying thing about it. I lost many matches because I wasn't able to sprint because the game decided to crouch for me and prevent me from sprinting when I needed to. LET US TURN THIS OFF!

You die too fast. A common experience for me in this game was getting hit by one family member a couple times just to run into another who hits me and then I die. I just feel so limited in what I can do to survive. Yea you have things to counter them like Leland's stun and the bone shards, but those only go so far when the family has infinite life and infinite attacks. If victims could actually work together to kill family members the game would be a whole lot better. That should actually be an alternative way to escape. The family has way too much power when all you can do to stop them is stun them for a moment in certain situations.

Confusing maps. After playing all of the maps several times I only really learned 2 of them with still a few things I don't always remember. It seems like if you don't know exactly where to go at all times you're doomed. The whole ""what do I do? where do I go?"" feeling kicks in and you just feel hopeless.

Overall the experience seems to be you either win fast as family or escape fast as victim. The long game doesn't really happen anymore in my experience. Family knows where survivors need to go and so they camp those places all the time. Sometimes other survivors will find a way to escape very fast, leaving their team behind to die instead of finding them to show them the way out. I think maybe the game could be fun if you play it with friends. If I am able to do that one day and have fun with it then I will update this review to reflect that. Until then, I can't recommend this game. Its not worth $40. This game should be $10, maybe $15. It needs WAY more content to be worth $40.",1704441893,1704441893,False,1,0,0.505931317806243896,0,True,False,False

But crashes are still very evident and happen daily. You'll run into some cheaters still but they've definitely put some attention on that. There are some heavy balance issues with a few of the expensive pay to win characters. Mainly right now danny. On top of the issues of them still not doing anything about lobby queues. If you are playing victim expect for the queue times to take about 10 mins to load into a game, and thats if the lobby doesnt send you back to main menu because it doesnt requeue the lobby. It's not due to lack of players. It's definitely have to do with some type of error that doesn't repopulate the lobby after someone dodges. I have changed my recommendation at this point, because they've definitely worked on some things, and added some new content which has been enjoyable. But please know all new content you will have to pay for (at the time of writing this) 

----------------------------------------------------
My updated recommendation is based on the fact that since date of release. The game has major performance issues still. Servers will crash quite frequently in the middle of the game, and there are quite a good amount of glitches. Since returning crossplay which was turned off while they tried to work on their cheaters issue (which has not been resolved still). Lobby queue times have started suffering. Along with the fact ppl will leave the lobby on killer side if victims lvls are too high or they have to play bubba. Someone will join lobby after you wait 3 mins to get the lobby. They will sit in the lobby 2 out of the 3 min lobby ready time then leave with 30 seconds left on the clock. Then someone else will join and set the timer back another minute. Till they too inevitably leave the lobby as well. And it will force the lobby to either close or for you to sit there for god knows how long. I love the game. But until they fix major problems with queue times/server issues/bugs in the game/ and still a large amount of cheaters. It's almost unplayable at this point.  Due to these reasons I cannot recommend a 40 dollar game in the state that it's at right now.

I would say to wait a while when they HOPEFULLY fix major game breaking issues. Until then. I cannot recommend.",1692402376,1704328171,True,0,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
Graphics are nice

Characters have cool enough stories

get to feed juice to grandpa

can be fun (sometimes)

Cross platform IS BACK and you can play with friends online

Hacking is nearly non existent now days, have done close to 200 games in the past 2 weeks and have not seen 1 hacker

Cons:
Game breaking bugs, like if you open the chat box and the game ends, game soft locks, execute a survivor in a weird spot? game soft locks, stand on a bush weirdly and it soft locks

Seriously balancing issues, family [killers] are waay too weak details stated below:
Victim is WAAAY too easy of a role, anybody who tells you Victim is hard is lying to you, Ive played both roles a lot, and I'm a trash Victim yet I escape 90% of the time, it requires no team work, most family never feed grandpa, even if they do it takes 10 seconds to stun him and de-level him, most maps you can escape in less than 3 minutes, you can stab them, stun them with a door, stun them with a gate, stun them by just picking leland, you can destroy the generator in less than 20 seconds, you can instantly turn back on the pressure valve (it takes Victim 3 seconds to turn it ON, and it takes the family 15 seconds to TURN IT OFF) also victims receive no cool down, fuse box has no cool down when turned off, and u can just flip it back on anytime and reopen the exit (meanwhile family [killers] have to wait 30 seconds to turn it off) so u can just bully them like a joke, they arent scary, they arent strong, and being a survivor is insanely easy, Victim is truly the role u play if u want minimum effort and maximum xp. Also just pick connie and instantly break locks and just speedrun escaping, why not? nobody can really stop you, just hide in bushes till they go to a different exit or why even wait? Just use her ult and snap the lock open in their face they really can't do anything about it. But be sure to tbag them, or just go through the same crack 15+ times so they cant touch you.
This game needs to learn a lot from DBD, they can abuse everything they leave no scratch marks, a survivor who keeps picking up bone shards can just keep infinitely fighting the same killer until another killer comes and rescues them. Its silly

Developers arent really active in fixing the many bugs or balancing issues, but theyll sell u a new skin for 15.99, want ur Bubba to look cool when a bunch of victims tbag him at the exit cause the game is a mess? Well buy the DLC now!

Wish I could recommend this game, wish more people would play, and wish the developers would actually give a fk, but thats a lot of wishes, this game will forever be there when I wana feed juice to grandpa, but thats about all its good for now. Poor grandpa stop stabbing him

If it gets to zero and all player slots aren’t filled you are kicked and have to restart the process. Unlike in Dead by Daylight where there isn’t a countdown until all slots are occupied. The worst thing about this game is the crashes. You are constantly kicked from your party if you DON’T spectate until the game ends. I wanted to like this game, but it is incomplete and broken.

- it takes time to level up both Victims and Family members due to not getting a lot of SP since you only get it when you level up and they only give you a little bit of it each time. Kind of wish they had a BloodWeb system like in Dead By Daylight.

- Pretty easy to play Victims and Family members overall.

God willing the game actually loads up, 9/10 times a player will DC before the game even starts making the whole match uneven and 9/10 times the health bar, perks, stamina, and your tools won't show up in the UI -- the most important UI elements, completely fucking gone most games. I've been loaded into a game now 5 times out of the 15 times I've played as a victim with the Leatherface character just standing next to where I spawn as if he didn't have to wait in the loading screen and intro video.

The culture of the community is fucked too, probably in part because they've gone through the psychological torture that is the lobby lobotomy simulator, but also because the game does very little to help new players navigate the game while making it a grind to level up where your characters are significantly stronger, but the matchmaking system doesn't seem to care what level everyone is -- putting level 0's with level 10 zuited out characters.

All of the problems added up make the game completely miserable to play and impossible to be enjoyed casually as you'll have to carve out 3 hours of sitting in the lobby just to get maybe a good working game in. 

None of these problems will be solved, as it's been a problem since launch, and it will only get worse as the problems turn players away from the game leading to more of the toxic and/or experienced players from being the only playerbase.

 I love how interactive it is for both Family and Victim, from item gathering, lock picking doors, closing gaps or grandpa objectives. What makes it more fun is that ultimately you have more than 1 exits making replay ability much more unique. Wherein, you either survive together as victims or kill together as family, no side would make you feel alone throughout the match (cause everyone is all over the place)


Crazy Gore and Voice Acting
The visualization of the inflicted injuries from chainsaw knives and razor slashes, broomstick and that garden thingy bashes and the gut wrenching screams, moans and the toe curling executions are so damn good the voice actors and animators actors etc... really killed it whether it is to show the family's sadistic nature or the victim's sheer terror and suffering 


Family Matchmaking
Although there are some things that really sets it apart is that family is heavily reliant in teamwork, matchmaking is kind of a coin toss whether you'll get a Cracked Perma Revving Nicotero Leatherface or someone who just picked up the game which sometimes lead to a frustrating match. That is simply why this is so much better played with friends for better communication or just some dumb fun 


The Randoms
Speaking of which, the randoms are surprisingly natural born comedians whether it is voice chat or game play. 


Scary DLC Characters
Nancy
The ability to literally look at the victims POV (+lvl 3 clear vision) really removes the stealth even with the new victim perk (out of my head) that kinda counters it and not to mention the poison infusion

Danny
The ability to open an exit for an excessive amount of time without any counter and stack the ability bar that requires to do that INSTANTLY (lvl 3 instant study) is just too crazy 


Its Not That Bad
Sure it ain't perfect but at least I don't have to hold m1 for a minute for a total of five times and pray to god the other teammates to do the same or hit the victims once and give them a 10 meter head start before I start chasing them again

I'm super excited for new content! Here's to the future!

(12/28/2023) I am revising my review. As we can see, the review ratings have fallen to Mixed. I still love this game and I play it a lot. Already got to Level 99, so I get to kick back and relax while I level up my characters perks. The main complaint is they need to lower DLC prices. It's extremely hard to justify spending $10/new character. 

I am hopeful for 2024 TCM. However, the temporary disabling of crossplay and the DLC prices reveal is what caused community uproar, which resulted in a mass amount of people leaving. TCM is not a DBD killer, as it only has one franchise to go off of. DBD has 35 franchises and growing. 

What they should do next:

While I prefer TCM to DBD, they need to listen to the community on this one and make some changes FAST. 

1. Lower Those Outrageous DLC Prices
2. Implement Fun Game Modes To Add Some Freshness 
3. Do Something About Matchmaking/Long Queue Times/Lobby Dodging 
4. Pump Out Frequent Patches Again Like Old Times 
5. Make The Tutorial Interactive Instead Of Just Videos
6. Nerf Danny, He's Still Too Strong 
7. Make Close Encounters Actually Fair, Not Based On Bone Scrap Immediate Win 
8. Fix Any Infinites On Maps For Balancing Purposes

If it's true that those clothing dlcs took them SIX months to create, then they need to rethink what they're doing with their development time. Not to mention they've made some really questionable design changes with the updates, like how you cannot see other players levels anymore which goes against the whole game's design on how to strategize, especially as family. 

Old stuff at the bottom when no one knew about the future pricing structure: 

Certificated Texan Mastapeace

Matchmaking bugs and private matches need fixing asap. Especially when you're in a party with friends. Also why do you have to make a party first THEN start a private match which has an entirely new invite code, like what?

Update: 
Seems like matchmaking has been fixed a bit? Maybe they've done a back-end servers update but it seems to be much more consistent now.

Especially when you have 3 people total to play family members, it starts a lobby immediately instead of looking for a lobby (which made no sense as the max was 3 anyway as family) as it used too.

Update #2: 
I'm not a huge fan of the last minute changes they're making. Particularly generator and battery being both on. One of the selling points and unique things of this game was having to set up the property first before the victims make it up. I understand they've changed it due to victims being able to rush and open an exit before you could even turn on the battery, but that's just a problem within itself.

(I don't care about paid skins, chainsaw noises or executions. If the TCM devs want to make money through that I'd wholeheartedly defend that.) Just don't block two of the arguably top tiers characters behind a paywall...

I rarely purchase new games full price, especially such a bare-bones that had a sudden burst of success, but I watched enough youtubers playing it, looked at reviews and character build videos then finally just thought ""What the hell might as well buy it while it has a decent player base."" No point in buying a discounted dead game in a years time, right? It had a lot of things I think are great potential for an upcoming game, a great fan base who praise the game, unlockables which reward grinding different characters, a lot of perks (some are useless, but i get a kick out of constantly leveling up even them.), different play styles, generally good looking game without performance issues, etc...

It has a decent amount of technical issues: 
1) If you get caught in a trap and jump out a window simultaneously the window breaks, but you stay in the trap, sometimes it works out for the victim because family members get caught in a cool-down animation hitting air, sometimes it just gets you 3 way gang-ganged by the family either side.
2) Hitting victims can be a pain if the game decides you're somehow missing and revving up a full leatherface chainsaw swing and watching it go through a victim without doing anything is frustrating.
3) Back stabs are a pain because the have the same button as grappling, so 50% of the time a back stab prompt ends up grappling when you're clearly behind that family member. (Sometimes you don't even get either options...)
4) Connection issues are definitely a thing, I don't have them, but a lot of people do and it ends up leaving games dead if for example two of the killers DC'ed randomly. When combined with lobby waiting times it can make finding a decent game pretty tedious.
5) Related to the last point and this review in general: Lobby dodging is a bad thing in TCM, which is made worse by people who want to play the content that they paid for and leave as soon as they figure out they can't play the character they want because someone else is in the same position. Something needs to be done about lobby dodging, increased lobby wait times or lower que priority, not being able to play the same character two in a row, etc... 

All in all it's a fun game, it's like any asymmetrical game (mainly DBD from my experience), it has issues, but for the most part it's a fun mess that you knew what you were getting into. I'm by no means a fan of Behaviour (DBD dev's) I do not pay money for skins and I use in-game currency to buy characters, but at least they have an understandable excuse for making licensed characters unbuyable with in-game currency as they need to purchase the rights and come to agreements to branded content which obviously brings in fresh new players. What is the excuse for TCM? Apparently the devs do not have full TCM licencing, so why not either make a content you've got the rights to or just make new unlicensed content as long as its TCM related.

If you play killers, the queue times are 10 seconds, if you play victims its 3 minutes.

To put into perspective, if you play family solo, you will lose most of your matches bcs the game is victim sided. If you play victims, you win every match in solo.

HOWEVER, the balance of the game is questionable at best and HEAVILY Victim sided at worst. Victim perks/stats/abilities give them an insane boost compared to the Family side, there is no reason to never put 50 points into Proficiency unless you're purposefully trying an inferior build. Max Proficiency makes locks insanely easy to deal with, it's just flat out too quick. The only caveat is if a Cook is in play using his Padlocks with Security Pins OR Nobody Escapes Hell is active(or both at once), but even then Connie can completely IGNORE Cooks padlock + Perk + Grandpa Perk. Connie is able to instantly break 1 lock no matter what perks are applied to said lock, which can completely invalidate almost half of Cooks ability. Pair this with Max Proficiency + Perks and there is nothing a DECENT Connie can't do.

The other free Victims are mostly fine, Leland is annoying at worst and Ana at worst can swing an entire games outcome due to her sheer amount of Damage Resistance. Ana can easily distract the entire Family team by herself and be perfectly fine, one bone scrap + one small health bottle + A little extra drip. Then she's good to go. 

The most glaring issue currently facing the game however is the pricing model of the game, DLC is outrageously expensive for what it is. I don't mean the cosmetic DLC's either, those don't matter and are purely cosmetic; what I am referring to is the ludicrous pricing of the new characters. $10 for ONE character is absurd, if it was $5 for one character that would be perfectly reasonable; however, charging $10 for a single character is insane. To add on-top of that, it's arguable that the DLC characters are flat out Pay to Win, at least Danny is. Danny is such an insanely strong character that in my opinion, he is straight up just P2W, intentional or not. Having a Danny on the Victims team is such an insane boost that it's flat out unfair. Danny's ability can PERMANENTLY stop the Family from closing an exit, if a Danny sabotages the Valve Pressure exit, the game is just over. There is currently no way for the Family to stop it from opening, and once that door is open Victims can just rush it and at most lose 1 person. The difference between Danny and Nancy's power levels is ridiculous, Nancy is a good character but nowhere near Danny.

The issue of future content(mainly characters) being priced at such at high amount, then those characters being leagues stronger than the free characters is what will do the most damage to this game if not course corrected ASAP. As the game gets older and more paid insanely strong characters are added, new players are at such a massive disadvantage that they may just leave the game all together. Which may not be an issue if the new characters were earn-able through some sort of in game currency or achievement system, but this currently is not possible.

I really want this game to succeed, it's so much fun but the balancing, pricing model and future characters power levels need to be brought into line as quickly as possible or it may just kill the game.",1692390384,1703545726,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★☆☆

""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is a brutal horror game that involves players in the fear of the legendary film, which was launched in August. The violent attention to detail is amazing; the spooky landscapes and grisly details completely immerse you in Leatherface's diabolical world. The frightening atmosphere is perfect, with every turn feeling like a possible threat.

The game is a visual masterpiece. The sound design adds to the entanglement, keeping you on the edge of your seat with every creak and whisper. It's a visual and audio feast that horror fans will surely enjoy.

The game, however, falls short in terms of content. While the first encounter is definitely amazing, there is a desire for more maps, personalities, and varied execution situations. The lack of variation reduces replay value, leaving players hungry for more challenges and settings to explore. A greater range of characters and execution circumstances would add levels of depth to the gameplay, extending its lifespan.

The lack of various maps reduces the game's strategic potential. More environments would not only diversify the encounters, but would also provide new methods and obstacles for both survivors and Leatherface. A larger map pool would keep the gameplay interesting and unpredictable, keeping it from becoming boring over time.
Similarly, extra characters with distinct powers and backstories could give complexity to the story and diversity the gameplay experience. A larger roster would accommodate diverse playstyles and preferences, ensuring that each match feels unique and entertaining.

In conclusion, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is a graphically gorgeous horror game that catches the essence of its original material admirably. The tense atmosphere and intense gameplay make it a must-play for horror fans. However, in terms of content, the game leaves players wanting more—additional maps, characters, and execution scenes would take it to new heights and create a more rewarding, well-rounded gaming experience. Let's hope that future upgrades will satisfy the desire for greater dread and excitement.",1701006605,1703541413,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The graphics are alright, not top-notch, but they do the job. The atmosphere is spot-on – creepy as you like. Now, the controls can be a bit wonky, like trying to control a shopping trolley with a dodgy wheel, but you get used to it.

What I really liked is the unpredictability – you never know when Leatherface is going to pop up, and it's proper tense. It's like being in a horror movie, but you're the one calling the shots, or at least attempting to.

[list]
[*]Close encounters suck for victims.  When you win an encounter, additional family still have up to 5 seconds to engage for instant kill because your character just stands there like a fucking dumbass staring at the person they just won the encounter against.  In short, even when you win you will still probably lose.
[*]Newest victim Danny is 100% Pay2Win.  How an ability that perma-opens an exit (""tampered"") made it into live is fucking unbelieveable.  The personal fastest I've seen a Danny tamper an exit is 55 seconds.  Granted, that takes a bit of RNG in their favor (valve just outside basement exit and the pressure tank being almost next to it), but it shouldn't be possible in the first place.
[*]Cross platform is ridiculously unbalanced.  For example, PC family players are handicapped compared to console family players.  Console families can see victims leave obvious trails of blood for them to follow, whereas PC families [i]MIGHT[/i] see a few drops here and there.
[*]There are so many interaction points that need pixel-perfect alignment to show their prompts.  The most noticeable being when trying to stab grandpa, or running up behind a family member for a backstab and the prompt appears 3 seconds later.  Pure horseshit.
[*]Timed lobbies to fill up belongs back in the 90s.  Fortunately, the devs said this will be eventually removed.
[*]As an ESDF player, it's annoying as fuck that latching a door is hard coded to the F key for victims and yet family gets to rebind this action.  Even something simple like assignable keybinds is apparently too hard to keep consistent for both roles.
[*]There is no matchmaking system at all.  This is self explanatory when this is a terrible choice.
[*]The mascot and icon of the IP, Leatherface, is arguably the worst family member to play as.  To that point that so many people were unwilling to play him that they had to remove his ""mandatory"" status just so people would stop dodging lobbies when they were forced to play as him.  How the fuck you let the face of TCM be the worst killer is beyond comprehension.
[*]When a family member attacks a victim, they get bloodied.  Apparently, Sumogun thought this would make a great DLC, so you can pay $5 for skins that will happen naturally during gameplay.
[*]On the topic of skins, the current skins are just colour palette swaps of their existing clothing.  Apparently a 3 second mask and recolor in photoshop is $5.
[*]Devs think the game is successful enough that they can kick back and proceed with a 3 to 6 month schedule for patches and new content.  Meanwhile, the game struggles to hit 1k concurrent players on Steam.
[*]Sure, it's reported that consoles have more players.  However, given that it can take victims anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes to get a game started with crossplay on, you'd have to be naive to believe that consoles have ""hundreds of thousands of players"" like the white knights try to claim.
[*]""Hey, you're playing all nice and stealthy and you're the last one alive - Good job!  Now, I see that you're hiding behind that couch and the aura shows a family member is coming.  This seems like the perfect time to go ahead and give away your position with yelling out a fucking voiceline!!!!""  This happens more often than it should, and it's pure bullshit.
[/list]
Obviously not a exhaustive list of the game's current issues, but that should be more than enough to justify the thumbs down for the game.  It's going to have a short life, so if you still want to play it enjoy it while you can before it gets shut down.

And it will, because the devs even stated that they will only continue to work on the game so long as the funds pour in from it.

Well, after over a month after release and this game is dogshit. I want to love it, but I just cannot. We thought it would compete DBD but it is nowhere near. The amount of issues with the game is insane.

Pros

The chases in this game are actually fun, strategic and actually mean things rather than run around a rock for 20 seconds while your friends hold a button. Get hit? Go to another rock and do it again! This game you actually have to think. It's not possible to loop so hard and you need to be on your feet to decide.

The stealth, one of the reasons old DBD was so good, is because people were trying to hide and in this game. If you are caught, its alot harder escape the chase alive. It is so fun trying to hide from the 3 killers roaming around while getting to your friends about to open the exits.

Cons...

Stuns, the worst enemy of Leatherface. You will find the Leland stunning Bubba so many times with bone scraps, it is so annoying, and so, no1 plays Bubba, and games just do not start.

Speedruns. It is too easy to sneak past while the family chase others and just escape. (I'm especially looking at you Connie)

Cheaters. It's impossible to fully get rid of. Doesn't mean you guys need to make PC players get the most unbalanced games ever and just not be able to play with their console mates.

DBD Community Migration. DBD has one of the worst gaming communities ever. The amount of entitlement is unreal. People get mad when they lose 30% of their games, and they die straight away. That is how the game works. DEAL WITH IT. Don't complain that your already broken side isn't getting buffed. THEY DONT FUCKING NEED IT. The devs aren't gonna baby you through it and hold your hands. Don't blame them when you don't win everytime. They say the devs are the reason why the game is bad, but no, it is you guys ruining it. And unfortunately, the DBD community is coming here. And I must admit, I did come here from DBD, but at least I'm not like the DBD Twitter users. (ifykyk)

The player base also routinely quits, sometimes prolonging the ability to find the necessary number of players to even start a match. In addition, there is a timer feature for lobbies. This means if you only have 6/7 of the required players by the end of the countdown, everyone is sent back to relaunch at the title screen to repeat the process again. My first three lobbies were unable to produce a playable match. 

This burnout of a game is a joke for 30$ (price on sale) because there is no indication that the development will adequately rectify the situation. The player base is rapidly declining, (which is a death sentence for a multiplayer game) and definitely not something you can change with the latest patch. Looking at the 10$ skins and neglect to balance the game in favor of P2W characters, the absurd asking price is part of some short-term effort to help milk all possible profit from this knowingly dying project.

The characters arent overpriced because its not using ps2 graphics like DBD, they look like realistic people and the animations are just amazing and brutal.

The #1 biggest problem of this game is the RIDICULOUS cost of DLC. Keep in mind, it's not the quality or even the content of the DLC I'm concerned with, it's the greater message it sends. 

The developers have spat in the face of the community and said ""no, your money isn't good enough. we want more."" The people who defend this kind of practice are experiencing an advanced form of Stockholm Syndrome and should seek psychiatric help. The DLC is not worth the cost, and even if it was, pumping out DLC before addressing gameplay problems is not a good look.

That being said, the developers have made some good changes (that should have been done prior to release, but I guess this is the state of the industry *sigh*) and the gameplay loop has been marginally improved. It's just downright confusing how a team that made F13 (one of my personal favorite assym horror games) dropped the ball this hard. To anyone considering buying, understand you are not respected as a consumer and if you're fine with that, go ahead and purchase. It's still a pretty alright game. 

As for the team and publisher, some PR and a reversal on previous poor decisions would go a long way to win back the huge portion of the player base that has been driven away by those bad decisions. Hemorrhaging roughly 9,000 avg. players (90% loss) in a fiscal quarter is not good business.",1692553081,1702868339,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Their games are buggy messes, they charge rediculous prices and their balance leavs a lot to be desired.

They run into the common issue of roleplaying their game instead of introducing mechanics to insentivise that kind of play, that is why i would go as far as to say that the game trailer is almost false advertisement, if it wasnt for the fact that the first hour or so feels like that, as the rest of your game experience will be a better described as a speedrun simulator.

The community could save this game, but they are more busy screaming at each other and wishing only their side to be listened to, rather than everyone getting what they need as both sides got to deal with incredibly aweful design choices, which is a common thing in Asyms to harbor this ""us vs them"" mentality, all in all dont get it, the game is to expensive for what it is (yes i would not give this game a 39 euro pricetag) and it will most likely just be abandonned after a short while like they did with friday 13th.

They leech themselves onto popular franchises and milk the community for what they can get.
Example there is a singular skin in this game, that costs almost 16 euros ... now i know skins are not mandatory, though imagine i would give you a mediocre menu of food and ask for 3 times the cost of an actual good menu in a well established restaurant.

People will hate hearing it but the trueth hurts, Dead by Caylight sells the chucky dlc for example for 5 euros ... TCM charges you TWICE the amount, for an overall less polished game. Now yes we can make the argument, being a very fair one, that DBD had much more time than that, but then dont charge 100% the amount your competition asks for, you look greedy and there is no reason to buy your dlc at that point.",1702853225,1702858063,False,4,1,0.508117556571960449,0,True,False,False

Do not buy this game, do not trust the review score here as it is out of date. Go to the game's Forums and see the current state of the game for yourself.

I should have put a review up for this game a long time ago, but I am doing it now before the Winter Sale to make sure my opinion is out there. Gun has a history I would hesitate to even be so nice as to refer to as disgracefully bad when it comes to supporting their games. This game is once again the same deal. They clearly are intending to only really push updates for this game so it can compete with Dead by Daylight. They deliberately released a DLC the same day as Dead by Daylight and far over charge for what content they are adding. They killed cross platform play and left the PC release to fester with cheaters for ages with zero warning only weeks after launch and have shown through this all that they don't really care so long as they can keep milking this for cash.

In concept, this game is fine. I don't hate the way they handled the IP or the asymmetrical game-play, it's all very well done. There was clearly effort put in to everything here, the animations, the textures, the voice work, all the audio and music, etc. However, all that good effort they did is shot right in the foot by the way they treat the game as a means to sell skins. If they had made this game 20$ or Free and put out skin packs, that'd be fine. Dead by Daylight is sold like that and has thrived on that model but also is not just one single IP. With the launch of the Nicotero Leatherface DLC, Gun made it very clear that they are not interested in what's best for the game or the players. One cosmetic for 15$ is not only far too much money, but they announced and chose the date KNOWINGLY AFTER the Chucky DLC was announced for Dead by Daylight and made it come out on the same day with intention to take customers away from Behaviour. It did not work. This game is effectively dead on Steam.

There are only ever roughly 1000 players on Steam and I would guess that likely over 50% are cheaters. This game was dead within the first 30 days and has no chance of coming back. There is no price I would consider this game to be worth when I consider than this was dead even faster than Gun's first attempt with Friday the 13th. I do not think that this was a bad idea, I think that Gun and Sumo were not executing it in a way that was going to go well. Once again, another company tried to directly compete with Dead by Daylight and found out that they're not able to make it work, unfortunately, Gun didn't really learn any lessons back in 2017 with Friday the 13th and still didn't understand what they were doing wrong here with Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I will not change my review at any point, even in Gun and Sumo improve the game. Gun cannot be trusted and their shady behavior with both games they've made deserves a permanent negative review stating exactly what they've done. This could have been a good game, but Gun is greedy and spiteful and Sumo don't really have any passion for the things they make anymore, if they ever truly did at all.",1702711560,1702711560,False,1,0,0.501145124435424805,0,True,False,False

The good:gory killings, team work for both killers and victims.GRaphics are good enough and the game is super steady, not had a crash yet. The talent system is fun too you can customize your family member or survivor whichever way you want.

The bad:when the victims are bad the game is fun since the games are long and a game of cat and mouse, when the victims are good the game is over before it even starts, i think the game needs more ranndomization to keep the puzzles hard to guess and objectives hard to find. currently the lay off the maps has 2 maybe 3 variants so people that have played the game dozens of times can get out of and escpare before the killers are able to do anything .

The ugly: The game needs to be slowed down quite a bit specially against experienced players. knowing your way out should still provide a level of skill and not just escape without seeing even one family member. 

Summary , the game can go from really enjoyable with both killers and family members trying to outsmart each other to teh victims escaping without the family being able to do anything about it. often the good victims just mock you at the entrance or they see you standing at the door and just run pass you to the exit .killers should be feared not mocked.but in any case the worst problem is how easy puzzles and locks can be picked. if you have a good team it can be good but the family needs to work together and in random lobbies that is often not the case.",1702601690,1702601690,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

___DON'T BE A DORK WHO WILL BUY DYING GAME___

(for the premiere TCM have 10k players, pretty good right? Now TCM have only 1k... How sad. But how did that happend? If you wanna know read text bellow)


1) This game cost 40 dollars. And if you wanna buy 2 DLCs with 2 extra characters you need to pay 20 dollars. Do you see that? First DLCs that come to the game cost half of price the full game. Little greedy devs. But maybe their abilities are fun and unique? Nah bro, they are boring as fuck. I would rather play cookie clicker than that piece of cr4p which devs are calling ,,game"" (there is no way of grinding this characters, you NEED to pay)

2) I'm not surprised that TCM is dying. This game come from guys who made Friday the 13th the game. How cool! Not really. They are only 250 players in F13 and the game will not be longer purchasable in december 2k23. You are literally buying game from devs which games ARE DYING OR ARE ALREADY DEAD.


3) OMGG bro this game is so fricking boring after 50h. The same 4 maps, the same 4 ways of escaping. This game is like 4-5 months old. And the devs gives us only 1 map HAHAHAHA. If you wanna get more content better pay 20 dollars for 2 characters... Ehh...


4) Progression system and random perks. WANNA PLAY WITH THAT PURPLE PERK? FUCK YOU, FIRST YOU NEED TO GRIND PERK TREE FOR 1 HOUR TO GET THAT FROM RANDOM PERK :)) Or maybe do u wanna make some funny build? Nah bro, not in this game. As a hitchhiker you can only play with GREEN or ORANGE perks. YES, U HEARED THAT RIGT, you can't mix that together. YOU CAN ONLY PLAY WITH GREEN OR ORANGE PERKS. Someone could say ,,Ou bro it will be too OP if you can mix that"". Bro, it's devs fault that they don't know how to balance their game and they need to block mixing perks, so pathetic.


5) Wanna get some highschool flashbacks? Go play bubba! You will get bullied in 5 seconds :> Oh no... Bubba is not required anymore. Yes, main character of Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not required in your match. What an irony :)


6) Wanna start a match? Better be prepared for kids dodging lobbies like hits from their dad. Seriously, you will need to doge like 2 lobbies to get a match.

7) Mayby skins are good? XDDDD bro c'mon. Skins that you can unlock for free looks like dog shit. BUUUUUT you can pay half of game price to get bubba skin! Cool right? It also got custom chainsaw sounds! Which are basic chainsaw noises with just lower pitch... Ouch. Devs are so creative :))

8) If u wanna play some horror asymmetrical game DON'T BUY TCM. Competitive players are everywhere, I'm not complaining, everyone can play how they likes to. just be aware that this isn't horror game

9) RNG. Yeah, you heard that right. In asymmetrical ,,horror"" game is RNG. But not a little baby RNG. HUGE AS MOUNT EVEREST RNG. There is an option where you can attack a killer with a bone knife and start a button-clicking minigame (it's called close encounter) . Okay, it doesn't sound that bad... right boys? right?... Oh my God... This is so fucked up. As a character with 15 or 20 strength you can beat killer with 50 strength very easily. I have more than 100h and I've won close encounters only 2 times as a familly member. It's not skill issue, I was smashing my keyboard like ur mom and had my strength maxed to 50. What a nice and fair game :)

        A few words at the end.
Don't buy this piece of cr4p, you will waste your money and time. It's literally buying a game from devs which all previous games died. Don't be an idiot who purchase dying cousin of already dead F13. Devs are greedy and pathetic, they don't really care about players. I think that Bob the builder will be better developer that this squad of idiots. Some people will say ,,Oh he is just mad kid on steam"". Yeah, I'm mad. I'm mad because this stupid ass devs are stealing our money with overpriced DLCs and other shit. I won't sit here like a dog and allowed this greedy fuckers to do shit like that. Fuck your game, fuck your studio, fuck you all. I'm gonna to go outside and play fucking basketball with some friends. I've had better things to do than wasting my time on your shitty ass game. I'm writing this only to warn other players to not buy this game.

      A few words to devs
I don't really care if you are reading that. Just for your information, TCM have 1k players (game is 4-5 months old), DBD have 30k players (game is 7 years old) Oh no... Texas is not doing so well? I'm so sorry... I really hope that your game will die, this shit should not be called ,,Game"". This is fucking cr4p and abomination. Delete this from steam cuz you are embarasing yourself. You should not be called ,,Develepers"". You are just greedy fuckers who destroyed Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchises. I really hope you will go bankrupt, and I will be celebrating day when all your shitty ass games servers will be turn off :)

EDIT 12/14/2023: Cool game. Great concept. Family vs Victims. Still falls flat. The devs have went to work fixing issues with the game's bugs and still plan on fixing other stuff as it comes up. Their last patch fix in November was ""huge"", and fixed a lot of issues with what was wrong with the game. With plans to fix a lot more. Lingering issues still remain. Victims have to get Choose Flight to help break chases. Family needs Scout which can be even harder to level up and max out (scouts reduced damage at level 1 which is punishing). It's like it FEELS like it's a requirement to maintain the chase or escape. Those perks are tied to an attribute called Endurance which you can put points into to improve, as you run or attack you burn stamina. Family's kill animations will lock you into the environment and If you're a victim going down a well, you sometimes get locked into the environment there too. Leatherface is still a literal walking MEME on why you should eat a salad from time to time. People look to actively attack Leatherface instead of running away. I've done this before playing as victim. It's fun on that end sure. But the reverse? He's slow, unresponsive, takes longer to do animations, and literally have players do a 360 around you as you're stunned or door slammed into oblivion. I quit a game last night because of it. ""Who's the real Victim here?"" as I thought to myself. Laughable now sure. But not then. Infuriating. You'd think they take more effort into making the main killer more desirable but everyone still avoids playing him if they can. Dead by Daylight did him better. Made him more relevant. The game's community is so small now that only the dedicated and the curious play the game now. Don't buy this game unless it's on sale or you got some kind of game pass.",1698306939,1702545690,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1433140,145992534,76561198012963687,0,8,6747,0,4203,1702521810,"This will be the last review I post of this game. The issues with this game are not being addressed fast enough. It seems like people who played the game for fun have moved on and you only get stuck with toxic no-lifers From the family perspective you have victims who are somehow able to escape the basement in a minute or less leaving you scrambling to catch up and before you do, OOPS. they've already opened several escapes in less than 3 minutes and are basically just toying with you, teabagging or looping.

Not only that, but it already seems like Family ques are so much faster because almost nobody likes playing family anymore. (Gee, I wonder why...) also a lot of Family members leave the lobby, and because less people play family it often means that slot will not be refilled before the game start timer runs out and boots everyone to the menu because there are not enough players. so if a family member leaves you're better off just leaving the lobby yourself and finding a new one.

Now from the Victim perspective, it seems like most of the time you're matched against Bubba who can find and kill at least 1 person in 30 seconds (either a cause or a symptom of the above mentioned speed running victims) and that screws the whole team up because the family has less divided attention after that. and because bubba can basically kill you in 2 hits (a stun followed by the insta kill animation) you basically need to predict where he won't be able to see you, which is almost nowhere if they have their brightness turned all the way up.

and there is also the fact that most teams are premade so solo players get screwed easily. and because there is no MMR you could be someone who just wants to play for fun put against some asshole with something to prove.

Bottom line, It's SUPPOSED to be a game, but it's not. it's just a ""I'm better than you"" contest, like every other ASYMM game. It's not fun. and like all other ASYMM games it attracts the worst kind of trolls and toxic players  who have to ruin other people's nights to feel better about themself.

Speaking candidly, I'm done with all these god damned toxic competition ""games"". it's not fun playing a game you never win because everyone who plays is one of those elitist pricks.

Cons: Killers often time overly to powerful! It's MMR is messy and so you could queue up with strong players or afk players who give up after few bits. Every now and then you get good middle ground on both sides. 
 So sample: when I was a new player I kept being queued against high end killers who just camped or quickly tunnel folks out. As I played and levels it balance little but not by much. That fine I don't expect perfect MMR system. So it could be a lack of folks playing the game.. because I'll get to that in a second. Or it could be the code or it could be just a OOF every now and then from game side. It got to point were my friend had to pull out a guide map on their screen and teach us the ways.. because you had no time to just get some what grounding where heck you were or doing or items and more. Amount new players see wiggling, banging, smacking and making loud sounds which bring the killers to you is crazy. Often time its because their new as well. Their just trying to get out like the rest of us. That more of game side issue and not player side. 

QUEUE TIME...  waiting and waiting and waiting to get in a match and die in 30seconds in to 3mins feels like 90% of the time. Devs claim there no issue on their end but I don't believe it. The timer legit like 10min/ 15mins lobby waiting.. when I can go to DBD and get into a match quickly in less than 5mins. There not a lot players in this game its a max 2000 on the weekend. Look at the stats before you spend money on this is all I'm saying. The number of players LEGIT playing compared to when it first drop.. even with latest patch/fixes and new folks added... its not good. I would wait until its on sale. Overall I hope they pick up the ball fix a lot these issues. 

This game has a chance to kill it in the market but the Devs need to really sit down and be real on the queue lobbies system because it is broken, to long of waits, and buggy. Its a lobby game at most..sitting there waiting.... and waiting ... that what felt like my money went into.. sitting in a lobby. I would love buy some cash shop stuff but way this game looks and rate of players that are legit in this game.. it makes me not want to invest much into it as of right now. Its a shame .. and anyone that said it's ""Skill issues"" will see this game go in maintenance sooner than later. Because if you do your research a lot community is screaming out same issues I stated and even MORE...   

PS: They plan to remove timer for what reason to maybe hide fact queues are long because.. why else would you remove the numbers... it help keeps track of how long you or your friends sat in those lobbies just to get into a game.  Often time its people window shopping as well for higher players.. so again MMR system that on GAME SIDE to be looked at not the players. 

Overall I don't want say to friends and family buy this game right now. Not until a lot this gets fixed and not played as like we're all fools and claim that code is just fine. Its not. I would say wait for sale so you don't feel bad like I do dropping money on it for me and a friend to just play lobby simulator.

I've sunk 322 hours (so far) into this masterpiece, relishing in the adrenaline-fuelled moments it consistently provides.

The game's foundation is strong, authentic and captures the essence of the original horror movie, with some added characters that feel like they belong to the 1974 TCSM Movie. The atmosphere is excellent, the sound design is hauntingly effective, and the overall tension is palpable. The feeling of being pursued by Leatherface & Family and the constant fear make for an adrenalised gaming experience.

However, my enthusiasm is tempered by the developers' questionable choices and decisions. There have been both temporary and permanent missteps that have negatively impacted the players experience & overall player-base count. Certain updates have led to bugs and imbalances that hindered gameplay.

The once-thriving player-base has dwindled, partially or directly due to these issues. One issue that severely impacted the game was the temporary removal of crossplay, the developers failed at basic game security and released a build of the game that included the pdb for every file, giving the cheaters everything they needed for destruction, and as a result the entire PC population was penalised for the actions of a small few and the player count dropped significantly and hasn't risen since, and then to top it all off they gave console players the ability to opt out of crossplay.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre remains a captivating horror experience that I've enjoyed investing hours into and will continue to do so. However, the developers need to address the community's concerns and reevaluate their decisions to ensure the game's longevity. With a bit more polish and player-focused updates, this game could regain its former glory and stick around much longer than Friday the 13th did, they have an amazing game on their hands I just don't believe they're making the right decisions and for that reason alone I currently cannot recommend this game.",1693951822,1702346905,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

PROS:
-More ways to escape.
-No super fast killers that can control the entire map
-Both sides feel equal
-Way better map interactions

-Not enough Maps/playable characters yet.
-Your game could be over too quickly (No second chances).
-Queues can be very long and a lot of people leave lobby randomly.

When there are a flow of lobbies going, its a great replacement for dead by daylight, and I have never once felt annoyed by the killers game-play like I did on Dead by Daylight. However, when you have been trying to join a game for 30minutes and people keep leaving (even when the lobby is full), it can be frustrating!

I genuinely do like this game. Really I do. It has the potential to be a lot of fun, and a lot of the family members and victims have their own unique abilities along with shared perks that can make each game different.

Unfortunately this game has been heading down a path that is not healthy for the longevity of the game. Not to mention the devs seem to be on an egotistical high horse, and can't seem to take criticism for their game very well. But here are my thoughts on the overall game.

The Good:
-Skill tree is unique and interesting
-Sound design and aesthetics of the game are really cool
-Really makes you feel like you are in the movies
-Unique abilities for Each Victim and Family Member.


The Bad:
-Long Queue times in Lobby, either from people consistently dodging or not enough Family members. Games are also shorter than lobby times for Victim.
-Tutorial needs to be a little more hands on
-Family feels unfun to play
-Leatherface being required for every match, and a lot of people don't want to play Leatherface (Edit: As of the November 28th Patch, Leatherface is not required to start the game anymore, however they also made the stupid decision of not changing barricade spawns or allowing another family member to destroy them like Johnny, so this is an overall bad change and will result in Victims holding games hostage and making Family even more frustrating to play)
-Lotta bugs, some game affecting some not.
-A lot of perks just outright don't work (Radar Detector, Saboteur, No Sell not working at times)
-Major Balancing issues (I get this isn't supposed to be a competitive game, but some balancing needs to be done so that things don't feel outright broken or unfair to play against)
-$10 Character Pricing raising concerns that the Lobby issue will become worse (Which it most likely will) and potentially Pay-to-win (Danny is SUPER P2W lmao what are they doing)


My Recommendation? If you're going to get this game, get it on game pass. Do not waste $40 on this game like I did. It has its moments for sure, but this game can feel downright frustrating to play and just not feel fun at times. It's a shame too because this game has a lot of potential, but I just don't see this game lasting for much longer if they go down the route they are currently going down. It's very disappointing. At launch its probably a 7/10 game for me. In its current state it definatley feels like a 4/10. Has just way too many issues that need to be addressed, that probably won't be addressed, or by the time it does, it'll be too little too late at that point.",1697694037,1702312800,False,12,1,0.607848107814788818,0,True,False,False

I enjoy playing as both Victim and Family, but I prefer playing as Family. Each Family member and Victim has a different play-style, and each has multiple different ways you can customise them to suit your tastes in their individual talent trees. 

The game is best enjoyed when you play semi-competitively. While I still always try to win, I started enjoying the game more when I toned down how much I worried about using the 'best' characters or perks. 

As Family, I play: Leatherface for constant adrenaline and gruesome executions; Cook for area control and giving my team information; Hitchhiker for chasing and mastermind traps; Johnny for tracking and being a swinger; Sissy for poisoning every health item on the map, karaoke, and showing grandpa how much I love him by providing him with freshly harvested blood; and Nancy for rolling a d4 every time I place barbed wire and reliving the nostalgia of being called a screen-cheater.

As Victim, I play: Connie for quickly and quietly busting open doors; Leland for violently assaulting the Family; Ana for being an obvious distraction; Sonny for silent assassinations; Julie for running from my problems; and Danny for listening to the radio.

Fair warning: the game takes time to master, and many people have been playing since the game launched. If you play Victim, you will probably die a lot. If you play Family, you probably won't get many kills. There are plenty of good videos or streams showing game-play which could help you to better understand the game. The in-game tutorial was a good starting point for me. I recommend trying both Family and Victim roles. When I started, I exclusively played Family. However, playing Victim helped me to understand what Victims can do, where they can go or are likely to be, and what is hard to deal with for them so that I can do that as Family. The best thing to do to improve is keep trying and you'll eventually learn what works and what doesn't.",1693034385,1702294298,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Still not recommended. 

The two new characters are pay to win with horrible regional pricing. There is not even a bundle. 

With the introduction of the big patch, two of the four killers were inadvertently nerfed/bugged which pushes sale of new killer. 

The killer Nancy has the unique perk of giving poisoned effect on every hit, which resembles the ""bug"" that Sissy had which eventually had gotten eliminated. Her ability to Spy cancels out stealthy gameplay that the devs claim to try to encourage.

The victim Danny stands out even more in the face of an anti-rush update. He is able to temper valve tank as well as all other objectives, rendering the family unable to do anything, just like the valve tank pre-patch. 

Lobby matchmaking issues (lobbies will not fill up if a killer leaves, unless a victim decides to leave). 

Random crashes. 

Still broken perks. 

Hidden player levels / team indicator to compensate for the matchmaking issue, which leads to miserable gameplay for both veterans and newbies. 

Toxic community. (Not even in a funny way like DbD's)

I had my good share of fun but I would not in good conscience recommend this game.

The game relies a lot on map knowledge so I suggest playing killer at first so you can use the sonar to learn where all the key exit spots and their correlating mini game are. If you're not someone who wants to play killer then make sure to run key beginner perks that allow you to see all basement exits/tools at the start or the one that allows you to see where the water tank/fuse box is. If Family are camping a certain exit ... guess what??? THERE'S 4 TOTAL, ADAPT!

You'll find a lot of people in this community split on how to balance this game but GUN has been very clear from the beginning they want this to be a casual game. 

--If you're a Family main you'll likely complain the game is all survivor sided because of rush meta on certain maps 
-- If you're a Survivor main you'll likely run into what ever the new meta perk is being abused pre nerf and complain about that (Currently that belongs to the Poison Claw perk on Nancy)

You're not going to win every match (or anything in life for that matter) so stop whining and submit you're feedback to GUN without the death threats and harassment. While not perfect GUN has by far done better then a lot of AAA studios at keeping us in the loop of what's to come.

Edited review, 29th of September, 2k23.

Some time passed, gotta re-edit the review.

Game isn't in THAT terrible state like it was before. Balance made by devs through a couple of patch notes weren't terrible, some of them were even perfect for game's health. Some important bugs were fixed. Over all I'd give neutral opinion, cuz it still needs more tuning. For now Im keeping my ""negative"", even tho I'd like it to be neutral.

Re-Edit: 21th of November, 2k23.

I have much more hours now, but over all through that period of time, nothing really changed content-wise. They've released skins that are ""ok"", but they're looking TOO much similar to their defaults. (poor Julie especially). An actual content is coming at 28th of November, it took long for sure. The biggest positives are that devs constantly address meta & balance issues try their best to fix it. (Family Members can turn off fusebox for example, so it won't be open for the whole amount of time) Over all, my opinion is still... neutral. It's in a much better state than it was & after my first edit of the review, but there's still *more* stuff to do.

Re-Re-Edit: 9th of December, 2k23.

 Well, content is acceptable, as I said in last Re-Edit - it took longer than it should (it should be honestly 1 or 2 months ago, especially with the hype game had). But to be for real, it seems like it ain't enough. Especially with Danny, being locked behind a 10$ paywall while being so OP. Saying it as a Victim main, who play FMs occasionally. There's nothing they can do as soon as Danny tampers objective (fusebox/valve).",1692592049,1702089741,False,5,0,0.538461565971374512,0,True,False,False

I'm not gonna mention anything about balancing, There's plenty of people mentioning that.

The two biggest issues I want to focus on is the match making, and progression.

Matchmaking is either bugged or the Developers are idiots, If the lobby isn't full in the first 30 seconds, it will never be. If someone leaves a minute before the game starts, there will never be a replacement. At first I thought this was due to a lack of players, (which also is an issue). but there has never been a time in all the time I have played where I have joined, or seen someone join beyond the first 30 seconds.

Second main issue is progression, XP is not added when you finish the game, I've read some places online that you need to wait until the entire game is finished, but if you are the first to die, you need to sit there for 10-15 min doing nothing, If you leave before you see Buba swinging his chainsaw around, you don't get any XP.

Balancing is just awful. Leatherface, THE character everyone loves from Texas Chain Saw Massacre, is the character NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY. Lobbies will take 10 minutes because people leave because they don't want to play the TITULAR CHARACTER. How do you mess up that bad??

And now they want to release individual characters for $10 each??????

Just avoid this game. Gun did not learn anything from Friday the 13th, and it's going to run into a wall very soon. It's going to meet the same fate as Friday, just faster, and without a lawsuit to conveniently blame.

[b]Update 10/9/2023[/b]:

Is it still broken? Yes! It takes twice the time to actually enter a game than it takes to play the game. If you're trying to party up, too bad! You'll get network errors and party randomly disbanding. My friend is currently restarting his game [i]several times[/i] just to make a party. We do this TENS OF TIMES a play session. TENS. If you want to play with a full party, you better pray to God that nothing bugs out. It can take TEN MINUTES to actually make a functioning party. This is so beyond atrocious, frustrating, and an overall terrible experience. I cannot express how genuinely terrible this is. I don't even understand how this game got through QA. I can't comprehend what possibly goes down in this goddamn company.

Oh, and if you get into a lobby, and someone leaves, may as well just leave yourself. I don't think there's a priority queue at all, so you'll just sit there as the timer runs out and it kicks you out to the main menu. Cool!

Fix. Your. Game.

[b]Update 12/7/2023[/b]

Is it still broken? A little! Same issue about party connections above still happens, but not as often. The lobby problem is STILL an issue, unfilled lobbies are just straight up NOT prioritized by matchmaking.

Game is slightly more balanced now, still has a way to go. Also just had an issue where a killer was able to just trap me in a corner and kill me with no counterplay? Couldn't move through him or anything, and I wasn't facing the wall at all while running. Not good. Also frequently have an issue where hits just don't connect with victims while playing family, and this is ESPECIALLY atrocious when you're using Leatherface's heavy swing. Good luck recovering from that one if it happens to you, basically throws the game half the time.

Also, let me disable auto-aim. Why is there an auto-aim you can't disable? I can aim my swings far better than this terrible system. It just messes me up if they're not running in a straight line, trying to swing at circling survivors with the auto-aim is hell.

I still wouldn't recommend it, though. The game is only fun with friends, alone it's frustrating and having to deal with the game's broken stuff by yourself means you can't just laugh it off with your buddies.",1696022921,1701952540,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

You officially Texas Chainsaw Massacred your own game, and impressively speed-ran pissing off pretty much your entire community in almost every conceivable way possible in the process of doing so. 

The hackers, the bugs, the turning-off cross-play, the ""escape in 1 minute"" Connie play, the incredibly bizarre choices at times of map/perk/skill tree design, being able to start with 2 killers, the killer nerfs, the waiting simulator in the lobbies, and now finally adding in the pay-2-win element which is so unbelievable broken that it's not even subtle anymore where the direction of the game is going.

I tried so many times to give this game 2nd/3rd/4th etc chances, and in fairness, mainly to get my monies worth. There were some fun times and for a while things appeared to be on the up.

In the end it was your greed that hammered the final nail into the coffin. A shame as there was so much potential.

EDIT: 3/10: cross-play removed as a knee jerk reaction to hackers. At this stage I feel I have been mis-sold the product as I purchased it solely to cross-play with my PS5 buddies. I am trying to seek a refund.

Gave this game a good shot but all-in-all a pretty subpar game. At this stage I would say the game is worth around $20. 5/10.

- The game has a variety of game breaking bugs that includes getting stuck in walls, not being able to interact with objects as the victim, or attack as the killer, being kicked out of the game and requiring to reload the game to be able to play (annoying in general, especially if you're attempting to play in a party).

- Maps are generally confusing mazes, learning the layout is more of a chore than an enticing reward. I get the feeling of claustrophobia is cool for the atmosphere, but that is shattered and replaced with frustration at  continually finding yourself in dead ends and even being able to traverse from one side of the map to the other. I think there some be some kind of basic mini-map, or paper map you can pull up to be able to orientate yourself in-game, or even a map to access from the main menu would make the game much more accessible.

- More time is usually spent loading into the match and interacting with the environment by simply holding down/tapping E than actually playing the game. The matches will always start in a similar fashion in the sense as a killer you're like going to be powering up a generator, collecting blood, or as a victim looting boxes for lockpicks. It's almost like even after you've loaded into the game there is another 30 seconds to a minute of what may as well be cut scenes. Lobbies tend to take a long time to boot into the game (for some reason the norm is people down ready up so you're waiting 2-3 minutes before even booting into the aforementioned tedious cutscene and routine opening requirements). This gets boring and repetitive.

- The skill tree doesn't appear to be designed very well, for a couple of reasons:

1) You gain tokens that can be spent across all characters, and you can respec your characters to gain the points back. Where this falls down is:
1a) You spread your points out across characters evenly: everyone of your characters will be similar to play in exception of their unique ability, be very under-powered, have a high likelihood you will be dominated by players who load all their token into one character.
1b) You load all your tokens into one character: you'll find you'll join a server that this character is already taken, and you're left with ending back up in the previously mentioned situation.
2) Some perks are randomly generated, and of course some are much better than others. I imagine the meta will turn into respecing a character over and over until you get these perks, and in the end, everyone will be running a from a small selection of specific setups. This eliminates the point of having a skill tree in the first place. Why not just have each killer and victim having variations everyone can pick from and put everyone on a mostly even playing field?

- There is already many cheese strats that are being utilised that can end the game in a matter of minutes. This appears to be in favour of good victim players. There are popular videos of survivors escaping the map in under a minute. This will soon enough, if it hasn't done so already, turn into the classic DBD scenario of victims knowing exactly where to go and killers likely chasing them around these juke spots while teabagging by the entrance and running around with no fear. This may invoke a ""get gud"" response but honestly for me it's more about playing a game that feels like the killers are a threatening menace and the survivors are having to do just that: survive.

- I appreciate the game is new and people are still learning the ropes but the community seems to have more of a lone-wolf mentality. If there are any comms  they are typically highly toxic. I'm not sure if this is just one of the ""perks"" of playing with console players again, and maybe the dregs from the DBD community have spilled over, but all in all I think in all the hours I've played so far only 2 of my matches have players been actively communicating and utilising teamwork. Granted this is not down to the developers, as they have provided the functionality to be able to work together with voice comms, but that doesn't mean in reality this is part of what you'll get playing this game.

Terrible short-sighted development decisions and at this point I think it is too late for them.

Cook, Hitchhiker AND Nancy can play together??? Are you f'n kidding me!? 
For the rookies who don't know the level of B.S. this creates let me explain.
There are 4 exits, 2 main, 1 power, 1 pressure. Now, they have a player called ""Hitch hiker"" who can place 3 traps down that ensnare you and highlights you for all to see. Another Character is ""Cook"" and he is able to hear you, highlight you and place 3 locks on doors so you'd have to pick twice to get through 1 door. These two combined was a pickle if played right, but fun enough it wasn't broken. Now the balancing part of this was you NEEDED ""Leather Face"" to balance it out.

So, onto what I am not playing this game for and not recommending the game to anyone is.... They allowed Killers to not be required to have Leather Face, which is fine to a degree but it's not just that, its now the combination of ""Nancy"" being thrown into the broken mix. For the new players again, Nancy is able to SEE where you are AND place 3 barbed traps down and with a perk you can get through the upgrade tree, you can have it so she has a 35% chance not consume one of her abilities. SOOO, she can technically place up to sky's the limit based on her luck, I've counted 7 traps before. 

So to put it into perspective. YOU as a VICTIM must exit through 4 options, within those options you must dodge 3 traps, 3 locks, 7 barbed wire snares, cook being able to hear you and highlight you for up to a minute, grandpa yelling forcing you to stop or you're highlighted AND Nancy being able to see exactly where you are. BRAVO, You f*cked your game. 

How to fix this?? Forcing a player to play Leatherface definitely made the matchmaking frustrating because no one wanted to play him so you were left waiting in dead lobbies so dont revert it back. I'd say make it so Leatherface isnt mandatory but put the characters into a class (heavy, Medium, Light) and you cant have more than 2 of the same class. 

Heavy = Leather Face, Johny
Medium = Nancy, Cook, Hitchhiker
Light = Sissy

Then for future updates you can further catagorize into assassins or brutes or whatever if this game sticks around to further add balancing. If NON of this suites your fancy, double the healing items around the map or let them respawn after some time, possibly limit the blood piles Family can pick up or the refresh rate of which they fill up. When I play with my boys we max Grandpa out in 4minutes on every map.... Yea, thats WITH me playing Leatherface lmfao. Imagine a Nancy. 

Anyways, fix this issue before you kill your game!

Killers most lobbies communicate and that’s why they win more games than victims. They need to add a feature where it forces players to be in game chat as it’s hurting the team aspect of the game. Just shows how selfish most console players are where they don’t care to communicate with the team. They think they so good at escaping but they only escape because there’s always someone running the killers around the map and since no communication they end up dying most the time. Console players need to learn to play as a team as communication wins more than actual skills. Please add feature to force console players to be in game chat and if they don’t want to they can go play dead by daylight where players run around like bots guessing what’s going on 😂.

If you want to play the survivor equivalent, buy this instead, as the gameplay is much more engaging. but if you want to play the killer side of either game, you should decide on what you want out of a killer experience and buy whichever based on what each provides. The team play as a killer is super engaging, as well as fun, yet fair, during chases. 
What I cannot get behind though, is the $10 DLC characters. Having DLC be this expensive is ridiculous. If you pay the same amount of money in Dead by Daylight, you can get 2 characters, which is much better value especially when you consider that killers provide much different play styles in that game, and on top of that, give you perks you can use on other characters, giving you more options.

TL;DR - Buy this game over DbD if you want to play survivor, but consider the way each game's killers plays if you want to play killer. If you want to play many killers, buy DbD instead as its DLC is much cheaper and allows you to earn many of its killers for free.",1692381461,1701645334,True,0,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False

The devs are incredibly slow at addressing issues. The game was basically unable due to crashing and error codes during it's launch weekend and those problems persisted for over a month. I see others reporting the game still crashes but the only time it crashes for me is when I hit Exit Game on the main menu. My friends and I do get error codes which prevent us from partying up frequently. One of the maps has a side door that is almost a free escape for victims people were saying is a problem all the way back in the technical test that they are finally addressing in an upcoming update. In fact this upcoming update is addressing things that should have been addressed in it's first month such as PC not having blood trails behind victims like consoles have had since launch. The devs also have a history since the game came out of making changes and not saying anything about it. They have said future updates will be 6-8 weeks apart.

The monetization. I'm not going to go on about the skin prices because everyone else has. I want to talk about the new characters being $10 a piece. That is the same price as a new League of Legends character, which is a F2P game and not $40, and twice that of this game closest competitor being Dead By Daylight. Both of those games I will argue have much more to their characters and higher quality. Another problem is that unlike DBB and LoL you are not promised your character so this games lobby dodging, which already really bad, is going to get much worse as they add more character since you cannot have two of the same.

The community. I'm not talking about the in game community which, aside from very sore winners on the victims side, is pretty good. I'm talking about this games social media platforms like Reddit, which the devs moderate. They are filled with incredibly whinny victims and doomsayers saying the game is dying if the player count drops by 3 at 1 in the morning.  They also have the devs getting into fights with players.

TL;DR it's a fun game held back from technical issues, really slow balance changes and fixes of important or simple things, new characters being too expensive which is very likely to lead to more lobby dodging and one of the worst out of game communities I've ever seen.",1700733328,1701576366,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I brought this game for myself & two other friends & I now genuinely regret it & straight up feel ripped off.

The game felt half baked at launch & despite it's numerous problems it seems they've been more focused on monetising it.  The two new character released are £10 EACH in a £33 game - that's insane.  I understand that for the longevity of a game like this they may need more money, however that should be done in the form of cosmetics (or ya know, actually improving the game to encourage more people to buy it), not by adding expensive paid-for characters to an already paid for game.  

Then on top of that, the new characters are essentially paid to win with extremely strong abilities, the new victim in particular having one of the strongest in the game.  Btw you'll also be paying £10/£20 for a characters that you're not guaranteed to even be able to play as only one person can play each character in a match.  

Finally, the playerbase is rapidly dying - you know what would bring a lot of players back?  New characters!  Yet GUN is fixated on keeping them locked behind a paywall, even at the expense of their own game, which really gives the impression that it's just a cash grab for them.",1701521929,1701522000,False,4,0,0.546108067035675049,0,True,False,False

Streamers used this game like a ****** and left it worse than when it started... And the devs took the bait.
Devs couldn't differentiate Steam vs Game Pass users so they decided to remove PC to console matchmaking and friend invites for weeks as a consequence of not implementing EAC in the latter platform.  The consequences have been sowed, despite the problem being fixed.
Fix the close encounter win turning into an instant death bug.
Secondarily, the mixed signals from the notes on what you want victims to do is offputting.  You want us to be stealthy?  Well you have Grandpa Lv. 5 before we can even reach an exit and no point on going for the depleted bone piles now.  You want us to go quick?  Well we get punished with 500 noise indicators.  What the fuck do you want from us?!
DCs for no reason in half of the matches that I can even get into as well.
Overlaying menus still have not been fixed.  If you get into a menu and you're forced into another menu due to a change in game state, you get into menu purgatory unless you smash your keyboard.
Bodyblocking basement exits means you have to make a wider exit if Sissy of all people can block it.
Playerbase is either so low because of the changes that it takes way too long for victims or the game is too starved for killers because I'm seeing the same 3-5 people playing again and again or the matchmaking is so abysmal that I can't get anyone aside from the same 3-5 people again and again.

Review before 11/27:
Crossplay is still disabled in case anyone's wondering about that.

The devs keep making changes that are 1 step forward and 2 steps backward.  Agitator is getting changed after the 3 bone scrap nerf so that games are just a ""wait until the family can get grandpa max to see you and heat seek you"" simulator. 
They're also looking into stealth and perk ""balancing"".  What they mean is make a shittier DBD experience where stealth no longer is a factor.

Why can't you just work on the bug fixes first and THEN balance the game afterwards?  It took them until now to address the family stun issue and hitchhiker traps.

Do not purchase.  I regret ever getting this game.  This genre is forever cursed.



Below are prior reviews.

Sept. 19, 2023 review: The third times paper already gearing up to be competitive.  Do not get the game if you're expecting a fun experience.  Just fix the bugs and leave out nerfing/buffing until after you fix everything.

Sept. 12, 2023 review: update still hasn't re-introduced crossplay, do not get if you're expecting to play with friends on console yet.  Updates seem to be coming out in regular intervals now, which is positive.

Good changes:
Lobby timer has been reduced to 3 minutes.  No one liked the 5 minute change.
Cook XP bug is fixed.
Car battery is on at the start of match.
Perking up achievement fixed.
Secondary hitchhiker trap bug is fixed.
Respec in Lobby removed.  Though honestly they should just remove leveling in lobby too.  Loadout changing is fine, but I'd rather not wait the entire time for someone to level from 0 to 10.

Well-known bugs still in the game that haven't been fixed to any degree (or were left unannounced):
Hitchhiker trapping ladder glitch (if it is fixed, they worded it very poorly to only be fixed on gaps, not the well into sky falling part)
Sissy regular attack slows
Loss of camera control after turning on fuse box.
Grandpa cutscene overheating.

Changes that are too far:
Bone scraps are being limited to 3, which is too harsh if there's 4 victims that each would like 1 scrap, but it seems they expect 3v3s to be the norm from now on.  If they limited each pile on a per person basis, that would be better.
  Not everyone is going to be bringing all stun/fight perks all the time, I'd rather Lelands solely get punished rather than the whole group.  Bone scraps only come into the environment if it's replaced with a consumable or permanent object like health or fuse.  Unless people are actively switching those out to give Lelands bone scraps in some circus-level trading, this wouldn't be an issue.
  This also presents a really bad problem with Sissy's early grandpa feeding, making some areas pretty much bare of scraps if someone hogs them all and everyone else can't find one to stab him with.  People going solo because they can't play with their friends yet only to find no bone scraps is an upcoming issue.
  This will make me actively avoid games with Leland with fight perks equipped, which I'd rather not do.  Wasn't the whole point of the lobby fill change to make it EASIER to get into lobbies?  Why do this?  I still can't play with friends anyways so this change is starting to sour queueing up solo.
  PLEASE do not be like DBD where Solo and SWF caused an imbalance to favor only playing with friends.





Below is for Sept. 5, 2023 pre and post confirmation changes.

 They decided to go through with the changes.  My points below still stand as even with clarity on the two changes (which one doesn't matter regardless, anti-cheat on gamepass should be a day 1 thing, not a week 3+ thing).  The 6 player lobby thing was a day 1 issue since there were issues getting the 7th player on that day, but by day 2 and onward, that issue resolved itself.  There was no reason for a non-issue at this point to become part of the patch.  Not only that, but the lobby timer increased.  That's not the problem, the problem is that one person doesn't ready up for the extent of the lobby timer.  Secondarily to that, no one wants to play Leatherface half the time and that stalls the lobby timer 30 seconds each time.  I had a lobby that lasted well over 5 minutes before the update because it would keep bouncing back the timer due to no Leatherface and I removed myself from that lobby after realizing that.

Secondarily, the responses by the dev team, or rather by the ""Brand Strategy Lead"", mattshotcha, have been antagonizing when valid criticisms have been brought up.  This is very concerning as it very much makes it seem like they don't seem to want to listen to the community's feedback.[url=old.reddit.com/r/TXChainSawGame/comments/16allha/server_interruption/jz7yepy/?context=3] Here [/url] [url=old.reddit.com/r/TXChainSawGame/comments/16allha/server_interruption/jz7y015/?context=3] are [/url] [url=old.reddit.com/r/TXChainSawGame/comments/16a73sy/changed_lobbies_will_now_launch_with_6_players/jz6l8uo/?context=3] some [/url]  [url=old.reddit.com/r/TXChainSawGame/comments/16allha/server_interruption/jz85awo/?context=3] examples [/url]

Below is the previous review regarding the changes.  The only parts that were removed were anything time-relevant that are now irrelevant.

  I'd say don't get this if you want to play with friends on different consoles or expecting full lobbies now that they're allowing 6 man ready ups (3-v-4 family to victim) in favor of the family since family can just wait with no LF until it becomes a 3-v-3 since LF is required to start (Edit, my point is that Leatherface isn't autoforced on someone, like Jason in F13).
The pool for PC players is going to be smaller and with a higher chance of hackers showing up.  These issues are going to be too big to ignore until they make another change regarding the two biggest parts of the patch notes for Sept. 5 2023.",1693878115,1701500376,False,7,0,0.531814157962799072,0,True,False,False

===Pros===
=Fun with friends=
=Encourages teamwork=
=New and somewhat fresh take on this style of game in my opinion=
=Cross-platform play=

===Cons===

=POOR AUDIO MIXING= Though I have played around with my audio settings, I find a lot of important sounds are often drowned out by other sounds and I have yet to fix that.

=POOR LIGHTING= While I understand it's a horror game and it is intended to be dark and spoopy. The transitions between light areas to dark areas are terrible. You can't see anything for a few seconds as your character's eyes adjust to the light. Then there is the matter of the darkness in the game in general.

=LOBBIES= There is no punishment for leaving a lobby, which I think this game would benefit greatly from.

Paying $5 for one outfit with different color variants is crazy. Paying $10 for ONE character is crazier. I got the game while it was on sale for $30 and it wasn't that great of a purchase. It takes about 5 minutes to find a lobby and it takes another 5 minutes to start a match due to people wanting to play certain characters and lobby hopping. Also, there is no MMR.

The pros: It was good while it lasted.
The cons: Everything about this game including the incompetent devs that are too greedy to throw a bone to their community or have any sense of good business practice. Their previous game Friday the 13th game was abandoned due to legal issues, which I believed why the state of that game was so poor, but seeing the lack of content happen again on their NEWEST game along with PAY-WALLING content when they offered so little for what you are paying for. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Avoid this GAME at ALL COSTS and save your money. 


Wanna know what $40 in the steam store? 
3 maps. IF anyone says that its 6 maps because there is a day/night cycle, they are clowns and they are trying to get you to be a part of the circus. 

5 survivors 

5 killers 

Wanna play the new survivor? 10 dollars
Wanna play the new killer? 10 dollars

60 dollars for a game where the the content is so little and new content will be behind a paywall.
I would not be complaining if the first 2 killers/survivors were free and we had at least 5 maps to play.

They were kind enough to allow the community to play the new maps without slapping a price tag on it. 
Though they more than likely didn't put a price tag on it because it would further divide the community.

There was no Halloween event when the community had expected it. Instead they released paid cosmetics during the Halloween period.

I am not against giving money to a company and I firmly believe in supporting companies that make content that you enjoy, but I am not blind to the companies that try to rob their consumers money with little effort thrown into their product. 

I'll be more than happy to change my review in the future if they change their ways, but based off their previous behavior, I don't think they will. This game feels more of a cash grab with how they have so far handled the game. 

Is this game worth 40 dollars? NO. NO. NO. NO. NO

Is it worth 15 dollars? Yeah its a good game for that price. You'll enjoy the game for about 15 hours before it feels repetitive and the maps feel too similar(underground).

The newest map is different thankfully, but that's all I have to really say about it.

Buy at your own DISCRETION, though I highly recommend waiting on a steep sale. It is not worth it's current price tag, and it might end up dying before it ever reaches, if ever, it's current price tag of 40 dollars.",1701394051,1701394051,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have never seen the movie but I am really enjoying this game. Much better than Dead by Daylight...

Everything feels well balanced, there's no bugs or game-breaking mechanics. The gameplay loop is simple enough to enjoy while sitting and relaxing, but engaging enough that the game doesn't feel boring even after a few hours of playing.

Picked it up during the Steam Autumn Sale 2023 to play with friends and family.

[h3] [u] PROS [/u] [/h3]
-Lots of replay-ability; There's many characters you can play on either team, and many routes/strategies to play and win the game for a game that's basically
-Character/playstyle customization--there's an extensive points/perks system in order to customize and fine-tune the characters to fit your playstyle.
-Entertaining dialogue between characters, reminds me a bit of [i] Warhammer: Vermintide 2 [/i] in that regard, but with different IP flavor.
-Such incredible attention to detail and fanservice for fans of the Massacre Franchise.
-CROSSPLAY! I can play with my friends that prefer PS5 and Xbox <3 

[h3] [u] CONS [/u] [/h3]
-Bugs. Mostly visual glitches, but I've occasionally had sessions where I get disconnected randomly.
-No rejoining matches once you've left, or at least none I've seen on Steam. This might be a solution for disconnects.
-No minimap or compass, for either team. This makes communication very difficult when you're trying to let a teammate know where the enemy is. Ofc it's more immersive and ""realistic,"" but it's incredibly frustrating when you're shouting that you saw a victim running, and all you can say is ""they're running towards the thing"" or ""they're over by me,"" to which your teammate replies with a flustered ""where the hell is that?""
-Unfortunately I cannot add randos from other platforms as ""friends"" so may play with them again. Would love this added as a feature. Idk how it would work across platforms, but I can always dream :D

[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]
Overall this game is very fun to play with randos or with friends, and the devs continue to add new content. If you have any love for this genre of games, hide and seek with extra steps, or simply love to immerse yourself in authentic, classic horror movie goodness, you should definitely pick up this game and support it as it develops further.",1701322700,1701322700,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The lack of respect for the consumers money and happiness is just so bad.

I really want to make it clear that 10€ for the amount of effort and reused assets that went into them is awful.

Also they fumbled the bag very badly when designing core aspects of the game such as balancing and the skill tree.

Locking perks within paths that you pick, in the skill tree, is unfun and generally just bad design. It conflicts with a perks main gimmick and that is to spice up your gameplay, making it unique and allowing the player to switch between different playstyles. Except you dont get to do that here. There is also a loadout system that is rendered useless due to the fact that you can only have ~ 1-2 active builds. You have to reset the tree in order to choose a different path, why? I have to spend minutes redoing the skill tree just to change my playstyle? Its so useless and feels like forced extended playtime. And the cherry untop of it is that some of the perks are random when you pick them, so you arent even guaranteed to get the build you want.

Now about the balancing... I cant really break every aspect of this game appart, since im no game designer but one thing is clear... Its slow paced, there is a lot of room for cinematics and is meant to be played casually. Except thats not what it does, people are very likely to treat this as a competitive experience and since there are things such as perks, abilities and exploits that are either useless, good or absolutely broken, people will use them and redefine what is game is actually meant to be.

I enjoy both Victim and Family game play however I prefer to play Victim.  Most of the time it is a big challenge because now that the game has been out for a while, players are very experienced and make it very difficult to escape, sometimes I can't even make it out of the basement. Everything can go wrong from one second to the other, and just as well, things can just flow perfectly and you're out in a couple of minutes.

I like the fact that the developers listen to player's feedback and until now they've changed and fixed a lot things that made the game sometimes frustrating. In addition to that, now there are new characters and a new map. As long as they keep adding stuff regularly and fixing what needs to be fixed, this game might endure. I do believe the prices for the new skins and characters is a little high, tho.

The graphics are great, everything feels real and immersive, sometimes you even feel like you're playing the movie itself, they did a great job with that.
There are several perks and ability points you can decide where to use and there are tons of different build combinations you can do for your characters, both Family or Victims, depending on how you want to play, there are so many strategies on how to face the game and even for each map.

I DO NOT recommend this game, and this view is based on two factors in particular: game balance and ethics.

The game is 3 family members vs 4 victims. The goal of the victims is to escape, and the goal of the family members is to prevent the victims escaping. The developers have long been clear on their stance that the game should be family-favoured but in my opinion they have been taking it way too far, especially with the latest update.

Victims can escape by activating a fuse box, a pressure valve, or by unlocking doors and turning off a generator / car battery. To keep a long story short, the fuse box was made practically unviable in previous updates and the latest update has made the pressure valve unviable. This means that despite victims having 5 different skillsets to customize for various playstyles, the only remaining way that makes sense is to spec for unlocking doors. It makes it super hard to win as a victim, it kills variety in victim loadouts and has really pushed me off the game.

In the latest update, they have added a victim character and a family character that both cost real money to obtain. This is literally pay to win, when functionally unique playable characters are behind paywalls, This is a cardinal sin in my book and is the second reason I do not recommend the game.",1701215077,1701215077,False,7,2,0.564971327781677246,0,True,False,False

Graphics: The graphics are lovely! Seriously they are some superb graphics in the game and it's a joy to have the good detail with a stable high frame rate. It's visually nice!

Audio: Like the graphics, the audio is good. The way the characters interact with each other in game as dialogue, to the noises to the engine noises, it's all very nice!

Controls: They added keybind changing AFTER the game was released, which is bizarre from a 2023 game... Either way, I use a controller because I find it easier with this game. It's not a lot of buttons to press thankfully but overall good stuff!

Game-play and everything else after: So the game is a glorified 'hide and seek' which to be fair it's a good one!

It has some aspects of dead by trashlight and some Friday the 13th. (I cannot stand the mind numbing dead by daylight, it's painful low level IQ gaming) anyway!

There are 4 survivors (Victims) and 3 family (Killers) and each have their own objectives! 

As a victim, you need to complete set tasks (Quiet a few might I add) to escape and get out alive. Each victim character has their own abilities and mechanics to aid you in survival.

Each character has skins, abilities, XP and skills to unlock making you better in the game... Most of the time it's fine tuning the experience to your liking.

As the family, you need to stop the victims at all costs and each family relative has their own perks and abilities to make the game mechanics easier.

I've played quiet a few games and only ran into 4 people who actually used their mic to talk and communicate being friendly. The rest of the time team mates DO NOT use their mic and work as a team at all. Again, these need to be reported as not team work players... In a game that NEEDS team work!

There is quiet a bit of toxic people in here though! Which is sad because they ruin the experience! Sadly, as I write this review.. You cannot report them! There does need to be some sort of system to report these people or downvote them at the end of each match, that way they are partied together with people of their own kind.

There is not a lot of maps, I am going to say 3? Could be 4 but seriously feels like 3 and it REALLY does need more to keep the gameplay fun because repeating the same maps over and over is boring so you'll find 2 or 3 matches and you are done.

I've had a few matches where from the start the killers are RUSHED like insane speed to the victims and killed them... Toxic game play. I've had others where people troll messing around, then others with killers who just do not care and are a waste of time and effort (One match a killer was just sitting at the top of the ladder slashing the entire game to stop people going up.... It's sad because the game is very enjoyable when you take those people out of it

There is not a lot of skins in that aspect and they are meh, but it's brand new as I write this review and the devs need some major work on the game to make it better.

The killers DO need a nerf OR buff the survivors at least because there is a huge HUGE imbalance between!

There are little things that are annoying (Apart from the no team work none mic users) like when in a 1vs1 fight, if a killer comes over there is no point to fight, just die. Jumping down a well or ladder is a slow animation and you can take damage if a killer swings at you, which shouldn't be allowed... (If anyone said well it's realistic, well no it's not. Who being chased would go to a well or ladder, STOP and then go slow down it? You would not! You would hand on and two feet over and down in a fast method... It's silly!

On the other hand, I do feel the game warrants a negative view as well! At the time of this updated review, they have fixed a huge amount of bugs BUT they then want £8.50 for a character for the new characters and cosmetic skins... this is laughable after the current standards and it does cement a reason that the Devs are getting greedy FAST!

I would recommend this game on sale and giving less money to the devs for recent antics and blatant disregard for the community.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, it's a good fun game and do not get me wrong, it is enjoyable when you get the right matches!",1692815284,1701198386,True,32,5,0.596031725406646729,0,True,False,False

It's no surprise coming from Gun Media, who brought us the excellent Friday the 13th: The Game.  Of course, that game ended stuck in the middle of a legal dispute between rights-holders, but the game itself was an absolute blast to play with friends and still holds up as more fun than most.

TCSM picks up where F13 left off and ups the ante to a coordinated team game of 3v4, where the Family of killers are still dangerous on their own but require solid coordination in order to stop the escape of the 4 victims.  Set in a gorgeous adaptation of the 1974 film's aesthetics and environments, the game utilizes excellent visuals and audio to provide a tense, deadly game of cat-and-mouse.  Locations from the film are accurately and lovingly translated into game maps that are packed full of detail and lore.  The characters, both familiar to fans of the film (Leatherface, Cook & Hitchhiker) and newly designed canon prequel (Sissy, Johnny and the victims), are represented with excellent voice acting and interactions within the game.  If victims are near each other they will talk to each other, and Family similarly interact as they pass on the maps.  It brings the entire game experience to a more cinematic level, like you are playing a new short prequel film set before the events of the 1974 film, albeit one that is very ""Groundhog Day""-esque since it usually ends in death but restarts in the next lobby.

The biggest challenge so far in the life of the game has been the developers being forced to combat the expat playerbase from the ""biggest"" asymmetric horror game on the market who don't care about aesthetics and design intent and have come to rush, sweat, and teabag all over the labor of love that is TCSM.  Luckily, Gun has stuck to its original vision and patches have been released to dial in the gameplay back towards rewarding stealth and pacing over noise and speed.  That, and lobby timers as victims need some significant help.  For some reason, Family is less popular to play (I find both sides extremely fun personally) so playing a victim results in a much longer wait to get in a game.  Family queue times are almost instant, so if you are looking to get game time in simply switch sides.

Time will tell if TCSM is able to maintain this momentum and build upon an excellent foundation.  The devs have laid out a clear vision in their Q&As and social media, and as long as they keep pushing forward I have high hopes this game will survive a long time since the core gameplay is MUCH more fun and satisfying than the ""biggest"" competitor on the market.  Content and balance will need to continue to frequently arrive but so far it has been a solid effort and I have no reservations about recommending this game.",1701179363,1701179363,True,1,0,0.503105580806732178,0,True,False,False

I've enjoyed playing it a lot so far, and it is a nice change of pace from DBD. I almost never find myself bored in any match, which is something that happens all too often in other games.

Pros:
-Fun interactive gameplay with many different tools and escape options
-Is very team based, but can play casually as well if prefered and still have a fun time
-Perks and game progression is fun, it makes every game different and variety
-Playing as the different characters is fun and changes things up: Both for Family and Victims

Cons:
-Lobby times are horrendous. Sometimes I have waited 20 or 25 minutes for a game. Needs to be fixed soon
-You can't always play as the characters you want. This is because only one of each character is allowed per lobby.
-Too expensive. This game being $40 is bad enough for a game with the amount of bugs and fixes it needs, but the DLC characters cost $10 for each individual character. Paying $10 for a character you might not be able to play is foolish in my opinion.
-Since launch there have been many bugs, but most of them are being addressed at least. Some quicker than others, but sometimes pretty slow.

Overall, I know there are lots of cons to this game, but I've still had a great time playing it nonetheless.

TCM cannot be played with an attitude that it is a copy of DBD or that it should be a better copy of DBD. This is more like a game of same genre but things work a lot different. It's more slow paced, encourages stealthy plays and strategic thinking yet still being more casual experience in a relaxing way. The game is less toxic than DBD, even though some of the baffoons have found their way in TCM to smear the games with their feces

Biggest problem of TCM is the fact that it is made for console markets. That's why the price of the game and DLCs are extremely high, and due to console game pricing the cost will not go down a lot for long time. The performance is not very optimized for PC and if you get weird stutter in game, try putting the graphics settings to High.  The game runs a lot better that way or some performance issues might disappear (= game might run better on High settings for you than with Low settings). FPS itself is not a problem as long as you avoid the stuttering issue with said settings. It can be difficult to enjoy the game before you understand how to play which might require about 2-4 hours. You should start as killer to keep things simple

Regardless of the price TCM is worth it especially during sales in case you like games of this genre.  The game does not try to emulate DBD, so don't expect to loop and outrun killers the same way. Neither expect to be able to bully 1 killer since there will be multiple of them, and in theory you can die by 1shot+mori wherever and whenever",1701016363,1701126795,True,3,0,0.529605269432067871,0,True,False,False

 [*] Exploits - With the game being new, it is littered of abusable mechanics from both sides.
 [*] Bad netcode - The netcode is poor. Sometimes you can't hit victims even if they are standing right in front of you and you will just continuously swing at air.

Right off the bat, the big selling point for me is the inclusion of Leatherface's family. The family dynamic has always been a big part of the franchise and just having Leatherface by himself would miss what makes 'Texas' special. Never in a million years did I think I would be able to play as Jim Siedow and it's a blast. 

There's a lot of love put into replicating the original film's setting and aesthetic. The family house has been meticulously recreated and expanded upon and the other maps feel right at home with Hooper's film. The game is often beautiful to look at in terms of the Texas scenery.

Gameplay wise, I've played as both victim and family and I think it's 'fair'. There have been times where everyone escapes and there have been times where everyone is killed. As a victim I've been killed most of the time but it makes it more rewarding when I've been able to survive. There are issues but the developers have been addressing them and I haven't had any major problems.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre video game plunges players into a harrowing experience inspired by the iconic horror film. With its intense atmosphere and relentless tension, this game successfully captures the essence of terror.

Graphics and Sound:
The game's visuals are chillingly realistic, immersing players in the eerie landscapes of rural Texas. The attention to detail in character design and environments adds a visceral layer to the horror. The sound design, featuring unsettling ambient noises and the revving of chainsaws, amplifies the sense of dread, making every step a nerve-wracking ordeal.

Gameplay:
Players navigate through a nightmarish setting, solving puzzles and avoiding the iconic chainsaw-wielding antagonist. The survival aspect is heightened by scarce resources, creating a constant struggle for survival. The controls are intuitive, enhancing the immersive experience, but the difficulty curve can be punishing, making each encounter with the menacing Leatherface a heart-pounding ordeal.

Story:
Staying true to the film's narrative, the game offers a compelling storyline that unfolds as players progress. The incorporation of the film's iconic scenes adds a nostalgic touch for fans, while the game introduces new elements to keep even seasoned horror enthusiasts on edge.

Replayability:
While the initial playthrough delivers a gripping experience, the limited variety in gameplay mechanics might hinder long-term engagement. Additional content or alternative story paths could have enhanced replayability, but the fear factor remains potent, encouraging players to revisit the horror.

Overall, Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a commendable entry into the horror game genre. It effectively translates the intensity of the film into interactive horror, providing an immersive and spine-chilling experience for fans of the genre. Though it may not revolutionize the gaming landscape, it successfully taps into the primal fear that made the original film a classic.",1694299724,1701012539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. Take so long just to find a match, and the character i wanted to play always got picked
3. Still buggy and game crashes sometime, connection not stable, a lot of people just got dced. 
4. Always see people fighting over characters (Both family/Victim). Why cant we play with multiple same characters? it can be fun if other family is starting in the basement. 
5. dont think in the waiting room family should be able to talk to victim. Toxic taunting

1. If you have a stand alone microphone like myself (Blue Yeti, Snowball, Rode, etc), the voice chat in the game may not work for you as it hasn't for my friend and I. I have followed the troubleshooting guide from the devs which did not fix the issue. This issue is very particular to myself but find it very irritating as I cannot use a core component of the game.

2. You have to recreate your party after every match if you decide to leave the match after you and your party have died or escaped but the game is still going. It disbands your party everytime which gets annoying after a while as sometimes you die within the first 5 mins (which is fine)

3. For streamers in particular if it concerns you... parties in this game have an invite code system except the code is not hidden by default and constantly displays the invite code on the home screen at the bottom. There is no option to hide the code so you are stuck with the code being constantly displayed.

4. Bugs are pretty frequent with this game, granted it is a new release so I won't give them too much shade but some can be pretty annoying. including gate hopping where the if you close a gate on yourself it can push you upwards and out of bounds which is irritating as people usually use it to troll. Another is if you open the player list which transitioning from death animation to spectate makes the player list stuck on your screen until you restart the game.

5. And of recent they have removed crossplay for PC players due to cheaters being a big issue in this game. So queue times will get longer unfortunately. Especially since cheaters can spoof what device they are playing on. Making it look like they're on console when they're not.

TL:DR>>> Game needs to do some quality of life improvements and fix bugs that are pretty frequent and abusable. As well as all PC players being punished for a small percentage of PC players actions. Great gameplay and dynamic player interaction but a lot of bugs and annoying $h!t.",1693867089,1700975411,False,5,0,0.50714576244354248,0,True,False,False

There've been a lot of complaints over the launch state of the game, from rampant cheating, highlighting a lot of balancing problems, and even big differences that the devs either acknowledge or dismiss between PC and console versions. 

Victim tactics;
Looping - there's no pallet drops, instead there's infinite slide/crawl loops and survivor only vaulting spots that can be broken by Bubba.

Distraction - bodyblocking is still a thing, but more risky here. Distraction from noise and baiting with aura reading similar to DbD.

Stealth - You can hide quite well in this game, as the dark corners appear a lot darker for Family than Victims. Aura reading doesn't happen much from Gramps unless he is at full lv5, and Cook can only target one player for himself. Several other perks give conditional aura readings, like dropping down a well will highlight a player for a few seconds.

Offensive - no flashlights, instead you have a bone shiv that can be a backstab stun, or a risky struggle fight.
If it's a Family 2v1 then struggle fight means instant death for the victim.
If any other family member touches you during that struggle animation, you're dead. Even if you've won the struggle, you'll be instantly killed.

Other things such as Door Slam stuns have been a hotly contested subject between community players and the devs, that's the closest thing to a pallet stun. It used to be a no limit and infinite stun loop that all players can perform on each other.

Ghosting - in-game VoIP, but limited to teams only. So they do callouts and relay information even while they are dead to other players by spectating teammates.

Exits - TCM has 4 different exit objectives, which each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some exit gates are timed, while others are just far away out in the open with a ton of locks and traps on them. If the Family members don’t do their job to turn on some generators, Victims can easily escape and win in less than 2 minutes.

Family tactics;
Chase - This is fairly basic, almost like an M1 Killer chase. Bubba has the weakest chase, but strongest hit, and can destroy survivor only vault spots. Cook is good at tracking, and Hitchhiker is great at endurance chases since he can slip and crawl.
But with the addition of teammates, you can corner a Victim during a chase. Unlike in DbD you need to have a Killer ability to corner them.

Camping - There isn't camping Victims in this. You might be able to try to corner them, but whether if Victims run the wrong dead-end route, it is more their fault for entering a dead spot.

Patrol - DbD Killer 3-gen is probably the closest thing to patrolling in TCM, since each Family member needs to do their route almost perfectly. Otherwise, it leaves an easy escape opening.

Pressure - Putting pressure on Victims here is a bit different than DbD. DbD you're regressing gen. There's no regressing anything here. Once a padlock lockpicking progression is made, it is kept there for good. Once a padlock is broken and unlocked, it is broken forever. Once an objective is set up, it is done for good, and just acts as a switch. (E.G. Pressure Gate/Fusebox just flip back on)

Teamwork: Family members can be helpful or hurtful. Those who don't do their load of the work will make a match a lot more difficult. Such as not feeding Gramps, not turning on power gens, not locking doors, etc.
You can see how it can be a clean sweep if one Family member is AFK or d/c.

Roles: You have to play your roles.
Such as if a pressure gate has started charging up. Bubba has to run to guard the gate. As he is the only one that can one-shot a survivor.
Hitchhiker setup the traps at the gate, if he has any left to set, otherwise everyone else has to run to try to turn off the Pressure tank before it opens.

HP/Killings:
Here you can probably take 8-10 hits from the Hitchhiker and Cook. While taking 1-5 hits from Bubba. There's no second chance, if Victim is downed by a Family member they are dead.
If the Victim hurts themselves and bleeds out, they are given a second chance to revive themselves. If they bleed out a second time, they die. You don't need Victim teammates to revive you, and you can't help Victims out of snares. (or at least I didn't see an action prompt when trying)

Match Duration:
Average speedrun for Victims exiting is less than 5 minutes.

Hard to say what the average match is for TCM since it really depends whether the Family and Victims knows what they are doing. But usually less than 10 minutes if Gramps is fed, callouts are happening, stuff is being locked up, etc.",1700851783,1700851783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also there are some minor visual bugs too but nothing really worth of mentioning, except animations when sometimes killing a player leads to his character's body to be broken in every was possible. Sometimes it's fun to see and not really a big deal if you ask me. 

Introduced skill tree and perk system is okay but requires a bit of balancing with character abilities as well, since some characters are obviously stronger than the others. Every time you level up any character using a skill tree, you get attribute points to upgrade that particular character's characteristics. The only thing you can't manipulate by those points is a character's speed, other than that you can do whatever and make an absolute monster with busted characteristics(tons of stamina or absurd amount of damage if playing as a killer, etc).

While playing as victims(survivors) you will see Sonny getting hooked and slashed by Bubba in a cutscene every match because of his inability to do something good enough, so rarely anyone plays him. As a victim, the game awards you for being aggressive which could be a good and a bad thing at the same time, depends on how you see it. Stealth is meh, except in some situations when you really want to lose a killer(to finish an objective or heal for example). The more people will get better in this game, the less you will see someone use this mechanic a lot. 

Despite clunky release, the game is lots of fun, especially when playing with friends. Great graphics, good audio/sounds, entertaining gameplay for both sides(better than holding down left mouse button on a generator, if you know you know). The only thing that keeps me worried at this moment is the content they can potentially add to the game or I should say the lack of that content. Developers are really tied to a license which doesn't allow them to add whatever or things that they would like to. So sooner or later everyone is going to get bored with the same 3 maps and couple of characters everyone plays over and over again(most likely with some leveled up busted characteristics as I said before), which will lead to drastic playerbase decrease in about a year or so. 

I hope developers will figure everything out and get a clear vision of their product at least for couple of years ahead. Other than that this game is a solid product, 8/10.

Edit: Lately I had a game where 2 or 3 survivor friends tried to speedrun the escape from family map using basement exit(via fuse box). Unfortunately for them I was ready and trapped it with hitchhiker's bone trap. They gave their best to run me around and slam me with doors. Sometime it was really sus how they knew every time when I was approaching the doors in general and which doors exactly, so they were slamming them on me from inside(and running outside from the room while I was laying on the ground). I learned my lesson and after couple of stuns they couldn't do anything or disarm the trap on fuse box, so eventually they gave up and just crushed the server. Cheating was an issue during beta but on release everything seemed good so far. Looks like cheating is going to be on the issues list again soon. 

These are the times I wish Steam had mixed review button.

Upd: DLC-s cost more than they should and game became boring really soon. Since release, playerbase is decreasing every single month and keeps going that way. As I said earlier in this review, in about a year the game will be dead. Buy it if you really liked a gameplay or you are a big fan of the franchise.",1692629951,1700849539,True,3,0,0.556737601757049561,0,True,False,False

I am ultimately going to recommend The Texas Chain Saw Massacre because I do truly feel that the game-play loop is fun, the characters are varied and engaging to play, and it certainly looks the part.

However some of the post launch decisions by the developers have been concerning, to say the least:

- Disabling cross-play for over a month for PC players rather than effectively deal with rampant cheaters.
- Charging money for extra kill animations on launch day.
- £13.49 for ONE SKIN for Leatherface (which does look cool, but ain't no way I'm spending that amount of money for one skin).

The game still has a healthy enough population despite this, and is on the Xbox Gamepass if you want to perhaps try it beforehand, there are a ton of bugs and connection issues, especially if you are using third party applications such as MSI Afterburner etc, so do be warned, patches have been pretty slow since launch, and day one bugs still persist.

NOW, ONTO THE GAME ITSELF...

 The game itself is ok, BUT...
Make a map of the big house from 'TCM the beginning' and put Sheriff Hoyt(The best character) in please!!!

Why in gods earth would you put Sissy (Loretta) in? she's not even present in the original, OR a killer at all. No TCM character spits poison like some sort of dragon.

I hope the first patch will also fix all frame rate issues. As soon as u see a killer, it drops from 60 to 20fps. Resulting in you not being able to get away.

Edit: The devs are still retarded!!!

I don't even play cus now, this game is just a disappointment. I just watch my bro and he tells me things, like the fact that they STILL haven't nerfed anything that needs to be nerfed.

While I do like this game, I can't recommend it in it's current state.

Due to map imbalance, family players being forced to play Leatherface, or expected to play Cook+Hitchhiker combo and players on both sides wanting to play a specific character that's already taken, there's a lot of lobby dodging. It can take 10+ minutes to find a match while in a lobby with other players.

There's a lot of technical issues too. With peer to peer hosting, expect lag and sync issues. Disconnections, ping and credential errors, etc. You can also clip into the environment and get stuck, as well as suffer frame drops when a lot of action is happening.

The progression system is too grindy and with random perks that require a lot of resets to find what you want, it can feel tedious and discourages experimentation.

There's also some exploits on both sides which can ruin the fun for people that don't want to use exploits.

There's future patches that will hopefully address these issues and the base game is a lot of fun, when it works.",1700754788,1700754788,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

- STUNNING Graphics and sound design & voicelines!
- Really Fun (Bonus points if you're with friends)
- Great gameplay / mechanics
- Shirtless Johnny confirmed!!!!
- Great developers that listen to feedback
- Has some really intense matches
- Highly impressive attention to detail and accuracy of the film!
- Tons more (you'll see for yourself)

Cons:
- Had a lot of issues to begin with, but the devs are really good at communicating with the community and receiving our feedback and fixing them in updates. Quite a few things have already been fixed and theres more to come! This includes the upcoming update with new content & 250+ fixes!
- Sometimes the community can be really toxic and not sure if the report system works, best just to mute them.
- Match can sometimes crash when a victim disconnects mid-kill (might be fixed in the upcoming update, not sure as still awaiting for patch notes)

Overall thoughts:
11/10. Worth playing, just give the devs a chance and they are proving to us how passionate they are about the game and are working endlessly to our feedback and giving us the changes we want to make an awesome game!

It is clearly a summation of Gun Interactive's time with Friday the 13th, and is designed with love and care from its licensed source. There is a lot to love about this game - and a lot of love was put into it.

However, at this moment in time, this game is not for me.

My biggest issues and concerns are as follows (as someone who chose Victim):

- [b]Poor Optimization[/b]: Immediately after downloading the game, I crashed at the very beginning of my first match. Not a good sign. This unfortunately continued, both because of random crashes (which completely closes the game out), as well as the infamous ""Supplied Credentials are invalid"" error. I crashed 4-5 times before I could even really experience the game. This severely dampened my trust of the game's stability.

- [b]Concerning Queues[/b]: I had read reviews of the queue times not being particularly good, but I assumed the best when I purchased the game. Truthfully, the wait time is not necessarily bad - what makes it bad is the fact that people can easily ruin a lobby. From people not wanting to play Leatherface, from Victims leaving because they don't want to wait [i]FOR[/i] a Leatherface, to people outright leaving just before the game starts, therefore resetting the lobby timer.

- [b]Lackluster Tutorials[/b]: The tutorials the game provides does not effectively ""train"" players how to play. I understand that a game like this requires regular play and practice; however, as a casual player through-and-through, I should NOT be expected to learn every tip and trick from the get-go, let alone remember what characters do what, understand where key items are, and how the maps are laid out. It was obscenely difficult to get my bearings in my matches because I had to remember where I was, where I was going, and what I was looking for - but I would be dead before I could make sense of it.

- [b]Oppressive Beginnings[/b]: As a new player, I understood that a variety of perks/stats would not be available to me. However, my time spent watching YouTube videos about the game made me severely underestimate how oppressive the base starting perks/stats are. Everything you are expected to do - opening tool boxes, unlocking doors, removing barricades, etcetera - is such a time sink (and an easy death sentence if you choose to ignore the noise warning) when you are a new player.

As a whole, I truly do love the concept of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Yet with poor optimization and a less-than-friendly starting experience, I felt like I was unable to truly [i]PLAY[/i] the game. I was overloaded with mechanics, maps, and tools, all the while dreading another crash or error. 

My final match of the night was the first time I actually survived and escaped from the Family. Unfortunately, it did not feel rewarding. It was a stark realization that a casual player like me - someone who plays a variety of games irregularly and randomly - would never really feel like a star player (or, at the very least, an effective teammate).",1700716012,1700719254,False,2,0,0.521494388580322266,0,True,False,False

The game is incredibly team-based and you may need to rely on that mic to be functioning and not sound like youre gaming in a subway. People are nothing but friendly and fun on both ends. The balance is fairly well and each party can be countered based on perks and on victims side if they stick together as well as work together towards one of the goals that is the objective. Since there are multiple ways to escape for victims there's tactics to fake like you're going for one to throw the family off. And on the family side you can trap up areas as well as guard certain locations. Hoping for longevity in this that F13 didnt have because it already has all the fun factors.

[b] I just wanna start out by saying that this is my first game of this sorts, and it has been a total new experience for me that has been nothing but a blast of fun! [/b] 

The developers behind the game have been nothing short of spectacular at listening to the community, fixing bugs, balancing, and keeping everyone in the loop as far as what they're working on, plan to work on, and what's coming next.  

I really love the characters on both the Family and Victim side, every character is unique, has unique voice lines, outfits, abilities, and much more. The characters from the films have been portrayed very nicely, and are very fun to play as well. Johnny and Sissy are easily two of my favorite characters to play, but Leatherface is insanely fun to play as well! 

The map and overall look of the game is nearly perfect! I absolutely love how this game looks, how the maps look, and the 70s feel to them! I feel like each map is pretty balanced, but there is some changes that could benefit each one in their own way.. such as the smoke room door on Gas Station, Pressure Valves on Slaughterhouse, etc. 

Overall, I bought this game at full price and it's been more than worth every penny. I've had so much fun playing both Family and Victim with and without friends. I really think that this game is not only worth the full price, but even more so when on sale. I'd highly recommend it, and I cannot wait to see what comes next for this game!

However, the match wait times are *awful.* It's not uncommon to have to wait 2-3 minutes just to get into a lobby and another 2 minutes or so for a game to start. Add in the threat that a good Leatherface can kill you right from the start, and you'll end up with time wasted just to *maybe* play the game for a tiny bit of time.

All of that aside, I'm not a fan of the games transactions. $10 for each new character and $15 for one skin is gross.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is yet another survival horror game taking a crack at Dead by Daylight. Much like the name of the movie it's adapting, the game is also a bit of a massacre. There is a lot of room for improvement and not a lot of desire for improvement from the developers. If you are thinking about getting the game, either wait for a decent sale or just play DBD instead.

[h2]The Good[/h2]

+ Texas Chain Saw Massacre offers asymmetrical gameplay. Unlike the competition (which is only DBD) where you play as one killer against 4 victims, here you play as a team of 3 killers vs 4 victims. This is the best part of the whole experience and one thing that should make it a viable alternative to other horror games...
+ Few unique ways of escaping available for the Victims' side. They will get repetitive as you play but it is still better than Dead by Daylight's generator system.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]

Oh boy, here is where things get very, very tricky. I want to love this game but the next few things on the list really don't allow me to.

- TCM is full of bugs. From animations getting stuck during specific actions, to the whole game getting stuck and crashing you to desktop, there is little of everything here. Some issues are minor and can be overlooked but there are some that can cost you the whole match. During one specific minigame where you have to fix a fuse box and open one of the exits, if you use a mouse to do the minigame, it will likely get stuck in place for a few seconds after the box has been repaired. Needless to say that running without being able to see is a recipe for disaster. To give credit where credit is due, the developers have acknowledged a big number of these bugs and are *supposedly* working on fixing them. If and when they actually fix them is a whole different story.
- Lack of players and long waiting times are also a major issue with the game. On Steam there are around 1200-1500 players in-game at all times (that might even be a bit generous). There is crossplay available between PC and next-gen consoles which is helpful as without it waiting times will probably be even longer. With all that said, if you want to play with the Victims you will be waiting for at least a minute and thirty seconds (and I'm probably being way too generous again). That isn't a big issue though, right? It wouldn't have been if the match would actually start once everybody loads in. It is extremely common to switch lobbies at least once or twice while searching for a match as many who play with the family or victims might want to use a specific character that is already taken by someone else.
- Perk system that allows you to play in your own unique way... or so it should. There are actually only a number perks that are incredibly good and everybody uses. Most of the choices you have are either useless or apply to very specific scenarios.

[h2]The Ugly[/h2]

The single worst problem is balancing... or lack there of. There is no skill-based matchmaking so it's a pure coin flip whether you get a player who's just bought the game or one who hasn't seen the sun for the last few weeks. In some of the previous patches it was possible to at least mitigate this issue. Player levels were visible so anyone could see the overall level of the enemy team and make a decision whether they want to continue or try a different lobby. Developers were made aware of this so they decided to just make the levels of everyone invisible. While it's understandable that they wouldn't want players constantly switching lobbies, there are far better ways to resolve this problem (like if they had used skill-based matchmaking in the first place...). Balancing does not only apply to levels and players you are facing, far from it. Some of the maps in the game are heavily one-sided as well, Slaughterhouse being a prime example of a Victim-sided map.

[h3]Supporting your own product is apparently too much to ask for[/h3]

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released in August of 2023. As of the writing of this review there have barely been any significant updates. A bunch of cosmetic DLC (which is paid, of course) and a few small updates that fix a thing or two. There is a new map and characters coming out soon but that doesn't change the fact that this game is evolving at an incredibly slow pace. If the updates continue to come out once every 2 months, I really don't see a bright future for the playerbase of TCM.",1700660467,1700660467,False,81,7,0.673221766948699951,13,True,False,False

DO NOT! buy this game if you are not ready to deal with the cheating and glitches that are running rampant currently. I don't really want to say anything about the ""Sweaty Players"" because personally it hasn't bothered me. There are quite a few ways to combat the speed runners with a Cook or Hitch Hiker, most of the complaints seem to be from people who are Leather face mains.

Now, unlike a lot of other people I actually think this game favors killers after the update. Cook is unbelievably broken and has only gone unnoticed because people just started learning how to play him and he is a support to the rest of the family. From his pad locks, Spam sonar hearing, Broken harvesting, and the ability to hit about as hard as johnny, he can literally turn a terrible team - decent, just by purely abusing his abilities...

Johnny is also a problem after the last update. Skill set wise he is terrible and easily the weakest family member out of the bunch, but he is suffering from a speed glitch. He can pretty much run at a sissy speed while hitting like Bubba....Simply put- Aids.

All of the other family members excluding Bubba, have their own little issues I just didn't think they were a big enough deal to cry about. (Bubba is pretty weak Fyi)

On the victim side of things, issues with stun locking family members and having escape routes that are basically handed to them is a real problem. I said earlier that I cant really complain about it because the issue hasn't been as big for me as others. But...That is not to say it isn't a problem. Gas valve is balanced and that's because it takes TIME, things like the fuse box or even gas station exit with a Connie don't have to deal with this. Gas station exit takes 2 lock picks which as far as I know, is the quickest escape in the whole game across all maps. No generator, No battery, you just walk through. The fuse box takes 1 lock-pick to open the box, and the fuse itself. It can spawn right next to the box or a few rooms away. The issue isn't the spawn though in my opinion. The issue is there is no wait time. You do the little mini game and crank it on, thats it. Family members cant stop it from opening the basement exit and even after it closes you can just go back up to the box and re-crank it.

I think a way to fix it would be a sound ping while doing the mini game or maybe even allow family members to remove the fuse. Honestly the whole design of this escape just seems, bland. I don't think the devs thought people would get this good this quick, but it needs to be addressed. 

Overall I really like this game and would love to recommend it, but in this state its beyond broken. LOL I didn't even mention the Crossplay being removed so all Pc players have to deal with hackers and people blatantly cheating. Anyway I'm done crying now. Dont buy this game right now but I suppose you will do what you want. Goodbye.",1693004780,1700658564,False,0,1,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It captures the feeling of being in a horror movie well, and being centered around one of my all-time favorite horror movies, I may be a little biased. Playing with a group of friends on either side is super fun, and personally I've found playing solo queue to be entertaining as well. 

Currently one of it's larger issues is lack of content after you've played for a long time (The game as of writing only having 3 maps with different times of the day), but with the upcoming new family member, victim and map, it might change around.
If you're also not willing to play whoever, queue times may be an issue as well. But if you don't care, then matchmaking doesn't take too long from my experience. Furthermore, there can be a bit of a steep learning curve as you may get matched up with people who have played the game for longer.

I wouldn't recommend the game if you're looking for a competitive experience, as this game is more on the side of being a horror experience/party game that happens to be a vs. ordeal than one where matches will be 50/50 in terms of balancing and matchmaking. 
Winning doesn't reward you much, and I've even found in matches as victim that I got more points overall after dying than my teammates who escaped early. I like to make my own fun in matches, and consider it a win if I had a fun time, no matter if I die/victims get out.

That being said, I can recommend the game if you like asymmetrical horror games, and you want a game to play with your friends that is overall a bit goofy, but can give some good scares. It's currently my favorite game, and I look forward to seeing how the game evolves over time! :)",1700657559,1700657559,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

Yes it has a learning curve, but once you pass that curve, it's incredible. I had some complaints recently, but going by today's Q and A and the transparency of the dev team after the hiccup that this game had during the first month, I am confident in the game again. So I am updating the review back to positive to reflect this.

My biggest concern for this game was dlc being over priced, and never being added as an in game unlockable option, but that has been addressed and it has been stated by the development team that an in game currency will be added in order to unlock things like characters and dlc for free. This combined with the big patch they have coming should create a solid basis and foundation for the future of this game and its longevity.

The game is honestly fun, it's worth buying and playing. Majority of the nonsense you are hearing at this stage is coming from people who don't even play the game, so take what they say with a pinch of salt and make your own mind up.

1. ''no updates'' - when the game was unreleased, it was still in technical test, it had 2 maps, when it released, 2 months ago, they released 1 more map, so that's fake, considering it's still a new game, that's enough content for the start

2. ''bad skins'' - another fake theory, how are they bad? u are given 1 skin that costs 5 euro + 6 reskins, different colors, on DBD u get 1 skin for 10/15 euro... let's be honest here

3. ''bad matchmaking'' - that has nothing to do with the developers, the matchmaking is in the people playing the game's hands, if not enough people play this game because they are brainwashed with a boring and toxic game (DBD), then ye, that's gonna happen, you will stay a lot to join a game (+ people don't want to play leatherface when he's fun af if you learn him)

4. ''cheaters'' - there are games released years and years ago (ex. PUBG) with tons and tons of cheaters after the developers cashed in revenues of millions of dolars and still they have cheaters yearly and they still exist even to this day

5. ''toxic people'' - have you people played dbd too see how toxic that is? trust me, it's worst than this and you can't put a bad review on a game because people have -50 iq, that has to to do with humanity, not the game itself

6. DBD IS WAY WORSE THAN THIS GAME - it's a stale and dead boring game, I played 1950 hours of DBD because I played with a few friends and it was the only asymmetrical horror game that actually had players on it (the game itself is just a boring hold shift and w, just run from the killer and put down pallets while the others cant even hold left click to do a generator that puts you to sleep of how boring it is to do, apparently even that is hard for some people to do, to hold left click)

7. DBD was released in June 14, 2016 and the game is still unbalanced and one of the most boring games you can play, you literally hold left mouse click on a generator as a survivor

8. ''Bubba overheating during cutscenes'' - That is a mechanic of the game (it doesn't bother me, it's actually interesting, makes the game more random and alive) and you can avoid more times than let it happen if you click and unclick right click fast

9. ''Bubba's chainsaw is extremely loud'' - I don't have any issue with this. YES, it is louder than other things in the game, but do you want a chainsaw to sound like a real chainsaw or like a toy chainsaw? (use your brain for a second)

10. ''Bubba's overhead hitbox'' - I don't know what you are talking about exactly, but the game runs pretty smooth and yes, you can miss them with the chainsaw sometimes, let's talk about DBD hitbox, where 1 huntress hatchet is like an entire locker, there are actually like 3 hatchets thrown at you instead of 1

11. ''Getting stuck in walls after executions'' - you say it happens a lot? either you got unlucky or you are a big liar, it happend to me once or twice and i have 260+ hours

12. ''Bugged perks'' - I've never had any bugged perks so far in my 260+ hours gameplay experience and I play both Family and Victim. I played all 10 characters in the game

13. ''Slaughter house favors vics, Family house favors family'' - So? When did you ever see games with fair maps? Have you played DBD? 85% if not more of the maps there are survivor or killer sided, they are not fair, only a couple of them are, and that game is 6 years+, yet they still make unfair maps

14. ''Lobbies take ages'' - That is full on people's fault, not the developers, people avoid playing Leatherface when he is fun af. People also don't know how to press the ''E'' button to ready up and everyone needs to wait 2 minutes for the match to start instead of 5 seconds. And ye, people dodge for no reason, they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they can't play with sissy or johhny in their team, I win with every killer I play + they dodge cuz they don't like certain maps, maybe be a man and grow up and actually win those maps, they are still winnable, it's not mission impossible

15. ""Terrible matchmaking'' - You can't force low level people to only play with low level, imagine if you do that, then only a few hundreds of players if not less will only be able to play with each other, they will never ever get in a match again. So ye, the low level players will get their ass kicked, but in time, they will learn the game and will get better

The only NEGATIVE things i have to say about this game are: the crashes, but they sometimes happen often and sometimes not, however, they should fix them, its been 2 months, and, another thing is the future characters, I hope they will be free, because asking 10 or even 5 euros on characters is just not logical, considering the game costs 39 euros, they should be free, this way the game would be more enjoyable and more accessible to everyone. They should also remove the locks from Cook and put them on the first gates upstairs for every killer, this way you are not forced to play Cook every match and the game is slower, victims can't just win in a minute, and buff Sissy, she's the only weak family member in my opinion

IN CONCLUSION, this game is a lot better than DBD. DBD only has a lot of players because that was the first asymmetrical horror game, it promotes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like lgbt and gay parade stuff, they have clickbait skins like resident evil, silent hill, etc, and people get baited hard on that shi*. (We live in a planet where people care more about skins and cosplays than the actual game, and in the same time, people still cry about skins costing money, it's mind blowing).",1692884952,1700642138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first night I played, I ended up playing for 3+ hours.  They have a few different maps (3 right now).  Some things are buggy, but the game is definitely still playable.  I can see myself playing for 100's of hours, earning the points to level up the characters and get the perks unlocked.  Playing with friends is a blast, playing solo is a bit rough, especially when your teammates do not use the in game voice communication.

The one unique thing about this game is that you don't just spend points to unlock a stronger level of a perk - you have to use the perk and gain experience in it to level it up.  Its a nice change from getting the strongest version of a perk right when you use it for the first time.

If compared to dbd,the biggest changes are-

Pros
-----------
1.3v4 instead of 1v4  (You can Kill People with your friends now! why hunt alone?)

2.4 Ways to escape instead of just one holding generators  for 90 seconds that require alot of distracting the killers to other exits or make them chase other survivors.Each escape is quite distinct  interactive to try.

3.Being Sneaky and Hiding is actually fun and rewarding in this game ,the bushes are actually big and you camouflage with them,alot of refrigerators and lockers and the back of car trunks to hide in. Stealth is encouraged and rewarded for wasting killers time and not frowned upon for not leeching off a generator 24/7.

4.Each survivor have different skill set (Strength,Toughness,Endurance,Proficiency,Stealth), So Do the killers (Strength,Endurance,Blood Harvesting) and all characters in this game have a special abililty unique to them and their personality which leads to interesting chase clashes.

5.no sweaty SBMM(Skill Based Matchmaking).


The Cons
-----------

1.A high chance of meeting no-life hackers in this game,they need to work on a better anti-cheat.

2.Server Connectivity Issues

3.A Leatherface is required anyhow which leads to lobby dodging because either People have maxed out leatherface and want to try and max other characters or its just suffocating in basement where survivors have the upper hand with so many barricades,vaults and gaping wall spots. leatherface is much better above ground in free open spaces, someone like sissy hitch or johny are much better off in basement because they got better chase ability and can go through places leatherface cant. 

(FIXED IN THE 28TH NOVEMBER UPDATE PICK WHOEVER YOU WANT)

4.Not Much to do after a certain point (lvl 99 and all character abililty lvl 3) 

(FIXED NEW CHARACTERS WILL BE ADDED THAT ARE GONNA NEED TO BE MAXED OUT AND THE MAX LEVEL CAP WILL BE INCREASED)

5.Only 5 family killers and 5 survivors to max out  and Only 3 Maps to play so far which gets boring after a certain time.which is leading to a shrinking playerbase. 

 (FIXED,THEY ARE GONNA ADD NEW CHARACTERS AND MAPS IN THE GAME SO THATS GREAT FOR GAME REPLAYABILITY).

6.Slaughter house valve exit is broken af because of the water pressure tank being in the basement.

 (FIXED in the 28TH NOV UPDATE)

7.Grandpa Cut scenes reveal where grandpa is  to the survivors and leatherface gets his chainsaw stalled everytime because of it

(FIXED IN THE 28TH NOV UPDATE)

8.Hitch hiker window traps are bugged leading to being bugged and killed.


EDIT
------

alright as for the changes, 

❥ grandpa's cut scene has GOT to go. it's just annoying at this point. xd
❥ some maps are sided for example family house is, you guessed it, family-sided while slaughter house is a bit more victim-sided. i think the gas station map is the most balanced but that doesn't mean it's perfect either.
❥ my personal complaint is that the victims talk way too much and it wouldn't be a problem if the family couldn't hear you. i'll be hiding in a bush waiting for bubba to walk by and then ana will just ask some shi about who these people are, what this place is, or where her sister went lol then bubba turns his fat ass around and the rest is history
❥ lobby timer is too long only because you always have that one mf who doesn't click ready 
❥ just overall balance things out between victims and family. look at overall statistics and see who wins more. try to make changes based on that.",1694461077,1700623143,True,61,6,0.773610532283782959,0,True,False,False

Launched with NO anti cheat on game pass, even after patches to fix this issue, hacking is still rampant. This game was launched in an abysmal state with NOTHING from the beta being fixed. The devs deleting threads on reddit giving them POSITIVE constructive criticism, if something is not done fast with this game it will die much like all other asym horror games. This was definitely released at least 3 months too early just for a quick money grab

Victims:
If you're not matching hackers then you're practically guaranteed to match other players that are abusing the multiple game breaking exploits such as sissy making you unable to move with rubber legs unintentionally stacking, hitchhiker holding you hostage in a well after placing a trap near a ladder, bubba being able to 1 shot you through 3 stacks of No Sell and 50 toughness using an overheat exploit, johnny being able to swing and gain insane amount of distance that looks very uninentional (unsure if this is intentional) or just cook spamming their ability on you so you get a headache from the constant laughing in your ear.

Family:
Family is a miserable experience if you're not in a 3 man team due to no pining system and people refusing to type in text chat or talk on mic, also fuse box escapes are far too easy for victims, and if they're not using the fuse box you're probably on slaughterhouse where valve  will be used and its very difficult for family to get to and disable or you're playing on gas station and the victims only have 2 doors to open before they get out. 

I truly want this game to succeed as it was fun in the beta and the first week of the game before the exploits, hacking and most efficient strategies were figured out. Save your £30 as it is certainly not worth the price in its current state and I'm just disappointed the devs don't seem to care

UPDATE:

now the game is practically dead, they're trying their hardest to collect as much money as possible from the addicts by charging you $10 PER CHARACTER, so if you want the new survivor and family you need to pay $20, which is half the price of the game",1694705410,1700618013,False,5,0,0.530556023120880127,0,True,False,False

EDIT 9/25/2023

The only thing fixed from below is that ""supplied credentials"" doesn't happen much anymore. Crossplay is STILL REMOVED. 

This dev team listens to the community too much to a point where things are ""balanced"" when unneeded. They're too scared to make a bad decision, which in turn, makes them choose wrong a lot of the time. Personally, I wish they had just fixed the bugs and then see what needed to be changed meta wise.

I was happy with the game until the announcement of the patch to be released tomorrow (9.26.23) which completely neuters the victims. Their idea of making stealth more important is nerfing the stealth attribute entirely. I'm not even going to get into the strength stuff which has also been totally removed outside of the struggle mechanic which is super finicky with timings already. I am a Leatherface main normally and just don't understand how these ""fixes"" resolve anything. The answer was already clear, start the victims with their abilities at zero so they need to wait the 2 minutes to use them. It stops Leland from rushing to BM Leatherface and Connie from escaping basement in 10 seconds. Rather the community would rather latch to exploits and scream when they are patched (both sides). 

To Family mains: stfu, your job isn't that hard. If you communicate, you'll do alright. If you're getting BMed, just take it on the chin and keep playing. You'll be fine.

To Victims: Its supposed to be stacked against you, stop squealing that family is ""obviously cheating"" when you do dumb stuff or get caught after bming.

To everyone: You're not supposed to win every game, just keep playing the game and improve on both sides.


TLDR: Don't buy this game until further notice unless it's on a decent sale and wanting to play customs with friends.


Outdated but still relevant - 
Pretty hitchy at the moment but I am sure they will fix it within the coming weeks. I have all my settings set to the lowest with VSync off (GTX 1080 and i7-7700K, its not my rig). Other than occasional kicks from ""Supplied Credentials Invalid"" error, this is an extremely fun game that scratches an itch.

I'm a massive fan of TCM & the different aspects of the game, it never feels like another cat and mouse game as there's plenty of ways to escape, different routes to take and other hurdles aside from the family that can hinder your chance of getting out alive. Play it safe and sneak around the map? Or try take revenge on the family and fight back!
From a killer perspective I think the perk system is excellent and have thoroughly enjoyed trying out all the different family members and seeing which one suits my playstyle best.

My only issues with this game would be that Leatherface HAS to be selected for a game to start which can cause issues when trying to find a game if no one wants to play as him but I do understand it as without him and his chainsaw there'd be a lot of un-accessible areas in the cave systems making it virtually impossible to catch any of the victims

Current playerbase is very low, add ¼ of crossplay players and it’s still low. I would say the game is very victim side with a strong competitive team, everyone just rushes every game. I instantly find a match as family member, but it takes 20 minutes to find a good one as victim. If I get to be the chainsaw guy, I get more points by destroying stuff than chasing players who know how to abuse every single mechanic in the game. 

There is no penalty for leaving mid-game (other than losing any experience points) so family unexperienced players leave so they don’t suffer the constant bullying of survivors with hundreds of hours. Every lobby is a simulator when someone leaves, making everyone who’s ready just to wait longer, add this to the lower playerbase for an inpatient game.

Developers haven’t changed anything of this. They just add more payments because they don’t play their game. If they think balance is okay, then remove the cutscene when grampa wakes up for the first time as it disrupts any animation ongoing (chainsaw revving). I know I’m playing in USA Eastern due to the latency I have on every match, where I also can’t check in game, there are no servers in my region (Latam).

I don’t regret buying this at discount and I really hope developers wake up and stop selling us an unpolished game where there hasn’t been a single update from day one.",1699852012,1700604293,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am ultimately going to recommend [b]The Texas Chain Saw Massacre[/b] because I do truly feel that the game-play loop is fun, the characters are varied and engaging to play, and it certainly looks the part.

[i]However[/i] some of the post launch decisions by the developers have been concerning, to say the least:

- Disabling cross-play for over a month for PC players rather than effectively deal with rampant cheaters.
- Charging money for extra kill animations on launch day.
- £13.49 for ONE SKIN for Leatherface (which does look cool, but ain't no way I'm spending that amount of money for one skin).

The game still has a healthy enough population despite this, and is on the [b]Xbox Gamepass [/b] if you want to perhaps try it beforehand, there are a [b]ton[/b] of bugs and connection issues, especially if you are using third party applications such as [b]MSI Afterburner[/b] etc, so do be warned, patches have been pretty slow since launch, and day one bugs still persist.

October 14, 2023: Still a great game and I have no regrets purchasing it, BUT the devs NEED to address the lobby times. We have the player base for quick lobbies, but non-stop lobby dodging from players can make wait times upwards of 15-20 minutes. I would hold off on purchasing until the devs address this and offer a solution, such as hiding player levels.

November 1, 2023: Devs claimed weeks ago that lobbies are their top priority, yet have NOT done anything to fix them. All they need to do is hide player levels and it would solve 90% of the dodging. There's literally people game sharing to another steam account and starting over just to play. It's ridiculous it's still not fixed. The devs continue to say on social media that they aren't going anywhere, but they will be forced to when the game dies. I do not want this game to die at all, I love it, but they NEED to start making quality of life changes.

November 21, 2023: Latest update helped. Lobbies are a little bit better, other than people refusing to play Leatherface. The patch releasing on November 28th will no longer require Leatherface, so I imagine lobby issues will be resolved. People will finally understand how important Leatherface is once they don't have him. Next update should be a W.",1692865870,1700570276,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

As many have mentioned - questionable decisions made by the developers in the name of ""balance"".

It is very annoying to only have enough perk points to have maybe 3 characters about halfway and respecing the skill tree (seriously its half of my playtime) on anyone takes far to long let alone randomly getting perks with trash perks in the way of decent ones.
By the time you get a single characters ""power"" to level 3 your almost fed up playing them having to wait so long to get a perk that notifies teammates, 
Very few games have i actually had anyone communicate when i do its someone with a live mic and doesn't know it or someone saying to shut up.
But we need some kind of coordination for the dozens of spots a victim can loop endlessly with the I frames being the most annoying abuse.

Glaring issues with balancing even when its not being glitchy as all hell.  the times I've had problems with my character or others teleporting due to lag is ridiculous.  The survivors are nothing but sweaty and due to the small playerbase they can't introduce a penalty for dc'ing or nobody will play.  Expect the most toxic players ever in this game.  Even the sole reason I got this game (to mod it) is now removed.  Big problems include when killers dc, their models are not removed causing them to become roadblocks if they disconnect in doorways.  As well as survivors becoming seemingly invincible during any animation whenever Leatherface tries to chainsaw them.  The game is not necessarily one sided as both sides have decent chances to escape, but the current interactions are not fun.  The stun animations are unecessarily long.  In the time it takes to recover from the stun a survivor can search a bone pile and get another dagger to stun the killer again before they can even move again.  The biggest offender, however, is the achievements, with one achievement requiring you to get a kill in 30 seconds.  Meaning you have to play Leatherface and you have to immediately find a survivor AND kill them in the time it normally takes someone to even find a survivor let alone kill them.  Not to mention the basement is horrendous for Leatherface with areas you physically can't stop survivors in leading to frustration over a seemingly impossible achievement.

I've tried to give it a real chance but there's a few things that set me back. Firstly is the imbalance of older players vs new. The perks are exceptionally strong and I get that it's a time investment to catch up to those, but at 21hrs in my perks all poured into a single character still don't make me able to contend with most players. Again, I understand the ""git gud"" comments, but when a 20hr player person is playing vs a 200+ hrs player there is no ""git gud"", their experience eclipses mine and I have no chance.
Secondly is how much time investment it takes to level said perks. At 21hrs I'm still a lv6 Connie. I'm sorry but I play a game to HAVE FUN first and foremost. If this is going to be a 2nd job where I need to play 8hrs a day for a month then I should at the very least have fun while getting my face mopped with the floor, in this case its not. 
The solution to both problems is design around exp. It should be quick to max out 1 character so you can at least get into the game on an even level. Then steepen the curve for each level passed that so it becomes increasingly difficult to max out multiple characters. 
The last point I want to raise is the audio issue, I've made a bug report, I've posted on reddit, I've never gotten an acknowledgement. There's currently no way to set your output/input device. Because of this my bluetooth for some reason always defaults the input to my headset when I want my blue yeti to be the input. This causes my audio quality to tank because its switching my headset to ""wifi"" mode instead of bluetooth. Because of this I cannot communicate with people in game, which I think would drastically improve my playing experience.
Overall, I just don't have fun playing the game at all in it's current form. Games should be FUN, and this...isn't fun. Hopefully devs can address issues in the future and I'd love to come back.",1700274579,1700274579,False,2,0,0.501286983489990234,0,True,False,False

What I do not like:
-Lobby waiting 20 minutes to get on a match that you will probably die within 2 minutes.  
-Players can't kill the members of the family.  I stabbed Leatherface like 10 times with bones, that will surely have killed him in real life.  Even in F13 you could kill Jason who was not human.
-Family are way overpowered, you may escape if they are new and do not know what they are doing but experienced family player playing against experienced victims, the victims have no chance.  
-Way overpriced.  Gun really went greedy on this one.
-Lackluster DLC.
-Not allowing cosmetic mods!  (biggest killer for me, I know they want to cash in DLC, but DLC they are releasing are ugly as hell lazy skins at least let us mod them and make them attractive!)

Killers are immensely overpowered it's ridiculous. 
Very unbalanced and unfair game after the honeymoon phase.  
SBMM is in this game and ruins it just fyi see point 5 also Invalid Credentials fix point 6. 
1. Invalid credentials
2. stuttering that did not exist in the beta
3. Leather Face Leather Face Leather Face - he is key. How? See point 4 first. 
4. Barricades are a massive problem. Barricades are essential to survival or winning as the family. Only Leather Face can destroy these. If you are paired with a ""noob"" Leather Face who does not destroy them or doesn't know what they are doing you are doomed. The biggest issue in this case is the barricade system and the fact only one player can destroy them if Leather Face disconnects you are finished you will not win that game. Barricades surprise me the most because they feel like something just put in last minute without a thought. The rest of the game is amazingly well balanced that's how I know the barricades were a last minute balancing tactic because they make no sense. 
5. SBMM - sigh despite googling and answers showing no SBMM I can tell you that is a complete lie. When I started off at level 0 I was paired with level 0 players level 5 around levels 3-9 max. Now I'm level 13 roughly I'm seeing players at level 19 to 13 so far I have never seen a level 0-3 again this is how I know they have lied and said there would be no SBMM. Now as you progress you just climb the sbmm systyem and end up with tryhard squads that rush obj while your solo noob teammates sit about pick the wrong character for the map etc it ruins any fun in the game. 
6. You can't customise your keybinds........ yet on this finished game...... ok enough said. 
Overall great game quite fun a bit too ""grindy"" also a lack of explanation in some things like symbols of a windmill above characters. Last issue is parties if you are with a party and you are a solo killer things are ultimately unfair and you will lose because they will band together and there is nothing you can do. When it comes to players in a party it should only be fair that you go against solo players as a solo player. And party players should go against equal numbered party players. ie 2 family then 2 survivors. 3-4 survivors a party of 3 family killers etc. Oh also ""Invalid Credentials"" to fix this you need to verify the game files. The game for some reason corrupts it's own files as you play I don't know how but poor game infrastructure.

Edit: So having played a fair amount sbmm is stacked survivor or killer its the same and while as a killer its not issue as a survivor this game is horribly unbalanced. For one cook's ability that shows your location every second to all the killers is massively overpowered to the point it ruins the game, if you are caught that is it you are done for. And there is no way to tell hes has zoned on you no sound queue nothing. Sissy has this ability to stun you with each hit and it disables your sprint at the lower levels you won't notice but as you climb the ladder sbmm wise every player will have either the cook or sissy combined if you are hit with her melee stun ability it's game over completely destroys the game. Killer side is good but survivor side is very bad and unfair the cooks hearing is immensely overpowered.  

YouTube review will be out soon and I am not compensated in anyway to advertise this game and it has no impact on my final decision and the score I give.",1692731382,1700071578,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

However so many issues left unresolved, Family house map is very difficult to survive in and even if you do escape and do a gen if more than one killer is on you, you wont have the staminer to out run them. They adjusted the points now killers get a significant more points then survivors. The points are very little so theres not much motivation to grind. Also can only really put them in one character making it difficult to play other characters unless you respec which makes match making difficult as everyone has to be a separate character.

This game feels like it got it's chance and failed because of the slow responses, and a sense of urgency with some very big problems problems. This game came out on August 18th, and as of this review there are numerous hacks and bugs that should NOT be in the games 3 months post launch. Then the devs hold an AMA on Redditt. They were super cryptic about a roadmap and QOL changes. Dude, you don't get to be in the situation of ""teasing"" anything. Your games player base is declining rapidly everyday. You need CRYSTAL clear communication for a live service game. No solo, no offline bots. Basically if people keep leaving at this rate, this will be dead with a capital D  by late 2024 tops. 


They finally addressed the crossplay issue, so now it gets a real review.

1. Jumping down wells sticks you into the ground, happened to me at least 4 times.
2. Not being able to back your party out of the game and having to reinvite every time unless you want to watch someone hide in a bush for almost an hour.
3. Bad servers; myself and others in games disconnect constantly.
4. Bad input when it comes to interacting with environment; I have instances where I'd go to open a door or go through a crack, only for my person to kind of hunker down in front of the obstacle while I'm spamming E.
5. Bad input when trying to go through an obstacle(door or crack) and when pressing the input to use the obstacle, the character uses say a toilet or tries to get a bonescrap, although that isn't what you are directly looking at.
6. Family members not choosing Leatherface making the timer run out and having to restart looking for a game.
7. Lobbies taking forever to find and get started; with the game being crossplay between all platforms, lobbies sometimes take up to 10 to even 15 minutes to join, find all necessary players, and actually start. Then you get a lobby that takes forever just to get 1 to 2 shotted by Leatherface right off the beginning because of one of said bad inputs mentioned above.
In my opinion, the game has been out long enough that the disconnect issues, leave with party option, and some of the major glitches should be taken care of. Add in long lobby times and the game isn't even worth the time.
Another thing, coming down to the last victim, there should be some sort of easier way to escape. Whether it be locks get slightly easier or a secret exit opens(that can be shut and reopened), when it comes down to being just the last survivor, you end up sitting in one spot waiting for an opportunity that may never come and before you know it, grandpa is maxed out and you are screwed either way. All I suggest is make it a slight bit easier for that last victim to be able to put more pressure on the killers.
One other thing that isn't as big of a deal is, lack of content. Nothing new as in maps or killers.",1699921342,1699921342,False,5,0,0.537879824638366699,0,True,False,False

- You need 3-4 friends close to your location to play properly. If your friends from your city or country aren't gonna play this game, you should pass as well. It has p2p connection. Game starts when you have 7 players, as soon as game starts people dc's from other side of the planet and you can not even play. If you enjoy playing against 1 killer or 1-2 survivors as soon as the game starts you might enjoy it. Personally I don't. 

-On steam version it reads ""full controller support"" however if you plug a steam-controller it gives ""supplied credentials are invalid"" error.  When u unplug your steam-controller and restart the game and play with keyboard it runs.

-Not enough players, queue times are such a pain in the ass. However if you manage to get players, some folks does not like to play leatherface and game disbands, you get in endless queue again. Imagine a game called ""Texas chain saw massacre"" and nobody wants to play leatherface. Really good job. 

-Same animations and visuals kinda boring after 10 rounds or so. If you are setting a trap or processing something, it messes when grandpa wakes. Maybe p2p connection causing this. Pressing E sometimes takes 2-3 secs sometimes 5-6.

-Seems like game has no future at all, you can not add more survivors or killers since it is on limited and specific genre. Maybe some more stupid maps and talent tree perks are all you gonna get. 

-Leveling and respecs are such a pain, it does not cost you anything but if you are trying to grab a perk from ""?"" mark you may have to reset tree 20-30 times. 

- As your account level goes up, it is harder to get skill points. First few days you start with a specific killer/survivor, you level up fast, you may have some fun for few days. However leveling others become stupidly long. Also you have to level abilities as well. Only logical thing to do is reset the character and apply points to other survivor/killer. But in the lobby if you can't get the character you want... It is another pain point.

The game is great fun but the more you play it the more frustrating it gets. Its full of exploits and bugs which basically let experienced players run rings around others. 

The tutorial is terrible and without the ability to play solo or offline, to learn the maps, the game is full of new players who don't have a clue what to do or where to go. 

Even after nearly 50 hours I'm still unsure of which valve or fuse to use where on which map.

In general its a frustrating game to play, especially solo in pugs, which is how I always play.

The game is chock full of bugs and glitches which are known to exist for months(Basically the beginning of the game), yet guess what, they are not fixed :)   (The devs said they will fix most of them, however I can't vouch for the longevity of the game, if it takes them this much time to fix things that are 2 months old)

Balancing ?
Imagine this, you are a brand new player with less than an hour, however the game decides to make you lean forward and **** you, and so you get matched with a player or even players that are max level. 
The opposite can also happen, I have a decent amount of hours and so who do i get on my team ? I get someone that has just bought their first computer and their first game.

Before the latest update there was a way to circumvent the balancing issues, as you had the ability to see the level of a player, however instead of adding a system to match you with people of your own skill, the devs decided to just hide the player level. Because you know, obviously it is way harder to add lines of code than deleting code, so they decided to go the easy route.

Character balance.
Imagine this, depending on the Leatherface's and victim's perks/abilities, a Leatherface can usually do 1 heavy attack(Which stun locks you) and then a normal attack and kill you. On the other side of the fence, there's Anna who can tank the heavy attack from a leatherface and then  3-4 or even more normal attacks, that's of course if she stays still and does not run away using a crevace, crawl space etc.
I won't even talk about Johny, who is literally the worst character in the whole game. If you get a Johny on your team, you'd be better of dodging. He does not provide any value to the team.(There are some exceptions ofc)

Perks
I like the illusion of choice they've given us with the skill tree and being able to pick and choose your own perks, so that you can form your ""own"" playstyle. Most of the perks are complete and utter garbage and so that means that you are basically stuck with (I'll try being generous) 6-7 perks for the victims that are actually good, some even too good(Choose flight). When I checked the perk wiki, I was amazed by how many perks there are and how I've seen no one play them(You can guess why).

The killers do have some bad perks themselves, however most of the perks are actually viable and useful when playing and can form different playstyles that are playable and are not a chore. The individual perks for each of the family members are also way better than the ones you can find on the victims' side.

The game also lacks content, which I can sort of understand, as it is a 2 month old(almost 3) game after all, but they seriously need to start putting out more content, as it can get quite stale after a while.

There are only 3 maps in the game and the balancing on 2 of them(Family house and Slaughter house) is horrendous. Family house is so easy for the family side, especially if you have Cook. The opposite goes for Slaughter house, it's the easiest map for the victim side.

I'm writing this, because I'd like to see the game thrive, with less bugs, better balancing, more content and so on, though I can't say that I see the bright light at the end of the tunnel. The game has around 1,500 players daily on steam(I don't want to imagine the player count in 2 years). Thankfully it has cross-play, but if it didn't have it, It would take even more time to get in a match, as It already takes 2 or even 3 minutes to get in a victim lobby. Family side is way better in that regard, you need less than 30 seconds.

TCM could have been a great game in my opinion but sadly it seems to have fallen flat due to MANY things but mostly just bad decisions/changes/mistakes made by the developers. As expected the game does have balancing issues some stuff is minor well other things are a bit more serious. There was a major hacking problem that occurred and the developers handled it poorly by turning off cross play that did nothing but isolate the remaining issue and then in return punished all PC players. Cross play has been turned back on and the hacker issue seems to be a bit better but you may still encounter cheaters here and there. As i stated above this game has balancing issues, some of the maps are either more family sided or more victim sided, this can lead to a terrible experience. I would not say this game is new player friendly as i have seen over and over again new players getting absolutely owned by more experienced players. The player base for this game seems like it is starting to fall in numbers by a pretty large amount. (resulting in longer lobby times) Most people seem to play victims since it can be very easy to escape and rack up points if you know what you are doing. Family side can be fun don't get me wrong but it does not feel as rewarding as victims do. Yet ANOTHER silly choice made by the developers was to hide player levels along with hiding the icon that would show if players were in a party/group. This does not solve any kind of skill gap between players, all it does is make it to where people have no idea what the lobby skill gap is now. There are plenty more issues that i could go on and on about but i think i got the message across. Sadly this game could be great but i have a feeling if things keep going this way it may result in the games death/shutdown.

UPDATE: After playing more last night and today i started noticing that major issues that should have been fixed are still NOT fixed, for example you can STILL become glitched in the ground and when this happens you can not do anything at all so you might as well just leave the match, you can also still become stuck inside walls or the stairs if you kill a victim on the stairs when to close to the wall. Lately there seems to be this trend of victims staying in a match to just troll family members when they know that either A the family members are at a huge disadvantage due to either some family members that d/c or B most family members are just bad minus 1 person so now only 1 family member is trying to do everything alone but just can not, and the victims know this and think it is funny so they stay in the match even though they can leave at any point due to all exits being wide open but choose to hold the match hostage just to farm points. If you find yourself in this situation you are better off just leaving the match and taking the loss because it's just not worth the headache. I am not sure what is going on with the developers and why they do not fix these things, i guess they would rather pump out cosmetic stuff to make more money.",1699466775,1699644873,False,5,0,0.523319065570831299,0,True,False,False

I have never had to check the system requirements for any other game I've bought, and it's always worked out fine. When this game used to ""work"" (it would still crash frequently, but I could at least get in a lobby without being booted for 'supply credentials invalid') it was pretty fun, although not nearly as fun as dead by daylight and 2 times the initial price. 
On pricing, this game is just plain and simple overpriced, with completely unreasonable prices of new characters for a game that is already in itself super expensive for what it is. When the devs announced that the new characters would be $10 each with no way to get them for free through gameplay (which every other game of the genre has), I was quite disappointed and knew I would not be giving this company another dime. 

In short, I regret buying this overpriced game and I think their graphics card requirement is excessive. I pursued a refund but steam rejected me, and the devs refused to help me with that.

Not only do you have to pay a lot for it but also pray that you do not encounter any game-breaking bugs during your matches after waiting for an unreasonable amount of time.[/b][/h2]

[b]Queue Time[/b]
The Queue Time in this game is ridiculous.
Roughly 2 minutes of waiting for the game to find you a lobby and roughly another 3 minutes of waiting for others to click ""Ready"".
So you're looking at roughly 5 minutes of waiting per match and THAT IS IF YOU'RE LUCKY!
If you're unlucky, such as entering lobbies where nobody wants to play as the Leatherface then have fun rinse and repeating this activity for as long as it's going to take.

[b]Lobby Dodging[/b]
Players dodge lobbies due to (Needless to say there are more reasons than what have been listed.)
- Huge differences in their levels. (Level 99s and Level 0s in the same lobby.)
- Unbalance maps that strongly favors one side over the other.
- Not wanting to play against Party Players when they and the team they're in consist solely of Solo Players.
TTCSM's Solution
- Hide the Player's Levels & Party Icons instead of implementing a matchmaking system that pair players of similar or at least close status. (E.g. Low Level Solo Players Against Low Level Solo Players)
So now you're basically queuing up for roughly 5 minutes or more for a roll of the dice.

At this point in time, the Developers have made and still continue to make questionable decisions regarding the game and that's why I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
It also feels as if they are trying to get as much money out as quickly as possible from the remaining but dying ""loyal"" playerbase before the playerbase is dead.

Unfortunately this is the kind of game where to have sustainable fun, you need a team of people that you know, or need to have played the game like it is your day job from its launch.  Here are a few reasons for why I gave it a thumbs down.

[h3][b]1.Voice Chat[/b][/h3]  - Voice chat does not ever work, so the only form of communication with my teammates is through text chat (which is near impossible to use when in the heat of a hunt). 

As a player who has played since the Beta launch,  it is still incredibly difficult (and I know the maps relatively well at this point). The learning curve is INCREDIBLY steep in this game and without a full squad that is communicating, you are almost sure to get swept by the other side. 

[h3][b] 2. The Community[/b][/h3]  - The community for this game is not great. Instead of playing the game, players will typically quit out and you will end up waiting until you leave and re-search, or until the lobby just closes (which is quite a while). To add onto that fun tidbit, there are sweaties, cheaters, and griefers so be prepared to run into one of those 3 in every match.

[h3][b] 3. Matchmaking[/b][/h3] 
Typically in these types of games, it becomes an issue of balancing the two sides so it can be a competitive matchup. This is something I actually applaud the developers for as the Victims and Family do seem pretty balanced. The only notable advantages come from the map being played. 

The bigger issue here comes from the matchmaking. From what I have seen, skill balanced matchmaking does not exist in this game. I was often matched up against players who were 60 levels higher than me. I was usually able to somewhat offset the skill difference by having a basic grasp on the strategy I was likely to see from these higher level players (again, learning curve). However, recently the developers have patched the ability to see both player levels AND if players were in a group. To me, this seems like an attempt to hide the fact that the skill based matchmaking is non-existent, AND the fact that the majority of the community is playing partied with other players. 

Why though? 

Well, I can only speculate, but my thoughts are that this will make it ""more appealing"" to newer players, and serve the purpose to ""counteract"" the current player base from leaving lobbies. However, it doesn't solve the root of the issue which is HAVING A BETTER SKILL BASED MATCHMAKING SYSTEM. Without that kind of system in place, it essentially forces players to take a chance on the game only to inevitably be placed up against players with[b] LEGITIMATELY 10 to 20 times[/b] more experience than them. 

That results in an unfun experience, and will leave players wondering why even bother (at least it did for me).

4. Needs new maps and characters since it's starting to get bored.
5. Ambient feels so empty.
6. Game needs more relocation on valves and fuse box since most of survivor already memorized all the map, and now they escape less then 2 minutes.

-	Killers should not be able to body block the fuse exit in the basement, please make it wider, so it won’t be possible anymore.

-	The ""jump down the well animation"" should not allow taking further damage when activated.

-	Please fix the bug that allows killers to hit and kill through closed doors and holes in the wall.

-	In my opinion games also give far too little points and exp points, it takes too long indeed to level up one charakter, please improve it.


-	I believe that killers have a lot of advantage, 4 perks in stead of 3, Grandpa's perk counts as well and they become up to 2 more if every family member takes a different Grandpa perk. As I said grandpa's perks and a lot of personal family member perks give benefit to the entire family (which victims do not have). Victims have to level up 5 different skills where family member only have 3 to level up with the same amount of points. Victim special abilities's cooldown after use takes forever and, for Conny for example, it has enormous disadvantaging proce in terms of energy, stamina et cetera, killer special abilities are strong and can be used much more efficiently and more often. Maybe I am just a real bad noob, but in my eyes this is an enormously killer sided game, at the moment. And on top of that selfishness does the rest in killing the fun here, mostly we die because of the total lack of teamwork and team spirit, everyone is selfish, thinks only for themselves and do not communicate saying where what is being opened, so that they escape while you die, chased by all 3 killers.

-	I think that 3 perks are very few so, since no one is using those of common benefit, those that could help teammates as well, I would suggest to implement that the perk that shows the other victims which doors are being opened should be put as default for everyone.


- There should be something showing what the other team mates are opening, since people, especially Connies, use their ability to sneak their way fast to an exit, and leave, without telling the others what is open, so that the others keep the killers buisy while she escapes, alone. Selfishness is already ruinigg this game.

- When ingaged in a close up fight with a killer it should not be possible for the other 2 to interfere and kill the victim. Victims have no chance with that and it certainly is not balanced.

- Killers get Buffed all the time and victims nerfed, I am fed up. Good bye TCM, deinstalling. This game will end like Friday the 13th, if idiots get to manage its destiny.",1692736017,1699466978,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There were some small things they needed to fix, and they did, although some balancing came a bit late. 

This first big thing that screwed this game up was disabling cross-play (Cut off for cheating, even though after 100+ games I only saw one game like this). Everyone I knew were split between PC and Console, so they decided to wait it out and play after it was re-enabled. Well everyone thought it would be a week or less, it turned into over a month of waiting, and none of my friends came back to the game, everyone quit. 

At this point I returned to the game after that wait, at around level 35 or so. Almost every game was filled with level 99 killers, clearly knowing all the tricks and exploits (Hitchhiker at the time), it seemed like playing survivor was just a absolute nightmare when your solo. Playing killer solo isn't any better, as no one ever uses the mic to even talk. So my second issue here is, absolutely no MMR style matchmaking. The game doesn't care if your brand new or a veteran, and no wonder, anyone new coming to this game will have an awful time with it. 

My other MAJOR issue is that the DLC that will be coming out, $10 for a character that you will have to fight for to play, as people will constantly just be leaving the lobbies to get who they want. There is no reason for characters to be this expensive, DBD is a lot more fairly priced than this game. Not a fan of removing ""In a party"" icons and the levels either. I can understand why they are doing it, but they should have focused on better matchmaking instead of doing the more easier approach. 

Lastly I have seen so many people ask questions and give criticism online only for the devs to just tell them to deal with it or completely bash their answer, when a lot of these people weren't even being nasty with their questions. I don't think I could honestly give any money to this team with that type of poor behavior from the devs. All in all, this game had huge potential, but has basically turned into a more of a deal with it / greed machine mentality that I will not support.",1699419311,1699419462,False,3,0,0.54327690601348877,0,True,False,False

However the game has been filled with bugs and exploits  and just basic flaws in the gameplay since launch, and the inability of the Devs to address any of the issues with the game in any meaningful way have caused the vast majority of players to abandon the game.  Over time they've made a few minor tweaks here and there, and even claimed that they fixed a few issues that actually never were, but they've yet to address some of deep issues at the game's core, like the fact that 2 out of the 5 family members are poorly designed and totally useless.  Another ""problem"" i suppose that they just recently tried to fix, is that there's a number of lv 99 players who love to form 4-man premade groups and go into public lobbies to try to beat up on solo players, however these players rightly have no interest at all in playing them.  These people have complained loudly that other players should be FORCED to play them, and the devs, for once, actually listened to them and then implemented a new system were you are no longer allowed to see the level of your opponents, or even your own teammates, as well not allowing you to see if they're grouped into a team or not.  Which makes you wonder why there's even a public lobby anymore, you'd think you would just click the ""Play game"" button and the game would automatically assign you your map and opponents and teammates, heck might as well assign your character for you too since you're not allowed any say in who you play anymore, so why should you be allowed to choose your own character?  

In any case, this is all obviously a bandaid they put in place to cover up some pretty deep seated issues with the game, and it's become clear to me that the devs have no interest at all in addressing those actual issues, but rather just throw up a few cheap, quick, superficial patches here and there.  They have no genuine interest in improving the actual game or making it enjoyable for it's player base, and any changes from here on out are probably just going to be detrimental to the players rather than helpful.

To start off with the good, the cat and mouse gameplay is fun for both sides. Victim is tense and rewarding, family is aggressive and thrilling. If you're only playing for the gameplay, this is perfect for people who love similar asymmetrical horror games like dead by daylight or Friday the 13th. The graphics are also very good, and still look good on the lower settings. The audio design is fantastic, and the animations are incredible. It's accurate and pays homage to the original TCM movie, while still bringing new ideas to the franchise. If you're only looking at the game for the gamplay, and you like what you see, buy this game. 

Most of the problems in the game come from the lack of time the game has been out, and lack of experience the developers have with working on this game. The matchmaking is a slog, and takes objectively too long. It takes 3 minutes for a game to start once everyone's in the lobby, assuming one person doesn't ready up. For comparison, Dead by Daylight only takes one minute. Because of the 3 minute wait, I have had many experiences where multiple people leave a full lobby because one person isn't ready, which causes the game to not start. This is made worse by the fact that there is a severe disjoint in the amount of family players and victim players. This means that queuing for victim games take much longer, and games sometimes don't start because there's not enough family members. This is made worse by the fact that each game needs a Leatherface to start, which itself isn't a problem, but a simple XP boost for Leatherface players would greatly improve it. 
Another large problem outside of the game is the DLC. If you've been following this game, seeing if you want it, you most likely know about the problem. If you don't know, the current plan is to have a single character as $10, which is 25% of the base games price. ($40). For comparison, a dlc character in DbD is $7, and comes with 2 characters, with the base price of the game being $20. Because of how the lobby is designed, if someone has picked your dlc character before you joined, you can't play the character you played for. This itself is fine, but the price of the dlc itself is absurd, and I don't recommend any purchasing of dlc until they change their prices. I also dislike how on the main menu screen, the dlc advertisement takes up almost half of the screen, though that is more of a nitpick than anything. 

That's it for my major complaints, and most of my other suggestions are little touch-ups that I think may make the game better. For starters, I'd like a form of callout system for both sides, simple sentences like ""Victims at generator"" or ""Fusebox powered"". Most games I've played don't have players using the mic, and this would help people who are either too uncomfortable or unable to use the microphone. 
I'd also like if family had an auto lock-on mechanic for hitting victims. It sometimes feels like attacks just swing right past victims, and it feels like movements on the mouse are extremely sensitive during swings. If this is a creative choice, that's perfectly fine, and I will just have to get more used to the controls. 
I'd appreciate if games were more chase-based and less focused on hide-and-seek. Most family games are spent looking for victims, and most victim games are spent hiding from family members. A simple numbers tweak would probably make this better, increasing victim health and stamina, and increasing family stamina and blood collection. This is a personal preference, and if the devs want a game more focused on hide-and-seek, that's fine. 

 Overall, the game itself is about an 8.5/10, and the problems with the dlc and matchmaking bring it to around a 7. If you like similar games or horror movies, do some more research, see if it looks like something you'd like, and avoid the dlc until they change the pricing.",1699245593,1699245593,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

Staying true to the source material of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) movie the game never stops attempting to put the player in the state of near hysteria.

[b]General Gameplay Loop & Other Stuff[/b]

Unlike all other asymmetric games that I've played, the main thing other than the setting (which can't be compared) which separates TCM is the complexity. Naturally there's still an element of generic copy and pasted gameplay that'll be familiar to most such as holding a button to search for tools in a box but TCM adds a layer of complexity that's remains faithful to the source material and doesn't treat the player as an idiot nor does it remove player agency. It's truly up to you (and your friends if you aren't playing solo) to decide how you survive, fight back or kill in TCM.

[b]Victim Gameplay[/b]

Across each of the three stages there are at least four escape routes. Step one is to find perishable supplies such as lockpicks to open doors, scraps of jagged bones to use as a self defence item and medicine to heal wounds. Step two the Victims main goal is to utilise stealth and locate an exit (some of which require a unique item such as a fuse) whilst always being mindful that they are being hunted down. Step three decide if your going for that exit or if your going to fight back.

Victims can choose to help eachother by running interferences for one another by attacking the Killers and Grandpa. By attacking the Killers Grandpa, the Killers lose killer team wide perk/s increasing the Victims survival chances but draws all attention to the one making the attack. 

[b]Killer Gameplay[/b]

Killer gameplay is essentially the opposite of the Victims as they already have everything they need from the start. The sole purpose of the Killer is to kill or contribute to the killing of all four Victims. You'll be relying on your basic senses as well as ingame mechanics such as abilities depending on which Killer you choose to help you locate and finish the Victims.

[b]I Like[/b]

* Both the Victims and the Killer have defining abilities
* The general sense of panic that slowly creeps up
* Jumping through windows
* The continuous balance of chasing/being chased and actively doing something else such as lockpicking or poisoning resources etc

[b]I Dislike[/b]

* The immobility of the killer Johnny, he feels very lacklustre. Everything Johnny can do, someone in the Family can do it better. He can't go through crawl spaces or squeeze through gaps in the wall (Sissy and Hitchhiker can). Johnny also cannot destroy barricades (Leatherface can). His ability is for tracking down victims via the tracks that they leave however Cooks ability shares this info with the whole team. Johnny is strong when it comes to hitting but then again.... Leatherface can one-shot victims and Johnny cannot. Johnny needs a mobility buff.

* Victims being able to stun Killers and lock them in place.

* Cheaters. To date I've experienced lots (almost every second game) definite blatant cheaters[i]*[/i] (all victims) here's some examples;

1. One was flying around the map literally like Superman.
2. Another cheater had every door unlocked and opened at the start of the match plus had the ability to go in and out of complete invisibility.
3. The last cheater openly talked about being a cheater in the end game lobby and only ""wanted to have some fun stabbing you all in the back"".

[b]Last Thoughts[/b]

I still remember that sheer shock factor upon seeing Leatherface for the first time in the original 1974 movie. I still remember the cruelty and mixed bag of emotions projected on screen when Cook held Sally captive and cruelly, with jest, poked and hit her with a broken wooden mop. Playing TCM today provokes those same feelings if you're new but sadly it wears off fast.

The cheater problem got too extreme for myself to continue playing and thus I stopped playing. If the cheating issue ever gets resolved then perhaps I'd consider recommending the game. Simply, I'd recommend if my 3 dislikes meantioned in the review were addressed, the player base increased because match making now takes a long time to get going and if the player base overall vibe changed because at the moment it's very ""them and us"" herd mentality stuff which puts me off.

[i]* A ""definite blatant cheater"" is a player who's for example literally flying around the map like Superman or/and going invisible in front of you etc.[/i]",1693410562,1699228390,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You have multiple ways to escape and (maybe not that many to stop them from escaping, if you don't play certain killers), but still having options on how to play and escape feels a liberating when it gets to endgame, and a lot less streamlined (generators).

Progression (leveling up) might need buffs or reworks, it might get too oppressive once the playerbase levels up enough for anyone new to pick up, learn and level while being a sandbag.

I've seen some people complain about victims staying in map to teabag, sure if it's the last one it might be toxic, but it might be so family can't just shift the focus onto the rest of the survivors, and also giving information and whatnot.

UPDATE:

Recently the player-base seems to have shrunk down, and players are getting better, that's not a bad thing but it does mean that game-play will filter down to a min-maxed version which means there's less and less decision making unless you want to put yourself at disadvantage, for example I think Cook and Hitchhiker are the most versatile family members for every map, specially strong on Family House.

Family House, unlike other maps, is very small and every side objective but fuse-box is locked behind another set of doors, usually with a padlock and a trap. Even if you get side garden valve spawn and open it completely you still have to somehow get to the front side of the house, and with how small the house is you probably can't unlock a padlock before someone comes back to check on your door after running through every other one, specially with harder locks perks.

Leatherface has a very strong route to patrol 4 exits out of the basement, which slows down and takes away options from victims. Once grandpa wakes up you can usually go upstairs and start getting rid of doors, creating a ""dead-zone"" that makes it extremely hard to unlock doors. If victims run back to basement to reset/heal they're not really progressing their objectives, and if they're not on fuse-box on second floor the same can be said for that floor, because there's no progression to be made from there.

Character dependent spawns also seem like bad design and further shows the strength of the aforementioned duo (on family house*), Hitch and Cook start with great spawns to quickly trap and lock the house, while also having access to a lot of blood pools, and unlike other maps they don't really have to waste time to collect said pools of blood, for example, unlocking a door to venture outside of the containment area. This also makes playing other Family Members a handicap from the get go, since you can end up spawning far from the house with no real objectives to do except run to the house.

Jumping out of windows (while not being Ana or having a very coordinated team) doesn't seem to buy any time, because most of the time front window can be trapped both in and outside, and 2nd floor drop doesn't seem to gain distance or time due to the long cut-scene + recovery.

If you're planning on picking up the game please refer to the Original review's 3rd paragraph and clench your butt cheeks because I've seen my share of single digit players being matched against level 90+ players, it's winnable for sure, but yea... it'll be a tough learning curve.

From the perspective of a Solo/Duo Quick Match player.

Game currently has 2.5k concurrent players on steam, which doesn't include PS4/5 and XBOX players playing through things like Gamepass.  Probably around 10k concurrent players in total.

There is a major update coming soon which will bring a lot of the old players back to the game, as it introduces a new killer, a new survivor, and a new map.  But because this game is being worked off of an IP, there usually isn't much freedom in creating new and interesting content.

I've been having a blast with this game since beta.  I play daily as both family and victim.  The game is much less team reliant for victims than the survivor role in DBD.  But it is much more team reliant as family (killer role in DBD), as you must be able to corner victims using 2+ family members if the victims are using the crawl spaces efficiently.

I have a couple of gripes regarding some bugs, but it hasn't been something that has turned me off of the game completely.  I've gotten stuck inside of some walls without being able to free myself.  Overheating my chainsaw during a cutscene with no warning is aggravating.  4 man teams are impossible to deal with if the killers aren't using communication (mics, typing is too slow and will cause you to lose chase).  Having my game drop FPS for .1 seconds every second is irritating (usually only happens on first load of the game in a day, restarting fixes the issue) and ruins the game for not just me, but my family member teammates, as I have no way to know if this is going to affect me prior to a match.

Even with my previous irritations, I love this game, and I hope to see the devs continue to develop this into something that competes in the horror genre alongside DBD.

In its current state, I wouldn't pay more than $14.99 USD ... you're going to go through a very tough learning curve, as the metas have already been developed and people know the maps.",1699041756,1699041756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly I wish I could recommend the game, but at its current state I cant even rightfully convince my friends to buy the game. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game and I personally feel like its pretty balanced. The issue I have is that I spent money on a game that feels like its in Beta. The constant disconnects, credential errors, the bug that makes it so that if you are a victim you cant interact with anything. I feel like im spending more time booting up my game for the 10th time then actually playing it. I find the maps and diff. ways to get out fun. Killer is fun also, I really enjoy playing Sissy and Leatherface. Its a unique game for its genre and honestly refreshing from DBD, so once things are fixed/addressed by devs ill love playing this again.

*edit 11/3/23*
Game still has a lot of major bugs. The good thing is they fixed the disconnect issues. The bad thing there is still some that have been issues from the beginning. Two major ones ive come across is mic issues in the game that have been an issue since the beginning. I am finding myself constantly trying to trouble shoot and fix my mic through steam settings. This is almost every time I boot the game up. The other issue is survivors blood disappearing on the console side so you cant track them as killer. I don't really understand why we keep seeing updates on new skins and such when things that have been an issue from the start have yet to be addressed. It's concerning because a lot of people wont stick around and wait months/years for them to fix these things. There is also a content drought which is the biggest and fairest complaint in the community, to which we haven't really had any new releases of maps or killers since launch. Not sure how much I can suggest for people to hold out on a game that hasn't been promising at all so far.",1692915125,1699032618,False,37,1,0.606975913047790527,0,True,False,False

I love how from a Victim perspective, the gameplay feels more like a game of hide and seek, rather than a game of cat and mouse. Though I end up getting killed more often than not, I still get a huge kick out of the challenge of trying to stay out of sight from the Family and finding a way out of the map. As a Family member, I like how you're working with a team and each member has a definable role. The fact that they can find and kill a Victim easily makes the stealth aspects of the game feel much more important. There's a lot of timing involved with making your movements and any noise you make, from foot prints to grunting, can easily give away your position. The maps, while they are a bit labyrinth-esq, are absolutely stunning and give the game a gruesome, oppressive atmosphere. The fact that they've designed everything, from the buildings to the bushes, based on actual on-site locations in Texas, shows how much of a labor of love this game truly is. The sound design and soundtrack are really damn effective too. If you're a fan of the original TCM movie, I think you will appreciate this game as an authentic tribute. The only problems I can think of that I have with it are the current lobby system they have for matchmaking. Considering people can only play one character at a time, and the match HAS to have a Leatherface player, you might have to search for new lobbies as people will hop in and out because they either can't get the character they want or nobody wants to play Bubba. If you're going into this game, it's probably best to learn the mechanics of each character, Family and Victim. Each character has something different about them, and I would argue that none of them are horrendously stronger over other characters.

If I could mention one more gripe that doesn't have anything to do with how the game plays currently, I feel like I should mention the monetization system they're implementing into the game. First off, $40 is a pretty steep base price for a new multiplayer only game. That and I think the current monetization system they've proposed is bullshit. Upcoming singular Victim and Family characters are supposed to be priced at $9.99. Not in a character bundle, but as SEPARATE. Hopefully, if the game can last long enough, they can offer a more elaborate system for unlockable outfits, characters, executions, etc. I understand that microtransactions can be a way to help support developers. But when you already have a game that's 3/4 full price and only offers a multiplayer experience, it's hard to justify putting a high price point on extra content. Cosmetics and alternative executions are one thing, but if it comes to characters that could potentially make a noticeable impact on the overall gameplay that could make it a ""pay to win"" situation, that's where most of us could draw the line. Ultimately, it's anti-consumer and I hope they can find a way to make modifications to what they're proposing.",1699011669,1699011669,True,3,0,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,False

It's a cool, fun game, most of the time, but we really could bring this game to the top with some better decisions.

HOW TO MAKE TCM BETTER AND MORE REPLAYABLE:

First, How to make a game replayable: Let's take a look at other games that do this well. You have games like Fortnite. One reason Fortnite is still going strong is because of their consistency. Now I'm not saying pumping micro transactions and purchasable items is the best way to add replayability, but it's content. Players want a reason to level up, they want something to work towards, like a special skin for a killer or that unique weapon skin only unlocked by completing a special quest. By adding a comfortable amount of customization via things such as - calling cards, custom player profile features, daily, weekly, and monthly quests that give you things dependent on its difficultly, skins, weapon skins, player skins, map voting, affordable or unlockable content, and so much more. You give the player a DRIVE. Now you don't need all of this but, why should I care about leveling up when I've maxed every character. There are so many ways to encourage leveling up and grinding the game that will make it more fun.
And lastly, moving forward: Personally, it feels lackluster to me that skins that are literally the same original killer skins, but with some blood on it took almost two months, just for the games first dlc. It was really a nail in the coffin when they set price points for everything they released. The only content released since launch is pricey skin packs that don't really do much for the game. It's honestly not a bad start, but as the first update and it's price points, it's not a super welcoming start to a player base. ""Like hey, we know you guys have been waiting weeks and weeks for content, so here's 7 skin packs for a total of like $45 DOLLARS."" If it was mixed in with nice quality of life updates and additions it wouldn't even be that bad. 
Conclusion: It's not a bad game, honestly very solid without the super rare bugs I seem to get quite often. I would love to see this game use features to bring better replayability to the game.

Less looping than Dead by daylight. Feels like survivors have to be more sneaky.
3 killers adds alot of fun and strategy. 
Game feels pretty balanced.
Great counter play.
Animations look great!
Matchmaking hasn't taken more than 7 mins

Cons:
Sometimes survivors can escape way too fast.  
Ran into a few glitches but nothing big
The skill tree system isn't very exciting.  Mostly just minor things that dont change much at all. 
Sometimes you get in a lobby and no one wants to play leatherface so you just sit there until someone picks him.
The maps don't feel any different. I really thought there was only one map for the longest time.  Turns out there are 3

Overall I give it a 7.5/10.  If you like DBD but are tired of chasing the professional loopers I would say give this a try.

In this game you have to either escape a dungeon using various possible methods as a victim, or as a family killer you have to find, hunt down and kill each victim. You can progress your character and try out different builds for their perks and overall points and if you do not like how it turned out you can respec everything. I've really enjoyed trying out different characters. Each has their own style.

This game is better than Dead By Daylight and Friday The 13th while staying in that general style of killers and victims. The 4 vs 3 mechanic works really well. The game has excellent, well balanced gameplay that gets more difficult as you level up. The matches get more complex and intense. The matches often play out quite differently depending on who you are playing.

It's my understanding that more maps and characters are coming. Each map offers potentially different times of day and environments. Daylight to night time.I love that there are multiple ways to escape each map but it's fairly difficult to escape the family murderers. While playing as a victim in this you can try to hide in dark places and the family members run right by you sometimes. It's super creepy and fun!

This is not a speed run game but a lot of people play it that way. I personally enjoy the environments and just sneaking around, trying to survive and escape!",1692846179,1698810370,True,3,0,0.50171583890914917,0,True,False,False

It's very disorienting in the beginning, like with any game you don't know the layout of.
Also not know what the hell to do haha. That is a part of the fun IMO.

There are tons of perks you can aqcuire and the skill tree is really big. In the skill tree you can select/unlock different paths, while the others you did not choose will be locked, and choose different perks along the way.
There are some slots that have random perks each time you respec, so sometimes you might wanna try and respec to get the right perks you want.

You don't lose anything when you respec your skill tree. So just use your points to make the whole tree visible and then read perks and then choose your path accordingly and try for nice random perks.
There are also attribute nodes you can unlock so you can also put points in the different ones. All of the characters have different stats so you might want to raise those that are made for your character or play around with them as you like. 

Another cool thing is the points is for everyone in that team. So if you put points in one victim character and reset you can use those points and unlock everything in the other character's skill tree so you can at least see what it looks like. Also a lot of time if you don't ready up, to skill up a character if you didn't get your character you already put points into. You can ask for a trade in the lobby though.

Lastly, every character have their own unique ability that you also can level by just playing.

Anyway, I hope this gave you some idea of how neat this game is. I hope it wasn't too hard to understand.

Initially the game was very fun, but the combination of a lack of updates and the playerbase figuring out how to abuse broken mechanics has made the game a chore to play. The developers went radio silent for nearly two months, then released a ""content drop"" that consisted of overpriced skins that are essentially already in the game; the numerous balancing issues and exploits were left untouched for the most part, which leaves the game in a bad state where every other match includes people figuratively or literally cheating while intentionally wasting your time on a regular basis. I was genuinely hoping that the developers would support this game with continuous updates and regular content drops such as new maps and characters, but so far they've disappointed me in every way and until that changes I'll be leaving this review negative.

Definitely worth picking up, this game is a breath of fresh air in a genre that's dominated by the steaming pile of garbage that is Dead By Daylight.

There are 3 places in which you will be mostly spending your time with within this game.
The first place is the Lobby. 
The matchmaking and also servers sometimes eat dirt while also some killers just wont play leather-face and then everyone is sitting in the lobby readied up but the game cant start with leather face.
The second place is the Progression.
You will most likely start spending more time here the longer you play this game since as you level up you gain points to use on characters which is interchangeable between all characters and sometimes you wanna play family then other times victims. Also clicking each and every nod then waiting for the next node to be clicked... You will understand.
The third is the Actual Game.

The bad, and why I don't recommend it, is purely what they are doing about DLC. It's highway robbery, and a quick way to turn many players off from it. The pricing alone will make the lobby dodging and taking lobbies hostage issues that are already present even worse. The price for cosmetics is whatever, it's only cosmetics. but $10 for A SINGLE character is insane. Ain't even atleast the family member and victim combo'd together, it's just one of em.

Who tf thought that was a good idea for a report system? At least FIX the hacking problem if you can't report people properly.
Also they clearly have never heard of a matchmaking system. Literally every match I go into with at least 2 brand new players, level 00, account level less than 17, and I go against a 3 stack killer group all level 10, account level 50-99, or a 4 stack survivor group all player level 60+. Can you at least pretend you're trying to make this fair?
Definitely don't recommend it in its current state, ESPECIALLY at $40. Maybe $5 for what it is right now. I've been reading other reviews and I don't know if it's cause they're all from August and they completely reworked the game or something, but I've been playing for 2 days and it's COMPLETELY killer sided. No questions asked. All these reviews are saying its an instant win for survivor and it sucks to play killer, but I've played every character and it is completely impossible to escape as survivor without a full group of people you know, and it's not that hard to get kills playing solo. Not only is it killer sided but the servers suck as everyone else says, game crashes a lot and kicks everybody randomly. Also a lot of random bugs that don't affect the game much like floating textures etc. Really disappointed tbh but I guess it is fun with friends.

Heads up: Right now, overlays (like Afterburner) being turned on causes the game to crash.

It's a fun game, has a lot of potential.  Has a few bugs that need to be worked out.  It took them a few days but for me at least they solved the invalid credentials error.  Still have to run it on high preset if you don't want stuttering during opposing team interactions, I never get 0 xp like some people, but on the postgame screen it always tells me I got way more XP/progress than I actually got (ie. saying I got 12k XP from a match but in reality it only applies 2.2k, and that reflects on my account).

Leveling up and getting a random perk you reroll a whole build around is annoying, they should just let you select from the perk pool random pulls from.

I have over 400 hours in DbD since 2017 at this point.  This game is fun too.

I currently have 23 hours of playtime, but at least 3 of these hours was me trying to play the game. It's really common to get a blue screen when the game is opening, restarting your computer, it happened to me three times on total. Not only that, but the game itself takes too long to load. You can notice how bad the optimization in the game is by closing the game, a warning appears, saying: ""The game crashed, would you like to send a report about it?"" (Yeah, the game crashes when you press Alt + F4 or simply click ""Quit to Desktop"" in game). Before you say: ""Your computer is probably bad and can't handle it"", the answer is no, the first few weeks the game was running fine, but after a patch, the game started to crash constantly and taking ages to load (guess the patch haven't really patched any bugs). Also, it's a shame for the developers to take almost 3 months to release a simple update (which only added paid skins to the game, nothing else, which are also poorly made and costing 5+ dollars which. That's a shame and also unfair since the game is already paid plus it's really expensive in other countries). Plus, after the update, after finding a match the game sent me back to the main menu saying: ""Invalid credentials set"", which made me instantly exit the game because I wasn't going to wait another 5 minutes to find a single match.

> Graphics:
-Pretty good, but like I said, the game is badly optimized, so you're probably going to need a GTX 3090 and 64gb ram to run the game on low graphics (Seriously, my computer can run every single game in the world and couldn't handle this one).

> Enjoyment:
-When the game is working, it's really enjoyable, but after getting stuck in spectating screen or inside a wall it's not really fun. Also, I got tired of the game after 20 hours playtime, and every single time I try to play it a bug happens (leaving me no choice but to leave the game, since these are unplayable bugs) or a blue screen appears. Also, the game is really unfair for both sides, since no character is balanced in this game, and you can also be eliminated in the first minutes of a match.

> Where can you play it:
-PC and console.

> Controls:
-Different from every other games I've played, but they're good enough and easy to learn. There is no tutorial teaching you the controls, you have to learn them by yourself.

> Learn how to play:
-There's no tutorial, you have to learn how to play the game by yourself.

> Difficult:
-The game is really unbalanced, so it's pretty hard for both sides. 

>Expectation: 10/10
>Reality: 04/10 (One of the biggest disappointment in my life, I expected way more...)

> About the price:
-Terrible, too expensive and lots of bugs included (+ if you want any other content in the game like skins, you'll have to pay a fortune too if you live in a country who doesn't pay in dollar).

> Do i recommend buying it:
-No, don't do that to yourself, use your money for something else that's going to be worth it (like food, another game, clothes, whatever).",1696608844,1698273195,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Both sides are really fun and balanced, you feel tense as a victim and feel powerful as Family, the latter does require more coordination and skill but learning the game is not only straightforward but rewarding too.
The games has a few things to learn and get the hang off but it's never overwhelming.
DLC is a bit expensive but it's very much optional, the base family members are all fun and strong and most perks are usable, once you have perks at level 3 you truly feel like a powerhouse.

The core issues that make this game frustrating remain unaddressed, and it's starting to seem like the developers are more interested in milking the player base than in fixing the gameplay problems.

One of the most glaring issues is the chainsaw overheat problem. It's been a persistent annoyance since day one.
Another recurring problem is the loss of experience points after a ping disconnect. This kind of annoyance can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you've invested time and effort into the game. It's surprising that such a basic issue remains unresolved. The long lobby wait times are yet another irritation. These wait times further add to the growing list of reasons why my enthusiasm for the game has waned.

The most significant disappointment, though, is the feeling that this game is more about profit than player enjoyment. It's disheartening to think that the days of developers creating games for the sheer joy of gamers seem to be dwindling. Instead, it appears that companies are solely focused on selling their products for maximum profit.

As a player who's seen the industry evolve, I can't help but feel a tinge of nostalgia for those golden gaming days.

The ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" game is a stomach-churning descent into mediocrity that left my tummy in knots for all the wrong reasons.

Graphics: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
Visually, this game is a train wreck. The textures are muddier than a pigsty after a downpour, and character models look like they were crafted by a toddler with Play-Doh. Prepare for a nauseating blend of poor lighting and uninspiring environments.

Gameplay: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
If you expected to be thrilled by the adrenaline-pumping gameplay, you'll be sorely disappointed. The controls are sluggish and unresponsive, making even the most straightforward tasks feel like a Herculean effort.

Sound: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
The audio design is equally dreadful. You'll be treated to a never-ending loop of monotonous chainsaw revving and lackluster screams. It's as if the sound designer ran out of ideas and decided to stick with the most irritating sound possible.

Bugs and Glitches: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
This game is riddled with more bugs and glitches than a rundown shack in the Texas backwoods. From characters clipping through walls to game-breaking crashes, it's a masterclass in unfinished development.

In conclusion, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a grotesque failure in the realm of gaming. It's so bad that playing it will make you physically ill, and the only thing scarier than Leatherface is the thought of wasting your time on this monstrosity.

Matches were fun at launch, (on either side), when no one knew what they were doing. The honeymoon lasted about 30 hours over the first two weeks after release, for me. 

More content in the form of layouts for existing maps, mutators or varied game modes, more new maps, or some kind of randomization would keep this game afloat. There should be some kind of meta-experience for endgame players to encourage risky play with worthwhile rewards. Victims should be encouraged to spend more time in danger, family to be more sadistic or methodical.

Even something as simple as calling your kills in advance and being rewarded for it. Or a specific victim being assigned to a killer for a bonus. ""As the cook, kill Connie"" Then players are motivated to communicate their goals and coordinate. Games like PayDay2 and Fortnite manage this very well, and it keeps their formulaic gameplay from going stale.

Unfortunately, the rewards have to be worth the grind, and these devs are already selling blood splashed skins for 5$, and single outfits in 5 colors for 5$...

P.S. a collaboration with House of 1000 Corpses would be appreciated, someone get Rob on the phone.

Don't expect playing Victim to be fun until you manage to start leveling your characters up. Leatherface starts in the basement with you, and you will be on the run from the moment you load into the match. 
Don't expect your game to last more than five minutes if you're queueing up solo- 80% of the time, the other two Family players will either trap the shit out of any basement exit -or- flood into the basement. General Family strat is to kill as many Victims in the basement as possible and then camp the easier exits to reach. If the Family team has a Sissy player, expect that Grandpa will be fully leveled within 3 minutes, so you're not going to be able to hide for very long unless someone is brave and stabs Gramps (Preferably Leland, if anyone is playing him). 
Pick your main based on their special ability, rather than on cosmetics or stats- a lot of killers play with max brightness so hiding isn't really that effective unless you're a REALLY ballsy player, and also you can blast stats with the attribute points from the skill tree so that your base stats no longer matter. 

While I think that this game is COMPARABLE to DbD, I don't think it will ever replace DbD as top dog in the Asymm Horror Game market, simply because it's a single franchise with limited content, at least for the moment. If you're coming to this game to try to escape DbD's notoriously toxic community, this is not going to be the game for you because you will face many of the same struggles you face in DbD, ESPECIALLY if you prefer to main the 'survivor' side of the equation. 


And for the love of god, use the push to talk function if you can. SO many games go south for Victim players early-on because there's no communication between players in-game as to who the killers are on or where they are.",1693852259,1698180056,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Despite me giving a positive review because of my overall experience, I would also like to mention things that I didn't like so much. First of all, some people say that matchmaking takes a lot of time.. I have never experienced this issue, however it is true that matchmaking as a survivor takes way longer, and this also depends on your timezone in my opinion (UTC+2 is mine). There is also not a lot of content for now. You pay $40 for a game with too little content, however devs promised to add new content soon (Even tho some people are not so happy about what they announced). The game is extremely fun for the first couple of hours, however it soon gets repetitive. Some people might not mind, but if you're a person that doesn't like when a game gets repetitive extremely fast, then wait until new stuff gets added. The game also has a lot of bugs, and sometimes crashes even if you have a better computer. So far it hasn't been fixed so be aware of that. I've seen some people saying that this game is dying, however it is definitely not dead!

I would also like to say that this game is more fun with friends. Playing solo can get boring very soon but if you have your friends in your team, then I'm sure that you will have fun for longer. Communication in this game is the key to winning, however if you play solo team communication is not that common. if you have friends who play this game and you would like to play together, then I think that this game is an excellent choice for you!

When it comes to my experience, I only played solo so far, but despite me not being good in this game I'm still having an amazing time. This game really caught my attention when it came out and I must say that I'm very happy with the game.

Hope to see this game getting even better soon!!",1698084730,1698084730,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is different in every other way. DBD started without licensing seven years ago, not without its own developmental hardships mind you. I don't think people take those things into consideration with their complaints. The cost of milk is up 25.26% higher than seven years ago. Inflation and entertainment IP licensing play a big part in cosmetic and dlc pricing, but we still want to compare it to a game's price point from seven years ago that didn't have to pay licencing fees at first. Every one is struggling to keep up with inflation and post pandemic price gouging. Dev companies are not immune to it. We need to support them financially if we want their content to continue. That's just a fact of late-stage capitalism. 
 TCM is far more detailed than DBD and the love for the IP is apparent in the game. The game play loop has never bored me personally. I still smile getting kills as family and still smile getting killed as a victim. Yes there are bugs, but name a game that hasn't launched without them. I'm not trying to make excuses for them, but complaining about launch bugs now a days feels like complaining about having to breath oxygen. The bugs will be fixed in time, and honestly, there haven't been enough circumstantial issues in my time playing to even mention. The internet loves their mountains of molehills.
The game is only three months old, and people are acting like it should be where DBD is now after seven years and I think thats where the problem lies with the negativity. We've all learned that you can't trust most of the internet and people are quick to jump into mob mentality. The only one thing I will agree with is, whoever the asshat on the GUN twitter is, they're making the whole company look bad, and should be fired. Why would you respond with shit like that. Who the fuck do you think you are, Tobe Hooper?

The game play can be confusing sometimes (it's a party game anyways) and requires lots of coordination if you're playing family, otherwise the victims escape in like two minutes. Victims don't need nearly as much coordination, but against a good communicating team, it can be hard to escape.
Rating: 3/5 since it's really fun to play (especially with friends!), but is an asymmetrical game which makes it unbalanced and maps sometimes give one side an advantage over the other.",1693956767,1698025514,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Seems the developers care more about creating cash grab cosmetics than address the massive systemic problems the game has had since release. Also the developers act like man children on social media and ban anyone on the official game sub-reddit that speaks out against the way the game is headed.

I don't even want a Halloween event even though this is a horror inspired video game.

What I want is them to address performance issues,bugs,crashes,glitches,perk balancing,victim balancing,family balancing,and map balancing.We just get really bad overpriced cosmetics instead of the real problems being addressed in this game. Also before anyone says their art department is different than the department that handles everything else I mention above. Gun Interactive has 12 employees they seriously chose to make really bad cosmetics over addressing all the issues the game has had since launch.

The game is already dying due to these developer's social media rants and censoring people that speak out about the problems the game has from a technical standpoint. Also the game is dying because all the real issues that I mentioned above haven't been addressed at all yet.

With a sadden heart I can't recommend anyone to purchase this game anymore. The developers ruined Friday the 13th and it looks like they will ruin TCM as well. Just play it on game pass until the game inevitably dies due to the developers sheer incompetence,cash grabs, and spoiled man children attitudes.

This is a statement regarding the future of TCM from the Gun Interactive CEO.
""Nothing is guaranteed. The higher the hype, the more likely ""Hollywood"" picks up the phone."".

I just wanna point out this is the same publisher from the Friday the 13th game, the game that had incredible hype at launch and was dead within six months because of copyright issues involving Hollywood. And the CEO is already admitting that they have done nothing to secure a future for this game while telling you to believe this game has a future.

From a very quick look, the 1974 movie copyright is not the same copyright owner for all the other movies, in fact I'm pretty sure almost every single movie has it's each own individual copyright. One of these copyright holders is Platinum Dunes, aka Michael Bay. And to make it even more confusing the copyright holder for TCM2 folded and merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. Which if I am right about these being the copyright holders, there is no chance of securing any more of the TCM IP in the future.

I can't imagine this game lasting long into 2024, even if given access to the entire TCM IP why would somebody play this over DbD where at least you have all those options vs just TCM. If you like the game that's fine but you need to understand how a CEO saying ""Hollywood doesn't work like that, licensing in general is a mess."" is just not a good sign.",1692511122,1697870805,False,0,0,0.467532455921173096,0,True,False,False

Now let me get the pro's and cons about tcm...

Pro's:
This is fast pace in good and bad ways here on both the killer and survivor side.
The killers are pretty cool *even though I played 2 killers, will play the other killers soon*
The survivors are quite interesting to play as, I play as the black survivor which is quite fun.
The maps are quite executed really damn good which I like on both sides so no hate there.
The killers have they're unique perks which I think kick ass, same with the survivors.
This is a lot better than dbd, I have over 80+ days on console which is quite insane in the brain, hopefully I can beat it on tcm.
Def better with friends that's for sure and I streamed it for 2hrs on my channel.

Now the con's:
There are some sweats, which is quite uncanny.
The wait time is quite unbareable.
Some glitches as survivor, not sure about killer side yet.
People hardly play as bubba which sucks to.
They need killer skins, and more survivor skins for the other survivors.

So far this game gets a good solid 4/5 stars for this game overall, ALOT better than dbd I can say that much, would play this again.",1697780721,1697780721,True,0,0,0.499209403991699219,0,True,False,False

Grandpa can be max leveled within 5 minutes which makes it impossible to escape without being detected. as victim you are 100% limited on perks so you cant make a perk build to counter the family without having to compromise even if you wanted to. the skill points are also capped so you can only max out 1 trait out of the 5 you are offered. if you are a casual player who is looking to just have fun and not be frustrated i highly recommend not playing until they nerf family or buff survivors in a way to where they are evenly balanced. i've played the game for over 100 hours and i find it hard to enjoy the game or have fun without family playing based off meta the exact thing the developers talked about not wanting in their game hence the reason they nerfed victims so hard. as of right now the player base is slowly disintegrating because casual players are not finding the the game to be fun to play in the current state it is in. overall i give the game 3/10 gameplay wise.,1697054663,1697669308,False,12,5,0.542794883251190186,0,True,False,False

Update:  The meta of this game is frustrating, most games only last a few minutes and it takes forever to get into a match because no one wants to play Leatherface.  On top of that I have had more exploiters and hackers in the last week than in any other game I have played. Exploits such as hiding in a car that no one can get into.

There's a solid game in here somewhere.  I've enjoyed playing it when the match could go either way but the constant speed rush is not fun.

The devs have decided to punish PC players because of poor EAC, by disabling cross-play for only PC players. That means exceptionally long queue times...

There is no date for when it would be re-enabled. This potentially means it could be indefinite if the cheaters are that much smarter than the people running the show. It boggles the mind how there was no foresight for the incoming cheaters that are all but guaranteed.

[/h3]this game overall for me playing it the past few months has been a complete blast. Heres a list of pros and cons incase your wondering on if you should buy the game or not.[/h3]
[/h2]Pros:[/h2]
a. Having every character do different things is an amazing touch to the game, it gives so many possible interactions with characters; such as Placing different traps at different locations with Hitchhiker, or having [/b]literal[/b] wallhacks with Sonnie's Ability which you can play as stealthy or ballsy as possible with.  
b. Different exits on different maps with different spawn points every single time to give you something new to do every time you play. Which could also lead to you setting up differently to how you might exit or play family.
c. Perk setups and the way abilities work, grinding to get levels to make yourself stronger and building your levels up on your perks makes for a good time overall
d. Gun is honest about how they are making this game. They address issues and make sure the community is fine before they take the next step. People begging for new content can look anywhere and see that they have new characters, they just need to make sure the finishing touches are in before the new characters bug out the game, because like with Cyberpunk 2077 you dont want to rush video games, it makes it die sooner than if you just didnt release anything.

[/h2]Cons:[/h2]
a. The game can be buggy at points, which might leave you in a wall after you kill a victim, lock minigames breaking to the point where you have to get a new lock pick, and not colliding with the ground making you fly in the air. These can have their frustrations the first times you get them and some times after, but once you get used to them they are pretty easy to avoid.
b. Upcoming character pricing is one thing I do not agree with, seeing the pricing I originally thought it was $5 a character and $10 for a bundle; but recently ive been seeing people say its $10 a character? I would be fine with $5 but not $10. If anyone from Gun Media is reading this, I know they wont, I love your game and can afford it, but $10 is steep as fuck and nowhere close to a right price.
c. Bubba Dodging is a huge issue since there [/u]NEEDS[/u] to be a Bubba in the game, it can lead to lobbies dissolving over time. 
d. Hackers are an issue many people have been facing, yet, I have 200+ hours in the game and ive only seen about 3 hackers, they arent as widespread as you'd think they are in this game based on the reviews.

[/h2]Final thought:[/h2]
I never played Friday the 13th prior to playing TCM, but I feel like they care for how every perk and character is put together and create a definite call back to the 1974 film and I %100 recommend the game even if you have not seen the original movie. You just have to look up a few tutorials or find out what everything does. It takes some time, but once you get to about level 10-20 you will understand and most likely have a fun time playing the game.",1697593098,1697593098,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has some serious balance issues. It is very heavily killer sided. Only 3 maps in the game, 2 which are small and easily controlled once anyone learns the map. You will see the same killers picked 90% of the time. Right now its cook + hitchhiker. People claim cook is slow and what not but his hearing ability is completely broken. There was a game where he was way on the complete opposite side of the map and was still able to hear me on the complete other end of the map. Hitchhiker needs to be nerfed as he is the most consistent character chosen in the entire game so much as to lobbies will sit there and timeout because no one wants to play leatherface but most definately will want to play hitchhiker. THe fact that hitchhiker starts with 3 traps and can reset set the traps an infinite number of times is extremely unbalanced. It was bad enough that he could set traps damn there at the exits of the basements and they did manage to change that but hitchhiker is still completely unbalanced. Getting tired of seeing him in 9 out of 10 games. The icing on the cake though is the limit options a survivor has to escape. There are only 4 options. Basement exit, car battery exit, generator exit, and valve exit. However getting to half of these options in all 3 maps is a extreme challenge that almost ends in certain death especially against people who like i said above know the map which is pretty much everyone by now. Devs need to increase the basement exit options to 6 doors so killers cant simply keep trapping/camping the same exits. Then once survivors our out of the basements there needs to be 6 different options to escape the family. Its to easy 4 is not enough when 2 or 3 of the available options are ALWAYS heavly guarded and a death sentence. Games use to be 50/50 when escaping. Now be lucky if you escape 1 time out of 10. Getting boring and fast. DBD provided me a good 3 years of fun. I cant even make to two months with texas chainsaw. And to all the sweaty try hard killers that all run the same meta build and are usually the ones talking the most shit, you be the same ones never to play survivor because you cant stand to lose.",1697575331,1697575331,False,3,1,0.448947042226791382,0,True,False,False

Lobby dodging, Its very easy to find a family game, HOWEVER, with people flat out refusing to play LF you will probably be playing lobby simulator MORE than the game itself, this is EVEN WORSE on the victim side.

OH and lets not forget, if the game DOESNT fill up the lobby b4 the time runs up, you WILL GET KICKED BACK TO THE MAIN MENU. In what world was this a good idea???? On top of this and  all the other bugs I havent mentioned, the devs have the testicular fortitude to announce DLC pricing, $10 for ONE character???? Really? I hate comparing games but DBD, Gives you TWO characters for the price/less. AND you can earn some of the characters for FREE. This game doesnt seem to have that option so you'll end up PAYING regardless. I also believe disabling crossplay for as long as they did really messed up the momentum for this game, and it's a shame because I WANT THE GAME TO SUCCEED. It's fun! It's something different! Until they get their shit together, I cannot recommend the game. FIX YOUR GAME FIRST, then we can talk about dlc. I am willing to change my review, and even play again once they get the bugs under control.",1697475144,1697475144,False,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I didn't come in expecting it to be the same as those, but I thought this game would hit hard for me. however, i am very disappointed and honestly feel like i wasted my money. 

Simply put... the map choices are bad (3 maps), the ways to win get repetitive fast (3 ways to win as victim), killers often camp objective or doors often if they know someone is close or has been tampering with them (not really their fault, it is just how the game is designed). this ends up turning the game into just extremely slow paced hide and seek. Many times as victim i find myself waiting for a killer to leave an area but they never do so i cant go anywhere. When I play family I feel like if i leave an area i know people are trying to escape i will lose ( and many times I am right). It just turns every victim match into a speed run where no victims really help one another. some of those things can change with time of course, but I am not sure its worth my time waiting on a game like this to get there. plus some of the content will be pay walled (new killers, victims and skins). There are also nitpicks i have here and that i wont drag on about. Those gripes along with some of the things above could be considered subjective...

 There are things however that are just plan awful. The pricing of the game, and its dlc. its not worth 40 bucks in its current state, and the pricing for future content ive seen is expensive. For example there will be a special leatherface skin for 16 bucks, all new characters will be 10 bucks A PIECE, and then various skins and execution packs for 5 or so bucks. basically the game was 40 bucks for 4 killers and victims and if you want to have any more it will cost you serious money. ask yourself if that is worth it. if it is then by all means continue. if not stay away. 

Then there are the matchmaking errors.... When the game first came out it was damn near unplayable, and it was pretty much impossible to stay in a party for more than one match. but after the latest update on october 3rd. I still get stuck in infinite lobby matchmaking to the point where i have to reload the game, I still disconnect, and then when i finally get in the game i still can find not just one bug... but several. 

Not for me... not for people who want a chill fun horror experience. it suffers from the same problems as dbd in that area. people take the game so seriously or play super toxic/ curse you out in the lobbies. ultimately there will be people who disagree with this review and thats fine, but as for me I am having to kick myself for pre ordering a game without doing the legwork and proper research.

The game is surprisingly detailed.
I like everything about this game so far except the fact Leatherface chainsaw stalls during the Grandpa cut scene, everyone who plays this game knows what I am talking about.
Leatherface does seem to be the most powerful family member but can easily get screwed over for example thrusting the chainsaw through gaps should hit victims more often than it is now. There is almost no counterplay to this as LF unless you have another family around the other side to attack the victim.
Apart from Leatherface having a few bugs or glitches such as the thrust doing no damage, oh and watching victims roll over a table with the barbed wire and being unable to do anything until they finish their animation is annoying, Surely LF can thrust his chainsaw under the barbed wire or immediately start the animation to cut the table whenever a victim vaults it and if the victim hasnt fully vaulted the table, they lose health or they have less time to run because LF is already cutting the table during the victim vault animation instead of after it, making it less of a free escape at times for victim.

Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a multiplayer only game where there are three killers and four survivors, naturally on separate teams.

As a killer your job is to hunt down the survivors using various methods such as traps, melee damage, locking doors and overall being a stonewall obstacle that the survivors need to overcome. Unlike other entries of this genre, namely DBD, it is a lot harder for the survivor to just play around and mess with you (Although it can be done with good co-ordination but is few and far between) and since you can melee attack multiple times, meaning survivors can't just pan their camera and run circles around you. It doesn't work. Once your team has killed all four survivors, you win.

As a survivor your job is to escape. Escaping can be done in various methods, usually there's a locked gate/electric exit, a water pressure exit and a basement exit. All of these have their pros and cons, but I see it more as high risk high reward. For example, usually the electric exit is the most obvious one as there's always plenty of places to hide but requires some free time to get the generator off and a few lockpicks, definitely the most simple but takes the longest. Where as the basement exit only requires a fuse and a lockpick and is usually very close to the fusebox if you know where to look, but the fusebox is almost always in a high traffic area, so you need to pick your moments.

Survivors and Killers both have talent trees which you can mess about with, upgrade and invest in certain skills to suit your own playstyle.

There's not too much else to it, the gameplay loop is fun and engaging, sure you need to learn the maps a bit and there are some skills which are more meta than others, but that's just how video games are in general so I don't see it as much of a criticism. 

Overall, if you're looking for something less toxic than Dead by Daylight, or feel like you're too late to the party for Dead by Daylight, give this a go, it might be worth your time.  7/10.",1697257196,1697257196,True,3,0,0.512383878231048584,0,True,False,False

Family game play. yes the kills/executions are enjoyable. but it falls short due to some teammates not even remotely cooperating. basically a free for all. or even kill stealing. which in short lets the others escape if two killers are chasing down 1 guy.
Ruins exp earning. just needs a better implemented system. 

Victim game play also is fun (when your team is working together). yes you can have matches where your the sole survivor but its most likely due to the killers not knowing how to play.
it takes the i'm scared sh***** and i need to escape and replaces it with a mini game tap tap tap. Run.Run.Run. tap tap tap. Run.Run.Run. its repetitive.

that's the issue with games like this DBD,F13,Evolve. suffers from the lack of repetitiveness. they were all fun at first but then it becomes this annoying frustration of Non skill based Matchmaking. And a chore..... its fun with friends but. I'd say wait and get it on sale.

The players sure aren't though!

EDIT: First patch shot the game in the leg, I don't know what the devs are thinking. Balance issues have gone completely unaddressed, all major bugs are still present and instead they ripped a core feature out of the game.

A pretty damn solid game, and a strong competitor to DBD.

There is very little sitting around in this game, each character actually has differences and perks can yield entirely new playstyles. Dead by daylight may have a lot more content, but most of it is very flat with survivors being just different models to play with. In this game, every killer is unique and every survivor is unique with different base stats and a unique power.

With a few patches, this game will be solid. With fresh new maps, survivors and killers, this game will soar.

Only issues, all relatively minor: (Mostly putting here for the devs tbh)
-Progression is a bitch, you CAN'T do it while waiting for match making, or while waiting for a match to start. Then it's highly randomized where you only get a small handful of random perks and a bunch of set ones. You can respec as many times as you want for absolutely no cost which is nice.. but you end up having to play roulette to get the builds you want. Utterly insanely stupid approach to progression, especially since you can't actually do any of it while queuing to play, you have to completely stop and sit there.

-Game is slightly killer-sided. (Have spent a decent amount of time playing both sides)

-Balance issues, especially with certain perk combinations.

-Some instability

although the game seemed unbalanced with 3 killers and only 4 survivors, it seems much more balanced than dbd and it is a bit more complex because you can escape in much more interesting ways. From my point of view at the moment it is perhaps on a par with dbd and if they made updates they could take the game much higher in the top, but tcm does not have such a competitive system and this could affect the number of constant players.
However, the price should be reduced to 20 euros and more dlcs, more killers, survivors and maps should be added. A rework of the leveling system would also be good


comparing it with other horror games on steam or games that work on the same idea (for example dbd, friday, evil dead and other horror games with stories) it definitely deserves a top 5 or maybe even top 3. It's still at the beginning but there is no need to waste time and updates should be made so that the game lasts as long as possible because it has great potential

They blame the players for it not being fun for someone to use something the devs put into the game. Any game where you play against another human being to win is competitive by nature, and designing a game to be roleplay oriented instead of balanced just doesn't work. You can balance a game while still having strong roleplay elements. They failed at this concept with Friday and they've failed here. Team Fortress 2 is a game I see brought up a lot in discussion, about how that game's community isn't toxic, and how those people are just there to have fun and aren't really concerned with playing to win. But TF2 was designed to be a competitive game, Texas Chainsaw wasn't. Texas Chainsaw is a game developed to be casual, but it has all the elements of a competitive game, and that's where it will fail. Additionally, there IS a competitive scene in TF2, but it's mostly invite only because they only want certain people there. And TF2's community polices itself, in casual servers, new players who might just want to play the game are babied, bullied, or kicked for wanting to play the game instead of mess around. They literally force people to play how they want. TF2 was balanced around being competitive, Texas Chainsaw isn't balanced at all for the sake of immersion. And don't get me wrong, TF2 doesn't have perfect balance, but there's outliers in every game, that's why ""metas"" even exist. Texas Chainsaw has absurdly broken things in it and the player is meant to not use those things to break immersion. The instant someone wants to actually win a game of Texas Chainsaw, everything comes apart and you're left with Family members with builds that hit more than they should, or do an insane amount of damage, etc. and Victims that escape in less than 3 minutes or stun Family for up to a minute.

The gameplay loop is okay, it's similar to Friday but a lot more condensed so there's always something happening. You can stun lock a family member for up to a minute (maybe more but that's the most I've seen). I prefer the open map of Friday a lot more, but I do see the appeal of this game.

The playerbase blames the Dead by Daylight community for the game becoming optimized and toxic, as if Dead by Daylight is the ONLY game in the world that has been optimized or has a ""toxic"" community. It's genuinely hilarious that DBD has been hyped up as this super toxic game, as the examples of genuine toxicity are few and far between, but that's a topic for another day. Essentially, the playerbase became toxic towards the playerbase because the playerbase has played a different asymmetric horror game before because Texas Chainsaw wasn't the first.

In short, the devs are whiney and can't balance a game, the playerbase points fingers at people for maybe playing a different game in the same genre, and I just don't like the gameplay all that much. I really want to like the game, I can really see how people do, but in it's current state I would rather play Postal 3.",1696537888,1696537888,False,7,1,0.536562860012054443,0,True,False,False

Yeah, even tho I heard a lot about survivors cheating a lot but what you expect from an online game? People always will cheat no matter what. Still I did not really seen any obvious cheater tho. Most of the time the Family side has won, when I played at least. If it is really a big issue then I hope it will be fixed soon. 

Anyways I think just because it is a 3vs4 it makes it a lot better than dbd. Without all those items especially clicky clicky Flashlights this game makes the killer side pretty more enjoyable. Also I love how both sides have to do a lot of teamwork. Of course you can play all by yourself but playing as a team works better in my eyes. 

Besides all of that in my opinion it is also better because you don`t have to learn a lot, of course map knowledge can lead you to easier win. There`s no stress to hustle on one killer, any big jukes or loops and whatever. 

Still you have to think a bit especially as a killer, I think. But for now I think this is way better than DBD. 

I hope this won`t ever change and become like DBD themself. 

For now I stay with a solid 8/10 due to know cheaters.

As I'm editing this review to add more information, I'll leave the original review at the bottom.

Before that though, a couple of people have tried to correct me by saying that Sissy does not have an unintended poison attack, and that it's just a perk. Incorrect. Regardless of whether you equip the poison cloud perk, her primary attacks when landed on a Victim apply a mini poison effect that can stack. In some cases, if hit enough times, they can get so slowed down they'll appear to be running in place. This has been confirmed to be unintended by community moderators on their Muerto Times post on Reddit, as well as even prior to it, though I don't remember where. 

Their most recent patch (September 12th) has made incredible progress at [b]not[/b] fixing the  issues the game has to offer currently. It has also made but one change that should've been done since the game's launch at trying to balance the game between the teams. This change is having the car battery on at the beginning of the match. Other than that, no meaningful change. Let me elaborate why.

They've limited bone scraps to 3 uses per pile, which in reality does almost nothing but limit trolling by the Victims. Since Victims can and will escape within 5 minutes without even needing a bone knife in the first place, this change only limits the players that like messing with the Family by stabbing them or the grandpa, or getting into close encounters. Essentially, it does almost nothing in terms of changing/balancing the gameplay. It does have some positive effects on gameplay, scenarios like stabbing the Family when someone else is in a close encounter, or stabbing Bubba when he's breaking an object, but then again, with the amount of bone piles around the map in combination with the limited uses a bone scrap has having just 3 per pile is more than enough. Overall, it makes sense once you consider that in an interview they've claimed to want their game to be as realistic to the event as possible. However, this does nothing to touch on repeated door-slamming, which from experience is much worse than just one stab to the back.

I should mention they've fixed some collision issue but I don't think I've ever experienced it so I don't have an opinion on it, but that's basically it. Other notable fixes they've made were fixing an achievement, fixing an XP farm method by the Cook, made some further anti-cheat improvements (good), and they've disabled re-spec in-lobby, which is a bit weird since they have a 3-minute wait timer in-lobby. Well, it was 3, they then changed it to 5 minutes without even mentioning it in their patch, but now they've reduced it back to 3. So.. Why? Why have a 3-minute wait timer if you can no longer re-spec your character in the lobby? Don't they play their own game before making changes? 

About the game itself.
If you don't consider all of the above and imagine a game where these issues are fixed, it could be a fun game. It was fun for me for the first 50 hours or so, when it worked. However I was playing with a friend. The problem lies in the times when it didn't. Credential errors that were luckily fixed, frequent server crashes that crashed 6 times in my last 5 hours. These are crashes that freeze the entire server, not just you, and force you to leave the match. They happened even before their patches, and keep happening. Bugged characters (Sissy's poison, Hitchhiker's traps, Sonny's ability not showing what it should, grandpa's waking up cutscene causes Leatherface to stall if they are revving when it happens), bugged maps, bugged animations, etc etc.

Their lobby and character selection system is atrocious. You get to select one character, unless they're taken, then you level up this character until in one game they're taken. Because of the perk system and how perk points are awarded, you can't take these perks from your leveled character and invest them in your current one unless you leave the lobby, which defeats the purpose. This means if you want to play with a character with good perks you need to have at least 4 fully leveled Victims, or 3 fully leveled Family, so that you have at least something you enjoy playing as available, if all but one are taken, or keep leaving lobbies.

The current maps and their difficulties for both teams are really far apart. I will not go into elaboration, but Family House is by far the easiest to play with Family, since it has very close basement exists with none leading to the outside (except for one but the Victims would have to go through the house anyway). The other two, Slaughter House and Gas Station, are hard on the Family. Victims have a major play-area with their basement exits being far apart, and having at least 4 exits to oversee (5 on Gas Station), the Family often struggles to counteract the Victims with how many crawl spaces, gaps and wells there are around the map, with combination of Bone Scraps and Victim abilities to boot, the game is almost exclusively Victim sided. I've played both teams.

To finalize, I'd like to correct myself. The game has a great idea, but it has an incompetent person in charge. 
I'd suggest avoiding this game currently and wait for a better opportunity. The times when nobody knew anything are over, and the issues with the game are much more apparent now. Until it's fixed, I do not recommend this game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[u]Original review:[/u]

Great game idea with incompetent developers.

One of the Family members, Sissy, has an unintended attack effect that applies poison to the Victims upon landing a hit. It has been an issue ever since launch. Something that should've been fixed within days is not fixed over two weeks later, with the first ever patch note not even addressing it. Problem is the developers acknowledeged it, yet it's still there. 

Next, they've temporarily disabled crossplay for PC players in order to battle cheaters. This means that anyone playing on PC will face cheaters much more often, since the issue has been getting worse by the day. I don't think I've been in a lobby full of PC players before. If anything, I've seen more console players in my lobbies. Not only does it mean PC player lobbies will have a much higher chance of a cheater being present in their game, it also means friends that relied on crossplay to play together will not be able to do so now. So if you played because of the company of your friends, tough luck, as they've essentially blocked the access to the game you've paid for.

Additionally, some very smart person decided to allow lobby starting with 6 players over the intended 7. I won't be surprised if the moment such a match starts people will leave the match, or leave the lobby if it's not full right away. In my opinion this will only enhance lobby hopping since no punishment is present anyway, and besides, it's a braindead idea regardless.

As a last note, the customer paid full price for this game. It does not matter at all the size of the team or the compexity of the game. As a developer of any kind you are expected to deliver a fully functioning product. (This is not an Early Access). Releasing a product with issues is already bad manners, but not fixing these issues when you clearly have the ability to do so is even worse. Won't even talk about these patch note changes. Ridiculous.

Edit: So I'm changing my review mainly for the absolute disrespect from the company themselves. Thanks to the developers' ""No cares given"" attitude, many people are already leaving this game.

PROS: 

Fun
Feels rewarding whether you win or lose
Has a unique feel in comparison to the other games similar to this one. 
As of 10/3/23, Crossplay is re-enabled again. For now. 


CONS: 
Future DLC will be overpriced and pay to win. (Check their twitter/reddit posts for proof)
One specific dev on their team is absolutely rude to their player base (Check em out on Reddit and you'll see)
Player base is dropping at alarming rates. It was 20k now it's already about 2k or less. Give it a few months and it'll be a dead game just like Hood Outlaws and Legends.  
Lobby queues take forever because nobody wants to play Leatherface and Leatherface is REQUIRED to start a match. Lots of people lobby dodge because of this and this will only get worse when they release new characters. 
Their text chat doesn't have censorship so you can spell out many racist words in chat. 
No way to report specifically for racism. 

About a week ago, I would have recommended this game but as of today, I'm going to say PASS on this one. It's an absolutely fun game don't get me wrong but with the direction they're going, definitely not worth the 40 dollar price tag!

Update: Finally much better.  no more credential errors.  Sometimes lag out and get kicked suspiciously after a victim dies, but whatever
Update: Server stability is shit.  People are either crashing this game when they die or something is whacky.
Hackers/cheaters all over.  Like people teleporting? Wonderful.
Matchmaking is shit.  Want to play victims? Only for the first game.  Otherwise you'll constantly be swapping however the game feels like it.
This game forces you to play characters to level up skills.  Want to find out how fun it is to pick a popular character to play? Just keep on lobby surfing spending the majority of your game play trying to play the character of your choice.  You're also really limited to the characters you have enough points to max out.  Otherwise you're chances of winning is greatly diminished.

So, what pros and cons does TCM have?  
Pros:
+ Being half original, half licensed*
+ Rewards knowledge of maps' layouts 
+ Not so grindy, when talking about leveling up characters 
+ Behind the scences content of original film and game
+ Can bring feeling of fear as victim (DBD, hold my beer)
+ Nice visuals even on lowest settings possible
+++ ATMOSHPERE 
Cons...:
- Hard game for beginners, before playing I advise watching gameplay/tutorials on the web
- Bugs, bugs and bugs, lots of them
- Slow bug fix release schedule
- Cheaters that can break game entirely
- Unstable servers crash from time to time
- Lack of content 
- Repetitive gameplay to the overkill**
- No repeats on characters***
- High prices on future DLC characters in already expensive game
- Clunky controls and overall bad rebinding
*>Being half original, half licensed game is good thing and bad thing at the same time, developers have little control of the content and need to take risks when adding new content, TCM may suffer the same fate as F13 (But I hope it won't)
**>There is a little variety in matches, so most of the time you're going to do the same thing over and over, there is variety in some sort of way, most items for vitcims will be in different places, blood buckets for family, but their placement is very predictable if you remember layout of maps.
***> Yes, if you pick favorite character there is a chance that you won't be able to play him, because someone already picked him. This is somewhat problematic feature/system, but bigger problem comes in form of DLC... If you buy DLC character for high price alone, there is no gurantee that you can play this character at all, because character system prevents repeats.
</> In the end I think TCM has big potential, but there are things for now that can ruin the whole experience by much, so I don't recommend buying TCM for full price, maybe when sale will be going, maybe when half of the problems will be fixed, maybe when there will be enough content to play with.",1696352319,1696352378,False,6,0,0.519805192947387695,0,True,False,False

- ultra high latency between killers and victims, like they added a one shot ability to the main character (leatherface) if he starts to rev his chainsaw and comes close at you, there is no way to outplay this, you are going to get hit - the latency difference and the lag compensation is by far the worst I have ever seen in any online experience. Dont ask me how you can mess up the build in unreal engine netcode this much - its prolly a matchmaking issue (you get matched with people all around the world).

- the game had on initial launch crossplay enabled - they decided to disable it a week later, because you can literally get this game for 1$ on xbox gamepass and the xbox pc version does not have any anti cheat system enabled.

- playing victim is literally self-harm, if you dont dodge till you get slaughterhouse - dont even try to play any other map, they are just hot kaka, some of these ""developers"" definitely need to get fired and replaced. ""Family House"" and ""Gas Station"" need a complete rework.

- the weekly to biweekly update frequency of this game is industry worst - this game is not optimized (sometimes server, sometimes client crashes), there are countless game breaking exploits and the first few patches mostly addressed ""balancing issue"" LMAO

- interacting with doors/items feels terrible, laggy and you are mostly stuck in cutscene like animations which just play like a movie from beginning till end its just unresponsive - ""oh you are getting chased by a scout 3 hitchhiker? well why would you want to take the gap if rather get stuck in a bonescrape gather animation because its literally right next to the gap""

- ""close encounter won"" - but you are still stuck in the animation for another 5 seconds in which you can get killed INSTANTLY from a third party - this is prolly the second biggest joke in this game

I want to start off by saying that - if I had paid attention to the Developer/Publisher - I would not have purchased this game. This is the team that was behind that Hood: Outlaws and Legends which came out in 2021. A game that came out with it's share of bugs and problems which may, or may not, be fixed. The one thing I remember when considering my purchase of the game, however, is the Micro-Transactions.

Learning from the Past is how we prevent ourselves from repeating those mistakes, no?

I haven't paid much heed beyond putting in the time to get my moneys worth out of the game before this game, inevitably, dies and becomes a mix of fond and painful memories. I have noticed, however, that the game has a number of issues. Issues such the character states getting locked in place when the game has two effects take place. [Example: Jumping out a Window, getting Trapped In-front of the Window] These issues also continue with killing a target on stairs will cause the animation to lock the character into the terrain if your a Killer. I've had it rubber-band me, once, when killing someone on the stairs but this was a one-time fix that might as well have looked like I was cheating if a Victim had been there where I warped.

Issues such as getting locked in one place are just the most pressing to me because it stops the game for the person stuck. That person is officially stuck in one spot until they are let go whenever the game ends through their team killing the Victims or the Victims all escaping.  These are issues that aren't even part of the issue of hackers or cheaters as you get into later games. Issues that aren't related to the Balance which I could spend an entire day trying to break down into words.

The point of this review is to state, despite the fact that I intend to keep playing on and off until the end, I don't recommend Texas Chainsaw Massacre in it's current state. I don't recommend spending 10 dollars for a single character which may, or may not, be broken to inspire the standard 'Pay to Win' methodology. I don't recommend making any additional purchases with the game until they fix the hacker issue and, eventually, turn Cross-play back on to see if that might save the game.

I can only recommend keeping an eye on the game and seeing if they improve it over the next few months. I can attest that you will get your money but would highly recommend getting it on Sale and playing the game with friends. It might serve, even after it has died, for Private Lobbies at-least.",1696277418,1696279847,False,6,0,0.529186367988586426,0,True,False,False

The game start to have family's hard patrol issues, where the game experience starts to fell apart for the casual solo victim players, where the victims are unable to do anything due to families players know victims every move. And the game turns into a very misery experience. 

So I think a way to fix this is,  i think victims need something that can buy sometime for them.

Like for example. When families are chasing hard on the victims in full patrol situations. Victim's can like go to a cage of dogs or birds. And victims can break the cages and the groups of dogs or birds come out and the dogs or birds can keep the family's occupy that is chasing the victim for a bit of time, or victims disturb a bee hive and full of bees can occupy the family's. Or victims can run to something like a closet and i open the closet and pile of balls fell out the closet to let families slipped and keep them occupy too. So letting the victims can buy sometime. i think this can fix some of the family's hard patrols issues.

But still i would recommend TCM over DBD. TCM a very good game for friends to just have a good fun thrill tense escape game experience. I think TCM is the best high tense high pressure run and hide and get away escape thrilled asymmetric game rn to play 9/10.

Let's talk about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game. 

I gotta say, it's an absolute thrill ride! Whether you're playing as a survivor or the family man, the adrenaline rush is real.

As a survivor, the game gets your heart pounding as you run from the killers, desperately seeking hiding spots to stay alive. 

It's like a high-stakes game of hide and seek, and let me tell you, the satisfaction of outsmarting your pursuer is unmatched. 

The feeling of survival, fighting for your life, it's simply electrifying.

Now, let's switch gears and talk about playing as the family. 

Oh boy, it's a whole different kind of thrill. 

Chasing down the survivors, the excitement of hunting them, and executing those blood-curdling moves, it's downright amazing. 

The power you feel as the family is both terrifying and exhilarating.

Sure, there may be a few bumps along the way, but that's part of the charm. 

The game offers a unique experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat. 

And let's not forget about the future potential this game holds – I can see it becoming even more intense and captivating.

So, if you're someone who craves that heart-pumping excitement, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game is a must-try. 

Whether you're escaping for your life or reveling in the thrill of the chase, this game delivers an experience like no other. 

Get ready to immerse yourself in a world of survival and horror. 

It's time to unleash your inner survivor or embrace the darkness as the family man.

From frequent crashing (some nights, it's almost every 30m-1hour), to server crashing, to gamebreaking bugs, to cheaters toggling speed / invisible hacks midmatch, to lobby queues that last longer than matches because of frequent lobby dodging, to aggressive monetization of cosmetics and characters, TCM has A LOT to deal with, and that's excluding the overall balance of the game.

It's worth mentioning that I do still enjoy the game a great deal, and play it daily (Discord helps a lot).  When the game runs well, for the most part (some map designs are infuriating e.g. Pressure Valve on Slaughter House and Gas Station Cheese Door), the game is very fun, engaging and competitive when played with friends.  Every game feels different, despite only having 3 maps, and matches can feel incredibly tight and exciting when both sides put up a good fight.

The best recommendation I can do currently is maybe a sale when TCM is half off or less.

All round solid game, learning from and improving on the likes of DBD and F13, I can confidently say this is most likely the most solid built game. It does however feel a little bare bones at the moment. Only 3 maps, 2 cosmetics and only 2 kill executions for each killer outside of paid options. The 3v4 works very well. I hope to see maps, unlockables and cosmetics expanded upon, as currently it feels there is very little to work towards outside of the skill tree. I will say however I feel it was worth the price tag and like supporting these horror movie games in hopes we can see other franchises such as halloween and elm street get their own games.

Plus they have just announced that future characters whether, will be family or will cost $10 each.  In a game where you are not even guaranteed to play the character you want play.  Victim already has this problem because some victims have better useful abilities and more well rounded base stats compared to the others (sonny). While on the family side leatherface is required EVERY game so his gameplay is getting stale, combined with his chainsaw revving making everything even your teammates harder to hear the whole game, plus he is also the clunkiest feeling family in moving anywhere but forward.  

Also the new player leveling experience is horrendous family earns almost no XP per match compared to victim.  Not to mention the game has been released for almost 2 months so good luck getting new players every match from here on out.  Plus the skill tree, there are these random skills on the skill tree, and by random I mean a literal mystery you dont have any idea on which of the skills in the group its going to give you.  So, you want to copy a meta perk build? Click through every option you want but restart if you didnt get good rng and repeat until you do.  You want a second build for the same character? you have to have enough points for a second character to do that, or respec your first buildinto the new one.  But if you do want to try a new build, good luck getting your wanted mystery perks first try as some of the perks are literally useless compared to others.  

Currently the meta for victims is to rush through objectives and escape as fast as possible which is possible within 3 minutes or less if family isn't patrolling and doing their jobs or rushing you in return to get a quick kill.  So to experience the best part of the game you have to go against whats best and play stealthy to get the full atmosphere of the game and original movie its based off of.  

All in all, its an asymmetrical game that has a good atmosphere for the genre but the design choices of the developers and future monetization model will ultimately be the downfall of this game and it will end up as another horror asymmetrical dead a few months after release.",1696096464,1696096464,False,6,0,0.524444460868835449,0,True,False,False

I'm also unsure if I like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or just this virtual hide-and-seek genre.

Either way, combining Texas Chainsaw Massacre and this hide-and-seek theme makes for an incredibly entertaining and addicting game with one objective - outwitting the other team.

Two teams are split between 4 victims versus 3 family members (killers). Each team has a tiny roster for some group variety, so you won't always deal with the same victims or killers outside Leatherface - who is mandatory for the match to start.

The first 10 - 15 hours will be a struggle as you familiarize yourself with the controls, maps, and each character's abilities. It will feel unfair, unbalanced, challenging, and somewhat overwhelming. The basic UI and unintuitive skill tree won't speed up the process toward competency either. Seriously, the skill tree needs a total redesign, it's that bad.

But once you understand how each character works, you'll find one with abilities that fits your playstyle, and that's when the game shines. My 100th escape as a victim still feels just as intense and adrenaline-fueled as my first escape. Hiding in bushes and moving your character swiftly past a killer who doesn't notice you never gets old.

I mostly prefer playing Victims as it's tailored more toward solo play. Playing as The Family is also fun, but only works well if you have a party of friends or a team that communicates. Playing as The Family never feels as intense as playing a victim trying to escape.

I also think disabling crossplay entirely and slowing down games and matchmaking for PC players because of a few cheaters was bonkers levels of stupid decision making, but thankfully there are enough players to currently sustain the game until they re-enable it. The skill tree system needs completely tossed out or reworked as leveling takes too long to max them out yet the game forces you to play multiple characters contradicting the entire design purpose of having a skill tree to grind out and max characters out in which encourages people to just quit out of games if they can't get one of the only two characters they have abilities and perks on. That said, despite it's flaws, this game is as fun or more than Dead By Daylight and a very solid worthwhile investment. Having a team of killers and a team of survivors against each other takes a lot of the pain and pressure of losing the game and doesn't make you feel as helpless to bad balancing as playing killer on DBD does. Team work is everything though as a result but it's a great and welcome change to the asymmetric horror multiplayer genre. Highly recommend despite some of the prevalent flaws the game does have especially since it's only $40 and I've gotten well over 40 hours of fun and still counting on this game.",1696025740,1696025740,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've had multiple games in my short time playing in which the basement is immediately open and the victims are walking upstairs. The fact that companies still use this specific anti-cheat should be condemned, as it makes the online PVP an overall worse experience, and that has been the case for a very long time. I'm not sure if it's cheaper, or if it requires minimal work to implement, but what I do know is that other games that have used it are a good enough example that developers should know by now. 

Secondly, the survivors, if they bring the right character, they can escape within five minutes due to enhanced lockpicking. It's reasonable to still be working through the balancing since the game was just released, we all know that League of Legends just doesn't try, so we can give the devs of this game some time to make an attempt. Leland is also a frustrating aspect of the game, since he can stun you for inordinate amounts of time and lock down sprinting and attacking after you've stood up from being knocked completely prone, and this is clearly not okay. 

Other than those points, the team-based killer gameplay is pretty fun. All of the killers bring something unique to the match, and seeing how those teams mesh if very interesting. Dead by Daylight could probably stand to learn something from that since Survivors are overall meta in that game, and it could benefit from a 2v6 mode. I also don't know how this game can build off of what it has, since it's specifically Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and there's not much to that.

EDIT: They had time to make Connie less bullshit when they kicked PC out of crossplay(Which they wouldn't have to do if they weren't using one of the shittiest known anti-cheats), and left her the same. That's a critical failure. If they had play-tested this game at all, they'd know how dumb her power to unblock anything instantly is.

EDIT2: So, there's also the pressure exits to talk about. Opening a pressure exit is automatic victory for survivors, because the moment they walk through, they win, and there's no way for killers to prevent them from doing so. Further horrifically bad design is the fact that the killers can be stunned every ten seconds, and it takes longer than ten seconds to shut a pressure valve. Leland is also capable of stunning you for inordinate amounts of time, guaranteeing victory for his team. They also still haven't sufficiently nerfed Connie, and Ana can break through the window of the family house map while suffering little damage and just win the game for her team automatically.

The gameplay foundation is solid and fresh. 3 survivors vs 4 killers (named Victim and Family, but I will use the basic terms for ease of understanding). Survivors rely completely on stealth, being very vurnerable and being basically unable to defend themselves. Killers feel like actual terrifying monsters. And it's executed reasonably well, in theory. I'll get to that part later.

So why, if it's such a solid game, do I have no trust in it? Well, it feels the dev team is trying to test how fast a good game can be killed due to horrible decision making.

Let me start with the most outrageous pricing I have ever seen, announced yesterday.

This is a 39 euro game, right (40 in dollars)? Well, the pricing for new content has been set as this (will be shown in dollars since they posted it in dollars) :
Premium content: 16 dollars (prestige skins in a way)
Characters: 10 dollars (that is for 1 singular character, confirmed by the devs)
Exectuions: 7 dollars (animations after you kill a survivor)
Cosmetics: 5 dollars (normal clothing and weapon skins)
Maps etc. will be free (what even is the etc.?)

Okay, I understand. Live service games need money to keep going. It is very understandable. The skins are not the problem here. It's the characters.
10 dollars (probably will be converted to 9 euros?) for a singular character in a 40 euro game is genuinely outrageous.
Some monetization examples from other games:
Dead by Daylight, said by many to have extremely greedy developers, gives you 2 characters and some premium currency for 12-13 euro (I have heard you can now buy individual characters for 5 euro, though I can't confirm as I have not played DbD in a long while)
Overwatch 1 was 40 euros and gave you all new content for free
Overwatch 2 scratched that, but it's free to play and gives you a grind to unlock characters.
Apex Legends releases characters that cost slightly less than 10 euro, but it's also a free to play. And it still costs less.
Deep Rock Galactic is a 20 euro game that thrives on 2 cosmetic packs a year and releases a lot of free content.

So now we have a 40 euro game in TCM, demand 20 dollars for when the next victim and killer will eventually come out soon (and it's likely very soon, judging by the data mining).
And there are no hints of the characters being unlockable without spending anything.
(EDIT: Devs have confirmed there will be no earnable currency. Reason being they want it to be clear what we are spending money on. What?)
Three more times and it will be the cost of Baldur's Gate 3. Just once and you could have bought Deep Rock Galatic instead.
And of course, if the characters turn out to be OP, the game could literally be Pay 2 Win.

But, alright. I think most should understand why the pricing is scummy now, and the issues that can arise with such a model.
What other issues are there? Well:
They implemented the gamepass version without an anti cheat. Their response was to remove PC completely from crossplay. They promised it is temporary and that it will be back in 14 days or less. It has been 3 weeks. I literally can't play with my friends using an advertised feature 2 weeks in.
They took a whole month to fix a bug with one killers that was able to stunlock you if you got hit once.
They literally just fixed a bug where an unavoidable trap after you climb up a ladder would make your survivor not being able to do anything.
Game launched with no key rebindings. Finally added 2 weeks in, still has buttons missing (family vision, that by default is on scroll wheel, that tend to be worn out the fastest in every mouse).
The brand strategy lead will argue with you like an immature teenager if you are being too critical of something, and most of the dev team is not willing to budge on certain game mechanics that are really questionable (Skill tree has random perks. Respecs are free. They say the risk of respeccing is not being able to get your random perks back. You can, though, if you want to spent half an hour constantly clicking buttons to hopefully get the right combination).
Staying on the same topic, I and many others have been timed out on their official discord after criticising the pricing announcements. The reason (which was hard to acquire) was arguing. I had threats of violence against me 3 times in that discord, each one of them the person got a slap on the wrist. Official subreddit is also exclusively moderated by the game dev team, and there have been very... suspicious things done there.
XP progression is very brutal as well. 80 hours in and I have three family maxed, 1 victim and a small bit in another victim. I had the whole month free when this game was out. How is the average person supposed to progress?

Let's get to game issues, I'll keep this short as they might honestly be changed soon. The updates to the gameplay have been mostly fine. Doors are still the scariest thing in the game for killers, making some chases kinda dumb.
A character has an ability that lets them unlock a door instantly. She dominates the game, with the killers constantly worrying about her and being very happy when she dies. Don't think 1 character should have this amount of influence.
Game is extremely toxic, I prefer League's toxicity...
There is more I wanted to put here, but my tired morning brain literally just forgot what I wanted to write. So, I'll end it here.

I'd be willing to switch this review to positive if they bring back crossplay, make the characters free, and make the next update bring some good changes to progression, and make an actual functioning report system.",1695981369,1696012448,False,15,0,0.538473725318908691,0,True,False,False

It was fun, but ultimately got stale quickly. They also removed PC from crossplay because of too many hackers (I have never encountered a hacker while playing but okay) and have given no timeline for when it will be re-added. If you are thinking about buying this game to play with friends via crossplay, DONT, because you CANT.

One of the biggest issues with the game right now is matchmaking time. It doesn't always take forever to find a lobby (but it often does), but once you get into a lobby, you are going to be waiting there for quite some time. There is no way to select the character you want to queue as, so if someone joins a lobby and sees the character they want to play has already been selected, they leave. Repeat this 10+ times until someone actually decides to stay.

To make things even worse, it was recently revealed that new characters will cost $10 per character and there will be no bundle-type discount if you want to purchase both the new Victim and new Family member. Charging 25% of the game's overall price for ONE character is just ridiculous and honestly makes me wish I could refund the game entirely. But don't forget about the other major flaw in the game: people leaving lobbies because their character got picked. So this means in the new update, people who spent $10 on one character are going to continuously leave lobbies until they find one where the character is open. And I won't even blame them, if you spend $10 on a single character, you may as well actually get to play them.

The new family characters are cool which is pretty much redneck patrick bateman and a manson family girl. Could easily see them in a future movie.

Still a bit buggy and the time it takes to start a game once you have a full lobby is waaay too long but those are my only complaints.

Update: Banning PC players from crossplay due to a handful of cheaters is probably one of the most asinine things i've ever seen from a game dev. The game already has issues with extremely long wait times and with people refusing to play leatherface or any victim that isn't Leland or Connie.

Also, while the game is pretty much aesthetically perfect, the more you play it and become desensitized to the vibes and are confronted with the game mechanics, it begins to become very frustrating.

[list]
[*]The EXP, levelling and respec system is total garbage and needs a complete rework. (should've been a priority to overhaul).
[*]Perk balance is all over the place. 90% of perks are unusable. The game wants to create a meta.
[*]Grandpa cutscene. It destroys immersion & has a weird timeskip where you can shut off Leatherface's chainsaw. (Should've been hotfixed immediately. This was identified as an issue in beta.)
[*]EXP wasn't being saved if you left early as a dead victim. (got fixed on the first patch- cool.)
[*]The devs basically stopped communicating despite everyone for the most part acknowledging the grandpa cutscene is bad.
Leland, Connie & Sissy being too strong; Johnny is unplayable
[*]Taekwon Door stunlock
[*]Gas station ""secret exit""
[*]Disabling crossplay. I don't think this was a retrospective poor decision, but how is your anti-cheat getting bypassed so easily?
[*]Allowing lobbies to start one person short. This was a band-aid to a wider problem.
[*]Hitchhiker trap interaction (now fixed)
[*][url=https://www.reddit.com/r/TexasChainsawGame/comments/16us214/lmao_yeah_goodbye/]""DLC"" pricing[/url]. This is the final nail in the coffin for me and has began to turn my opinion that the devs are ""wilfully ignorant"" to ""maliciously ignorant"".
[/list]

I pre-ordered this game & bought the first execution pack. I regret it. Do not give them any more money until they fix these issues.
Grandpa cutscene should've been hotfixed immediately. EXP, respec & perk system hasn't even been acknowledged as an issue as far as I've seen (I have heard they've tried to justify it!), apart from Cook spamming locks (whom I don't even blame).",1695981306,1695981306,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

Poor programming with a clear lack of knowledge of the Unreal Engine. Egregious game breaking bugs and no server side security leading to rampant and effortless cheating. The solution according to the devs? Removing the cross-play feature and quarantine Steam players. Very unprofessional.

Game balance is also pretty bad, demonstrating a lack of understanding of basic gameplay mechanics. Rushable escapes in 1 minute and i-frames as soon a survivor initiates a crawl animation with no cooldown for using the same crawl gaps over and over. 

Patches go for a trial and error approach, without a clean vision of fundamental grasp on reality due to a lack of the devs playing their own game.

From someone who's worked in the industry, I can tell you that all in all this is an amateur job from both the game design and technical side.

Other more specific things worth pointing out:

- 3 minute lobbies, so you get to sit and wait for a duration that is sometimes longer then the match itself. If a single person doesn't ready up, you get forced to wait the full 3 minutes. Some people intentionally don't ready up just for fun, to be annoying. Badly designed lobby system in general, allowing players to respec and waste everyone's time.

- UE5 ragdoll physics assets not set properly so you'll see player corpses ""melt"" and get stretched out in unnatural ways.

- The game apparently initially shipped with the dev tools included allowing for hackers to create cheats with zero effort.

- As mentioned before, there is zero server side authentication for critical player actions such as breaking locks, etc. This means a cheater can do ANYTHING as long as EAC is bypassed. I have personally witnessed this happen multiple times.
Also, no server check on player movement speed.

- Collision bugs. Sometimes you will find yourself stuck in a wall unable to move at all.

To improve the game they would need to hire a new game designer who actually plays videogames and a specialist programmer with a 6 figure salary who has experience in Unreal Engine and can handle the security. Online games should have a guy like that as the bedrock of their infrastructure.

There's lots of playstyles to keep things engaging and fun but imo even just playing one playstyle is fun since there's elements to the game you can't control (like killer skill) which keep things fun, I still get jumpscared sometimes. 
However it is important to note that there are game breaking bugs that are still in the game, like glitching onto a ledge as both survivor and killer and being unable to move for the rest of the game, or when suddenly you can't go through any crawl spaces or wells. It still hasn't been fixed, and one of the more problematic bugs (Sissy having infinite poison on attacks) was only fixed a whole month after launch. 
At least the game-breaking bugs don't happen too often but it's quite frustrating when it does. PC is also locked out of crossplay right now because of cheaters but I'm not sure why so many people are mad about it since it really hasn't affected my gaming at all (maybe longer queue times??) but definitely be aware of that. 
In terms of game balance, imo I don't really see the game being too killer or survivor sided and the maps are generally balanced enough, more often than not a really well coordinated killer team will wipe survivors even if the survivors are 4 stacked, but if the killers aren't coordinated, then survivors will generally do better (if 4 stacked). There are some questionable map design choices like the free (although locked and pad-lockable) door out of Gas Station but maybe they will change that? Not sure. 
Overall I really like this game and it's giving me the fun I felt when I first got into DBD all those years ago! It may just be because of recency and how there's an asymm gap in my brain but I really like it and 60 hours in, I still see myself playing a lot.

It crashes for everyone not just me, because there's about a minute you can type in the chat with people before the game officially ends and it says ""You lost connection with the network."" It's happening to everyone.

The devs don't know how to remove hackers, so despite multiple updates all they did is end cross platform play instead of learning how to remove hackers from their game, despite making millions of dollars (LOL). Their updates usually include changing things no one cares about or asked for, and not focusing on fixing any of the legitimate issues with the game, which is probably why they've already lost 30%+ of their player base in a single month. Ouch. 

I get that this kind of game will never be perfectly balanced, but I'm pretty sure everyone I've seen agrees the balance is way, way off. To the point where if you're a new player, I'd suggest you disconnect if you see a pre-made team of max level 10's together. They'll end the match in 2 mins before you have a chance to even learn how to play, so there's no point. The game would actually be better and more balanced if there were no perks and no level system at all. Then everyone would be equal and you wouldn't have to worry about going against insanely overpowered 1 hit kill killers or Connies that escape in under 2 mins.

There are pre-made teams of level 10 victims that escape certain maps in under 2 minutes, which is insane when you factor in that they get at least a 10 - 20 second head start over killers that haven't even loaded into the game yet (There's tons of videos on youtube showing how to escape that fast). Even coordinated teams of people on Dead by Daylight attempting to set world records can't escape that fast. On farm I had someone jump out the front window and start kicking the generator off about 10 seconds after I loaded into the game as killer and I hadn't even been able to walk down the stairs yet, because of a pre-made coordinated team of all level 10 no-lifers that speedrun the game. Yes, they can literally escape that quickly. Funnily enough, those teams always insist on having a Connie on their team 100% of the time. Hmmm... wonder why... 

Those of you who play solo and don't play 12 hours a day with a pre-made team on discord might be raising an eyebrow at that story. That's because you probably have a life and just want to chill and play a bit and not don't get too sweaty about it, and as a solo you often pair up with average players that refuse to talk at all and then die within a minute or two because they don't really know how to play yet and then just D/C. Or they just play as Connie solo and escape in under 2 minutes silently and then D/C. Then it's up to you, solo, to go against a team of level 10 killers that probably are a pre-made team and all talking together on mic and camping the exits that they have memorized. Good luck. 

You of course don't see crazy speed runs if the victims are all level 0 or 1, because the game is sort of well balanced when the victims and killers are somewhere in the level 0 - 5 or 6 level range, but once they hit level 10 it gets laughable. If your teammates (whether you're killer or victim) are levels 0 - 5ish, and you're going against a team of all level 10's, it's usually best to just disconnect because having a max level team practically gives you super powers. Max level killers can kill you in about 2 seconds or instantly if they catch you. But max level victims can escape in 2 minutes or less, (they always pick Connie because she has an ability that just deletes locks instantly) and the devs ignore that and go ""well it's just a few teams that do that and they'll cry about it if we make the game harder for them, so... we'll just let it slide."" There are updates that could be done to balance these things more, but instead they do things like ""we moved the valve from here, to over here instead d00d."" The game will have less than 1000 players in a few months, then probably dwindle to about 400 - 500 within a year. Who knows if they'll ever bring cross platform play back, they don't even know how to remove hackers. Save your money.

Update: No one uses anything except valve exit on slaughterhouse. It is completely undefendable and unguardable as killer and even the most basic of players can just stab anyone in the back that tries to turn it off. 10 games in a row and no victim did anything except go for valve exit. The game is laughably unbalanced and crashes more with each update. Devs don't care and don't know how to balance the game.

The player base has taken a pretty sizeable hit because of this and it doesn't seem like they are any closer to reverting it. Even before this, the game was incredibly fun even if there were people cheating (not as often as you'd think). The developers have handled this extremely poorly and the game will sadly die a slow death because of it. 

Some of the balances changes they've made up to this point either aren't effective or just don't make sense. That pales in comparison to the travesty that is how they're handling the cheating problem. Basically, the game was golden until they started touching it.

I want to try and give this review pros and cons, to prevent it from seeming overly negative. The problem is, there is so much working against this game that it is hard to find things to praise when it is so painful to play.

My major thoughts are as follows: The dev team was not properly prepared or equipped for release, particularly a release that garnered as much attention as this one did. As a result, the sheer volume of players overwhelmed them on two fronts: bug fixes and server stability. The first 2.5-3 weeks of release were plagued with more bugs and server issues than I have ever witnessed in a modern game launch. Instead of bug fixes being fixed quickly, and balance breaking issues being addressed- the team was forced to devote the entirety of their time to resolving fundamental UI and server issues. 

These shortcomings have allowed game-breaking issues like Sissy's basic attack applying her AOE poison effect on every slash to remain in the game for OVER A MONTH. Unfortunately, there were numerous issues like this that have stayed in the game even to-date such as the Family's ability to body-block one of the exits due to collision and Hitchhiker's traps being able to be placed in front of ladder blind spots that are unavoidable for victims once they begin climbing.

The most recent patch was accompanied by the devs saying that patches will now become less frequent as they begin turning their attention to balancing issues, as well as making the patches LARGER. This, shocked me, as the current state of the game is not one that is stable enough for monthly patches with the sheer degree of hotfix-worthy issues. As it stands, I am not confident in the current dev team's vision of the games immediate future, nor their ability to consistently and reliably respond to issues raised by the community. While I have gotten great enjoyment out of the game, it is clear to me it will suffer a fate similar to its asym predecessors like VHS, Evil Dead, etc.

I would suggest buying the game on sale to play. And I would discourage anyone who does not have a friend group to queue with consistently to invest heavily into the game as is, where balance issues and bugs can really only be overcome through the use of coordination with people you know.",1695623010,1695623010,False,5,0,0.484233289957046509,0,True,False,False

When you hit ""Next Match"" it disbands your party by default. Pretty annoying when playing with friends. 

As for bugs, network connections issues causing disconnects. Sometimes you will just get stuck. Unsure how it happens but i've been stuck crouching in a bush without being able to do anything. Or you turn on the fuse box and your camera spins 360 before it gives you back control.

Cooks ability is very strong maxed out pretty much can spot you anywhere on the map and people will go for the upgrade that allows is perk to let the family see where there at as well, that's fine but, for him to spam the perk consistently non stop and the only way for you to not get caught is to walk at the slowest speed possible is completely abuse when the victims have to be able to run in most situations because at this point stealth is not even a real thing in this game really when people know the maps by heart and pretty much hiding in bushes for long period of time is pointless. Victims have to be constantly on the move and cooks spamming his perk just seems to much, the cool down needs to be way longer and it should not be allowed to spot some one more than once every 20-25 sec to at least give the victim a chance to not have his location pin pointed for every one to see at any giving time.

johnny is not the hardest person to get away from until you run out in open areas where theirs no gaps to go threw, his running speed is pretty fast, but as of right now people use an exploit that makes him faster by just spam hitting the air while running, it gives him more speed witch makes no sense an needs to be fixed so he can pretty much stay on you the hole time while hitting while your using your full speed as victim is pretty much pointless. If you are not going threw gaps  to escape him. and then also when it comes to his perk i don't think he should no exactly where your at when you are hiding in bushes he uses his perk to track foot prints but you cant see where the footprints lead when there in a bush it just goes from a trail of footprints to a scent trail in bushes witch makes no scene. if he was tracking the footprints, you cant see where the foot prints are in bushes so for it to just have a yellow trail that follows you is pretty op i think, i think if the prints lead to the bushes then it should just highlight the bush and that way they know went in that bush but don't know exactly where in the bush there at to at least give the victims a chance to sneak away or out play johnny.

Sissy probably the most broken of family members and her stupid poison, i think the devs made a bad decision on making character that can put poison on items an when you touch the item, it makes noise for the family members to see what you touched? what kind of bs is that, on top of that she has the ability to pretty much stun a player so badly with her normal hit that they cant even run away after they get hit twice by her, she should have zero stun with her normal hit and only if she blows her poison cloud at you, should be able to slow you down but the devs have said there looking into her stun so will see. 

and my main concern is that i feel like the killers just need longer cool downs with there ability's in general i mean its 3, killers an 4 victims  they already have better stam regen and very high advantage , the games stealth mechanic needs to be reworked because trying to play slow and steady will not work for lvl 50+ killiers that know the maps by heart and overall is not well balanced and the game was easy hackable day 1 one still seeing lots of cheaters in the game now. 
I really liked the game at the start, someone who plays victim more than family, i just noticed how much easy it is to play a family then victim and matches last no more than 2min average starts to just get annoying fast. 

i still will play the game when some new maps and characters come out and overall some balancing changes. but if your new coming into the game now i would try to find friends to play with because it will be the only way you will enjoy playing right now as a victim in my opinion. if your a DBD or FT13 player coming to this game well you all have your own opinions how you feel. i dont really recommend Texas chainsaw if you goin to play solo, more fun with friends, communication will help you win more games. or wait for a sale on the game if its under 30 bucks.",1694808134,1695430374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are okay, was hoping for a little more with kills, violence and gore, customization and horror vibe.

Level interaction is a little frustrating, lack of freedom, hiding spots and the small amount of things that Leatherface can actually destroy or victims can use. Hackers also plaque the PC version, uncertain of how this is being done, since Game Trainer is not allowed, but I have been teleported, instant killed, and if there is someone running something like Trainer the game will say excessive ping or network error and everyone gets kicked out. Can be quite annoying. 

This game definitely favors the killers especially on maps like the Family House. It also appears the developers are listening to the killers more often and nerfing the victims. An annoyance is this game would best be played with brightness turned down, and make it actually more playable for the victims so they can hide, but alas I see little way to police this. An aspect I enjoyed in Friday the 13th was the small possibility of actually killing Jason, in Texas Chainsaw nothing is at your disposal other than some bones and one ability a player has to stun. The bone is mostly worthless and will only toggle somewhat randomly when you are standing behind the killers back. In grapple mode you are basically dead if another family member attacks you. Things such as the wells seem out of place on maps, and it would be cool if there was more of a horror vibe and hiding was tweaked. It would be neat as well if VOIP only worked within the radius of family or victims and all players could hear and eliminate chat.

Having said that the developers have done a decent job of skills for the victims and family trying to make things equal. The game is quite fun and competitive, but a lot of this game is luck and you will end up dying in the first minute if you happen to cross Leatherface and get one-shotted. Or the victims will escape within two minutes due to the wrong killers being selected on some maps and getting lucking with certain item spawn points. In conclusion, a lot of tweaks could be made, but this would be very dependent on what side you like to play. The developers did a great job staying true to the original movie, character skills matching the movie, and making a game that is fun to keep going back to with a progression system that is solid. A high 8ish out of 10 for me, and with future updates this game could stay fresh and better polished.

I'm one of the unfortune ones that really liked hide & seek type of gameplay and tried to implement this type of gameplay style into DBD but DBD it's just NOT that type of game. Yes you can play sneaky, there are viable builds to do so but most of the time you will not be seen by the killer by doing so if you are successful and it will make the killer search for other survivors which then they may end up getting tunneled as a result which makes you lose the game altogether. That means if you never were hooked, you need to take one for the team and intentionally make the killer chase yourself so other team members who are in death hook can finish last gens and there goes you being sneaky. This doesn't mean DBD is bad, it's just doesn't present itself as such and that's okay. DBD has chase & run type of gameplay style.

Where as in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre it is the opposite. Hide & seek type of gameplay not only way more viable, is also rewarded and there are so many mechanics that compliment this type of gameplay style even more. You can also engage in chase & run type of gameplay style, it is there, totally viable too but it is different than DBD, so don't expect the same thing.

Cinematic looking is there, they nailed it. One time i just stood there hiding and watched my fellow survivor getting chased by leatherface in awe, as if i'm watching a scene from the film.

Thrill of hiding and thinking ""what if they saw me?"" part is so entertaining. Getting chased is adrenaline pumping.

There are by the way skill trees and ability loadouts for each character, for both killers and survivors. You can respec your skill tree anytime you want, without spending any in-game currency or whatever. You can build your character and if you don't like it, you can just change it anytime you want without any downside. Being able to freely respec your loadout and skill tree gives you opportunity to try any kind of build you want.

I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys hide & seek type of gameplay.


EDIT

After 100 hours of gameplay and 350+ matches and 3 updates in:

Yes i was right. Now that people learned to play killers efficiently, stealth become more important than ever for victims. You still gonna see people who are rushing and you will still most likely see them dead in the first minute of the match because of it. There are times you need to rush and there are times you need to do stealth. Patience wins in the end.

From now on all we need more QOL and balancing updates along with new content and we're golden. Extremely promising future is awaited for this game.",1692393179,1695335127,True,19,0,0.69998621940612793,0,True,False,False

Current list of issues this game has:

[b]Game is heavily victim-sided when the theme is horror and, as such, should be family-sided.[/b]

[b]Chain door-stunning[/b] — why is there even a door-stun mechanic is beyond me. It makes both sides look ridiculous. Currently, it's a no-risk strategy to door-stun as a victim, as even if you get caught in the stun, you have i-frames, making you invincible. Whereas if the family gets stunned - you guessed it - you're unable to attack.

[b]Grandpa cinematic[/b] — when grandpa wakes up, he forces a cinematic that screws with a lot of things. For example, Leatherface's chainsaw revs out of control if you're actively chasing someone. Please remove the darn cinematic and make it happen in the background.

[b]Lobby wait times[/b] — frequently waiting up to 5-7 minutes for a lobby to start. Thankfully, the game provides statistics for how much time you've spent playing in-game versus your actual Steam time. Guess the ratio of most players? Mine is 30 hours in-game time, yet I have 68 hours on the record. That means I've been busting my ass in lobbies for 38 hours - queue simulator.

[b]Car battery off[/b] — [strike]why do we have to turn on the car battery as family, especially when the team has a composition of family members who do not spawn near it? We don't have time to do the bloody thing, the victims are already out of the basement![/strike] Car battery is now on following their [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/1433140/announcements/detail/3681184905258084226?snr=2_9_100000_]12th September update[/url].

[b]Victims rushing and disregarding stealth completely[/b] — current meta is a very toxic rush one. In a single minute, they're already out of the basement, grab a fuse, open the fuse box, and in 2-3 minutes are already escaping. Worst of all, only counterplay to the fuse is to ""camp"" it, which is boring and not fun. Seriously? Valve escape has a counterplay; why doesn't the fuse box have one?

[b]Johnny is unfinished as a family killer[/b] — you have Cook who has padlocks. You have Sissy who can poison items. You have Leatherface who can break obstacles. And Johnny? He's got nothing.

[b]Sissy applies poison on hit[/b] — [strike]this is not intended, it's a bug, and family players are abusing it. There's a perk that basically slows down a victim by 20% when they are poisoned, and it seems that perk with the bugged poison can stack, effectively rendering a victim paralyzed.[/strike] This has been fixed following their [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1433140/view/6137899136658195351]19th September update[/url].

[b]Completely useless and missing unique perks[/b] — Leatherface has two useless unique perks that I can't fathom anyone ever using. Johnny has a single unique perk that is near F-tier but still usable. No other unique perks, though, unlike other family members who usually have three or four of them.

[b]Toxic player base[/b] — this is turning to become a DbD clown fiesta. Every time the victims escape, they wait intentionally near the exit until they get their satisfaction of seeing the family pay them attention. T-bag a little bit? Potentially. Stun you? Potentially, and then finally leave... just why?

[b]Gas Station bad map design[/b] — there are two exits near the generator—one requires the generator to be turned off + a lockpick, while the other just requires... a lockpick. Who thought of this crap?

[b]Cross-play ""temporarily"" removed[/b] — the idea behind this was to combat cheaters. How do you combat cheaters when you punish an entire community to fend for themselves against your own cheating problem? In my career playing this, I never encountered a single cheater, so I don't see how this helps ANYONE in that regard.

[b]Hitchhiker traps on ladders[/b] — there's a bug that if you get in a hitchhiker's trap near a ladder, you're unable to go through gaps, or interact with crawl spaces and wells. Developers confirmed that there may be other side-effects to this. This persists until the game ends.",1694157774,1695327003,False,321,27,0.793074727058410645,57,True,False,False

I remember falling in love with this game on the technical test and have been hyped ever since. Let's just say, it holds up to expectations (minus the few glitches and bugs that inevitably come with launch). The last time I've felt THIS tense playing a game like this was back when Friday The 13th was alive (which is ironic since this is the same company that also made that game). Nothing like jumping out of a window, collapsing, and then watching leatherface break into a sprint towards you.

I've been playing both sides and let me say, it's been wild to say the least. Some people may complain that this game is repetitive but I personally like the simplicity of sneaking around getting various items to escape (& trapping n killing as the family-- the kill scenes are brutally satisfying). The skill trees are unique and each victim/family member has their own set of strengths and weaknesses which is amazing as it doesn't just feel like you're playing a glorified skin. Not to mention, one of the useful things on here is that you can voicechat with others, which provides better communication as compared to other games (coughcough DBD). Speaking of DBD, this game isn't a DBD killer and never will be. I hope both games can continue to coexist and maintain a frequent playerbase because as of right now, I'm addicted. [spoiler]My only complaint thus far is my skill issue of never being able to escape the hitchhiker once he's on me, dude is speedy af >.>[/spoiler]

The saw is family. As Johnny says, TAKE IT!

In fact, just a few days ago I was considering writing a glowing review of this game. Unfortunately, I'm not able to recommend anyone purchase this game right now. The game came out a week ago and I have 73 hours at the time of review, so I've played it quite a bit. I've played both victim and family, and I will start by saying: I had SO much fun. 

Unfortunately, within a week of release, much of the fun has been optimized out of the game. The game tells victims to hide and play stealthily at the start of the match, but it turns out: that doesn't matter at all. In fact, the most optimal strategy has become victims making as much noise as possible at the start of a match, waking the grandpa up while the killers are still in a cutscene. Yes, the family members stay in a cutscene for somewhere between 10-20 seconds longer than the victims. Because of this headstart, experience victims are already unlocking a door to the basement before the Family has even had a chance to play the game. 

Unless you plan on playing this game with friends and sweating your balls off, giving comp comms, and still losing and getting less points than the few victims you manage to kill (if any), I don't recommend it. Playing Family solo is a difficult experience - console gamer mics aside (which are many and bad) -- without playing this CASUAL game like it's a competitive game, you probably will be losing way more than you'll win.

Victims ignore stealth in favor of trying to chainstun the Family (currently, there are situations where Leatherface can be permanently stunned in the basement until another family member comes to help. Other Family can be stunned this way too, but it's particularly egregious when the behemoth of a man Leatherface gets knocked down like a cardboard cutout for minutes at a time.) 

When people were playing stealthily and playing the game like it was Texas Chain Saw Massacre and they were being hunted and trying to escape a terrifying family of cannibals, it was some of the most fun I've ever had. Both as Victim and Family. My heart was pounding as I tried to escape and had terrifying encounters with the family. The more I play, the more my face is essentially :| while I run to the quickest exits on the map, knowing full well the Family can do nothing to stop me unless I personally make a mistake. (Especially since my favorite character, Ana, has the ability to almost completely nullify any damage dealt to her.)

To finish: There are still fun moments, but it's when playing with people who aren't trying to play it like a competitive tournament match. Hopefully, the devs will be able to nerf some of the 'comp strats' making the game unfun. I think tuning down Leatherface's chainsaw 2-shots, making certain key escapes more difficult, making the basement more difficult to escape and more dangerous for victims, tuning down Sissy's poison, and fixing the myriad of bugs present in the game would make this something I could recommend to other players. If I didn't already have the game, I probably wouldn't have fun if I started playing it now. Knowing how fun it can be when it is at its best keeps me coming back, but I can't in good faith recommend a new player start playing.

Last tidbit that is important to mention- this game is VERY computer intensive. I struggle, lag, and crash with a 3070, so keep that in mind if you have a less top-tier system. There are also MANY bugs - crashes, abilities not working correctly, getting stuck in objects/walls and being unable to move for the entire match, suddenly not being able to vault or jump down wells as Victim. It honestly feels like each day more and more bugs crop up, but I do trust the team is working on those. 

If some of these issues are addressed, I think the game could do really well and stand alone as its own thing in the asymm genre, and I'll absolutely change my review if I think it becomes worth it for new players to try.

Update 9/10: I definitely think they're working to make improvements and I'm feeling more positive about possible improvements. I'll wait to see how the upcoming patches go and will change to recommended if the technical issues become significantly less. Still quite a few too many bugs and crashes in my opinion to spend $40 on steam, but if you want to try it gamepass is a more affordable option.

Update 9/20: I really applaud the devs making strides on major technical issues the game has. While not all fixed yet, it's definitely getting to a better place. If the balance update coming out soon helps with chainstunning, I'll feel better about tentatively recommending it. I think it remains to be seen how they are planning to balance stealth, but they have communicated it is on their radar which is a HUGE step, and I am interested to see what they've come up with.

I think something that would help for new players would be a more robust tutorial as well as perhaps a soft mmr lock for low level players. I enjoy the wild west aspect of matchmaking but have had trouble getting friends into the game since they struggle to learn to play when facing level 60+ players. Some kind of ""beginner matchmaking"" could be super helpful for that.",1693037626,1695237111,False,306,17,0.80062413215637207,0,True,False,False

I'm going to give it a thumbs up because I didn't hate it. A bit unbalanced but I hope the devs weight it a bit better towards the escapees. Because there's so many killers its easy for them to get the win by camping key locations on a few maps.

I'd say if none of the killers were able to use crawlspaces and sliding areas the game would be a lot more fair, but might be just me.

Graphics are great, concept is solid, just a few map design issues and unbalance issues. Hopefully they'll be fixed with patches.

TLDR - Wait until they have anti-cheat in the game to purchase.

This game is great and I can't wait to see how they improve it.

There could definitely be some balance changes as some family feel underwhelming, while others are easy wins. Survivors perks don't work properly half the time, and their skills definitely need some fine-tuning. However, the way it is now is really not terrible and still fun to play with.

However, I believe some QoL changes should be a higher priority, most notably the report function. There's a lot of exploiting killers lately and the only way you can report someone is in the end-game menu. To make it worse, if an exploiter leaves immediately upon getting to the end-game screen, you can't even report them! If you want to stop exploiters, better take some screen recordings and hope you got enough evidence to email support with!

They disabled cross-play with PC to ""improve their anti-cheat system"" yet it seems they have no interest in stopping them, just minimizing their damage to PC players only.

i like this game
people who don't like it are most likely adverse to the level design but this as far as i know was because the designers wanted to make the basement more easy to escape from the family as victims. It's labyrinthine because the intent is not to loop. But for the family chasing them to get lost- as that was the biggest flaw in DBD's design
     you get out of basement, you go for 2 of the ""door"" objectives, one high profile and one low profile (generator and car battery respectively) and another ""item"" objective. Gas - low twords high profile, fuse high twords low profile  
     that's very interesting compounded with the family's short and long game proirities + incompetency rate. (patrolling objectives / commen routes and feeding grandpa). 

but when you don't know what you're up against because this requires patience to learn with muscle and mind memory  -> practice + videos the game gives you and the level design not being very clarifying 
that's why people don't like it

The game use to be cross-play but they're have been many hackers forcing developers to temporarily make the PC version separated from the console.

Pros: 
- Great friend experience, mid solo experience. Playing solo can be wildly fun, but that is if you have teammates that both communicate and work well together. If you have some bad teammates, it can be frustrating.
- Game has seen multiple updates since launch and the team behind the game are working hard to make the experience as fun and balanced as possible.
- Varying characters makes it fun to experiment. Not only are different builds possible, but each character has their own unique style of play with perks to help that style. Want to be tanky? It's possible. Want to be a stealth master? Possible. Game has a character for any playstyle.

Cons: 
- 3 maps can be kind of repetitive. I know that a new killer and map are in the works, but I do hope that we get new maps at a steady rate so that the game doesn't feel too repetitive.
- Set spawns for items/exits can be quite challenging for killers with a super try-hard survivor group. With the right perks and characters, a 4-stack of high level players who know the map layouts can leave the map in less than 3 minutes. Having random spawn locations for these items might help curve that possible speed escape.

 Well that's a complicated question. If you were to ask me which game was better at launch, I would say TCM 100%. However, since the games initial launch, DBD has 28 licensed characters from classic horror films including Texas Chainsaw. While you may be thinking, what does this have to do with the gameplay? People love to play as their favorite movie character and DBD provides many options for that to happen. Also, by having that many licensed characters, it allows for more unique gameplay whereas TCM the killers are limited to 5 which is still 2 more than dbds initial release. Although, they don't have as many killers, their powers and objectives are still unique. Having 3 killers in each game also allows friends to play killer together which is not an option in dbd. There are 4 different ways to loop/dodge killers in this game such as squeezing through a space, crawling under a space, vaulting over a space and running past a door and slamming it in the killers face. There are even characters that can fight back against the killer which is extremely satisfying to do. 

 Your main objective as survivor in the game is to pick locks so that you can escape but there are multiple ways to do so whereas in DBD you are forced to do gens and open the gate. In TCM, you can power a gate with a valve or fuse, lockpick your way out or even fight killers to cause a distraction for your fellow teammates. The maps also have interactive objectives which is quite refreshing. The game relies on strategy and teamwork to succeed whereas DBD you just do your objective while someone else is being chased. As killer, every person has a unique objective to accomplish in order to find and kill the survivors making the role feel vital for each person playing. Cosmetic wise, your powers and perks are linked to the character you leveled which I don't mind. So far the perks feel good and not too op or weak on both killer and survivor. There's also currently many cosmetic mods online for players to play as their favorite character, but I'm not sure for how long they'll be allowed.

 I currently enjoy this game more than DBD and the game also gives you ample opportunities to escape the killers grasp early game making it hard for killers to tunnel (one of DBD's biggest problems). The game does have some network issues when connecting to a lobby but that's to be expected on release day. (FIXED) The only issue is that the game runs out of players because that seems to be the cause of death for every asymmetrical horror game. However, seeing that this game has the backing of Friday 13th and DBD players, as well as it being on the game pass, I can see it lasting much longer than its predecessors. If players can keep this game alive, DBD will have some real competition and be forced to step up their game. 

Update: I'm having so much fun playing killer with friends that I have to take breaks so i don't get burnt out. Once you learn the maps and know how to play your role, the game becomes way more entertaining an competitive as well. I also notice the devs are quickly rolling out bug fixes and qol updates weekly which shows they're paying attention. Queue times are also quite fast even with crossplay disabled. I'm not really a fan of the leveling/sp system but that may just take some getting used to. Honestly my expectations have been exceeded and I'm very happy with the game.  :)",1692439283,1694986924,True,277,2,0.85939478874206543,23,True,False,False

However, I cannot recommend this game. As someone new trying to get into it a month after the game has released, this game *really* sucks to try to learn. For one, there is zero report system whatsoever in this game, so toxic and problem-causing players can just do what they want with zero punishment. I have played a couple of matches where victim teammates end up drawing the killers to the exit you're headed towards, intentionally, simply to BM them, which also inadvertently (or even worse, intentionally) causes the killers to close off and camp that exit, forcing you to have to completely reset your progress and find another one. I have been told to kill myself because of my voice. I have had at least one Family member who was very likely cheating, unable to be reported and thus able to continue doing so. It is very frustrating to deal with.

Secondly, the game is very unforgiving to newer players and there is, as it seems, zero weighted matchmaking beyond getting people into matches ASAP. My first game was a lobby full of max level characters, and a few games later I had a lobby with 6 other people that had never played the game before, with me being the most experienced one there with a whole 86 minutes of gameplay under my belt. A lot of players who regularly play the game are very devoted to the game, which makes learning either side obscenely difficult without watching tutorials on youtube or *requiring* you to pair up with friends in order to have any sort of cooperation, as few people use communication, and those that do are very often toxic in my experience.

I am sure this game was an absolute blast to play on release day, with all the players who didn't know what they were doing. Now, seemingly only a month later, it feels too late to even try. I want to like this game, but sadly right now it is very difficult to. If none of these things bother you, by all means give it a shot, it is a very faithful spin on the original films and is probably very fun to play with friends.

Hitbox:
- As a killer is very hard to hit survivors. The hitbox is a real mess. You click to hit and the animation go to the other way around but not into the survivor. Sometimes survivors are in front of me stuck in a trap and still can´t hit them cause the  animation goes all the other way. Besides that sometimes I´m hitting them but they don´t get hit/lose health. it´s so frustrating.

Beginning of the game:
- Makes zero sense survivors starting the game before killers. Plus most of the times they do all sort of noises to get even faster and start even faster. Sometimes I only have time to put  one trap and they are already upstairs. 

Stuns:
-  There is to much stun abuse in the game: Leland, doors, knifes, traps, etc. Or either you put a cool down on the knifes or something. The other day I was trying to close the water pump and I could´t cause in the middle of the animation I was being stabbed over and over cause he had a pile of knifes right next to the water pump. So every time I went in the water pump animation he grabbed a knife and stabbed me. And did that 5 times. It´s an abuse. 

Leatherface_
- In a game where we suppose to have fun I don´t know why put a insta death power with the chainsaw which is abused as hell. Try to make people have a fun long normal game instead of in the first 1 minute of the game someone was unlucky to be caught in the leatherface power and get insta death. It´s boring is not fun and doesn´t have a point.

- lots of cheaters
- pc players are treated like shit, cuz the crossplay is now turned off for them
- the most stupid game design decisions Ive seen in my life. You cant turn camera while lockpicking or searching for items, you cant do that when you are in fight animation. You are somehow locked in fight animations for whatever reason, so if another killer comes up to you, you are dead, which is really stupid because victim is always an initiator in fights, why cant he flee.
- bad interaction hitboxes, dumbass keybinds: 
1. sneak and default attacks are the same key but the action is determined by hitboxes, if you are not strictly facing killer's back and not standing close enough, you will make default close encounter which can lead to death if your strength parameter is not high enough. 
2. The door interactions are also fucked up. You will often run back from chase to basement and try to close the door in front of killer's face. Well, good luck perfectly timing it, because rushing it will make you close the door from the same side as killer. Why not just make another keybind? 
3.Also there is a slam door stun mechanic which you can do only while running. Now, how are you gonna wait out for the perfect moment and start running on the time? Sure, you can train it. But you dont have to, this is a flaw in game design, you should be able to stun in stationary position as well as while running. It's like if in order to drop a palette in dbd you had to sprint all the time. 
4. Why in order to sprint burst I need to spam space button? I should've had an option to just hold the button. Also, it's hard to keep your eyes on stamina bar and you can easily overcommit and accidentally use Choose Flight charge.

- Basement level design is too hard for survs to navigate. I think I'll never remember where basement exit is on every map. It's really annoying when you open the exit but it's located in another part of the map, so while you try to come down to one of the basement doors you will have already turned 360 20 times and completely forgotten where to go. And the moment you find the exit, it's closed.
- Lobbies. Why do I have to wait until the end of times for that one idiot to finally pick leatherface? They are connected when another two killers had already picked non leatherface characters, why can they choose other killers without swapping with their teammates? Why when I click to proceed to finding a new match as a victims after finishing last one I get a random chance to join in a lobby as a family member? Why cant I level up my skill tree while being ready in lobby? 
- Why cant I drop items I hold in my hands? Why when searching a toolbox without free item slots the item which was swapped with a screwdriver isn't left on top of the box or somewhere near it, so I can then return and grab it too? 
- Why hiding perks in skill trees? You want to stop me from unlocking the build I know and want? I will google which branches to unlock anyway, but couldnt you just show me what every perk does and where it is in the skill tree from the beginning?

And I will repeat it again, why the fuck do I, a regular player, need to suffer from not being able to crossplay, having to wait longer for lobby to be filled, playing with even more cheater because of these cheaters? Every player has an option in settings to turn off crossplay, thus console players could resolve cheating with an old simple solution, while devs are figuring out their shit. I paid full price for this game for you to restrain me from playing the bigger part of user base.

Perks are so op that if you are not max lvl you will straight up get rocked. if the survivors have a slight clue how this game works you will get ruined. Half of the killers are pure support killers, its not fun to play them, just anyone has to. and dont even think the maps are balanced. its just a random mess of ""lets give the survivors importality"". @Devs, when ur Maps have more slipthrew paths for survivors then actual gothrews then you should know you did something wrong. Note here that most of the killers cant get threw the slips in the walls and IF you got one of the 2 killers that are able, the survivors will do it faster then you so you dont even need to try to chase them because its not rare that if there is 1 slipthrew there are another 5 or holes in the wall to crouch threw which works the same way as slipthrews. When you play a character that cant even crouch threw them you have to find a path around them. but as I said, the Map is not designed to find the right path. you have to run half a marathon to even get there where the survivor was 10sec ago. Your only chance of winning is camping the hell out of the exits. Is it boring? yes it is. Can the Survivors just take a different Exit? yes they can but you will never find out. Some of the survivors are even so strong they should be a killer. That survivor im talking about can literally fight and knockout the killers, not just for a moment to escape but easy for above 10 sec marks and higher. Try to kill him, he has huge amount of hp, so much, that some killers dont even have enough stamina to make that much hits to kill him xD

Conclussion: If you dont have a spare 39 euros for the dumbster then dont buy it. maybe wait for a sale or smth but its by far not worth it. This Game will die the same as Friday the 13th and all other DbD clones.

""It's a party game"" okay, so then why do I have to grind 50 hours just to have a third character at level 10? That doesn't feel very party-friendly, in fact it feels incredibly competitive. You either dodge lobbies until you get your character, or you bite the bullet and play a level 0 character against a bunch of level 10s, it's absolutely insane. Not to mention those of us who like to play both sides. Good luck. You get one character on each side to level 10 and that's it. Even more dodging/playing level 0. To get a 3rd character to level 10 will literally take you about 30 hours of grinding.

The game is a ton of fun when it gets going, but the Devs have gone on record to say they really don't care about player feedback whatsoever which does not bode well for the games future. It reminds me a lot of when Brawl came out and Sakurai tried to eliminate the competitive aspect of Smash, which is something the majority of the player-base loved about it. 

If there are YouTube tutorials on how to grind EXP in your ""party game"" then you've done a really poor job. If you have to re-spec your characters every time you want to play the other team, that's bad game design. If you are making dev vlogs arguing with your players and telling them they're wrong and don't know what they want, you're a bad dev.

Train wreck of a game dev. When I play as a survivor. I want a fair game. I want to be rewarded for my skill. 

I want a good chase. But no, each family have a way to one shot you. Whether it being slow you down to a walking speed if they land one hit, or simply out run you mindlessly. The survivor can not make any mistake. And the best part? there are three family members who are more than happy to gang up on you to spam attack. There is no counter to this, you can door slam and 360 back stab all you want, a capable family team can easily punish you for playing aggressive. 

The only play style for survivors is to stealth and speed run. This is fine, I am also up for a good suspenseful hind and seek game. Still no! Now with the update, you are greeted by a family member 67% of the time when leaving basement since both would be camping the basement exit. Stealth play become highly situational. And given how easy it is to camp and petrol the objectives now, there is no time window for completing objectives if the family player know what they are doing. You are bound to be found. That why most of my team mate simply does nothing.  

Game is simply disgustingly family sided. You think this would create fun and suspense? There is no fun, no suspense when 3 goofy ass run you down with team com, abusing the slow down, stagger and damage on each character.

However, where DBD has this game beat will be in updates or other various characters. I'm just not sure how a game related to one specific horror movie will be able to add other characters or maps the same way DBD has been able to. otherwise the game is solid.

EDIT - After putting in an extra 20 hours, this game has become increasingly frustrating to play. SIssy is so over powered that the second you are attacked your game is over. Compared to going up against other members of the family, including Leatherface, you at least have a chance at escaping. Fix Sissy. The other thing i don't agree with is the most recent patch of excluding consoles from the game until cheating has been resolved. There should be an alternative method to this other than removing console players and leaving the remaining PC players to deal with the cheating.

Not to mention the lobby time is up to 4 minutes of wait time you you'll often be sat waiting for 1 player to ready up. Games can be less than 5 mins yet the wait time to get into a game can be 10+. NO new game should have such bad lobby times

My other major gripe with this game is the progression system. The skill tree system is awful and the xp gain is in an awful state and it doesn't feel good to grind this game. Rn i think its fine but long term idk how they plan to retain players with this system. 

The core gameplay is very fun and I enjoy the majority of my games but with the two big problems i have with the game i cant recommend spending £30 on a game that doesnt feel like it rewards you for playing or makes you sit in a lobby for 15 fucking minutes when the game just came out a week ago. I will continue to play this game a lot however

with more time this game gets worse and worse and worse and worse i quite honestly have never felt like i wasted money on one of these games before but this game is either very fun or so ungodly unfun and boring mixed with infuriating that the highs aren't high enough. DO better. It's not OP nor is it the best ability in the game connies is super OP but Lelands unavoidable stun is quite possibly the worst gameplay mechanic i have ever seen in an online multiplayer game. It is like if dbd had a perk that just let you slow the killer to a crawl with no counter, but what makes it worse is Leatherface is a required killer. Meaning if a bubba is using his chainsaw attack and stuns himself because he decides to do damage to another victim, leland is not only able to come in with another unavoidable stun but can also stun bubba with a KNIFE adding up to 3 different damn stuns. I dont care who you are but there is not a single game were getting stunned is fun. Game is riddled with bad decisions and has fundamental flaws that desperately need changed or the new game goggles are going to come off.

DONT BUY! This game is the worst killer sided mess of all times and will be dead in approx. two to four weeks. If you are a victim main, dont buy because GUN currently only listens to cryhard killers who want victims to be nerfed into the ground. In a few weeks nobody will be playing victims anymore. It is unbelievable how GUN manages to destroy their game in such a short amount of time. 

This is the most unfun and unbalanced piece of **** game you will have ever played if you are a victim main. Now killers can rush the basement, since there is no MMR your Newbie teammates dont know what to do and dont open up exits although you are looping killers for 5 minutes. After you ran out of stamina and tried to take a different path in the basement to finally get away or you got flanked by another killer and die you see that you didnt even got points for running the killers. This is so frustrating. 

How in the world could a game be destroyed that fast by its own company? Who ever is responsible for this should be fired and sued for the financial damage this person is actually doing to the company because of all the refunds that will come in. I cant believe this game went downhill that fast. 

I have over 130 in it. But currently after the patch this game is absolutely unfun. When in a few weeks noboby is playing victim even more family main players will also leave this game and simply return to dbd so that they can continue crying in dbd for survivor nerfs.

DEAD GAME SOON, BEWARE!

Shame on you, GUN Media, for destroying your great game!

After F 13 the second game you guys messed up.

It is unbelievable. 

Really.

I dont know if this game can be saved. Maybe GUN should sell the game to another company. Maybe then it could be saved. But a lot of work needed to be done and a lot of so called balancing which were simply killer sided changes needed to be undone.

And to every killer crying about getting door slammed or chain stunned: Just stand with bubba with your back to a wall at the beginning of the match before starting the chainsaw and you are goód. Even if Leland slams you. Immediately go to a wall. And if you get door slammed just call your mates for help. Survs will go down immediately. Never had problems as family members. But you are the ones destroying the game. 

AND GUN EVEN LISTENS TO YOU.

Shame.

***************************************************************************************************
UPDATED REVIEW: So Gun actually patched the progression bug, which was really annoying. Also Gun currently is looking into balancing patches. I can not tell if they will be good or bad because the patches will come out in the future. The game is quite fun but if you think about buying this game right now you should know that it is extremely hard. Dont expect to have easy wins or fast success. Currently PC is being removed from crossplay due to blatant cheating on pc. Gun stated that they will bring PC back to crossplay once they actually have managed to solve the problem (which will be hard). If you plan to buy on pc and then play together with your friends which are on console you should know that currently this is not possible. Sissy is currently bugged and with her perk rubber legs she cant kill you within seconds because of a bug. Devs said that they will patch this. They did a pretty good job so far with the first patch. Hopefully they will be doing a pretty good job so far in the future. Now I can recommend this game.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************ORIGINAL REVIEW:  This review is pretty tough because I really like the concept of the game as well as the ambience and the sound design.

But I really dont know what in the world GUN Media was thinking when they were releasing this buginfested piece of crap.

This game COULD be a masterpiece - only if it would be ready to play but it clearly isnt. I have been patiently waiting for over two weeks now since release for a bugfix patch but there is no patch in sight.

I just played the game or lets call it this tech concept of what could be possible one day when the devs did finally their job and finished this concept art and then in the middle of the match I was experiencing this bug which doesnt let you go through cracks in the wall anymore. Because of this bug I was unable to get rid of Leatherface and died. I experienced this bug also yesterday.

Then there is the progression bug, which forces you to stay in a match until the very end and spectate even those level 10 players which go into a match with a double zero character and just have picked up the game. You can now enjoy watching them becoming one with a bush. If you decide to not waste your time and leave then you wont get your xp. If you would have leveled up though the game shows you that your level would have increased and that you would have been rewarded with 7 skilltree points but then in the next window your rank resets completely to the last rank, you are losing all of your xp and your skill tree points. WOW. This is the most sadistic game breaking bug of all times. 

But that is not the only bug in this broken piece of a mess. Often you get a bug which destroys the communication between your party members, when you leave a match your party gets disbanded, crossplay is not working so you have to disable and reenable crossplay again so that console players con join your lobby with the code, sissy is overpowered because of a bug that poisons you after each hit again and slows you down. Then there is the invalid credentials given bug which GUN Media has claimed to have fixed but still this bug appears from time to time. Then your game sometimes simply crashes.

Oh, and the latest bug: This game sometimes decides to shut your pc down by giving you a bluescreen. 

Lets be serious: This tech demo that could be a great game someday has a lot of potential. But in its current state IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED!!!!!!

Give this one a HARD PASS if you are on pc until GUN Media managed to finally deliver a solid product which is ready to be played. There has not been one patch, yet. 

I dont know when this concept art will be ready to be played. I also dont know why this concept art isnt flagged as early access because it is. To be honest it should be flagged as ""Way too early access"". 

I was really looking forward to this game for months. I dont know what happened between the playtest and the release. And I also dont know which designer came up with the idea of this overpowered sissy. But whoever messed up should be sued for the financial damage he has done to the game. Many players are already leaving this game for good, steamdb.info proves this. 

GUN is not taking actions and only responds to players stating that they should submit a ticket. I a ticket is being submitted then GUN responds in rare cases with sentences like ""We´ll make sure it is shared with the right folks!""

WOW.

Sounds so responsible.

Unfortunately in its current state I cant recommend this game. At least not on pc. Stay away from it.

You can pack it on your wishlist and if GUN ever patches it maybe this could be an option. But if the game is then still alive... who knows. Just look what happened to F 13. You could think GUN Media learned a lesson. They clearly didnt. 
TCM is in an even worse state.

To my personal dislikes: Janky movement, but that might be intended. If this game is supposed to be symmetrical, it is not. Any decent Family team with mics will coordinate and slaughter you. Some characters need reworks or buffs, balancing is off.

POSITIVES
1) Despite all thats been said below, I do enjoy the game. Its fun and exciting to play with friends and it gets me on the edge of my seat pretty consistently. It creates a great atmosphere of horror and I love that. I think there's definitely room for some balancing and tweaks to make the matches a bit more even but in general I think the games worth getting. More so if you have like minded friends who will also enjoy the genre.

FEEDBACK 
1) Mechanics feel geared towards the family at this point. Double locks, traps, insta kill hits, sounds coming from hiding places making them essentially worthless, and a recent patch gave the killers an even bigger head start. 

2) A maxed level Grandpa should do 3 yells in a row that auto-reveal you, and then be dropped back down a few levels. A maxed out Grandpa is essentially a game over. 

3) Feels like theirs cheating or exploits occasionally. I'll be hiding in a dark corner and a leather face will charge straight to my position without hesitation like he knows I'm already there. I've spent entire games just roaming from hiding spot to hiding spot with a leather face constantly charging my exact position. 

4) When you run through a door, you should never have to turn around to make it close without putting you on the wrong side of the door. You can do this with wooden doors but not others and that just feels weird. 

5) This game, from a survivors perspective, is all about staying together. Thats one of the only ways to win. Communicate, work together and win. The issue is, the second someone is caught, everyone near them has to book it or hide wherever possible since you all can't move down similar paths without someone dying guarenteed. This isn't an issue if you can allow people to ping each other or communicate somehow. Maybe do a trail of personal items that helps people follow or get back to their friends.

Current list of issues this game has:

Game is heavily victim-sided when the theme is horror and, as such, should be family-sided.

Chain door-stunning — why is there even a door-stun mechanic is beyond me. It makes both sides look ridiculous. Currently, it's a no-risk strategy to door-stun as a victim, as even if you get caught in the stun, you have i-frames, making you invincible. Whereas if the family gets stunned - you guessed it - you're unable to attack.

Grandpa cinematic — when grandpa wakes up, he forces a cinematic that screws with a lot of things. For example, Leatherface's chainsaw revs out of control if you're actively chasing someone. Please remove the darn cinematic and make it happen in the background.

Lobby wait times — frequently waiting up to 5-7 minutes for a lobby to start. Thankfully, the game provides statistics for how much time you've spent playing in-game versus your actual Steam time. Guess the ratio of most players? Mine is 30 hours in-game time, yet I have 68 hours on the record. That means I've been busting my ass in lobbies for 38 hours - queue simulator.

Car battery off — why do we have to turn on the car battery as family, especially when the team has a composition of family members who do not spawn near it? We don't have time to do the bloody thing, the victims are already out of the basement! Car battery is now on following their 12th September update.

Victims rushing and disregarding stealth completely — current meta is a very toxic rush one. In a single minute, they're already out of the basement, grab a fuse, open the fuse box, and in 2-3 minutes are already escaping. Worst of all, only counterplay to the fuse is to ""camp"" it, which is boring and not fun. Seriously? Valve escape has a counterplay; why doesn't the fuse box have one?

Johnny is unfinished as a family killer — you have Cook who has padlocks. You have Sissy who can poison items. You have Leatherface who can break obstacles. And Johnny? He's got nothing.

Sissy applies poison on hit — this is not intended, it's a bug, and family players are abusing it. There's a perk that basically slows down a victim by 20% when they are poisoned, and it seems that perk with the bugged poison can stack, effectively rendering a victim paralyzed.

Completely useless and missing unique perks — Leatherface has two useless unique perks that I can't fathom anyone ever using. Johnny has a single unique perk that is near F-tier but still usable. No other unique perks, though, unlike other family members who usually have three or four of them.

Toxic player base — this is turning to become a DBD clown fiesta. Every time the victims escape, they wait intentionally near the exit until they get their satisfaction of seeing the family pay them attention. T-bag a little bit? Potentially. Stun you? Potentially, and then finally leave... just why?

Gas Station bad map design — there are two exits near the generator—one requires the generator to be turned off + a lock-pick, while the other just requires... a lock-pick. Who thought of this crap?

Cross-play ""temporarily"" removed — the idea behind this was to combat cheaters. How do you combat cheaters when you punish an entire community to fend for themselves against your own cheating problem? 

Hitchhiker traps on ladders — there's a bug that if you get in a hitchhiker's trap near a ladder, you're unable to go through gaps, or interact with crawl spaces and wells. Developers confirmed that there may be other side-effects to this. This persists until the game ends.",1694660307,1694660307,False,6,0,0.573192238807678223,0,True,False,False

Hitchhiker related bugs still exist.
Traps ontop of ladders still glitch you, not letting you use crawlspaces etc.
Then there was this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaD2X0FCkS4
The main cheats still seem to work. People i know who play with last weeks Cheattable for CE can go as hard as they want (apart from cord warps)

Update 1st Patch:
So they removed crossplay, claiming to have improved anti cheat when my literal first game was this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-YnSXDSRqY
Infinite sissy poison hit, infinite stamina, infinite steering, itemswap glitch, ladderwarp glitch still work, nothing fixed. fusebox can still be repaired without fuse, item not being consumed still works. you can still make yourself host so every single value in the match can be adjusted. People found out how to remove progress on your account as well. 
Avoid this game !


Update 2+ weeks after release:
radiosilence from the devs, game seems abandoned already (same as F13)
the game is full of gamebreaking bugs and broken mechanics
no update or patch since release
by now every twitchwatching monkey knows how to dupe items, infiniteglitch stamina and bone shards
no functional anticheat (crossplay) so cord-teleport, console unlocking locks/itemswaps etc are a common thing
you can still declare yourself ""host"" and max all your stats, kick people from the game etc.
if you think this will fix your thrive for a dbd like game that isnt as inbred as dbd - dont do it. this game got pos review bombed on launch but the people doing that are long gone.
avoid !

65 hour update:
This game is an absolute mess. its so buggy and broken it is ridiculous.
i dont even know where to start.
there are at least 20 game breaking bugs, you can have infinite stamina, infinite items, you can swap items int different items, you can infinite stun killers, you can glitch people and yourself into terrain, you can forever-stun killers, you can legit, start the game, itemswap to a fuse, walk to the fuse, exit through basement before hitchhiker even put his traps or cook put his locks. even if the game wasnt overrun by cheaters and basic cheatengine user cause EAC doesnt do anything the gamebreaking bugs combined with this ridiculous meta make the game unplayable at rank 50+. you can legit declare youself host of the game, kick people, set their xp to zero and everything you can imagine by editing the gamefiles. i think i cannot remember when the last time was where i came across such a broken and malfunctional product. ontop of that you have mentally deranged dbd players protest positive-reviewing this game. wild


Updated TLDR after 40ish hours:
It took 5 days for the game to be unplayable in high levels:
Survivor meta: Spam doors for infinite stun
Killer meta: Make the game unwinable
-the game has a lot of gamebreaking bugs, (crashes related to specific graphic settings, soundcues not working properly etc)
-the game has a lot of broken mechanics (infinite stunchains, infinite lockpicks, infinite stamina, infinite chainsaw steer - open doors while steering as LF)
-the game is overrun by cheaters (level 99 accounts to call the obvious ones, warping behind exit gates 1 sec after spawn etc) due to lack of proper anti cheat 
-in order to be not at a disadvantage you have to (same as dbd) run with min graphics cause otherwise you will be detected in hiding spots which you considered save
-there is a bug that forces you to restart the game otherwise you cannot join lobbies. this bug occurs every aprox 2 hours
-the devs did a stress test beta months and weeks ago - nothing improved or changed
-devs have not given statement regarding the poor state of the game
-the progression system combined with how matchmaking works is ridiculous. again i cannot imagine someone signed this off and thought its nice. In order to build a character you have to (in order to get proper perk sets) reroll the skill tree-  which is designed for gamepads and maneuvering it is a pleasure i dont wish upon my enemies.
-----------------------------
Minor annoyances:
-the amount of time you have to spend grabbing lockpicks is ridiculous
-collision detection is maximum flawed and results in absolute ridiculous bugs (getting stuck in enemy models, getting stuck in terrain, getting stuck in doors etc)
-steam achivements percentages and global stats dont work properly (there are achievements with little to medium difficulty which apparently have 100% completion rate)
-sissys poison mechanics causes fps drops and the mechanic itself is trash
-cooks ability not having a proper announcement is crappy and feels bad to lose to
-johnny is borderline broken what did you think when you adjusted that cooldown ?
-being real here - 1 survivor ability is crazy good (leland stun, or the batista spear how i call it) everything else is super situational maybe niche decent to absolute trash worthless. 
-grandpa level 5 is unbeatable as a victim and with the proper build its very easy to achieve as family(killers)
If your lose 1 teammate at the basement the game is almost impossible to win (1 killer for each victim)
-the graphic filters whenever a killer is near are absolutely disgusting and whoever signed this off should be ashamed. 
-controls dont feel responsive at times

If the stuff stated above doesnt concern you:
you can as a killerteam complete lock down the game cause you can ""guard"" 3 spots of interest that are necessary for escaping for every route (steamthingy/battery/generator) - no counterplay. tested with friends - works every time.

good game, has potential. lots of fun if it works and enjoyable; IF it works. has a LOT of bugs and random crashes. Matchmaking is quite silly cause leatherface is required yet people can just ""dont play it"" and let the lobby timeout. you spend a lot of time in the lobby. game seems to be in a beta state yet its sold as a finished product hence the thumbs down. Dbd ""community"" recommending the game cause ""its not dbd"" is pretty much what has to be expected of that rabble.

Update: Was able to fix the crashes by turning down graphics (on a pc that can play other properly made games with max settings on 144fp) but i still have to restart the game in order to get a frequent returning bug.

Also very proud to say that just 3 days after release the game has achieved 9k cheattable downloads (Source: CE toplist)

After another good amount of hours - the matchmaking is broken for multiple reasons:
lobbys where noone wants to play leatherface end with sending you back to the title screen
lobbys where anyone wants to play a character that someone else plays send you back to the lobby cause people leave over it and the lobbys dont get filled up properly.",1692470009,1694615227,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Incredibly fun game held back by some odd design choices and CONTINUOUS issues.

Victim & Family Pros - Cons
+- 3 family v 4 victim or 3 family v 3 victim. The former sucks, latter is fun.
+ The family members are all fun and inventive to play as, each with their own style in every meaning of the word.
- Family members have some insane variance in how useful their skills are. Cook is ridiculously good, but is useless as a solo, while Johnny feels aimless and Sissy - Hitchhiker being better than everyone most times.
- Teamwork for family is a must, but no option for communicating easily without mics.
- Some family builds are ridiculously OP and / or bugged ala Sissy and Rubber Hoses which can make it impossible to move as victim, and slows you, and gives her wallhacks on you on top of very strong endurance game. You just lose if this build is in play. It's odd that it's still in honestly.

+ Victims have a ton of character and while each one is a lot more interchangeable than the killers, they have ONE unique ability each which can massively shake up the game.
- Some of these abilities are just bad. RIP Sonny.
- NO in game tutorial, instead a bunch of mini tutorial videos which are terrible. I'd much rather have a text option personally as that's how I learn better, but these long videos where it shows you a lot of basic stuff followed by the one piece of nugget you want is just not how you do tutorials in '23. This is such a disservice to new players who don't just live the game via osmosis.
----- There's one victim whose ability breaks the game so hard that the setup period of the game simply can't take place, that being Connie. If your Leatherface doesn't find and immediately kill her as soon as she spawns she can bypass the first mandatory locked door near instantly and set off Grandpa at level 0 which is where he does effectively nothing at all. While she's not the strongest in any given stat, the fact that she can straight bypass entire safety nets is a MASSIVE issue as it's totally possible on most maps to burn your ability to get a lockpick near instantly, then walk 5 feet and instantly open a door. With set maps and a team of people you can legitimately exit a match in under 3 minutes for barely any XP and the family gets none. Maps where Connie is OP is Gas Station, Family House, and Slaughterhouse... Yes that's all 3, but it goes in that order as Gas Station has a minimum of 2 doors to burn through to instantly leave the map which means you can escape the map PRIOR the Family's mandatory cutscenes ending, then Family House because you can burn through a toolbox, a locked door, and then the front door if your RNG is good enough, followed by Slaughter where the easiest exit requires you to go through another slide door which is... Challenging at least.
- You wait longer for matches then playing one thanks to balance issues.
- Leland's ability to stun killers is appreciated given how little defense victims have, but it never feels like it does much until he's grinded. Also why lock lots of the defense behind the random perk mechanic?
- Family members that aren't Bubba can be stunned via a grapple mechanic, however if you grapple a family member and then another family member runs in they can instantly kill you. Mind you the risk - reward here is so incredibly lopsided as there is only risk and the reward is an INCREDIBLY minor stun against A family member, of which there are 3. This mechanic is also just not explained well at all, with the community seemingly not knowing how EXACTLY it works. Macro abuse is rampant here.
- You can trap lights which feels like a punishment to console players only. It also just feels pointless which is confusing as it only stuns them WHEN THEY TURN IT ON vs when they walk past.
+ There's a Backstab you can do while holding the shank which always feels good
 - BUT because of how family members move you can stab THROUGH their front side on their end which is silly.
- Similarly the door slam perk can be used infinitely against family members until a different family member intervenes. Just because you didn't walk the exact right way to a wall.
- Hitchhiker and Sissy are so incredibly hard to shake off that they feel terrible to verse, especially as they regain stamina while doing crawling actions through holes and thin cracks which means they will be at a FULL bar of stamina the entire time they follow you, combine this with both having incredibly potent area denials it gets frustrating quick. Both can't trap a lot of things, but it's still frustrating.
-The cutscenes at the beginning + for grandpa should be shortened as they can legit fry Bubba and make him useless as soon as they trigger.

Maps:
+ Maps are incredibly pretty
+ Key items in a map typically make noises to tell the family and victims that they are working, key examples being the moans of Grandpa, the hum of generators, etc.
- Waste perk slots to find where things like Valve go as victim or use those to actually survive.
- Slaughterhouse is just a tad bit too crowded with breakables for Bubba
+ The Night / Day variants thing is so so so so cool I love it.
- Maps vary incredibly wildly in balance. This is fine with some variety, but for the most part maps are stagnant and therefore the worst parts of them are as well. Slaughterhouse is terrible for anyone but Sissy and Hiker, while Gas Station has a door you can leave out of in under a minute.

Gameplay:
+++ VERY tense as a noob.
- The grind + perks feel incredibly artificial and either pointless or game changing, with the grind making any perk gain feel terrible.
--- Random perk parts of trees feel beyond awful.
* There is recolors for every victim and different outfits for Bubba, but currently he's the only killer with cosmetics which is a massive shame.
+ You can near totally disable voice chat which is a massive god send.
+ Sound auras hit at JUST the right time for you to react to them most times, and other times they do very little, but they are good enough as is.
+ You can customize each characters stats and even select different kill moves which is nice for variety.
- However this means every character will, at max level, play the exact same in base stats.
- Mics or wastes of perk slots to coordinate with your team, which wastes use of perks like doing 20% bonus free damage on any character. Pick your poison truly.
--- Feeding Grandpa feels really bad in terms of effect unless the game has no Connie, which it will have a Connie, so bad. The waiting, the long animations, etc.
- There's really no chance for the final victim to make it out unless the Family is completely uncoordinated and / or blind. Gallows for Bubba is also pointless.
--- You can lockpick electrified gates for some reason. Yes it's busted strong.
- You can infinite stun killers via bad map / game design
- Family can't do anything against fuse box which feels just straight up weird.

- There's already a toxic community, as per the usual with multiplayer game, so disable every form of interaction with it if you value your sanity.

+ Despite worries, the devs are actually getting problems fixed in the game at a relatively fast pace, however who knows when / if that ends. In the meantime, buy for the product the game is, not what it COULD THEORETICALLY be. At least until we get a roadmap or something like it.
* Key example: Infinite bonepile stun on Bubba is now only a 3 bone pile stun on Bubba which is SIGNIFICANTLY less time.

*** THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA, BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE MOVIE CONTENT YOU CAN UNLOCK WHICH IS VERY, VERY, VERY COOL.

there is very little for survivors to do, and once they do they can easily escape. usually if there are 2 survivors together, good luck getting either of them unless your one shot leatherface but even that thnx to hit-boxes can miss. Now i mainly play family since leveling up when you hit double digits is really hard. next just outright impossible. so i can only speak on that behalf but IF 10% of DBD players come to this game, the game will be broken for both sides. mostly survivros though cause the only way right now i'm actually getting any kills is cause the survivors refuse to communicate. if they actually worked together. there is literally nothing i or heck with some builds, all 3 family members can do and almost always 3 survivors will go by.

I've gotten more disconnected matches than actual matches. the bugs for the online section and loading screen are TOO many and too game breaking. But in all honesty. I like the game alot. the fact that it Doesn't have to be a rushed game like DBD. that its a matter of actually finding survivors and chasing them is fun but there is so little for survivors to do in order to escape that if you fail once you've probably let 2 people just leave.

There are still many bugs that will either disconnect you from your game or will ruin the match for you. While this game CAN be fun at times, you'll mostly end up trying to grind for levels and skills that can be outmatched by groups of survivors/killers. What will mostly happen if you do play is that for survivor, at least one of your teammates will die early, leaving you with a 3v3 match that leaves survivors at a huge disadvantage in the early game. For killers, you'll mostly be fighting against survivors that are rushing you, waking up grandpa, and wondering what your other teammates are doing while your fighting against multiple survivors. Overall, needs to be balanced better, bugs and glitches still need to be worked on, and needs to have an identity in its gameplay of whether it wants to be fast-paced or more slow-paced gameplay.

The door close mechanic is straight up broken, anytime you try to slam a door or close a metal one, the killers just glitch right through. Once you're alone as victim it is impossible to do anything, the game actually punishes you by having grandpa at max level where no matter what you cannot run or do any objectives, like ten seconds after everyone dies. There are multiple exits but the only viable ones include kicking a generator and then running out of a gate, which of course the killers all just camp every game. I've seen people complain it is too easy for victims to win, but it's only easy for hardcore victims who learn the best path to take every time. If there is only one viable escape in the game, what's even the point of having more? Anytime I have ever even seen someone escape or myself escape, it is always through the same escape every single time, assuming the killers aren't camping it. If there is three killers, why not put like 5-6 victims in one match to balance it out? 3v4 doesn't seem very fair as the killer can just all focus on one or two people at a time, screwing them over. The killers have plenty of advantages, Grandpa will see you even if you start an animation before he is active, still seen. Killers just have to camp objectives and they will win, or at least get 3/4 of them consistently. Family mains will always complain, but then get surprised when everyone rushes the one viable route in the entire game.

[list]
[*]There are definitely issues. Mostly technical things. These didn't happen too much in game, after a few games in a group, I would get an error saying ""Invalid Credentials."" This was fixed by restarting the game. There are very few games that don't have tech issues on the first day so this is completely normal and in all honesty, launched in a better state than a lot of games technically.
[*]The game is ever so slightly family sided. Not nearly as much as people are making it out to be, but very slightly. Playing as many games as the family as I have, it's been a mixed bag on if we win or lose. Very rarely when solo queuing did we steamroll or get steamrolled. Usually at least one person escaped with a few times no one escaping.
[*]On the victim side, it definitely is much harder. some balancing changes I recommend is increase the distance between where the victim rooms are from Leatherface at the beginning of the match. The time to turn off the battery and generator is a bit too long.
[*]The game is needlessly confusing in my opinion. Tunnels are way too big and have too many dead ends. I understand this is to balance out that everyone starts there and so leatherface can't steamroll, but it can get brutal. I also do not think that the location of the fuse box should be randomized. Randomize where the fuses are and make box itself static. Listening as killer can help, but it's very rough to decypher what the outlines are when they're far away. I'd kind of suggest a color legend of some sort. Green for your character's consumables (Sissy's poison bowls, Bone piles for Hitchhiker, etc), something like blue for car battery and gate, white for doors, etc. Maybe even custom colors so people don't have to worry about colorblindness and simplify (Different shades of the same color for more advanced players, etc)
[*]The game is only as fun as you make it. Playing as killer can either feel the same or different depending on how YOU play. If you use your abilities and actually play how the killers are meant to (Hitchiker and Sissy trap, Johnny and Cook track, Leatherface chases and patrols) then it can feel different going from Trapping to Tracking, to Chasing.
[*]There is one thing that is OP in the game. Ready for it? Communication. The difference between winning and losing is all based on communication. Solo queuing as killer was a mixed bag because the other people didn't communicate. There were definitely times it was skill based (Killers didn't know what they were doing, where they were going, forgetting to turn on the battery, etc) but none of them communicated which made knowing where anywhere was, what was checked, etc impossible. Purely was down to skill at that point and sometimes we won, sometimes we lost. Sometimes it was a blowout on either side, sometimes only one person escaped. When I started queuing up with friends and communicating on discord, the game completely changed. We started annihilating every game because of the communication. The times we lost, it was because our LF didn't communicate because sometimes she does that. The funny part is you can tell when people are communicating, it was very clear. When they actually communicated, we got one or two kills. Most games were 3-4 kills because communication is so lacking in game.

I would still recommend buying since you'll be able to play with your friends soon anyway. Still a good game. Plus, all the updates have happened pretty recently and released recently showing the developers dedication to this game.

TL;DR:
First off, fuck you for not reading the entire thing. Read it please, it's great. Anyway, great game. 3v4 asymm horror and compared to the most well-known asymm horror game (dbd) then it is a fucking breath of fresh air and wayyyyy better. Buy it no matter what, 10/10.

When I first brought this game, I was a little bit happy but also concerned as it could follow the route of MANY other asymmetrical horror games that came before it (F13, VHS, Evil Dead). Needless to say, I no longer think that it will go down those same routes that made all the other asymm games fade into obscurity, it might even go above dbd. I'll get onto the proper review now. And yes, I may have accidentally made it an essay... sorry....

Introduction:
Let me start by saying that TCM is not your average asymm horror game. It is a 3v4 instead of a 1 v whatever the fuck the developers chose. This means you can kill with friends and survive with friends. It also feels very balanced imo, no side is stronger that the other with Connie having a great ability and Sissy just being the most annoying family to verse. It's launch was.... sort of rocky? There was a lot of hype and the developers knew this and the servers coped but bugs were soon discovered. They have released a patch but mainly for the prominent issue of 'Credentials not supplied' or whatever the thing was. The game was also found to crash a lot for some people. I've only sunk 19 hours and I think I had 1 actual crash and the rest just happened as I closed the game. This game is also better than dbd in my opinion. Hell, we can't even compare most of it to dbd but since dbd has been the #1 ruler of asymm horror games for a while I shall try my hardest.

Victim/Survivor Role:
Victim has been a fun time for me. Voice chat is very helpful but there IS TEXT CHAT FOR YOUR TEAM TOO, so don't be scared if you can't afford, don't want to use or just don't have a mic, you can help your team as best as you can. Or just trash talk them, either way it's good. Victim's entire thing is to escape. Sure, you could say that's similar to dbd but there are multiple exits and not just gate or hatch. Plus, you don't have to do 5 gens anymore, just sneak around and lockpick to generator or car battery. Fix the fuse or open pressure gate. It's also a really intense yet fun role. Sure, I will actively cuss out every leatherface who kills me immediately but next game still can be a fun time. You will spend most of your time sneaking and hiding in bushes instead of looping a Johnny or some other family because you have limited sprint, you cannot run forever in this game and it shows. Victims are not purely cosmetic, you can only insta-unlock as Connie, punch family as Leland, take no damage as Ana, etc. They also have their own individual skill-trees which is the only way to get perks on a victim and cannot share perks at all. Victim is done so much better than dbd did survivor and it will show after a few hours. Hell, I still get fucking scared at a Leland popping around a corner or a hitchhiker jumping out from the bush as I run for pressure gate with Leatherface and Cook on my ass but that's how they do it. I'll explain atmosphere later.

Family:
I'm not going to say Family is bad because I have fun but I prefer victim more. I've had my good share of fun moments absolutely shitting on people as hitchhiker but I'll explain family really quickly. Family is the 3 part of the 3v4. They require a leatherface who starts in basement with the victims. The other two spawn up above and are to set up for the victims once they're out. You have to kill all the victims, there is an easy way to track them and that's feeding grandpa. Feeding grandpa is your side objective, feed him and you benefit with him being able to eventually reveal survivors when he screams no matter what. It's a relatively simple role on paper... until you realise that there are 4 (5 if you're on gas station) ways to escape and you have to PATROL ALL OF THEM. Hitchhiker is great for this with his traps but you can figure placement out, I'm not giving away my secrets. Honestly, family is a fun time and you should totally play it as it can help with your victim play too!!

Atmosphere:
This game has 3 maps but also several times of day for them. Family house has day, night and maybe dusk? Slaughterhouse has dusk and day, and Gas station has day, night and potentially dusk? Anyway, the atmosphere is still tense. There are moments when you will have a Hitchhiker jump out at you, a cook or leatherface see you, Johnny opening the door you're unlocking (totally never happened to me). Many different ways to get scared. It also isn't fast paced with stealth being the best choice thanks to limited stamina. This forces you to think about risks you'll take, are you really going to lockpick that door in the open? Are you really going to go for that health in the open? Are you really thinking about sneak attacking that Sissy with a lvl 15 strength stat (also totally not something I did)? You're thinking about every sprint, every use of your ability cause if you waste it then you're completely fucked for a while, every position, whether that escape is the best one. It's fear and anxiety inducing and it's what I need in my life sometimes.

Conclusion:
Overall, TCM is a fun, fresh breath of air for asymm horror games. It's better than dbd imo and could easily be better than dbd. You'll get a varied level of enjoyment based on whether you like victim or family but you'll still have fun. I can promise you that. 10/10, these developers were great and deserve your support by buying the game.",1692948073,1694550633,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Map knowledge & levelling up are a necessity for this game, you are expected to understand the genre & how important team work is on both sides of the playing field. Nothing too harsh about this, just reality.

- It went from being a completely horror-based stealth game to just flat out speed-running.

- The game is not balanced at all. The game is heavily victim-sided and most of the maps are shit. At this point, everyone has already memorized where everything is whether it is fuse or valves.

- Why in the fuck are there cooldowns? And why the hell can't family switch off the fuse when it's been turned on? I can understand there being cooldowns for victims when they try to turn off battery or turn on fuse and valve, but why in the absolute fuck do Family have cooldowns? It takes forever for the cooldown to go away and by the time it is done, one or two more exits have been opened.

- Stun locking is a huge problem in the game right now. And pray to fucking god you don't get stunned by door because if you do, then you are more likely going to get infinite stun looped for minutes, and I mean for minutes. I had a game where I was leatherface and I was stunned for a 2 minutes. 2 fucking minutes. And Leland, why the hell does he get 2 minutes for his stun when you get him to level 3 for his ability?

- The maps are absolute garbage. Really. Let's look at Gas Station for instance. On the side where there is a generator, there is a door you can go through. The first door isn't even locked so don't worry about picking that. Oh and you can latch the first door so killers can't get in. To make it even sweeter, you can shimmy through tight spaces and not even use the first door to unlock the front exit and then you're essentially free. What's the fucking point of doing generator if I can go by one door and unlock it and then I'm out. Did the developers not think of this shit when they designed the map?

- The bugs are ridiculous and there are still hackers. The solution to dealing with hackers was to turn off cross play. I have hardly come across cheaters in games and when I do it's usually addressed. But you are meaning to tell me that cross play was disabled in order to deal with cheaters? Now it feels like communities from different platforms are being punished just because of cheaters. I can't play with my best friend who plays on Xbox because of that. Even Dead By Daylight has had its fair share of cheaters but even they never disabled crossplay because of it.

- Half the perks are pretty much useless

- Johnny is arguably the weakest killer in the game. Where hitchhiker has traps, sissy has poison, and cook has padlocks, Johnny has nothing and his ability is easily countered.

- Here's one that really pisses me off. Let's talk about the report system. It's literal shit. I can't report players in game for when the DC or if they cheat or just flat out being toxic in a malicious way in game. In most games, you can view players post-game. Texas Chainsaw Massacre does anything but that. If a player leaves the game by any means, you can't view their profile to report them. Why the fuck can I not report them just because they they disconnected and are no longer in the game or spectating.

What a piece of shit. I mean I feel horrible even writing this out and I had high hopes for this game, but with the way that things are and the thought of recognizing how little thought was put into this game, I have never felt more disappointed. Until they get rid of bugs and actually do shit that would otherwise balance the game, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!",1694497710,1694497710,False,1,1,0.443414509296417236,0,True,False,False

For me: I have played this game 3 days straight, not even more than 10 people know what they are doing.
Either they're getting killed with in the first 2 minutes, or just walking around without knowing what to do.
I think this could blame the matching system? 
Moreover, the waiting time at the gaming lobby is WAYYY too long. 3 minutes is VERY USELESS.
You could've just chose the right skills for you before the game start or even queuing. Most of the time people just won't press ready and you'll have to wait for 3 minutes. If there's people left the lobby, good luck, you'll have to wait again.

*Graphics*: its okay does the job its not blow your hair back graphics but it suits the gameplay fine. i'd say soild 6/10 not great not bad but good enough for what the game has too offer and what its intended for.

*Audio*: bit jank if im too be prefectly honest, some times you wont hear guys on the other side of a wall even though theres a hole that you can slide through somehow the hole isnt big enough for sound to get through though? some times you can hear them above you in a hard wood flooring in an old house that if the game is based on the movies ( id say thats a safe bet) then you 100% should hear running around going on up stairs but maybe thats just me.

now for the rough parts the parts some of you will agree some of you wont. keep in mind this is MY THOUGHTS on the game not yours im not arguing things should be changed just sharing my own opinions I have add as a customer.

Map design: confusing at best and down right broken at worst. some how on gas station they thought it would be a good idea to have a door with ONE LOCK ON IT leading out side in the same place as the gen is. so it begs the question whats the point in doing the gen? i have tryed thinking of any idea in the world for that answer and i honestly cant think of one reason why you would want too.

then theres slaughter house they put the gas main in the basement for some reason so either your tunneling for one guy and let 2 or 3 get out to block that one exit as an option or you avoid it and have 2-3 get out but the one that open dies. theres no good option with it its a forced loss by game design im very much confused on the logic with that map design choice.

lastly house. why is all the fuses and all the fuse box spawns in the top floor that has maybe i'd say 4-5 rooms in total up there all linked together. makes no sense. why does there have to be a safe speed run option for each map to get out with thats broken af.


*Gameplay*: amazing when it works but as listed above maps are an issue with the flow of gameplay but so are characters connie and johnny hickhighter and leland are all very strong powerful picks but say sonny cook sissy and ana there so bad of a pick its like the game gimps you for picking them so why would you ever. but man when everyone thats playing is just playing to role play it is the most fun you will have in this game that moment is crazzy good and what i remember from Friday the 13th the game gun media's pass project that was something truely wonderful.

*Progression*: personaly i find the grind is long and not enough rewards too be fun takes right around 20-25 hours of gameplay time to get to level 3 with a character but once your there its really only the one reward your getting the best upgrade too your powers everything else takes like no time at all like 1-2 hours of gameplay time you can get any perk maxed and gaining levels for skill points you get for any character just comes with time as you get them for just playing the game personaly i was hopping for more skins or skins for tools or traps weapons something maybe even a whole skills tree for a power and not what we have i mean something that isnt just level 1-2 are just stat upgrades and then level 3 changes the power all together i mean one adds effects too them but small effects posion bleeding burning things like that they should deal small tinny amounts of damage but something one branch should change the power all together marking targets but no longer hurts them or way less damage but the stun is greater and added things like that. then the last one is stat upgrades incase you liked how the power was already more freedom to choice what you want and it makes it scareier for others because there not sure what your spec'ed into.


*Things I would change*: ( just in case you wanted to know) i would change the map flow to be. basement should be the scaryest most dangerest place in the game not the safest the next level ( shortly after exiting the basement) should be a little more safe but dangerous in the sense of more killers roaming about. then the last place is the safest back also the most dangerous depends nothing should be out there to be used ( aside form hiding placings closets freezers boxes car trunks and bushes things like that) but if you get out that way with out being caught then its safe because its so out of the way that killers dont want to go there unless they think or know someone is there. i would change each character to respect this rule/change and allow for more powers that effect every other bit of the game. that way the flow of the match is the same but what you do in said flow changes.

This game does have a few flaws though which MAY cause me to change this to a negative review later depending on the devs. The biggest problem by far is the door stun mechanic. If anyone ever played propnight when that first came out, then just think of that, but much worse. Survivors can spam the doors and have priority in using them over the family which can get family members stuck in a stun spam loop. Even in early propnight a good survivor could land (if I'm remembering correctly) 2 stuns with a door, but then the door would be damaged with the first stun and destroyed on the second stun. There are a lot more doors in this game than in propnight, so even if they made a 2 stun limit on doors in TCM it would still be too strong for survivors. Even being disadvantaged as the family, you don't really benefit from winning a mind game and landing a door slam on a survivor. You damage them a bit sure, but you have to wait for the animation of them getting up to attack and after that finishes they can just right back through the door again usually before you can even get a hit in and repeat the process. As leatherface you can destroy doors so they can't be used, but it takes a fair amount of time to do so and again there are a lot of doors. I think the best immediate change they can make is just have the doors be automatically destroyed after one successful stun.

The other issue which has been the reason for a lot of negative reviews lately is they temporarily disabled crossplay. People have been giving negative reviews as if the change is permanent or something. Not to say the anger isn't completely overblown though because this just shouldn't have happened. I definitely don't know the specifics, but they should have delayed the launch of the game or something to make sure this scenario wouldn't happen because it's caused irreparable damage to the community which isn't great for a multiplayer only game.

One last thing is it's probably a little more challenging than it should be to try and escape as the last survivor in this game. I don't think the game needs a hatch system like in dbd per say, but something to help the last survivor to make this stage of the game more balanced would be cool.

Other than the issues listed above the game is good. It runs smoothly for me and my pc isn't even up to par with this games recommended system requirements. I've only experienced one bad bug where my character got stuck in the bone chimes after grandpa woke up. The other bugs I've seen have been minor visual bugs with characters.

Game itself has 4 maps and I can already tell people are going to be so sweaty in it that they know every one like the back of their hand. Infact because of a lack of hard-stuck forced minigames this game is entirely reliant on the victim/survivor skill. If they are good and in coms they can easily escape and there isnt anything you can do about it. I mean there's videos of survivor groups stunlocking and looping the family for like 40+ minutes and people escaping 20+ times in a row to back what I'm saying up.

There are good things in the game. I think having to escape from the basement is cool, the grandpa system is cool, the family members are alright even if there's only 4 of them.

The graphics are OK, gameplays repetitive but the perks are well made and the final straw for me; the servers intermittently desync. Crossplay would be a great thing to add to the pros as well but it seems like they can't even get that sorted out. As a game its unplayable right now because desyncing takes out half the games (maybe its in anticipation of a patch coming sooon?) but assuming it gets fixed its like a 7/10.

""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" video game is a gruesome and heart-pounding experience that successfully captures the essence of one of the most iconic horror franchises in cinematic history. As a fan of both horror and gaming, I couldn't resist diving into this twisted and terrifying world, and I must say, it didn't disappoint.

Graphics and Atmosphere (5/5):
The game's graphics are gritty and unsettling, effectively immersing players in the eerie and decaying atmosphere of rural Texas. The attention to detail in recreating the infamous Sawyer family farmhouse, is commendable, making it feel like you're stepping into a nightmare straight from the movies. The dimly lit rooms, flickering lights, and eerie soundscape all contribute to a palpable sense of dread.

Gameplay / ""Story"" (4/5):
The gameplay primarily involves stealth and survival horror elements, as you navigate the Sawyer house while avoiding Leatherface and his deadly chainsaw as well as the other family members. The tension is palpable as you crouch behind furniture, hold your breath, and pray that Leatherface doesn't discover you. The gameplay is intense, but it can feel repetitive after a while, with limited escape options, as well as unbalanced objectives.

The game follows the same basic plot as the original 1974 film, with players taking on the role of one of the ill-fated friends who stumble upon the Sawyer family's gruesome secrets. Though it doesn't offer much in terms of innovation or surprises for those familiar with the movie.

Replayability (4/5):
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre game offers some replayability through skill trees and level up systems, encouraging players to continue playing for hours on end. However, the lack of diverse gameplay mechanics and a long wait between additional content may limit its long-term appeal.

Bugs and Server Issues (3/5):

Currently at the time of writing this review, bugs and server connection issues riddle the game. Constant crashing and server instability errors, as well as bugs involving audio and gameplay issues can unfortunately provide a frustrating experience. Fortunately the developers have stated that they are aware of these specific bugs and issues and are working hard on patching them.

Conclusion:
""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" delivers a faithful and gruesome recreation of the iconic horror film. It successfully captures the tension and atmosphere of the original, making it a worthwhile experience for fans of the franchise and horror enthusiasts. The game also provided a fun and addictive gameplay loop that is suitable for new and old fans of the a-symmetrical genre. If you're a die-hard fan of Leatherface and his gruesome legacy, this game is worth playing, but don't expect it to revolutionize the horror/a-sym genre.",1694299357,1694313266,True,1,0,0.491805464029312134,1,True,False,False

As shown I've played this game for nearly 50 hours or 2 days and from it I've had some of my most fun gaming moments ever, however there is a big problem plaguing the game and that's just simply experience. The game has now been out long enough that everyone who's been playing since week one has info on how to play each map and it makes victim incredibly easy and family incredibly stressful and mostly unfun. Victims can open most if not every exit in a map against even some great family members in minutes and trivialize the game on maps such as gas station with the infamous ""cheese door"" or family house by jumping out of a window with a specific escape build that's not difficult to actually pull off. On family side there isn't as much variety either and one player is always forced to play LF but 90% of players don't want to which tends to be another issue during matchmaking.

- I literally can't voice chat because its bugged and they said they fixed it last patch, but its not, so that's already a MAJOR hindrance as I don't have any friends who play this game, solo queue is my only option.

- When Sissy hits you it puts you into an inescapable vortex spin driving me absolutely nuts, that HAS to be a bug right? If its intentional it needs to be removed, she's already strong enough and she has poison to make you wobbly like that already. It is infuriating getting hit by her even one time.

- Lobbies take forever to start, everyone wants to play your character or they leave, and often nobody wants to play leatherface. So then you start letting people play your character, and then you're playing a lvl 0 victim vs lvl 10 killers which feels like a huge gap in power.

-Matchmaking is horrible. It constantly feels like its either A. a really competent team of family vs victims who are somehow lvl 30 but act like they've never played the game before, or B. victims who are actually good, work together, and all escape through the same door in the first 30 seconds vs a family that has no idea what they're doing and don't even turn on the car battery or a leatherface who doesn't break a single barrier. Also nobody talks, likely due to the voice chat bugs still in effect. Only way around it I think is to go open mic and some people do that and then you can't hear anything cause their trash mic is fuzzy or playing all kinds of background noise.

- Cheating is still a big issue. Also the being infinitely stunned as leatherface is a huge problem and probably why nobody wants to play him, although I do know a somewhat of a fix is coming for that.

- We still can't customize our key binds. Unreal to me that it was not implemented at release. 

I am just beyond frustrated and am not having fun 70% of the time anymore. It feels 30/70 on whether I'm gonna enjoy the match or not. I'm okay with ""losing"" or ""dying"" if the match actually felt fair and playable, its not like I'm a sore loser. But due to all of these issues I feel like, in some matches, I cannot even play the game.

Most of my comments are playing as victim, which I have played a bit more of than family. I'd say I've played 60/40. As family I feel like I'm extremely powerful. Rarely do any victims give me problems and usually if they do its because I'm outnumbered. But the killers move fast and get around quickly, even without comms I'm usually not too irritated playing as family, though being able to speak in game would fix any issues I had.

I do love the concept of the game, and it has so much potential to be fun, and I keep convincing myself to play because of that, but I am just so often not having fun while playing due to all of these extremely necessary fixes that I can't recommend it until most of these are patched.

1. Takes forever to start a lobby.  Takes multiple attempts because of lack of players
2. Second I notice as I'm playing  getting disconnected from lobby and from in-game. (Happening with others)
3. Sissy too overpowered and its really hard that there's two Killers who can go through obstacles. She can carry a lot of blood and can easily awaken grandpa to the fullest in a short amount of time which increase the chance of the killers to win the game especially when the killers also have ability/perks. 

Overall, its a good game. Just wanted to share my input. Thank you.

Honestly a lot more engaging as a player and overall a much more enjoyable experience. I love the fact there are multiple ways of escape not just one. You make a plan and suddenly your path becomes too dangerous so you gotta have a back up plan. ""Yes, got the fuse gotta get that box open...oh wait its being patrolled k gonna grab some lock picks and try the back exit."" I put far more thought into my plays and actions than I did in DBD. There is so much more to this game which is absolutely refreshing. Each character has their own unique ability which makes playing them fun and allows for more variety in the gameplay vs just buying a character for their perks and unlocking a new character skin. 

Honestly as a fan of this franchise I gotta say that the devs put so much love and care into every inch of detail into this game. From the sound design to the accuracy of the maps in respect to the films sets, the character voices and animations...list could go on. Love that Kane Hodder came back to do the body capture for Leatherface. Love that Sissy and Johnny were both concept characters from the og film. Love that they brought on Kim Henkel the original writer for the first film to work with them on the character design, they even were able to have Edwin Neal come back to reprise his role as The Hitchhiker, it's absolutely incredible. Its amazing to imagine almost 50 years after its conception that this franchise would be brought to life again through a whole new medium.  

I highly recommend this game. It embodies so much of the horror and terror that was The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It's new and feels fresh. I hope that the devs keep giving it love and keep it afloat with good updates and additional content. 

Some things I would like to see fixed: 
Animation for grandpa should not be so overwhelming. Should be a notification on the side or top of the screen. It should not interrupt the games motion. 

Skill trees while being very detailed and an interesting approach needs a bit of work. Multiple load outs is nice but I would like more variety to choose from with my perks. I get locked to certain paths on the tree and often times the perks are subpar or don't fit my play style. Then I need to refund the points and try a different route to try and get better perks...so why have multiple load outs if I am only changing one perk depending on which family members I am going up against? At this point I feel the system is a bit off but I am sure it will be tweaked. Fingers crossed the devs listen to the community. 

Disclaimer: At the moment there are two level systems; a player level and a character level. Your xp will affect both levels. So starting out new your xp level requirements will be low so you will level fast. This is normal for pretty much all games. I was able to get a character to level 10 within the first 3-4 hours of playing. Not too shabby. Then it took me around 5 hours to get another character to 10. I currently only have two at levels 10 and one at level 3. The grind seems to be a big one. This is either seen as good or bad for some players. Good because it gives reason to play and level everyone to 10 or bad for the more casual players who might feel stuck with playing certain characters cause they are only leveling one or two. Good thing the game has the skill point refund option so yes you can move points around. Just be ready to grind this game if you want to hit max level for everything. 

Okay, I've said enough. Buy this game and let the terror begin!

You either play family where you are stuck in cutscenes more than playing the game.  If you're leather face you're constantly bashed and backstabbed by Leland with an Ana supporting and door slamming.  If you're any other family member you are defending objectives which is either way too easy on house especially if you have a cook and hitchhiker or impossible if it's slaughter house.  Family is never fun to play as since the most common thing that happens is the game is over in less than 3 minutes.  Lobbies are longer games

If you play victim the games aren't as bad, but families that 3 stack do have the potential to hold the game hostage.  Have a hitchhiker?  Great, trap the ladders and have everyone stand at a door.  Have a sissy?  Great, lose as soon as she hits you because a perk she can get is actually broken.  Have a cook?  Then get spammed with laughter unless you want to crouch walk everywhere.  Of course this is only if you are not being chased.  Have a johnny?  He's impossible to outrun with scout 3 and will kill you in 4 hits.  Rushing is the most simple and easiest thing to do, but there's no fun in have a game last less than 3 minutes.

The devs are also to blame.  An anti update removed cross play, made lobbies start with 6 players and made the lobby timers 5 minutes??? They really wanted to kill the game faster than any other asymmetrical competitor.  This game needed more testing, almost every character can break the game or make it incredibly unbalance.  Sonny is the most balanced character which is why he dies in the cutscene intro all the time.  No one wants to play him because he cannot delete mistakes or instantly complete an objective.

- Constant stuttering throughout matches despite decent specs and lowering my graphic settings to low
- Cheaters allowed through xbox game pass
    - Devs, instead of ensuring beforehand that their anti-cheat system was effective, made the brilliant decision to work 
    around this by isolating the PC pool from the console pool, forcing:
        - PC players to play more cheaters
        - Premades of PC/Console players to not play together
- Input registration is clunky
- Bugs with certain killers
- Intermittent bug with xp being saved after matches

The sad thing is they did a Tech Test a few months prior to the release, and the game was still a mess afterwards.

End result: This game was fun for everyone in the beginning now if you want consistent fun as a family member you won't find it.

honestly a poor experience every time I've played, on victim you're expected to know what to do, on killer you have 90% of the match time as total downtime. how hard is it to mute on loss of focus lol, trash game

Compared to Dead by Daylight, it's a nice change in pace for DBD Veterans or anyone looking to play something similar. I have some thoughts on the game's current state though:

I don't know if it was intended, but 2/3 maps feel pretty imbalanced. Family house is way too oppressive for survivors (as long as killers know what they're doing). The map is way too small and with the wide open area outside. Not saying that you can't do anything as survivor. You can still attempt fusebox exit, etc, but it's still incredibly challenging if the killers patrol correctly. 

Gas station is a pretty good sized map compared to the other two maps. The only thing I will criticize is the gas station exit is way too easy with the front door. They need to have it removed entirely so survivors have to turn off the generator. 

Slaughterhouse is way too easy for survivors. The map is too big for killers to patrol. Again, not saying that killers can't win on this map, but survivors definitely have a good chance of surviving on this map. Also I think that the fuse spawns should be further away from the fusebox. Often times i have found it super close to the fusebox, leading to an easy escape. 

In regards to leveling up/progression system-- it can be way too long to do. I think they should at least show what earns you points while your in game so we can at least have an idea of how that works. I've heard that playing cook and marking survivors can help you farm points!

Also I think Sonny could use some changes because his ability isn't very good. I'm not saying that it isn't useful, but compared to everyone else, his ability isn't that great. It can be useful in certain situations, but not enough to make me want to play him. I would say it's just a preference, but I've been solo queuing lobbies-- I don't see people hardly playing Sonny. 

In regards to Sissy, pls don't attack me, but I think something should be done about her in instances where once she lands one hit, you can't run as survivor and your stuck. I understand people's viewpoint on how you should have a bone scrap to counter her. I have done this, and often times, other killers are nearby to get the instakill while I'm locked in animation with her. Especially on family house-- there's nothing you can really do because of how small the house is. It's crazy to me because she has great chase ability, but she doesn't have to due the one hit effect. 

There should be more punishment in the beginning for waking grandpa up because survivors will make so much noise in the beginning because they know it's more beneficial than playing sneaky as intended. Not sure how you would make it better, but figured it needed to be said. 

Lastly, make the lobby times shorter. It's ridiculous because I feel like I've done more time waiting in between matches than actually playing haha",1694205744,1694205744,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Main problems the game has now is that the servers are really sporadic and bad, you'll get DC'ed randomly every now and then and you'll get kicked for having too much ping, you'll get animation stuck and just have to leave, etc. These issues are sort of compensated for by the fact that all XP earned in a match is gained no matter if you leave or not, you do not have to finish a match to gain XP. (This is on the other hand also why you get victims bullying family and doing a lot of... weird counter-intuitive shit because they're not focused on escaping, but earning XP)

Devs seems to be on the case of fixing the game, but they communicate mostly on Reddit so if you look at the steam discussions you'll get a very poor view on the devs responsiveness to the issues in the game.

The game can deliver a lot of intense and high pulse situations even 40 hours in, sometimes a match is 1 minute long, sometimes 15 minutes long.

I don't think I've come across such a toxic community since League of Legends, but let's go for the good things first.  The game is great, it is ingenious and captivates you from the first moment, whether you are a victim or a member of the Saw family. Even if you are lost and die, or don't know how to take care of your house, it entertains you. The skill branch is very well done and offers many possibilities for everyone to form a build to their liking. Now, what I consider negative: first I don't like the idea (mostly as a member of the family) that you have to play with characters you don't like. Even in League of Legends you could pre-select to avoid arguments. They even insulted me and told me everything just because I entered the room last and I had to go, according to their invented rules, with leatherface. I don't think that someone should be forced to play with him, although I understand that he is the protagonist of everything. Anyway, it can be solved by adding an extra mode where you can search for a game with the character you want. Second, and unlike other games, here the premades condemn you. They make a lot of noise to get together and you end up dying because of their disasters. They also won't hesitate to reveal your position to save a friend. I think it's terrible.

 Games also don't feel like there is a lot of push and pull that you would expect in these style of games. 
Survivors can rush objectives surprisingly fast and experienced players can also chain loop and stun the killers for what feels like forever. On the other side killers abilities can also often lead to very fast deaths for players that had pretty little counter play (invisibly poisoned objects, traps placed at the top of ladders that survivors can't avoid, being poisoned while moving through chase breakers that make it next to impossible to escape the chase, just being instant killed by leather face, etc.).

That said, i ultimately cannot currently recommend the game, for several reasons. Notably, as most games do on launch, there are blatantly unfair things in the hands of both sides; Victims can run rampant stunlocking the Family and easily escape out of poorly designed maps that are easy to memorize, while the Family has access to the Hitchhiker who can completely lock down certain maps into a stalemate and Sissy who is nigh-impossible to escape from with the right build. Most unconscionable however is the devs' decisions in the most recent patch. Firstly they decided to segregate PC players from Crossplay while they work on implementing anti-cheat that should have been present at launch. As of right now, the timeline is ""hopefully weeks"". In the meantime, us PC players - including those of us on Steam, mind you, who willingly paid for a game that launched on a subscription service and therefore are arguably more premium customers - are trapped with the cheaters away from our friends with drastically increased queue times. Those who decide to brave the queue times anyway are met with a lobby timer that was inexplicably increased to *FIVE* minutes (remember - on some maps a good Victim group can escape in <3 minutes, so you could easily spend double the time getting in a match as you do in a match) and the ability for games to start with only 6 players - whether the team a man down is Victims playing 3v3 or the Family playing a 2v4, this is blatantly unfair and clearly not how the game was designed.

POSITIVES:
☑ Fresh Dead by Daylight experience.
☑ Fun with friends but unless your EQ is 0.
☑ A huge lot of potential, but bruh oboi the negatives.

NEGATIVES:
☒ You will spend more time in the lobby queuing than actually playing the game lmao. It's now at a 3:1 ratio of waiting in the lobby to playing the game.
☒ Lack of Tutorial and in-game guidance, instead we get an in-game video that doesn't really say much. You will need YouTube Guides or suffer like me :)
☒ Poo Poo servers.
☒ You literally cannot max more than 2 characters without putting at least 30 hours into the game
☒ The most awful Skill Tree I have ever seen in my entire life, you'd rather shit bricks.
☒ Level gap grind for skill tree points are the worst I have ever seen
☒ ""INSUFFICIENT CREDENTIALS"", here, now you must restart the game and repeat the process when queuing.

POSITIVES:
☑ Fixed the insufficient credentials bug

NEGATIVES:
☒ Servers have became twice as unstable compared to before, with frequent disconnects or just crashes that force you to just quit mid-game.
☒ Frequent stuttering bug on first game, solvable by restarting the game again

I have played as leatherface and hitchhiker a lot, I think for right now that they are balanced to some degree. Leatherface feels kind of clunky but I'm sure there will be improvement.

i deeply enjoy the mechanics within this game, and how there's parts of the map which are killer based, others victim based. if more cosmetics were to ever come out in terms of character skins (for the family would be super cool?!), i'd gladly buy them. the graphics are amazing, and even on my gaming laptop, i can run everything in ultra without fps stutters. for as early of a release this is, there is a few bugs, granted; (the worst being doors, certain killer mechanics, etc.) but overall it performs great. the variety of family perks, victim perks, and skill tree point allocation towards stats is awesome. it lets me add better/tweak the stats on characters that lack them in certain areas and are stronger in others.

a solid 8/10 from me. the two-point deduction for me could be fixed with a slightly better anti-cheat software and some more niche bug-fixes. i wish people didn't give these developers such hell in the reviews (it's very discouraging, and makes the game intimidating to those looking to buy). i do not have as many issues on this game as others describe, on any devices that i play on, besides things that are very minor (mainly issues with hitboxes, and family like sissy). maybe i'm just lucky, but i think this game is great, fun, interactive, and beginner-friendly.

if you love games like dead by daylight, or friday the thirteenth (rip o7), this is a good game to try that most may enjoy. i heavily recommend it to anyone who loves both horror and puzzle-like games that keep you on your toes. keep up the good work, looking forward to more updates and hopefully some fixes on the issues!

tldr; 8/10
pros: fun to play, easy to learn, beginner friendly, variety of perks for a very individual feel
cons: specific game impacting bugs and glitches, unreliable anti-cheat system

glitches/bugs i have personally encountered in the past two weeks of gameplay:

- sissy and hitchhiker (sometimes johnny, as well) getting a + 6 hit streak on me, and being able to continue to hit me at a very fast pace even after missing several hits consecutively (this depletes over half of your health bar and makes it very difficult to evade)
- doors getting caught on characters or killers and disabling movement of both the door and player parties
- executing someone as killer, and then no longer being able to move from that spot anymore for the rest of the match
- leatherface getting stuck after breaking barricades, or stuck in map corners
- getting one shot by certain killers (leatherface and johnny) with a 3/4th full health bar with no health-damaging affects applied (poison)",1694065532,1694098358,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A very fun asymmetrical horror that is unfortunately riddles with issues including; Constant game crashes, stuttering/hiccups on ultra setting with a 3090 RTX and a	11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-11900K, credential errors which I assume have to do with authentication and anti-cheat.

Time to kill is INSANELY short, to the point you can be killed in a single chase or in a few hits by the harder hitting killers. There is one ""tank"" character, and you can spec anyone into being more durable, but dying instantly in my first 10 games prevents me from getting EXP to do that.

Game has a ""solved"" meta already thanks to the amount of streamer publicity it has, and if you don't conform you get bashed.

The community is fucking AWFUL. My first ever game had a female streamer on the killer side, to which my partner victims bashed her with every slur known to mankind, then bashed me for asking for some leniency on my first game. But it's okay, I'm not a softie, I'll take the death and move on. 

Next 4 games were the same. Bashing, bashing, fighting, cursing, slurs, then dying instantly in a single chase because I couldn't get anyone to cooperate or assist me in my understanding. 

I'm not asking for handholding, but it -IS- a team game.

Of course people are going to compare it to DBD, which is fair considering that its another asymetrical horror game with kills and escapes the primary objectives. However, I feel like the game stands out on its own and has enough uniqueness to it that it stands out from other games in the genre. Being based off of a well-known IP is a big help. The way I like to describe it to others is that both sides have their objectives, but compared to a game like DBD its a bit more extreme. With a family(killer) like Leatherface, its completely possible to remove a victim(survivor) from the game in the first 30 seconds or less. Catching a survivor in a bad spot with the right killer can lead to a quick death. No hook states or second chances. However, one survivor can stealthily unlock their way to an exit if they play slow and sneaky. A killer leaving an area for a few seconds can lead to an escape if there are no safeguards to slow down victims.

Pros: 
-Each family and victim feels unique with their appearance as well as their abilities. Some share perks but their abilities are what truly make them stand out.
-Each map has a unique layout, with some favoring the family over the victims and vice versa, and can even impact what family gets chosen. (Slaughterhouse appears to be the most victim sided at the moment.)
-The pacing of the match can be impacted by both sides. Victims can choose to play aggressively and try to escape before family can setup and grandpa gains levels. They can also choose to play a lot more slow and stealthy. However, family can spend time feeding grandpa to encourage victims to act before grandpa gets to level 5 and can reveal anyone.
-Atleast currently, only microtransactions have been an execution pack for killers. Other skins are earned by just playing the game.
-Communication is big and can lead to landslide victories if a side works together well.

Cons: 
-Feel like updates and bug fixes are happening to slow. Granted its new and I know nothing about coding, but there are well known bugs (like Bubba's chainsaw revving through the grandpa animation and overheating) that havn't been fixed yet.
-Stun chaining can be a bit annoying, although it can be countered by having a second family nearby. Most noticable if someone is playing Leland because they just stab your back after using his ability on you.
-I don't think doors are that bad, but doing some weird game of chess to see if either person is going to slam the door open feels unnatural.
-Transparency regarding the recent cross-play removal feels low. It feels a bit weird to just completely disable it instead of making it more apparent that you can opt of cross-play in the settings. Gun hasn't mentioned how long their idea of ""temporary"" is as well so it leads to a lot of confusion to how long this feature is going to be gone, as well as what steps they are taking to fix the cheating issue.

I wouldn't call this a con per-say. It's just something I've always found annoying from DBD, which is just sitting in the exit gate waiting for a family member to push you out. 9/10 its a connie that is bragging she used her ability to unlock a gate in .2 seconds or its a Leland waiting to shove you.

I would recommend the game though, I think most of its problems right now aren't that bad as long as Gun continues to update the game and add content as it ages.",1694058788,1694058788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is tense as victims and can give you that power high as the family. However, that is about where the big positives end. The game is buggy, dry on content, and balance issues out the wazoo. The asking price is far too high for content that is too little. Yes, they may end up fixing a lot of issues, balancing characters and perks, and add a lot of new content. I am judging how it is right now and right now the charm of a new asymmetrical horror PvP game has faded and all the ugly is showing clear as day. 

Also with this new update to ""fix"" the game they disabled cross-play in a poor attempt to remedy cheating for console players while they come up with a way to get rid of cheaters. They added custom key binds. (Wow! A basically more than standard feature of any PC release for only like the past 10+ years!) As well as fixed a handful of bugs, but per standard of modern gaming ended up breaking almost as much as it fixed.

Now with the community, the player base is already showing a fair amount of toxicity and making the game not fun in general. I know how players act is largely out of control of developers, but really sucks this games community is already ruining the experience for many so soon after launch.

Need I also mention them locking family execution animations behind a pay wall? Seriously? What happened to earning things in game? This is already a serious red flag for them to abuse this to try and get more money from people for future content.

EDIT: Only been playing killers/family and so far only 1 victim has survived out of 7-9 games. Each of us all have maxed out victims and killers occasionally 1 person lower level but that's how it's been recently to put into perspective. (There has been multiple groups too like a 3 man or 2 duo parties etc etc.)

I'd be down to play this more it's not a bad game but the killers are so overpowered and easy to play. I can play Bubba with no levels added and do well enough to kill victims that are level 10 maxed out. Ontop of that when it's a full 3 man of killers vs a random 4 victims it's just ridiculous and makes me want to leave the game in the lobby. You get caught by one of them and all 3 just come running at you. (The victims were stupid but I got a 3 piece with Bubba before any of them even got out of the basement too and multiple times at least killed 1 or 2 before they would get out of the basement it's insane how easy it is since Bubba can nearly 1 shot)

- Endurance vs Killer Stamina: I can max out my stamina with a victim/survivor and it is great however despite the fact some of the Family/Killers can't get through every gap or hole or obstacle like all the victims can it's still insane how easy it can be for them to just chase you across the map. I can go through a small gap and with the 1-2 seconds it takes me to fit through it a killer can already be around the building entering in from the other side. My stamina can renew quick with it being maxed out however playing killer I realized it just pops back to full in a couple seconds.

- Perks: A good few of the perks are very very situational and are pretty useless until they're leveled fully.

- Maps: The maps overall are really good but with 3 killers it's just difficult to even try to do anything. I can open up 2 exits both exits being timed but if I run to one a killer could be camping that spot and potentially murder me quick enough that I couldn't outrun them unless I was Julie or had Endurance perks. So if this situation were to happen then I'd need to sneak or run all the way to the other exit I had opened as well and sneaking could run the time out and I'd have to run to reopen it whichever way is required or run and another killed pop up and chase me alerting the other 2 killers to come and follow me as well resulting in death. 

I've had a killer disconnect even making it a 2v4 and I still do enough to take out atleast 2 or 3 of them.

There's a ton more I can complain about in irritation but overall TLDR killers are just not fun to play against ESPECIALLY when it's a full party 3 man. It's just such a low chance in surviving solo and even with a group I've died in less than 2 minutes playing with 3 other people. Or playing solo and having a duo on my side and they just get hung up to be butchered in less than 5 minutes. 

It's a situation where it's not all based on if you know what you are doing/skill but just how the game plays and unbalance.

EDIT: Forgot to mention for some random reason they removed PC crossplay due to cheaters? I ran into 1 so far past couple days ago which was a Sissy player who was invisible and teleported to each victim and killed us in under 3 minutes.",1693969986,1694054565,False,4,0,0.526060640811920166,0,True,False,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After almost 40 hours and leveled up the Cook and Leatherface skills to level 3, I can say that this game needs a lot of work yet.

The maps are unbalanced as hell. Family house is kinda hard to victims to survive and escape. Gas Station can be rushed by victims in a flash if they know what to do. And Slaughterhouse more of the same, if you know how to rush the fuse escape the map can be done in less than 3 minutes.

The characters are broken or useless. Cook having the skill of spot and mark enemies is kinda broken, but Sissy in the other hand seems kinda useless for me, since there is a delay when you use the venom, so victims can avoid it easly. Leland is a victim that is also broken with that stun, and Connie is also kinda OP with the insta open lock.

Items like the bonestab is broken as hell. You can coordinate with other victim to permastab a family member and make him unable to play. Also the enviroment escapes are OP too, since there is no cooldown for use them, so they can infinite loop you until you get some help (if the teammates are whilling to help).

The way that you earn points is silly. If you play characters like Cook you can make 2k or even 6k in a single game, being crazy OP, since that could be more than a level in a single game. When you kill a victim you earn more points than when you hit them, so if a teammate steal your kill they will profit more than all your effort to kill that victim.

With all this said, the game needs a lot of balance and redoing for be more fun to play.",1692755132,1694051985,False,2,0,0.527897000312805176,0,True,False,False

--Sissy is still bugged and subsequently OP AF
--Hitchhiker traps on ladders will bug you so you can't interact with crawl spaces or gaps, this triggers 100% of the time
--Saving a fellow victim in a struggle will make it so the family member can't interact with anything anymore. This triggers 90% of the time
--Cutscene still causes issues for Bubba
--If you get hit doing a valve you're stuck on it and you'll die

I recently had the misfortune of playing ""Dreadful Descent,"" a horror game that left me not only disappointed but genuinely irritated. As an avid gamer with a taste for the eerie and spine-tingling, I thought I was in for a thrilling experience. Unfortunately, ""Dreadful Descent"" failed to deliver on every front, leaving me frustrated and counting down the minutes until I could stop playing.

First and foremost, the game's graphics were shockingly subpar. In an era where photorealistic visuals are the standard, ""Dreadful Descent"" felt like a throwback to the early 2000s. The character models were blocky, the textures were blurry, and the environments lacked the detail needed to immerse players in a truly terrifying world. It's 2023, and there's no excuse for such lackluster graphics in a horror game.

But the problems didn't end with the visuals. The sound design was equally disappointing. Instead of a carefully crafted, chilling soundtrack that could build tension, ""Dreadful Descent"" relied on an annoying loop of creaky doors and generic jump-scare stings. It felt like the developers were more interested in making players jump out of their seats than in creating a genuinely eerie atmosphere.

Perhaps the most infuriating aspect of the game was its story. Or rather, the lack thereof. ""Dreadful Descent"" seemed to throw together a mishmash of horror clichés with no real narrative cohesion. It felt like a random assortment of horror elements, from zombies to haunted dolls, all stitched together with no rhyme or reason. There was no depth to the characters, no meaningful exploration of the game's themes, and no satisfying conclusion to tie everything together.

Gameplay-wise, ""Dreadful Descent"" was equally uninspiring. The controls were clunky and unresponsive, making it a chore to navigate the poorly designed levels. The puzzles were simplistic, and the combat was tedious at best. It felt like the developers were more interested in cheap jump scares than in creating engaging gameplay mechanics.

To top it all off, the game was riddled with bugs and glitches. From characters getting stuck in walls to items disappearing into thin air, ""Dreadful Descent"" was a technical mess that only added to my frustration.

In conclusion, ""Dreadful Descent"" is a horror game that I would not recommend to anyone. It fails on almost every level, from its lackluster graphics and sound design to its incoherent story and frustrating gameplay. If you're looking for a truly terrifying and immersive horror experience, I suggest you look elsewhere because ""Dreadful Descent"" is a nightmare in all the wrong ways.",1694019380,1694019380,False,1,0,0.415355563163757324,0,True,False,False

It's an asym game focused more on stealth than chases unlike DBD, which is exactly my jam. But I'm not going to dwell on the positives, you can read the other reviews for that, I'm sure there's plenty and they are all worth a read for the actual gameplay aspect. But a game is much more than the gameplay.

First of all, they disabled an advertised feature with the latest patch, no official timeframe of re-enabling it. This is unacceptable for a few days, let alone weeks or months like a dev suggested on twitter (unofficially). This, plus making the lobby 5 minutes long, makes it incredibly painful to get a match that may be over in under a minute if I make a mistake, not to mention that it doesn't fix the hacking issue for PC.

I'm not comfortable in owning or playing a game that will not hesitate to remove features or downgrade my experience, given that I payed full price for it without any mention of timeframe or compensation. Not to mention the slow process of fixing gameplay critical issues, like the stunlocking bug and the chainsaw bug which can ruin games. Good thing that they added keybindings in the latest patch. It's only been around since the 90's so it's pretty new tech that devs need to get used to.

I am especially not comfortable with how the developers respond to (and enable) threads calling PC players (and by extension me) ""subhuman"": https://www.reddit.com/r/TXChainSawGame/comments/16allha/comment/jz7yov6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
The original comment is now edited to remove that word, but the dev responded before the edit, and you can search in the comment thread for proof that that word was indeed used.

The incompetence with which this game is being handled and the unprofessionalism of the developers makes me leave a negative review.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
I cannot in good faith recommend it. I've tried to refund it 3 times but with no success so I'll just make do with what I have.

There has been a cheating issue recently with a very small minority of PC players in the past. Instead of taking responsibility themselves and making a better anti-cheat, they pulled the trigger on ALL PC players and disabled cross-play for them (temporarily, aka 3/4+ weeks) - meaning that:

1. You cannot play with your cross-play friends (punishing both you and them for the small amount of cheaters and their own lack of competence).

2. Your queue times on PC will be incredibly high as PC only matchmaking is heavily not preferred due to bad server issues (putting you on Asian servers when you are from NA/EU) and people preferring with friends.

3. You are now being forced into a small group with all of the cheaters instead of playing with the whole game player base, meaning your quality of games will be really low.

4. You are now being forced to take responsibility as an innocent player for the actions of a select few.

5. The issue isn't even resolved - Xbox Game Pass (which is the main culprit of hackers existing) can STILL play cross-play.

Along with this, there are other issues. There have been some really BAD bugs existing in the game for a while that haven't been fixed for a long time.

Sissy has a game-breaking bug where you can get stunlocked and die as a victim within seconds because she literally hit you.

Your game can keep crashing for no reason.

You don't get XP for random things.

You also can't rebind your keybinds.

They have also confirmed no road-map, take of that what you will.  

Even assuming the game was free of bugs (which it isn't) the balance just really isn't there, every game seems to be heavily one sided. Against uncoordinated survivors, there's no real challenge, just rush towards them and you win. Against coordinated survivors they're out and free before the gramp cut scene has played and stunned Bubba. Although it's difficult to fully blame balance due to the subtle hacks people have freely been using. 

The perk system in the game is a little strange, allowing people to freely respec their trees but having random perk nodes that could be any perk. Which essentially results in repeated respecing until you get the perks you want, I'm unsure why a 'choose your own perk' system isn't utilised rather than wasting 20 minutes for something useful. Not to mention a few perks don't seem to work at all. 

The matchmaking system seems to be a trial and error approach from the devs, rather than any actual system for matchmaking they recommend leaving lobbies if you don't want to risk a 6 player game. I can't imagine the long wait time for a game isn't due to play count, rather than seemingly randomly throwing players into half full lobbies without any sort of 'pending' time to work out where best to place 7 people at once. 

A lot of the good reviews for this game are saying 'It needs some polish but it'll get there. Have some patience'. It's a $40 game that has had 3 months from tech tests to resolve these issues and an additional 3 weeks of it being live. Instead they shipped a game with debug functions and without any sort of anti cheat on one of its platforms. 

I'm not even going to mention cross play removal since it never should have been an answer to a hacking problem they created.

Aside from the above issues, there is a solid foundation for a fun game with friends (unless they're on console.) If they start to resolve the bugs that people have been raising for months then perhaps it will be more enjoyable

I will say this as i don't usually leave reviews, the most fun you'll have in this game is the first few matches you get, the horror and terror was amazing, BUT unfortunately as you progress you start to see the flaws highlighted massively.

The cheaters are out of this world already on this game wall hacks speed movement you name it, there absolute ZERO mechanical skill involved aside form leather faces chainsaw reving, the classes for killers most of them are completely useless and find the victims having extremely overpowered abilities.

now people will say just get good, fair point but for a casual experience there is none, already you have people leaving games if they dont get their main not allowing to have a variety of exposer to all victims/killers, there no skill based match making so you'll probably go against sweats that will escape in 50 seconds, and honestly the way you get good at the game is just understanding the map, you cant use skills that will put you infront of a killer or victim.

Disregarding the first patch while they currently address people bypassing Anti-cheat by disabling crossplay for PC, there's still much to enjoy, with fast pace gameplay and quick decision making.  I would say this game does much that keeps you on your toes.

Pros:
Customizing your character does have a notable impact on gameplay, depending on the survivor you can feel the weight of your attributes and perks.

Maps can be as confusing as it gets, but it adds to game by having you search about and seek tools, or victims to slay.  

Learning curve isn't impossible to pick up, and you don't need to be highly experienced to escape. 


Cons:
Progression System is honestly my biggest gripe.  Getting Skill Points takes a very long time which isn't very noticable at early levels. But once you're at lv. 15; the progression quickly falls apart.

Being unable to play the same character can lock you out of victims or killers you've invested your time into. Often forcing you to play characters you've otherwise neglected. In my case; I've only got two characters who are moderately leveled.  When they're taken up by someone else. I'm forced to play at the bare bones.

It is possible to get killed quickly in the early game as victims. Characters with low health can be one-shot by Leatherface if they are poorly caught. Which can feel very grating or unfair. I would hope something could remedy this so people aren't just KOed by a singular mistake.

There is a notable bug with Sissy that, with the right combination of perks. She's capable of killing victims if she lands a single blow.  This results in reducing all movement speed to 10%, making it impossible to flee even when sprinting.  This has been addressed but hadn't been fixed yet. This makes playing against Sissy almost impossible if you're not playing as Ana. Even Leland's special ability cannot buy enough time to get away.


This game has a HUGE amount of potential. I enjoy playing this.  Hiding isn't cripplingly bad as Killers have tools to reveal you. Stealth and cunning plays are great for both sides.  I'd hope these issues are addressed and looking into new solutions to make gameplay more smooth, and make it less grating to level up lesser played characters.",1693979289,1693979289,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I didn't get to partake in the betas, but I've had my fair share of gameplay so far. One thing's for sure: these matches are quick! You're either watching the Victims get picked off super fast, or they end up mildly lucky with which exit they are rushing, and escaping in no time.

I feel like I have mixed my time in the game pretty well, where I can both speak on behalf of Victims and Family side of things. Most matches last between 2 - 8 minutes, I do have the occasional 15 minute match where I am struggling to get out, but they are rather rare.

But my main concern for the game currently; The game feels a bit... samey after a while, and lacks depth, and forcing Leatherface in every match? It kinda limits things as well. We're talking about just 12 Family combos to watch out for. Yeah, there are perks, but they don't shake things up that much.

[i] I get having Leatherface in the match makes sense both lore and gameplay wise, but what I have noticed is that a majority of the current player base do not want to be forced to play Leatherface if they do not wish for that, so it ends up with a lot of disputes on who should switch from their lvl. 10 Johnny / Sissy, and play Leatherface, who they have never played before [/i]

So, TL;DR? ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is decent fun for now, but the devs really need to be on their A game with adding content, as I can see this game quickly growing stale for a lot of people.

- 6th of September UPDATE -
As of today, I can not recommend this game. The developers have yet to address some (even though minor) balancing concerns, bugs being abused and so on, and the first patch they DO decide on is to disable crossplay for PC players, as there are issues with their implementation of their anti-cheat.

Even after the first patch this game suffers from frequent UE4 crashes, players getting stuck in walls, frame rate/stuttering, hackers, chat issues, XP gain issues, server disconnects and much more.

Door stun exploits in basement allow victims to perma stun family members. The ability to start a match without lobbies being full resulting in a 3v3 or 2v4 match.

Here's a handful of things that bother me:
- The developers shipped the game with debug functions on launch. This makes it very easy for cheaters to hijack these functions and completely ruin matches — really just the game as a whole. Of course, these functions were not removed until today, weeks after launch. They could have had a patch out just days after launch.
- The Microsoft Store PC version did not ship with an anti-cheat at all. You can imagine how this worked out. Anti-cheat was added in today's update (thankfully), but I have doubts in its competency. The developers promised to have cheating issues mostly under control on launch when the tech test was happening, including adding more server-side checks for various functions but that did not happen. Mostly everything is still client-side.
- Crossplay was ""temporarily"" removed on the PC platform today. Who knows how long this change will last for, seeing how a developer on Twitter said ""hopefully weeks or less,"" I am led to believe this will be for possibly a month or more. People can no longer play with their friends on different platforms such as Xbox and PS5. This was done in order to give the developers more time to ""perfect"" their anti-cheat and protect the precious console playerbase, while leaving the PC playerbase to deal with these cheaters in tenfold. Shows how confident they are in their new anti-cheat measures. 
- Lobby countdown timer was 5 minutes in the tech test, 3 minutes at launch, and now back to 5 minutes as of today. Who asked for this? If anything, people were complaining that even 3 minutes was too long because there would always be that one moron in the lobby who would not ready up, and we would have to wait the entire 3 minutes. 3 minutes really wasn't that bad, but now it's back to 5 minutes? I don't know if this is somehow supposed to compensate for the change that allows lobbies to start with 6 people, but even that's ridiculous. Really, the 6-player lobby change just leads to more sweat. I want to play semi-casual, not feel like I'm competing in a tournament for $2,000. It was fine with 7.
- The request for keybinding has been a big thing among the PC playerbase since launch. Players mainly wanted to remap the text chat key because it was just so easy to accidentally press and completely get screwed in a chase. Never really happened to me, but I understand where others are coming from. Keybinding was added to today's update and I believe everything was added except for text chat rebinding, one of the big reasons players wanted a keybinding feature in the first place. Was this done on purpose or are the developers really just not listening?

I hope I can recommend this game in the future, but as of right now that is not the case.",1693952271,1693953486,False,4,0,0.525369465351104736,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed their “Friday the 13th” game for the same reason. That said, I had high expectations for this game, and so far, they’ve delivered; however, like many others on here, I have grievances I’d like to see addressed. 
For starters, the tutorial videos are okay, but as mentioned earlier, this isn’t Gun Interactive™’s first rodeo; they should know how important it is to have a playable tutorial that will hold the player’s hand and teach them how to complete basic objectives both as Victim and Family Members. It’d also be nice to have an offline mode so you can practice and become familiar with the maps. Having an offline mode helped me when playing Friday.  
The game has a built-in feature that allows players to report other players. This feature needs a complete rehaul because, as of right now, it’s a blank “report this player.” You can’t explain WHY you’re reporting each other – are they hacking? Is there harassment involved? Do they have an offensive name? The developers will never know because you can’t elaborate.
Those are my two main gripes with the game. I’m sure everything else will work itself out over time.

Pros:
- When you like games like Dead by Daylight you will love this game
- Both sides are fun to play and it seems balanced / fair until you face a SWF / KWF (Survive / Kill with Friends group) while you play solo, that can be sometimes pretty frustrating but at least there is an ingame voice chat you can use to coordinate with your team mates
- Every killer and survivor have their unique powers that makes them special but some character's ability is a bit stronger than the other but I won't call a character OP right now; for example: Bubba can destroy barricades, doors and vents and he's awesome in killing / can oneshot if he is able to use his sprint ability right, the Hitchhiker can place traps, the Cook can lock 3 doors with extra locks and can try to hear people making sounds through walls, Sissy can poison survivors to slow them down and is able to follow them whereever they go and Johnny can track footprints
- You don't have to repair 5 gens and then escape through an exit gate like in DbD, it's more interactive: You can escape through two exit gates that are powered with electricity that flows across the floor and prevents you from escaping, so you have to turn off the generator or the car battery (depends from which gate you want to escape), you can escape through an exit door in the basement that you have to power by finding a fuse and by activating the fuse box or you can escape through a valve exit and you have to find the valve to activate the gas boiler that opens the valve exit. And the killers have to prevent you from doing it. They can't camp all 4 exit gates with 3 killers so there is always one way out.
- You can play it stealth, you can rush to the exit (Connie is awesome in lockpicking doors) or you can try to fight the family (you can use bones to attack the family members, Leland has a special ability that lets him bodycheck a killer and Ana can be an awesome tank)

Contras:
- It's currently a bugfest and the server connection sucks
- Sometimes your ""gameplay"" freezes so you just can walk around but can't interact with anything for a few seconds (I died once at an exit gate I was lockpicking and somehow couldn't finish the animation, meanwhile two killers came from behind and had enough time to prevent me from doing it and I just died)
- I lost connection (""Supplied credentials are invalid"") to the servers a few times while being in a match (had nothing to do with my internet, I rechecked it)
- Since a few days I can't join TCM without disabling my anti virus program: ""You can't connect to PlayFab"" (that's the launcher of TCM)
- The maps visually look awesome but they are poorly designed in some ways, there are infinite loops, especially in the basement where you can do nothing against as Bubba except one of your family members helps you

Still, I can overlook the bugs and server problems because the game itself is so much fun, so I recommend it to everyone who loves horror movies (especially the classics from the 70s and 80s), horror games and asymetrical games like Dead by Daylight.",1693951902,1693952096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TCM cuts out a lot of the padding other asymmetrical horror games contain and makes both roles (victim and family) enjoyable to play. Matches often don't take long to finish (~10 minutes/match), but in that time you're granted a tense, blood pumping, challenge to escape/kill. Too often do games in this genre become action games with a horror theme after the fear begins to wash away. With about 50 hours under my belt it's still pretty scary thanks to hard work and time spent in audio and visual design.

GUN Interactive and Sumo Digital did a great job at giving this horror classic a proper video game release.

Don't waste your money on it. 

If it takes longer than a week to get crossplay back I'm leaving this review permanently negative even if I do manage to play it again some day simply because this will be the second game they've burnt me with as I was a backer of friday the 13th actually. if I don't see anything but mostly premade lobbies, then to avoid falling behind from just taking some time off after the game kept kicking me with my internet and streaming working fine (the game's problem) costing me sometimes plenty of 3k+ xp games then I'm gonna just start doing nothing but padlock farming with cook until the game becomes playable for a solo again on pc.

I'm sick of this shit with games. Horrible enough launch states will retain permanently negative review from myself from now on, as an example of what I mean by that, while no man's sky is great now I would have left it with my 2018 review or whatever year that was it came out.

Otherwise give us refunds and remove the license from our accounts if it ain't back in a week or less since our money is wasted here and we should have gotten it on ps5 or seriesx for those of us with one (I only didn't because of upcoming sony pricehikes for ps+ as I hardly play online on my console thanks to CROSSPLAY BEING STANDARD SO GAMES DON""T DIE IN WEEKS AFTER BECOMING CESSPOOLS OF TRYHARD AND PREMADE FILTH YOU CONSTANTLY SEE THE SAME LOBBIES OF OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER).

I had really high hopes for this game and in 3 weeks it's pretty much done. Why waste likely hundreds of thousands on big name advertisement and then do this stuff? Maybe the people handling the money need a better leash on the devs.

The devs have decided that, due to hacking, they are going to remove PC from crossplay. This means PC is removed from what I believe was said to be at least 66% of players. So if you bought on PC, you now have an inferior product missing content that was sold to you, and that other platforms still get. There is no ETA on if/when it'll ever come back. So now you paid 40 for a game without the features advertised, and that has in one day lost 66% of players (since we cannot play with them) and thus has now far far longer lobbies. They knew this would be an issue so they changed things so the game doesn't even need to be asymmetrical and can just be 3 v 3 now (which is very unbalanced but now needed since PC players will be waiting forever.)

PC players are punished because the devs did not take any precautions for hackers EVEN WHEN BLATANTLY WARNED ABOUT IT 3 MONTHS AGO. They knew this would happen, did nothing, and are now punishing customers for the crime on...being on the wrong platform. 

And at the end of the day? Any cheater that wants to connect to console can do so. What, you think they have hacks to teleport around but none that can spoof themselves to the server saying ""Yeah, I'm totally Xbox *wink wink*""? cause I assure they do.

I do not see the games PC playerbase recovering after this. This was a shotgun blast to the head of PC players and I question if this is even legal outside of consumer-rightsless USA.",1692542190,1693940465,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Both killer and victim can cue with friends to work together which helps with the frustrations felt by other genre games that forces one person to work solo. Best part is if you do solo q it is still possible to get some kills or make an escape as you don't have to be dependent on your team.....but it does still help to have them. 

Atmosphere is especially excellent, similar to Friday the 13th. The game is an amazing recreation of the movies with its tone, maps, and those little attention to details that most devs gloss over. If you're a fan of the movies you'll definitely enjoy the work that went into getting the setting just right. 

A lot has been made for bug issues, balance, and cheaters- as someone who was around for DBD when it was in beta and in the first few years of its release the issues present in this game are nothing different than what that dev team went through. They have the benefit of 7 years of experience in the same game and have drastically hired on more help as the game grew in popularity. Most of the people complaining and comparing are doing so with a game that hasn't even been live for a month yet versus as game with 7 years experience. And most don't appear to have been around when that game was new.

But, despite all of that, it's an incredibly fun asymmetrical game, especially with friends, so you can coordinate together. Or at least it was, when I was allowed to play the game that I spent $40 on. The devs, despite knowing about the cheating problems well before launch due to them not even bothering to put anti-cheat into the PC Gamepass version, have decided that the solution is to segregate all PC players from the rest of the community. With the vast majority of Xbox players playing the game for free, this means that a massive percentage of those who actually PAID for the game--aka us suckers on Steam--just got removed from the pool. Now, not only can I not play this game with my Xbox friends, which was the only reason why I had bought it in the first place, but now if I want to play on my own I'm stuck in the cheater's corner where all the bad apples have been sectioned off to. And the hilarity of it all is that you can already turn cross-play off in the game's settings if you, as a player, want to shut out PC players because of the cheaters.

This is NOT an acceptable ""solution"" for devs to be making for problems of their own creation. They cut corners with PC Gamepass, listened to reports about the obvious consequences of that action, and then chose to ignore it completely. And on Xbox/PS, are things all sunshine and rainbows, now? Of course not. Even if you didn't play crossplay with PC friends, EVERYBODY regardless of platform is now stuck with significantly longer queue times. To make matters worse, this overly-aggressive quarantine comes in the same patch that will cause games to start with an imbalanced 3v3 lobby instead of simply waiting for a 7th, when the entire game is built and balanced around 3v4.

So, would I recommend this game? No; certainly not on Steam. Your queue times will be significantly longer than every other platform's, you won't be able to use the now falsely advertised cross-play to play with your friends, and you'll be treated like the cheater Gun thinks you are and thrown into the Salt Mines. If and when this change gets reverted--they said it will be, but game support hasn't inspired confidence thus far with this being their first real patch, if we're being honest--it'll still be a hard sell. The game has a ton of minor problems that add up to larger problems. The game is fun and has a great potential for growth, but if the first priority is to punish their paying customers instead of bothering to fix any of the actual problems, then it worries me that the game won't receive the necessary support and improvements that it needs. Friday the 13th was a skeleton crew shortly after launch, and despite this game only just coming out, Gun are already fumbling the ball.

And the icing on the cake is the meltdown that's currently happening on this game's official subreddit. Devs shouldn't run the subreddits for their own games, because it's incredibly difficult to prevent the bias that comes with sifting through the myriad of negative posts about something you had a hand in making. But they did it anyway, and now the subreddit is plagued with devs and community leads who have been attacking and lashing out at the community for their criticisms and displeasure at not only the lack of PUBLIC community interaction--because no, replying to a comment deep inside of a random reddit thread saying, ""We're working on it!"" isn't making a public statement about community issues. Not every criticism has been given with class and maturity, but it doesn't matter to Gun. If you say anything negative, you get threatened with a ban (if they don't ban you outright). And, if you question what you did wrong you're immediately kicked to the curb for, ""trolling."" This is incredibly unprofessional, and Gun should do better if they want to foster a positive community, rather than the antagonistic one that they've currently cultivated with their recent community responses and arguments.",1693932809,1693933259,False,1,0,0.500650227069854736,0,True,False,False

the phenomenal details re-implemented in this game: 

it captures all the art and tone of texas chainsaw massacre from where it began. 

it is fascinatingly immersive from the atmosphere, the music, the colors, the voice acting, the characters personalities and most importantly the objectives. (they're realistic based.)

it not only does a perfect job at introducing fear, anxiety, stress and panic in dire situations but also just in general while you're walking around since it's full of suspense. emotions of: ""how do i escape"" and most importantly ""will i escape?"" emerge and linger for the whole match.

the game in itself is really fun to play considering balance is all team based. meaning every single character in the match from killers to survivors is what creates the balance. do your part, be efficient in every choice that is made. and you'll survive. 

vice versa with the family. 
work together to stop those little survivors from escaping. every single moment counts.

this game mirrors the original movie so much that you know the developers poured all of their heart, blood, sweat and tears into this and no one can convince me otherwise. 

so cheers to the most amazing developer team out there. thank you so much for taking your time with this and welcoming a new horror game into our horror community.

I personally haven't seen the ""rampant cheating"" that others are talking about. Maybe it's taking place at higher ranks (I am level 19 atm) the game does seem to prefer to match you with players of similar rank so it isn't level 0 characters going against maxed out characters. 

Cheating is always going to be a thing in PvP games, this game atm doesn't seem any worse than other PvP games (It's certainly better than something like CoD Warzone) They are working on improving the anti-cheat with today's update so here's hoping they can keep it manageable

* Constant crashes due to invalid credentials.
* Server issues where the game servers crash.
* Environmental bugs that cause you to unable to interact with gaps / crawl spaces / doors.
* The biggest ice breaker is the amount of cheaters in the game and it hasn't been addressed sooner. It shows the lack of integrity the developers have for their game.

1. The devs are taking a very long time to fix some very minor issues. There has been an experience bug going on where you don't get the proper EXP after a match unless you watch the whole match. So if you escape within the first 2 minutes and the others take 10 more to escape you have to spectate the entire thing or you won't get EXP. This is a bug and it took them 3 weeks to fix. Along with other minor menu bugs, which should be solvable in 1 to 2 weeks, they're taking 3 whole weeks to fix minor issues. At this rate I am not sure how long it'll take for the game to become steady.

2. There are some cheaters on PC, no one really knows how much. Some say they encounter them almost every match, others say they encounter them 1/20 matches, so who knows. But the devs decided than instead of communicating and saying: ""We're on the problem, it might take a while but it's on our radar"" they've decided to remove crossplay from PC entirely. So if you have friends who are on another platform you can't play together right now. They're saying it's temporarily, but with how it took them 3 weeks to fix minor issues, I am really sceptical how long this'll take. 

If you REALLY want to play it and have other platforms available, I suggest buying it on series X and PS5, because the PC playerbase will from now on have long queue times and more matches with cheaters. 

Also: Don't buy it on PS4, it doesn't have crossplay with other platforms except for the Xbox One series and the playerbase on there is abysmal. 

Check the patch notes every now and then and bite the bullet when they've enabled crossplay again, but don't support the game right now.",1693899998,1693899998,False,8,1,0.539885401725769043,0,True,False,False

But now, they decided to quarantine the entire playerbase on PC. They are technically pushing their responsibility to contain cheaters to the users instead. This is one of the laziest decisions I've ever seen to combat cheaters.

And that's the best solution they could come up with after 3 weeks of silence? There are problems that are being constantly pointed out and they haven't done anything to alleviate them, let alone revealing their vision as to how to fix it. 
Connie was proven to be overpowered back in the technical test but she is still somehow untouched, Sissy slows down Victims to a snail's pace with her bugged basic attacks, Hitchhiker traps break Victims using ladders, chain stuns, Car Battery turned off at start (very inconvenient in Slaughterhouse for the Family), how the lobby waiting is much longer than the actual game itself, Grandpa cutscene forcibly stalling Leatherface's chainsaw, some Perks still not working properly, annoying skilltree system with RNG perks that dictate 30 minutes of rerolls, plenty of cheaters, and much more.

They already lost some of my trust when they couldn't promise even an approximate timeline for the first major patch during the first 2 weeks. Still, after getting to Level 27 on Gamepass I decided to buy in on Steam since the core gameplay, the biggest thing I care about, was fun. Starting from scratch again, I did hope the developers would get onto those aforementioned issues asap.
But no, they disabled crossplay and called it a day. What a response. Funny that the CEO of Gun Interactive praised the importance of PC Gamepass to keep the population steady, yet they forgot to add EAC to Gamepass version at launch, and their next update is to remove Gamepass and Steam from console crossplay.

This is an extremely well made Asymmetrical Horror game that feels pretty balanced once you learn the ropes for both sides. Each match has a lot of tension and suspense creeping around corners and through doors. It feels a bit disorienting at first especially in the basements but once you get a little familiar with the maps that goes away. 
My two and only complaints at the moment would be for progression and parties.
Progression feels a little bugged for me watching my level, perks and abilities gain XP at an inconsistent rate. First 10 levels seems to guy by rather quick but after about level 15 it just feels like it takes ages now. Not only that but sometimes the end results screen would show me leveling up an perk or ability but when looking at it, it's not the case and looks like it didn't budge a bit.
As for Parties as a Victim, if you escape or are sacrificed early into the match and it still being in progress afterwards the game forces you to disband the party. There is no option to return to the menu or search for the next match with the group staying together and has you either wait for the entire match to come to an end or exit to the menus and re-invite the group.

Apart from the big problem, issues do arise for playing Family, Victims with a brain could survive most encounters if they find a spot that includes walls to slide through, and with most people not using mics, can cause problems for chases and have to give up, even if they're near an exit, you won't even have a chance to get at-least a hit.

But oh my lord, are the devs an absolute joke... I paid this game to play with my friends cross-play, and these devs are such a joke at competence, they REMOVED cross-play, because they can't code an anti-cheat to save their lives...

So not only do they remove cross-play and force cheaters to play with PC Players only and stop us from playing with our friends, but they also had the absolute genius idea of allowing the game to start with only 6 players (2v4 or 3v3) instead of 7 players, which throw people of any which side at A HUGE DISADVANTAGE.

This game was fun on launch, but the developers are such an absolute joke its not even funny. A 4 year old would be much more competent at optimizing the game. 

Game is fun, devs are an absolute joke and do not deserve an ounce of support. They can't support and optimize their game for shit, absolutely taking the piss out of PC players.

So if you wanna support devs that are so incompetent they have to cut half the playerbase from interacting with each-other because they cant, to save their lives, make a competent anti cheat, then this is for you.

If you don't wanna support devs that are an absolute joke, do not buy this game right now. Devs will fuck you in the ass and leave you with a huge gaping asshole. Trust me.

First update we get and actual base features getting removed from the game PURELY because devs cant dev.

With the new 3v4 differing from the classic 1v4 we've all been accustomed too, this game is an experience that currently no other game offers. Personally, I can say that I have been hyped for this game since 2021 but I can't just be biased to the positive side of the game. As every game, Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes with it's fair share of Glitches and Bugs, and a new upcoming problem being cheaters. I do have to give credit where it is deserved such as the graphics and sounds being quite superb on release only needing a few tweaks here and there. However, the amount of Bugs and Glitches presented on launch were much higher than expected. One exception to this is most of the Bugs presented were server sided and may not have been able to be resolved before release. It is evident that the team is trying their best to fix these.
My overall evaluation of this game is that it brings a whole new type of play style. I think with regular updates and new content, this game will be a great success. If the developers don't act fast however, the games player count will continue to decrease and my rating will also.

- Killer spawn very close to victims.
- You only get visual clue when killer is very close to you.
- No on-hit sprint.
- No attack cool-down.
- Killer favor map (except Slaughter House).
- Full map wall hack.
- Victim only have 1 life, if you dead, game is over.

Besides, killers also have the following advantages by game design:
- Killer has ability to see map items. 
- Killer has 1 more perk (grandpa skill). So 3 killers have 3 more shared skills than victims.
- Killer has 1 more item slot, but victims only have 2.
- Killer only have 3 stats, victims have 5. But they all have ~30 skill points from leveling up.

All these things above made this game more like hide and seek. Because if you got spotted, you either being chase to death, or jump back to basement. Also designer might think basement is a safe place. But it's not. Sissy and Hittchiker can get thought obstacles as victims. If they storm the basement at the start of the game, victims is basically unable to get out. So the game play becomes very tedious after 10 hrs play. Most of the game victims escape because they did their best hiding, while their teammates are suffering. Lacking interactions between killer and victims. 

This game also don't allow dup characters, which is quiet annoying because I have to reset all the skill points when I switch from killer to victim. And because I only leveled 2 characters, I had to re-queue the game many times to play these characters.

The tutorial is also lacking. Some mechanisms can only be learned through public match, like how to unlock the lock. And many players don't know how to disarm traps, Hittchiker is kinda op right now because he can basically shut down 3 of 4 ways to escape (generator, fuse, car battery).

Random perks are also really annoying because you gonna reset skill points a lot of times to get the perks you want.

Also I got the following bugs:
- Can't interact as victim.
- Wrong exp shown to level up as player.
- Invisible victim, pretty hilarious.
- Skill points got reset for no reason.",1693240613,1693803023,False,1,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

To sum this game up, its a fun game to hop on with your friends and play killer together and cut the survivors off and work together, etc. However, depth of a chase, and creative options for combating the killer are not really there. There's even a killer (Leatherface) that you're going to consistently go against (because he is required for a match to start) who's sole role is to one shot you before you know whats going on.

However there is alot that needs fixed or addressed and I’m kinda surprised there is no news or information coming about future patches and nerfs. I am level 27 on pc and I’m level 24 on console. Some of the perks are not even working, you have to take them off and re add them to get the perk to work. That is huge because you are needing those perks to help plan your routes or counter the killers. Some of the killers need a nerf I think it’s obvious to everyone which ones lol.  The game also crashes a lot for this game having dedicated servers when someone backs out the whole game crashes which means you get nothing for the time you invested in the match. As a survivor I should be able to save my teammates also when there in a fight animation. The killers can instant kill the survivors and save there teammates would be nice to be able to save my teammates seems pretty fair. I think bubbas stamina should be effected a little more when he is running around revving his chainsaw to get the one hit kill. I don’t mind the one hit kill but because you can spam the buttons just right he doesn’t get tired. You don’t even need to spec into stamina with bubba because when revving the chainsaw it gives you max stamina. Bubba is my main so I understand how I can cheese him.. Sissy isn’t bad but sometimes when she hits you with her poison knife it will permanently effect you for the whole game. like you been poisoned but never wears off, ten mins later you’ll still have the effect going. Game over at that point because you can’t move straight again the whole match. There is a lot of positives on this game I’m just surprised there isn’t a update yet to fix a lot of this. People say grandpas blood fills too fast but idk I usually stab him I guess it’s all about the team you’re running with. If you hide in bushes and not helping loop the killers or get stuff done I can see that being a problem but is avoidable. Sometimes I don’t even try to get out I’ll have the killers chase me and I’ll take there time up so my teammates can get out and I’m stabbing the killers a ton it’s fun. Like I said I enjoy this game I just worry about the player base dropping. Players don’t stick around long anymore they’ll move on if they feel there isn’t anything new and no fixes to the game. Looking forward to this games future. This is just what I notice so far. On a side note…I think it be cool if the devs did a dlc someday with house of a 1000 corpses and devils rejects characters in this game. Just would seem pretty cool to bring some skins in and a few voicelines and I think this community would love that and go insane.

The only disadvantage is: For me its really hard to keep orientation on the huge maps. Would be very good to have some kind of overview of the landscape like in Diablo. Maybe this is already included in the game and I just didnt find it. Or maybe the devs will provide it via update.

The rest of the game is great. I played a lot Dead  By Daylight as killer. Here I can play a killer and be a part of a team. The difference? More fun!

Edit: Ok, I played the game for like 3 weeks now. There are some things that the devs could improve. 
1. Characters slam doors in their own faces when trying to close the door. 
2. Being directly at Grandpa does not mean you can feed him - you need to walk around him until the head-up message says that you can press ""E"" to feed him. 
3. Leatherface sometimes DIRECTLY hits victims with the chainsaw but the hits do not count for strange reasons 
4. Matchmaking: The ""familiy""-team proposed often does not include leatherface - this does not make any sense since you cannot start without leatherface. So either let the game be possible without leatherface or link him directly at the lobby to one of the players. 
5. Granda wakes up always from the victims ""noise"" only. Obviously he seems to be used to the sound of a chainsaw cutting through doors and obviously he can drink blood while sleeping - strange guy. 
6. Sometimes the maps are confusing and maze-like. The barriers and bounderies do not always seem very logik. 
7. The ""minigames"" are quite stupid, beause they consist of pressing the same button again and again only. 
8. Johnny seems a little bit weak. He cannot go through narrow passages or crawl through holes and his special ability seems to be of only minor use. 
9. The videos / tutorials should tell the ""family""-players what countermeasures are available - for example I still do not know how to close the pressure gate if it has been opened. I do not know how it is deciced who wins a 2-players-fight-minigame.
10. Scoring should have consequences. When all 4 victims escaped, it does not make much sense to show the same animation depicting leatherface dancing with his chainsaw. Maybe the police shooting leatherface would be more reflective. As I said: consequences.
11. Leatherface seems not to be able to go through doors which the cook secured with a paddle-lock. Instead leatherace needs to destroy the door with his chainsaw. I think the killer-skills should be synergistic and not conflicting.
12. The standard-audio setup makes the chainsaw super-loud. When I played leatherface I was not able to understand the voice chat. Needed to adjust this manualy.

I will explain why this game is just awful and no near close to for example Friday the 13th.

- The game relies on good team work especially if you play as the Killers for the surviviors it can be forgivable depends what for a team you go against. If you face high level victims its heavily survivor sided, there are already bully squads who just make fun of leatherface in the basemant there is no counter for it the loop design is very bad, you can endless loop Leatherface in the basemant, there are just way to much obstacles and obstacles you cant break so they can do them forever and you as the Killer/Leatherface cant do nothing, the best thing you can do is to leave the basemant to dont waste your time any longer. There are loops all around the map were some killers cant catch the victim you need a other killer to come by to help you, this is a good tactic for the surviviors get as much killers chasing you while the other surviviors doing the objectives. this chase design is very bad and no near competetive. So this casual game just gets frustrating and you cant speak of ""fun"" anymore like the developers describe this game ""just a game were you can have fun"" cleary they havent played it themselfs.

-Speaking of the bad loop design its actually worse than you think, you cannot punish a survivor if you catch him crawling trough an obstacle you cant damage him you cant pick him up etc. NO you have to wait till his crawling animation is over  you think you can now punish him now? nope he just will crawl back and even if you hit him he takes no damage no punishment most of the time doing that, you need to break these obstacles wich take about to 10-11 seconds and some you cant break, and thats it this is the chase design ladys and gentleman

-The surviviors can escape in less than 5 minutes of the game, you start in the  basemant of leatherface you bully him, you open the basemant doors, and from that point on you have many ways to escape from the Killers, be it from the outside gates, the valve gate, the fuse box to open the basemant exit, and for some of the exits the killers have no counter. if the Fuse box is repaired the only thing the killer can do is do boddy block the exit till the fuse box needs a repair again, the valve on one map its in the basemant wich is just a bad design, the surviviors can interrupt you closing the valve by putting a knive in your back, and you have to start the closing valve animation from the begin all progress lost...... 

For everyone who played Friday the 13th or is looking for a competetive game AVOID this one, this is a casual piece of garbage with huge balance issues, and the developers dont seem they are in a hurry when it comes to bug fixes and patches, overall a mediocre casual game.",1692568099,1693757566,False,3,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Family members can just rush down into the basement (Victim starting point) and chase you until you run out of stamina or they corner you.
On the other hand, as a family member, I've played several games where victims speed run the fuse box to open the basement exit within the first five minutes of the game starting. 
There's nothing enjoyable about a game where you either, A., can't leave the basement because all the family members decide to rush down there, or B., Don't see a single victim except when they escape through the basement exit at the speed of sound. 

Also, there's an in-game cut scene where Grandpa wakes up which halts the entire game; whether victim or family member, any action that's currently in progress will be put to a dead stop. All except for Leatherface when he is revving his chainsaw. If you are revving the chain saw and someone makes a loud noise and wakes up grandpa, causing the cut scene to trigger, you are forced to rev the chain saw to its stalling point which then forces you, the player, to have to sit through an animation of Leatherface being frustrated which is equally frustrating to the player especially when you're in the middle of a victim chase.

You'll have 'feels' for this poor, misbegotten man struggling to cope with the rigors of daily life and the challenges he must face to overcome such obstacles (Damn you!!! Fur covered pallets, and Leland, you shoulder ramming piece of s***!). No joke though, this game is more than on par with Friday the 13th (before it went tits up) and Predator: Hunting Grounds. Keep up the good work GUN, and please make more franchise-based games! (Nightmare on Elm Street?...Hellraiser?...please and thank you ;] ) 

P.S. Sissy fine as hell!!!! She may be cray-cray, but you know want some of that vanilla pudding! Also, Johnny's an a**hole but he's fine too.

This is incredibly disappointing and quite frustrating, especially since it's been two weeks since release, and there are a multitude of critical errors that impede my satisfaction with my purchase.

Every three games, something goes wrong that causes me to leave a match. Whether it's desync (I've lost several family games because either myself or one of the other players fall into a connection void), not finding a seventh player to start the match, or the game gives up on itself and causes some irreversible problem that can only be remedied by leaving (getting stuck in the overhead menu while playing a match because the cursor wouldn't go away after fixing the fuse), something goes wrong and it rips be me out of the experience. 

List of bad design choices (fuck you, Wes). 
1. Seeing the family selection at the match menu screen and in the player connection screen (tab).
2. Bloodrushing.
3. Leveling up (every match feels inconsequential after player level 10 because I'm not directly working towards anything big, and what I am working towards crawls at a snail's pace). 
4. Giving Johnny the worst power in the game. 
5. Giving Sissy the best power in the game, and then overpowering her so it's almost impossible to escape her (it would make more sense if you could just switch her power with Johnny's power, so that she can still be the insane rush-down force that she is, while Johnny can walk around and trap stuff). 
6. Designing certain parts of the maps (slaughterhouse, in particular) so that any family other than hitchhiker/sissy can't play. 
7. Developing a game that relies on communication, and then developing no way to communicate other than mic. This game is nearly unplayable without a party because everybody has sponge for brains when they don't communicate. 
8. Leaving future content in the files so people can datamine it and leak it. 
9. Not allowing leatherface to break wall crawl spaces, or allowing Johnny/cook/anybody to stick nails in the wall to damage survivors as they slip through them. 
10. Having crossplay but not designing a friend system database where you can meet people in lobbies and party up with them/friend them. Five stars for making the only way to party up with people you meet in lobbies by keeping the shit-digit code from the main menu on hand to recite over microphone at the end of the match before the timer runs out, or before I accidentally hit a button (specific, but tedious). 
11. Maxing character levels out at 10. In the scheme of the game, I suppose it makes sense, but it still feels stupid to have such a low ceiling for your skill tree, which becomes static and unusable after you max it out, lest you wish to respec everything and reroll the few perks you might have gotten lucky with. 
12. Cosmetics and unlockables aren't earned, they're given to you after playing a certain amount of games with a single character. Super stupid system. Even if most of them are just recolors, it would have been better to tie all the outfits to a certain achievement or feat to make them feel won, not gifted.
13. Cutscenes. At first they were charming, but that honeymoon didn't last more than a week. They're not extremely annoying, but I wouldn't mind a skip button, even if they're supposed to cinematically tie into the gameplay. 

Go play this on gamepass with your friends. 










[strike] I suppose after a few days if gameplay, I should probably air what I enjoy about the game, because it truly does outweigh the negatives in terms of entertainment and enjoyment.

1. The core gameplay loop is fun and sporadic. You really don’t know what will happen once you open the door to the basement for the first time, leaving a whole world of possibility in the few minutes you manage to stay alive, which I enjoy.

This is more or less the same objective concept they brought over from Friday, where the game’s outcome is dictated by what essential object you find first, and that’s always a pleasure. The only thing that gels poorly with this design is the easily memorable battery/gas escapes, which are both somewhat difficult to pull off if the family happens to be orbiting it, but always spawn in the same place with the same requirements, whereas the fuse/valve escapes spawn randomly with requirements that are harder to find. 

2. Chases are dynamic and usually escapable, with multiple victims being able to chase and survive, but at a heavy cost. This interplays great with the well/basement system, where you can slip away from the family after a tense battle with them, while not being overly punishing to the killers if they do happen to squeeze past. 

3. Objectives are quite fun, with a neat variety for the victims and a decent secondary objective for the family. 

[more thoughts later]

Day one impressions are pretty high strung, but there are some things that require serious consideration. 

1. In game party system needs to be improved. Maybe create your own friends list system for the game, I don't care. I've met several people I wish to party with after I've completed a match and have been unable to contact them post game. 

As of right now, partying with people you meet in game requires a great deal of foresight, seeing as you have to make a party at the main menu and must write the party code down somewhere so you can share it post game, which is extremely tedious and frankly should not even be an issue. 

2. Skill tree ceiling is too low. Maxing a character out at level 10 is insane and happens incredibly quickly. I understand it may be there because we're not supposed to only play one character, but it feels extremely shallow and makes the skill tree seem incredibly half baked, almost as if it was still in beta.

Dead by Daylight's Bloodweb system encourages extreme replayability with its max prestige level cap of 100 and rewards the player well after they would have completed a character's conventional use, something I believe this game is missing.  

3. General perk leveling seems slow, which wouldn't be such a problem if I still had things to unlock in the skill tree, which I no longer have. Unlocking skill tree tokens felt more rapid in the early game, but after you hit player level 10/11, the skill tokens dry up on a per character basis, which is somewhat unfortunate. 
Edit: SP does indeed dry up and leveling other characters is almost impossible and I feel the game is wasting my time. 

4. In my experience, Cook and Johnny are incredibly underpowered and don't really deserve the time investment leveling them would offer. Both their powers, while great in concept, have the weakest execution. 

The cook's hearing should broadcast the location of a victim to the whole team, and Johnny's power should pick up and follow scents without having to look for the easy to miss footprint.

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The game is heavily sided with the victims, too many cracks and walls and hiding spots and wells and all this crap that just became annoying.

However, the draw back is where are they going to go with content, sure they can add new killers and survivors but that rings a bell in another title in this genre. They have been given permission to add things to the game, but it must be within the lore of the TCSM, leaving minimal content within the quality of life of the game. 

I enjoy survivor and killer, I have more fun playing as bubba! Though sometimes it feels that Sissy can be a bit broken within SPECIFIC perks that allows her to do extra damage, with the amount of times she can swing. She can constantly hit you making you stumble and kill you relatively quickly if you are caught in a bad spot, even then in good spots with exits I have been locked in the stumble animation as she continuously hits me leaving me stuck to even escape.

Since this is day 2 there are several bugs that can cause major distributions, I have found 
myself getting stuck on the environment as the killer quite often and even had a game where I was stuck for the entire game and unable to move after hitting a wall from missing a survivor.

Also I found survivors shutting doors in front of a killer can sometimes vacuum a killer when on the opposite side thus getting a free kill or hit.

Finally, there are server issues that are causing people to disconnect mid-game, kicking people out of lobbies/ making you unable to join lobbies - A quick reboot of the game fixes it, but this should be patched within the week :). Overall I will give this game a 7/10, it's not going to overthrow DBD as they are both different games with their own unique objectives/ playstyles.

Servers are also all over the place you get put in every region which sometimes causes you to be kicked out because of high ping. There is also an out of the map glitch that can occur has heppened to me aswell when i went down a well and got teleported outside of the map for a free escape. but you have people that can keep the game hostage now if they have that happen.

Design of the maps are extremely accurate to the film and you can see that great detail went into the overall themes. 

Con: 
QOL Changes: The party must be remade after leaving a game, unless you stay and watch the final person surviving or dying to the end. 

The EXP system is pretty terrible. You have to share skill points between family and victims which can really lock you into one role. As you progressively level up, there is a sharp curve and it feels hard to fully level more than one character in either given role. This is a problem since the lobbies will often stick you in a match where other people are already your ""best character"". Meaning you go into the match at a severe disadvantage.

Overall: I enjoy playing the game but it will need some balancing to remain fun.",1692864647,1693648058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cut scenes for the family take way too long it feels like the victims have a lot more advantages and that it is easier for them to escape than for the family to actually have a chance to get them. Everything for the family members takes way too long, setting traps, collecting blood, checking hiding spots all so long and theatrical for no reason. No one wants to play as leather face he is slow and clunky so if you are trying to build another character its hard to start matches because someone HAS to be leather face in order for the game to start and a lot of people refuse to be him. Also no one readies up so you're sitting in the lobby for a full 2 min before the matches start, lots of fighting over characters, shutting doors and gates has also been glitchy. Chasing victims is super frustrating too even if they are bleeding and sliced up you still won't be able to catch up to them and if you do your stamina is gone and cant even attempt a kill. Like it is the families property but there are so many advantages for the victims on the maps and not many for the family like they can pretty much lock doors and and unless you are able to miraculously level up the character you like their abilities can be kind of useless for certain characters. The game can be fun if you are playing with a party I don't think it would be that fun playing by yourself. Outside of parties there is zero communication between the players on either side.

The game was fun until people figured out ways to exploit it.

The maps are unbalanced. 
(Godloops, free escapes)

The skill tree system is tedious and forces you to Main characters or respect points over and over in order to try builds out.

5 minute queue times or longer for a 2-3 minute game. (matchmaking really needs work)

Plagued with people leaving game causing you to lose exp and waist your time just to queue for another 5 minutes.

Broken Meta builds that make things very boring for both sides.

Bugs that make you have to close the game every 3-4 games; 

Getting stuck in stairs, ladders, and wells only to be ""kicked for idling.""

People exploiting cook and not playing the game in order to milk exp.

Stun exploiting

I could prolly name off another 10-30 things that make the game hard to enjoy.

I want to enjoy this game but it takes the wind out of your sails after 1-2 games and leaves me frustrated.

I love the feel to this game as it makes you feel like your really in a movie. It will make you feel on edge constantly because a family member can be lurking around without you even knowing it. I play family mostly and this is what I've noticed and experienced so far. The opening cutscene needs to be only for leatherface because the victims just spam the button to get out the restraints because there is really no penalty. By the time I can actually control my character they've already escaped the basement because of Connie and her focus ability. Instead of nerfing characters just make it to where there is a small chance to get a lockpick instead of one automatically. The game needs to be slowed down because it is designed for you to survive and escape, not to speed run it. I've also been glitched into walls after executing someone that has squeezed through a crack. I've also experienced people vacuuming to the top of the map after jumping down the well. How to do that is you have to be hitchhiker and you place traps at the top of ladders. Then when someone goes to jump down a well you hit them as they're going down. The developers say they want the family to be overpowered and have complete control, but here as of late I'm getting bullied by people knocking me down with wooden doors and then stabbing me in the back when I stand up. It's just way too easy for people to escape. There should just be one fuse and one valve. If you put the valve on or the fuse in you should be able to take them out or off and they should respawn back. Reason for that is because people like to just sit in the basement and send just one person up to do the fuse box and then everyone is out. The slaughter house map i just completely avoid at all cost. That map is heavily victim sided. It's too big of a map, and I can't prepare for it because of that stupid cutscene with grandpa. If you don't play as hitchhiker and cook for that map you've pretty much let everyone escape. The overall gameplay is nice, I love the way it feels when I hit someone, and I was expecting it to be clunky as family but it's super smooth with no frame drops or tears and I have everything on ultra. There needs to be another map or better rotation because I've gotten slaughterhouse 10 games in a row. I hate how it goes from day  to night then it switches the map and it does it again. I just hope they don't abandon the game like Friday the 13th because I finally found a game I love and can constantly play all day.",1693587887,1693587887,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Cook is required unless its Slaughterhouse where its just better for Family to dodge the lobby and hopefully get the other 2 maps. Sissy is stupid with her attacks forcing you to turn into her meaning she can 100-0 the tankiest of characters. Connie soloing the entire game because she makes any lock instantly finish and any victim player being able to stunlock family members to oblivion.

Most notably, this game is 3v4 instead of 1v4- so you have 3 killers and 4 survivors. The maps are bigger and there are multiple ways to escape from each map.

You can level up specific stats of your character, causing a killer to do more damage on each attack for instance. As they don't have to hook someone several times inbefore they die, but they can actually just kill someone with their attacks, the game requires a lot more stealth gameplay than Dead by Daylight does.

shared xp for all characters like in dbd

But even if I say that, lets go over some things I find a bit janky.
First, the leveling up.
It takes a LONG time after a couple levels to start gaining levels and EXP.
Seems like an MMORPG amount of effort is needed.
Luckily you can just refund all the points on a character infinitely but the bad thing is your random perks get re-rolled AND that has to be done either in the main menu OR hope to god no one has picked that character cause otherwise you wont be able to do so.

Oh and after you've unlocked all the routes?
You have to manually click everything again manually and go through the painfully slow animations instead of being able to click somewhere in the tree and hold so it picks everything in the way to that point like DBD's blood web nowadays.

As for the gameplay?
Some stuff is janky.
The prompt to backstab a killer appears, I can spam the shit out of the prompt and it wont do anything half the time.
If you are in the middle of doing something and grandpa cutscene starts, you will sometimes be STUCK doing it and cant cancel it.
Example: Was revving chainsaw and grandpa cutscene plays.
I am stuck infinitely revving chainsaw effectively overheating it constantly as I can't stop revving until I hit someone for whatever reason.

The tutorials could have been just text instead of videos and they are very barebones to teach who can do what.
Sissy is the only killer I am having an issue with and that seems to be a majority consensus that she needs to be toned down slightly.
She's the only killer who you cannot effectively escape PAR Bubba's powerslam and then normal attack combo IF they don't overheat from the slam.
But sissy literally sticks to you like a camper in DBD where your only escape hope is if theres a wall that you can go through, a well or a tiny crawlspace which btw she can go through or leave poison at and effectively chase you and kill you cause there's no way to escape PAR fighting her with a bone scrap which btw if any other killer shows up is an instant death for you even if you win the struggle as you are STILL stuck in the animation making the struggle worthless.

Oh and you can't save people being executed.
If that animation starts they are dead no matter what.
I could understand Leather being uninterruptable since he shoves a chainsaw in you.
But the rest could either get stunned and give a 10 second-20 second grace period for the nearly executed survivor to run to get health IF someone manages to stab them or leland tackles them.

Apart from this, I don't see many issues.
Just needs more map variety and the ability to choose which primary ability a character has.
No, I don't mean that everyone picks the same primary, it would be a system where you have a choice between 10 abilities, if someone picks one of them it's locked so you have 9 other choices.
This would eliminate SOMe of the ''Oh I can't get connie or leland? RAGE QUIT!''

As for the killer side thing where they need leatherface?
Make it a system that after playing leather you get to play any of the other family members for 2 games.
Then it's back to leather.
If you end up in a lobby with others who are supposed to play leather, it chooses the one who has played leather the least to play Leather.

That's my personal few cents.

I love slasher films but have never been able to get into these types of games, which is honestly shocking because The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been on my Wishlist for over a year, so I've been looking forward to it, but never had any real hope. It was until the game began trending on Twitter for two days when I saw it had some actual potential. 

Let me start by saying, playing as the Family is fun, and playing as the victims is scary. 

The family is very unique in what sort of skills you posses with each player. For example, Leatherface is the most powerful character, but mechanically, he can be very challenging to use. He can kill an enemy on one hit, if timed correctly, or will continuously swing and waste energy on a player too fast for you. He levels up pretty good and if you can narrow down his chainsaw ability you're in for a killing spree. The Hitcher is my second favorite character, for his speed and traps -- he is considerably weak, but can pull off multiple hits on a player in seconds. The same goes for Sissy, who has an ability to poison players and objects. 

The victims are the most challenging to play as. The game suddenly goes from a super-energetic hunt to a terrifying game of hide and seek. You start off in the basement, with Leatherface of all people, and it can be very unnerving to hear him killing team-mates in the halls below, as you hear them scream and his chainsaw rev, all the while he makes these grunting sounds and shouts, like a gorilla, making it very disturbing. It is extremely challenging, Leatherface will scare you out of the basement for the players upstairs to take care of you. 

And that's where it gets hard.

There's a lot to enjoy with this game and I am merely scraping the surface. Everything you have heard about it is probably true. The matches are quick, its cross-platform, good graphics, great level design, a good progression system, crazy abilities to purchase, a detection system A.K.A. ""Grandpa"", which is amazing, and totally enjoyable. I highly recommend the game, my hope is they include CHOPTOP in the future AND the Abandoned Amusement Park from TCM 2 as one of the environments. Well? What are you doing.

Go and give it a shot!",1693534490,1693534657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So far, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is off to a really solid start, with a considerable variety in characters and their abilities, and keeping survivors on their toes.

EDIT: Okay, it was definitely recency bias. While I still highly recommend the game, you definitely are going to find folks who aren't using their abilities to stay alive, but to troll. Stay vigilant of survivors that don't keep running when they're next to doors, or anyone playing as Leland, because he's definitely going to abuse his shoulder charge instead of using it to get out of a pinch.

And while this may change as more people figure out the inner workings, this game actually feels like a slasher movie compared to other games of its kind feeling more like episodes of Tom and Jerry (DBD and Ft13th in particular). This isn't to say the other games didn't have their moments, but it can be frustrating when the overall thought behind playing it is ""Will this be a good game or not?"" And I must stress that doesn't mean ""Will I win the game or not?"" It's very possible to have a great game and still lose, but poor sportsmanship is usually the key reason for such issues. I'm not entirely sure how to explain it being the case for TCM, but there's not really any major issues I've had where players are exploiting specific aspects that can potentially ruin the game.

It also says something that I'm legitimately still having a good time when I mess up and either lose a survivor or get killed. Again, I'm not sure what's different about this case compared to others, but even with a revved chainsaw going through my chest, I still get more of a ""better luck next time"" feeling from a TCM game over a ""lol uninstall you loser"" feeling from losing a DBD game.

In any case, the biggest thing Gun Media does need to work on once most of the technical kinks are worked out, is to add more content. This game definitely has way more potential in comparison to the other potential DBD rivals I've seen, but more content is definitely needed to keep it alive, just as DBD does. How Gun Media will do this when they only have rights to the original movie is anyone's guess, but we'll have to wait and see.",1692928750,1693529729,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

As someone that bought Friday the 13th on release, I feel a lot of nostalgia from that. This game is really fun honestly. I really appreciate the diversity between all the different survivors and family members. Each survivor has different things they are really good at. For example, Leland is one of my favourites as he has the ability to fight back against the family in ways the others don't. Others are good at tanking more hits, picking locks faster, etc. There is something for everyone. As for the family, *holy shit I appreciate being able to queue up into family matches with friends*. It's so much fun. They are all really fun to play, my personal favourites being Johnny and Leatherface himself who are very good at outputting lots of damage 

Honestly, if you want a fun game to play with friends, I highly recommend. Up to 4 on the survivor side, and 3 for the family members. If you like survival horror, this is a good way to go

Also, no micro-transactions! Everything can be grinded for, which is a huge plus in my eyes. Also no battle pass or anything. Play as little or as much as you want!",1693525170,1693525170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Each survivor has their niche perks, one of them being able to break locks instantly.

This was even the case the first couple days of release, most matches felt good to play. Unfortunately, now that most players have access to non-default perks (unlike in the technical tests), and have those perks leveled (also unlike the technical tests), matches are all now a race to the finish, with many of my games only lasting a few minutes. It used to be fun finding the right balance between setting up, looking for Victims, and feeding Grandpa, but now there's no reason to feed Grandpa, since Victims with the Agitator perk can remove up to 4 of his levels, setting him back to 0 from all but the highest level.

Escapes can happen *so* quickly, in fact, that there's almost no reason to do anything except sit on and patrol objectives and wait for Victims to show up. Victims can have the door open within seconds of the Family actually beginning to play (since they have a head start), and from there it can spiral out of control very quickly.

None of this is to mention that once you hit account level 10, leveling slows to a crawl; especially if you play Family, since they earn a fraction of the exp that Victims do. Overall, the game is currently an exercise in frustration as Family. Last time I played, four of my matches (in a row) lasted under 3 minuntes, with at least three Victims rushing particular escapes. It's possible that these quick escapes are anomalous, but it happens to me often enough that it's such a pain point that I haven't bothered launching the game in days. When (or if) I actually get back to playing the game, it'll be after some significant balance changes hit, and I'm unlikely to play Family again unless the game slows down significantly.",1693509303,1693509303,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

My level get set back to 22 and the new skill points go back to what I originally had before. 

Compared to other games like Dead by daylight this game is super fresh and fun to play and most of the time pretty balanced, but not being able to progress you characters on the family or victim side while others seem to not have this issue is very annoying, cause everyone else gets the better perks and skills leveled up.

Until this issue is resolved I will not be playing the game anymore, because if there is a progression system that doesn't work, then what am i playing for exactly, yes just playing the game for playing sake is  an option but when everyone around you is getting meta builds and becoming stronger it just really makes it feel like you are wasting your time.",1693489989,1693489989,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is absolutely fun, especially with friends, but it struggles in many critical areas.

With the same gameplay loop with each objective always being in the same place, no possibility to change keybinds, a struggle minigame that is practically impossible to win as a killer unless you want to destroy your finger, an exit which is practically a guarantee for survivors to escape through (fuse box) and a level system that locks you from creating the build that you'd like, I simply can not recommend the game.  Furthermore, it's difficult to see how the game can provide new content in the future since they only got the rights to the 1973 movie. 

I believe that by addressing the issues above and finding a reliable way to provide new content and battle toxicity, this game can live for a long time. Without that, I think it might suffer the same fate as others within the genre.

They have ALREADY released DLC that costs 6.99 USD for just content that should be included in the base game. This is going to be just another F13th game that dies in a year or two. ( Probably less if nothing is done to patch or fix the multitude of issues this game has. ) This is a game that has to be constantly patched and balanced for it to be fun and remain fun to play. Right now, it gets boring pretty quickly. I've already stopped playing it and moved back to previous games. It plays the same no matter who is the killer or who is the victim. Its lacking maps, killers are overpowered. Things that should be exclusive to victims such as traversing through crawl spaces are now usable by killers. It's just not fun. I have 34 hours and i'm already incredibly bored with it. It might be fun with some friends for a few hours but there is no replayability in this game. Play killer, kill victims, get bored. Play victim, die because of broken game mechanics, get bored. Save yourself 40$ and wait for a little while to see if this game is ever getting updated.",1693164232,1693456986,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember watching the film in theaters when i was a teenager. I am now a single father to my son, who is now 17. My son recently downloaded The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and in less than a week, he had already played for over 50 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his autistic friend Mitchell playing catch, or just watching dance videos on TikTok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but the menu was really bad, i eventually figured out how to join his party. I asked my son for help and he put me into a ""family"" game. I loved it, as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. We were calling everyone on the victim team racial slurs after the game ended, together as father and son. Just like the family in-game, this experience brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house finding unsuspecting victims and making there heads into head cheese! (we even use the jowls).

To briefly sum up the game, the player chooses between The Family (Antagonists) or Victims (Protagonists). The goal of The Family is to make sure all exit points are secure, closed, locked, collect blood, feed that precious blood to Grandpa (Grandpa, is that you? What do you think of the house and the silvery moon? We're going to repaint the front door soon!), and ultimately kill the Victims. The Victims, in contrast, start the match kidnapped and tied up in a dungeon deep beneath a the house of a family of cannibals, and must find their way out via sneaking around, rummaging through tool kits for lock picks, creeping into hiding spots, stabbing chickens with crude bone knives, and if lucky, managing to open an exit gate escaping. There are perks, or skills available for both The Family and Victims, which can take a considerable amount of play to unlock and level; especially in being that you must unlock and level each skill separately for each character. The graphics are insanely good for this game, and the developers certainly didn't cut corners on this aspect of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. As a long player of Dead By Daylight, I can honestly saw that Texas has better graphics than DBD. How would you say, Texas is more realistic, while DBD is comic bookish. There is a bountiful amount of blood, violence and gore, so if that offends you or sickens you, this may not be the game for you. Now as for some minor criticisms on the game. The loading screens are very simplistic. You cannot rotate a character's ""cosmetic,"" at least not to my knowledge, Prior to a match you simply see small portraits of which characters were picked. There is also a lack of cosmetics or skins in general. The Cook only has one skin. Leatherface only has 3. Most survivors have a good amount of skins, but they are just different colors. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre developers and owners could have already made a fortune off selling skins, and I wonder why they didn't take advantage of this. Interacting with objects in the game can be somewhat frustrating at times. For example, when feeding Grandpa you have to be exactly to his right side, and just this perfect angle, or the animation and process of feeding him his meal won't start. This also applies to blood buckets, as you must be at the correct spot in front of it to utilize it, and must hold the button ""X"" down just right. If I were developers I would have fixed these issues, that is, I would make it so you could feed Grandpa from any side of him, or at least initiate the process and animation as such. Another annoying aspect of the game from The Family's perspective is that when Victims make a lot of noise and their position is highlighted in red, as far as I am aware you do not get a sound notification, so it's easy to miss out on this. I must admit that the game ""pausing"" and showing a full animation for ""Grandpa just woke up,"" or ""Grandpa has reached level 2,"" etc is rather annoying. And while the entire game appears to ""pause"" during this, it doesn't really pause at all, and as Leatherface your chainsaw might overheat during this duration where you cannot control your character. As survivors sometimes it feels like The Family can see you no matter what and just comes straight for you and kills you, even in the very beginning of the match. I am not sure exactly which skill that is, but you are a goner for sure if they are using it. All in all, the game is very basic, and if you like it, and keep playing it, you're possibly into Horror Films (like I am), especially old 70's and 80's ones. This game is also a ""Hide And Go Seek,"" so if you were into playing that as a child at recess then this game is for you (I always loved Hide And Go Seek / Chase on the playground and was the best, seriously). Last but not least, Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a great game to play if you want an adrenaline rush, because it will deliver just that. This is the main reason anyone would truly be playing this game, and that adrenaline rush works best if you play as a Victim. I must admit that playing as The Family isn't as much of a rush, but still has it's charms.",1693416163,1693416163,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some maps are literal puzzles with cryptic areas where you can get lost and never find the right door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGpltS9zj2A
Map rotation makes it so you can't really learn a map with real players.
Survivors are incredibly hard to find, you have to use your family skills but the problem is that the family is very slow to wind up so if the survivors know the map, are on discord, they just beeline for the exit and there is nothing you can do.
Progression is very limited to the point where luck is the main factor of the game.

Basically, the main enemy of the family is the darkness, the cryptic levels and the stupid level design where up to 50% of the map is not used for anything but can be used to loop the family.
There are too many dead ends where you get stuck but the survivors have holes to escape.

In essence it's like DBD where survivors are massivly favoured except you can't get great builds since it follows a strict scheme:
1) basement is leatherface domanin, it has to play well
2) house/grandpa, this player has 1-2 minutes to prepare
3)outside/yard, basically blood and activating something
This game will be heavily tilted for the survivors like all similar games are so the family/monster playerbase will be massivly reduced.

In essence, they need to adress the balance very fast. But enjoy the game for a week, then all the youtubers will make S tier, mega good, tips, guide, op, AMAZING, ESCAPE ALL THE TIME builds and will show some routes that are very hard to defend:)

A match can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes
Game has many cheaters now, definetly don't buy until the devs implement anticheat
Literally unplayable because of cheaters,everyone rushes at the start to wake up grandpa and the killers dont have time to do anything. even the survivors end up running like headless chickens.

The Family is way OP. And to make it worse, its only tryhards that play the Family. This game lacks balance. It got a 6/10 on IGN, deservedly so. Maps are wonky, family is op, victims cant run. The game is just a waste of time that... unless you're a try hard and only ever play the family because they are op and easy.

Also, since day 1 I have been having issues with mic and text chat in the game. As in mic and txt does not work, AT ALL, not matter what I do. So, no communication with the other players whatsoever. No txt, no mic.

Also a few more things: 

I cannot create a party. I get a network error msg. 

And 3 Family vs 1or2 victims, how tf are they supposed to escape? Because after people start dying, you quickly go from 4 to 1 victim alive with zero hope of escape. Might as well quit. 

And now lets talk about the character swap request spamming. It has GOT TO STOP. I'm sick of tryhards in a group and one of them wants to chick I have, so they'll spam the request over and over and over (ad ad nauseam) while I'm in the customization menus. Ill purposefully not ready up when they do that, then quit as soon as the round starts. Now they're down one player at the top of the round.

* In lobby time reduced.
* The fuse box should be changed to only be active once two fuses are used.
*If the valve mechanic is closed by family, it should get broken again, and victims should use the item to repair it once more.
*Johnny Demage reduction 3 hits, and the victim is dead. way too strong.
*The sissy poison effect reduced, and stamina consumption increased.
*Leatherface's powered attack is an ensured one-shot death, as it is a great tool. He recovers too fast after hitting, so the victim doesn't have a chance to survive. The recovery time for leather faces should be increased.
* Cook's ability cost should be much greater if he detects a victim.
* Hitchhiker areas where you can place traps near ladders, generator batteries, and fuse boxes are way too close to objects. You climb a ladder and step into a trap without even having a chance to disarm it. Family members not getting impaled with traps is also bad; there should be a downside to this so that trap placements could be more thoughtful and tactical.
* As for victims, major changes to the kit are not needed; they just feel strong because of easy mechanics like a fuse box or valve exit.

* A close encounter should be reworked. It is a fun mechanic, but being struck by another family member instantly executes you. I think it should be changed only to interrupt the close encounter rather than kill a victim.
* Family health bars added: while there is close encounter and sneak attack, it does not feel very effective. The downsides for family members are very low and do not impose any threat, but with added health bars, it would open several things, such as: family members would need to make a choice between healing themselves with blood or feeding Grampa; it would also add a risk if being attacked several times and not healing family members would receive great debuffs like reduced running speed, reduced attack damage, As for victims, it would be very fun to build and play, and it would elevate whole sneak and close encounters.

I can't wait to see what else is in store for this game. Family members, victims, maybe a whole new family, and victims more maps. A game has a lot of potential in this type of genre, and it can only get better.",1692614109,1693387151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game concept is great and fitting of the movies (good job developers). 

Now, only something I stumbled upon while watching some YouTube late at night. It was dark (no, not really) and stormy (again, not, just kidding), but there was a YouTube streamer with 30 subs who claimed to be ""Using Hacks & Cheats to Troll Players in Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Trolling as a Developer using HACKS & CHEATS in Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which caught my eye. Scary stuff (although, watching it was more like a horrible rom-com with oneself) was seen: blip-ping and blooping, flying around, and... CLAIMING TO BE A DEVELOPER multiple times. They really did all of these things and more (like whined when their cheats didn't work). Amazing.

One annoying thing i will say is, due to the lack of characters, and not being able to pick duplicate characters, it can be a bit frustrating getting into a lobby and being able to play the character you want with how the progression system works.

5 family members and 5 victims at the time of posting this review, which only leaves 1 unpicked victim and 2 unpicked family members. 3 of the victims are pretty highly contested mixed with NEEDING a leather face in every game (which makes sense), makes most lobbies turn into people leaving non stop if their character is picked.

I can imagine this problem will sort of balance itself out later on as you level up and earn more talent points for your characters,  I'm currently level 18 and have enough talents to have 2 maxed out characters (1 family member and 1 victim) but like i said earlier, most lobbies end up with my character being picked and me asking for a swap, which people usually decline, or leaving, which doesn't feel great either..

Hopefully more characters and maps come in the future. The gameplay loop is pretty satisfying especially as a victim pulling off a clutch escape, just lacks a bit of variety in terms of characters and maps.",1693377918,1693378023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game right now is really solid, an online multiplayer game where you hop in and out of matches over and over. It definitely isn't perfect and has much to be improved upon but knowing this game will continue to get support and more content over time is really nice to see.

As of the time I'm currently writing, it does feel like grinding to get experience can get difficult in stagnant, rights to every other movie is currently in hell meaning all the family characters we're gonna get he on out are brand new just for this game. I hope this eventually gets somewhat resolved because it would massively open the games for characters, maps, cosmetics, and much more. Imagining a timeline where this game never gets to the rights to any of the movies is kind of worrying. Imagine if the friday the 13th game only had the rights to one film.

Definitely not as bad as Dead by Daylight's cooldowns, but theres so many moments where characters animations will just be them doing nothing for a bit?? and i HATE IT. I hope they at least add some perks to make certain animations faster. Also Bubba just needs his sped up by default all of his animations take forever and he cant do anything and everyone hates playing as him, its like playing spin the bottle on who has to play this character because honestly nobody wants to. Bubba's skill tree should be much bigger than it currently is considering he is MANDATORY for every single match and doesn't have much variety in his gameplay. Hopefully this will be resolved over time.

I think it's dumb that you don't level up each character individually.  Instead you respec your skilltree and transfer those to one character.  It's weird and dumb.  When they should get people to use each character.  NOPE just spend on one character and never use the others.

So then you have people wanting to swap characters with you.  OH NOW WHAT!  I hate this person.

I was able to participate in the tech test earlier this year and absolutely loved the quality of the game. When the game launched earlier this month it more than met my expectations! The sound effects are awesome! The maps look really detailed and realistic. Not only that, but the maps also pay a really good tribute to the original TCM movie! I love the time and effort that went into making the maps align with the lore of the story. The gameplay itself is extremely fun, and despite only have a few maps I feel as though no two games are really the same. I am really happy with the quality of this game. There were a few bugs on launch which is always to be expected with a new game, but despite the bugs it was not enough to deter me from playing the game. In fact, one of the more irritating bugs was actually patched already! As soon as they work out some of the other bugs in the game, I believe it will be even more enjoyable to play. I look forward to seeing where they take this game...if they had even more new characters that fit the aesthetic of the game or new maps. I am interested to see if they launch new kill animations as well! 

As a note: I have played both survivor and killer on this game and I find it to be fun on both sides! I think it is fairly decently balanced..especially for a new game :)",1693325746,1693325820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game brings fresh air into this franchise and it makes a lot of fun, until you meet a group with 3 premade killers.
In my opinion this game is to much killer sided. In my like 80 Killer games i never feeld like the Survs have great chances to survive if i cooperate with my team mates. All 3 Maps are build like you can camp the Gen/Batterie exit without victims can open it up while the 3th killer is looking for basement options. If you have a sissy in your team its so easy cause she can feed grandpa to lvl 5 in like 3 minutes so that every surviver is exposed all 20 seconds which makes it kinda impossible to escape. When its a not comunicating killer team its balanced, but you cant handle 3 killers at the same time when they are coordinatet.

After all this game gets a 7/10 from me they just have to balance it a little more.
Also some starting bugs /crashes but this can happen hope they fix it next days.

I see much potential is this game

For these reasons, below, and let me note, this game overall is enjoyable with friends, having a laugh, but for people like me that take survival games seriously, these factors below are what lead me to giving a thumbs down.

The game crashes at random times for no reason at all. Some times I can't even get into the damn game for 40 minutes, after multiple restarts and closing off all task except the necessary for the game. Crashing during game play.

 I can see it's potential. Too many times have I died to stupid stuff. Camera movement feels clunky. God forbid you get trapped within a corner for a brief second because you'll die. Coming from the DBD community, I understand this game, in no way is related, but getting close to a corner in DBD I know I won't instantly die. Getting use to the mechanics of the game is easy. But falling down a well or jumping out a window and taking 2 hits before I'm killed with moderate health is ridiculous. 

I don't think the game is favoured to the Family, just certain scenarios need to be changed, such as the inability to move straight after the window or well jump.  As I said just before, I want to give this game a thumbs up.

Like many of its kind, once you get to know the game it does lose some appeal. I like the win some, lose some that most matches seem to be, but this game seems a bit faster than others into degenerating into victims throwing house parties instead of running, turning the whole ""horror genre"" concept on its head and making the fear/anxiety into nothing more than a joke.  Hard to get around in these games, to be sure.  People get to know and master them, and then f around.

Game is still a buggy mess since release, and they had only addressed the credential error.

So far:
- Network errors kicking you out of games.
- Game breaking bugs such as being stuck and unable to move.
- Lobby system sucks and has ran out of codes to share with friends for the second time.

.. but most importantly, the game is becoming infested with cheaters. Xbox Game Pass version of the game has no anti-cheat. Apparently the game isn't even making server-side checks for cheats, and has been unchanged since the play test 3 months ago despite a community manager promising that it will be addressed with release.

The game has many other fundamental game play issues that I doubt will be addressed anytime soon. They are too slow to fix this game at the moment...

This game can be something cool and ""different"" and maybe not dying after a few months, but only if devs start fixing and balancing it.
Killers with poison attacks that make your camera looks like you're drunk but at the same time slowing you down, but at the same time they can kill you in 3 hits even if you max out your character life points. they have no recovery time after hitting you nor you get a little speed boost and they can just spam M1 till you die in less than 3 seconds.
Another dumb thing is the chance to be oneshotted in not even 30 seconds since game start, making the game very dumb and boring.
Bugs pretty much everywhere especially FPS drops for no reason.
Perks are dumb, you cant have all the perks and then have fun by sperimenting, you got a few perks and a few rng perks that makes all boring and dumb.
Character selection...jesus christ...there are 5 survivors and 4 killers, then to play the character you want, or the character you main/master you have to fight...constantly ppls joining and insta leaving lobbies because they can pick the character they want (on both sides), troll who just join the lobby, make everyone wait for 3 minutes then leave at 20 seconds.
Oh yeah and cheaters, lots of them, with unlimitedpower usage, super speed, teleport, no power cooldown, very fun.

To begin with, I was really looking forward to this game because I'm a big fan of the ""TCSM"" movies. The game somewhat introduces you to the world of the film, you having the possibility to play as the family members or as a survivor. If you liked the movies, you will love this game. The community is very friendly, which is a big plus for this game. One thing I really like is the fact that you don't have to wait a long time to find a match. If you liked Dead by Daylight, I think you will also like this game. Indeed, the price is perhaps a bit high for a game of this kind, but I really don't regret spending the money on it. It can be a very funny game no matter if you play with your friends or you play solo because, as I said above, the community of this game is very friendly and you can really have a lot of fun in every match. The customization of each character is quite extensive and what I really like is the fact that if you chose a certain path when you used your perks, you cannot go the other way. I don't want to make this review too long, so I'll say it briefly, I recommend the game with all my heart, and you, the developers, have done an absolutely wonderful job.

It's far from Dead by Daylight because the victims are just really trying to escape, not doing some generators to fix.

There are seriously needs some BUG issues to be fix and some GAMEPLAY mechanics to really enhance.

Here are my Two cents  on the time of playthrough.

Family Side Problem:
-The two of the Family can gank up on a victim when they are on a grapple scenario, and instakill the victim, that for me is very bad mechanic i suggest changing it to like a family member can just push the victim away causing the victim to take a reasonable amount of damage the same with victim when they gank a family member.
-Bubba in lvl 10 or build a really great perks. that maxes savagery, can instakill every single victim. i have experience that kind of build on lvl 10+ that really sucks 
-Why is it bubba is really needed to start the match? i get it because he's iconic. but it was a combination issue on the match where you can play everyone. and sort of takign account that bubba cannot go through gaps and crawl spaces.
i suggest power down the family member that is in the basement except bubba in a that case.

Victim Side Problem:
-Connie has an instant unlock ability that's too OP, which can end the game within 5 minutes or less. she can get other victims access to the surface pretty quickly. that detriments the flow of the match, Overtime when victims learn the map they can just get out really quickly (especially when using third party apps to communicate)

-The Animation of the beginning of the match is fairly the same it lacks variety and expression. and sometimes ragdolling everywhere, i see some bugs that stretch a certain victim way long.

Game issues and Bugs that i found.
-End game screen not going away after you have finish the match
-UE STOP WORKING
-Stabbing a family member sometimes result in locking in place.
-Music sometimes does not work while in chase.
-Tutorials ARE A WHACK nobody LIKES TO watch a while 2-5 minute video explaining how the game works.
PEOPLE LIKE TO DO A TUTORIAL WHILE PLAYING! (Add a tutorial scene to new players that are coming into the game)

Conclution:
Overall the game is really fun at first but it lacks the ""IMMA GRIND THIS GAME CAUSE IT'S SO GOOD"" but overtime the gameplay just rinse and repeat, Ngl this game has a lot of potential. i really love it but listen to the community.

PLEASE ADD REALLY GREAT RNG
PLEASE ADD RANK GAMES AND GREAT MATCHMAKING
PLEASE ADD MORE SKINS TO SISSSY (SHE'S SO HOT ASF)
PLEASE ADD MORE VICTIMS AND FAMILY MEMBERS! T_T
PLEASE ADD MORE PERKS AND VARIATIES ON ABILITIES!",1693154324,1693241333,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its so easy to be killed unless you take the fuse box path, which is an instant win. The killers side is a little better but still not super fun. If a victim knows what their doing, they are free in less than 4 mins. 
 
Grandpa is busted. If the match lasts 7 minuets,  grandpa will be at level 5 which means you will not escape. Kills give way too much blood, and the blood collection perks are too strong. 
ive had several matches as sissy where i wake grandpa up before anyone escapes the basement, and then the game is over cause the basement floods with the killers.
Over all the matchmaking is fucked. Being put against killers that are lvl 10 with maxed perks so early in release blows as victim. And its not fun as killer when no one knows what their doing and dies quick.

Personally, I hate that the victims and killers are in 3rd person but your camera is locked in place when your interacting with anything. If your going to let us peak around corners, let us watch our surroundings when digging in boxes or  lock picking. 100% of my victim games are lost because a killer walked around a corner while i was looking for bones or a lock pick. It sucks. Either commit to a full 3rd person, or do 1st person. The middle ground is annoying.

I tried to refund after 4 hours due to sitting in empty matches and having so many dc'd players, but steam wouldn't refund it. (i get it but i don't like it)
I tried picking it back up several times after that but i can only do 1 or 2 matches before i just quit.

Overall it has a ton of flaws, but like, it has more potential. Its got plenty of room for fixing issues and its only been out for a little while, so it can easily become something great. But in its current state id avoid it. Just watch streamers or something. If you jump in at this point its only frustrating.
But unfortunately, its growth feels limited due to being a Texas Chainsaw Massacre IP. I already think they need a new killer ""family"" to add any variety, but then it wouldn't really be a ""chainsaw massacre"" game. 
The only comparison ill make to dead by daylight, is that the killer pool has amazing variety and id love to see this game be similar in that way.

overall I really want to like this game but i just hate playing it. Im going to continue now and then and see if i can enjoy it.

AND there's no sitting in one spot playing a quicktime minigame for the majority of the match. The characters all have different builds you can spec into which really improves the replay value too. It's also beautiful and decently balanced in terms of character differences and between family and victims. sometimes matchmaking will screw with newbies, but that's bound to happen every now and then in any pvp game.

My only 2 gripes is that the lag is pretty horrible, especially when a chase starts and when an execution happens, and that sometimes you get paired with victims who's goal is to speedrun a solo escape, making certain more co-op oriented builds pointless. So you just don't get a chance to test out or make use of a build you've just spent time and energy theorycrafting.",1693197555,1693197555,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Immersive maps, including dilapidated farmhouses and eerie surroundings, amp up the horror. Customization options may be limited but work well.

Another note is I only really play killer at the moment so I'm unsure on any flaws from the survivor side


*****iframes*****

When survivors go through cracks in the wall you can very clearly hit them yet often they don't take any damage or it seems potentially reduced damage if you do get the blood collected notification, this can apply to other things such as crawl spaces, wells and pallets

*****Glitches*****

I've had it happen several times now where I go to attack someone and my character starts the attack animation then just cancels, this can happen several times in a row giving the survivor a big advantage in escaping and preventing them from taking damage they should have received

Not sure this is specifically a glitch as much as an unintended effect from the cut scenes but when Grandpa wakes up if you are doing your charge attack on Leather Face you will come out of the cut scene overheated  sometimes which is really annoying when you were just about to get someone with the charge attack   

I've been back stabbed next to a door which caused me to glitch through a closed door before which allowed the survivor to get away much easier

*****Clunkyness*****

Sometimes you get stuck on random stuff that you shouldn't (little stuff on the ground, door frames ect)

I've had some issues with executing people that are downed because the game does not give the execute prompt unless you are looking at the downed person

Sometimes when you walk through a metal door then try to close it behind you it pushed you back inside closing you on the wrong side

*****FPS issues*****

Any time someone is being executed, no matter where on the map fps starts to tank / stutter which is also an issue for a friend I play with

*****Lobby times*****

Lobby times are too long, often you get stuck sitting there for 2 minutes every time you join a lobby because someone doesn't ready up

*****Forced cut scenes*****

Every game you are forced to watch the same boring intro cut scene as well as the one from Grandpa waking up, honestly at this point I'd rather look at a black screen than see the same scene over and over and over, the Grandpa waking up scene should also just be gone as it can interfere with game play 


Playing on 12700k, 3080 and 32GB RAM, overall the games runs fine at 1440p 144 fps aside from the mentioned issues. I look forward to future updates hopefully addressing the issues mentioned above, the game does have potential to be the next DBD which would be nice to have a populated alternative as the DBD dev's constantly make questionable decisions and the game has a horrible community",1693175856,1693175856,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. All characters skill trees are branching, and at first, beyond the branches you cannot see which perks will be available to you, all this does is incentivise filling out the skill tree, then respeccing...and repeating until you can see the whole tree.

2. Not all characters get all perks on their skill tree, but there are nodes that give a random perk. Want a specific perk that isn't on your tree? Better fill out your tree then respec until you get lucky.

3. Character levelling/progression is really weird. Instead of levelling Hitchhiker by playing him, you just get skill points to spend on any character. The higher your overall level, the more ""floating"" skill points you have.

After having 3K hours on DbD i am happy to say i found a new game in that genre.
The things i like about TCM are the graphics it looks real pretty, Also survivors can do much more different things then jut repair generators and loop killers for ages.
It also feels much more terrifying since you are forced to hide for various killers,
whats also nice is that there are plenty of ways to fight em back! 
The killer gameplay is also a lot of fun since there is not just 1 but 3 killers all covered up with game chat as well.
I bet that If they keep this game updated with new features and some maps this could be for ME the new DbD.

1. Refreshing from Dead by Daylight as far as the concept/objective of the victims (survivors) vs. family members (killers). At first I was afraid of it being 4v3 since DBD is a very unforgiving game, but the idea of having multiple ways to escape the map justifies having multiple killers on a team. This brings a unrelenting effort of wanting to escape the map as a victim from leather face, which is insanely satisfying. 

2. Every victim & family member is very unique to their own style of play based on their core attributes, perks and special abilities. This is very refreshing from DBD allowing players to focus on multiple builds and play styles based on their characters personal level and how they executed their skill tree. 

3. UNREAL ENGINE makes this game absolutely enjoyable making it feel modern and with the times. The quality of the graphics is beautiful. The game is brutal, chaotic, dark and insanely gory. Every victim and family member has their own unique style of movement, which makes this game very unique during gameplay via PVP.

4. Crossplay is a huge PLUS for easy matchmaking across the board between all gaming platforms.

B) CONS:

1. Server crashes/errors are very common after a few matches. You constantly need to restart the game just to make sure you don't get kicked out from the next match from a server error issue. This can get quite annoying, because at times it may feel as if you're spending more time restarting the game than playing it.

2. During matchmaking while you're waiting for everyone to ready up the timer to start the match is way too long. It should be drastically reduced, so we can begin a match asap. Players being ready is a common issue, which causes a huge delay starting the match. Since there has to be one leather face as a family member at all times, this can cause players to leave quite often by players not being ready and taking too long to begin a match. If one person has to be leather face than there should be a default feature that permanently makes one person as leather face, so there isn't people constantly exiting the match. 

3. Not enough victims to select when matchmaking. For instance, if your victim is selected, which 7/10 times in most cases will be, a lot of players back out of the matchmaking, which causes a huge delay finding a replacement to begin a match. I understand the game just came out and it's catering towards the actual story, but if they added 3 more victims it would make the biggest difference from the survivors aspect/pov. 

C) OVERALL:

1. YES, I would highly recommend anyone to purchase this game. It's very challenging on both ends between the victims and family members. The concept is drastically different between both teams. In addition, the concept of the game is very unique to its own style, which is very refreshing from most common horror survivor games. Overall, I give this game a 9/10. It would be a 10/10 if it didn't have server issues while matchmaking.

So, huh. Let's say you want to play a family member : either you play a guy who can track victims but NOT follow them, or you can play others who can't track victims but will be willing to actually follow them through obstacles.
Or you can play Leatherface who can't do either, in exchange for a clunky chance at a OHKO move, which doesn't really matter since once you start hitting a victim it's basically over for them anyway, regardless of the character. Hope you like him tho because he's needed to start the game.

The tutorials are just (pretty repetitive) videos, you can't skip ahead, you don't play, they're undubbed beside the first, it's boring AF.
Cherry on top, you can't even rebind your controls.

     killers, but one of them must always be Leatherface against four survivors who are tasked with escaping.

➤ There are many different ways to escape in the game. Personally, I like the escape the best where you have to find a 
     fuse and then insert it into the fuse box there is a smaller puzzle that you need to complete to open the exit. 

➤ There is also a skill tree in the game where you unlock perks for your character and you also get points which are used 
     to upgrade your character's attributes.

➤ Each character is unique because they have a unique ability that can't be obtained and this applies to both survivors 
     and killers. In general, I liked the game a lot, both in terms of looks and gameplay.

➤ Things I like about the game:

+ The abilities of each character: It's fun to play as each character, as they have different perks and this changes the whole 
   gameplay, as you can play but completely on stealth or on the contrary make a mess and force the killers to chase you.
   For killers, you can play a support role and feed the grandfather, or take a lot of damage and chase survivors.

+ Different ways of escape (Generator, fusebox, batery etc..)

+ Appearance of the game

+ Voicechat is very key here for both parties and can be used to your advantage. 

➤ However, even here there are things that bother me a lot: 

- The servers are quite unstable, during the game you get an error and the game kicks you to the main menu. This problem 
   will be solved by a patch.

- The Slaughterhouse map is terribly difficult for killers, as it is terribly huge and before you get from one side of the map 
   to the other, the survivors will run away, as they start a bit earlier than the killers.

- The game is not optimized. I have no problem in the main menu, but once I'm in the lobby, the web browser starts to lag 
   horribly, despite having a fairly expensive computer. The same thing happens to me sometimes right in the game when 
   two killers are near each other and trying to kill the same character. I believe they will also fix this problem as well as the 
   first one.

♥ Personally, I can only recommend the game, as I hope that the negatives I mentioned here will be removed by the 
   developers.

At first the game was fun during the initial hype, everyone was new and all the 'abusable' techs hadn't been discovered. But soon the horrible design choices began to show in all their glory. Certain map decisions (gas station door for example), chain stuns, game breaking bugs, losing to fps drops and bad optimisation, games being over in 2 mins or less. The list goes on. It feels bad to outplay an entire family team for 20 mins as a solo, just to die to 'bleed out'. One of those mechanics that sounds good on paper but soon becomes a needless frustration. 
Don't get me wrong, it captures the theme of TCM well and is a decent horror experience. The game looks great too, but there is just not much to master. There are only so many times you can pick a lock or press LMB on a victim before you begin to want a little more. Its worth a play for sure, but don't be surprised if your interest starts to dwindle after 50 hrs or so. Oh and before i forget, cheaters a few days in.

caution! he wears your face 🤡🤡🤡
..wasn't the biggest fan of leatherface when he was on DeadByDaylight. But it was mostly because the killers camped a lot. 
Well, here you have a game where camping becomes impossible. There are 4 exits and only 3 killers (leatherface and two relatives). A bit confusing at the beginning, despite the tutorials, because the maps appear very large and you don't know exactly how the best is to approach them.

I've never liked playing Killer, but I really like it here. Because every single one of the family has different skill trees as well as abilities. There is sure to be something for everyone. Whether attaching locks or poisoning objects or sawing everything up ;)

As a victim you also have very fair chances here. Body blocking or hits when you have already performed an action do not work (unlike dbd)... and if the grandfather gets too annoying again, he'll be paralyzed for a while ;) of course don't get caught! 🤡

The game is also graphically impressive.

Conclusion: Stupid for people who don't speak English, because unfortunately it's not in German. The developers have once again conjured up something great, with a lot of Love for the Details of the Movies. I'm already looking forward to more Content or new Fashion :D

Things like the crashes, lag spikes, blatant cheaters here and there, and the supplied credentials being invalid (even after the fix this week it has still happened) are the big pain points for the game right now.

There are also a few smaller things like overall map/game balance and how Connie is almost guaranteed a free win in the right hands. Other things like Sissy overshadowing some of the other killers and things like chain stuns potentially becoming infinite stuns as well. i-frames for climbing/crawling obstacles could also use a look at however that one's a small personal gripe more than anything.

With the above said though the devs are really chill and as far as overall fun goes the game definitely has it. However I will say the game once played to a certain extent begins to show some repetitiveness, and could absolutely use more than three maps along with some aforementioned map balance/adjustments (especially with the gas station).

I think I've gotten to 11 Hours and have no desire to play more. 

What makes this game good: Graphics, the feeling of being in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre Movie. That's it.

Took a week to get a simple fix to some server issues which doesn't sound like is completely resolved. This is the same development team behind F13 the game (which died before the lawsuit was a problem) and since they don't seem to be in a hurry to fix things, I'm not counting on this game lasting long. 

I would say the game is balanced on both sides. Victims seem to have a harder time playing to begin as it's poorly explained what you are supposed to be doing and how to complete objectives to escape. Family is pretty easy with you learning what objectives to keep an eye on and little things you learn along the way, it's basically hit the humans over and over again until they die. 

Grandpa is op at level 5 but can have his ability reduced by 1 if a victim stabs him but doesn't mean much when most of the family will be able to get him back to max very quickly. 

The generator and car battery exits are stupid op for victims, once they unlock the doors and gates to that exit, it's pretty much impossible to stop them if you don't catch them before they sneak there way to that exit. 

People are starting to play competitive due to the poor game design, victims have escaped a match in under 3 minutes. This is becoming a more regular thing. It seems like they'd have to completely redo the game to fix this issue as I don't think it can be a simple fix. 

Voice chat is a necessity but most people don't talk or treat it like a COD lobby making teamwork difficult. 

The gameplay is already boring to me at 11 hours in. I can't see myself enjoying another 90 hours of it at a stupid price of $40. There is nothing in this game worth $40. This is a $20-$30 game at best. the fact they are already releasing DLC shows they are greedy and think the game is already worth $40 but trust me, it isn't. 

From other reviewers, there are cheaters which doesn't surprise me but I can't talk much more on that, I haven't encountered a cheater that I'm aware of. 

I fail to understand how so many people think this game deserves a positive review but trust me, in its current state, I would not recommend playing this game. If you can get it on sale for under $30 sure but not for $40. I don't know what kind of shelf life this game is expecting but I don't see it lasting long currently. I couldn't imagine playing this for 3 years unless they make some serious gameplay changes and add more content that would make each match interesting to play and where it isn't possible to just escape each match in a few minutes.
