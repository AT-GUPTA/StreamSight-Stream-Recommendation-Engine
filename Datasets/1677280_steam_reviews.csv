Graphics look like they're from 2007 and absolutely no new features whatsoever in multiplayer (in fact, less than previous titles). I couldn't be more bored with it already. Feels like a slimmed down version of CoH1. 

The big selling point was supposed to be the dynamic campaign, but it feels like a phone or flash game, not a AAA title. Incredibly lazy development, no depth, and again - terrible graphics. 

Don't waste your money. CoH 1 and 2 were much better.

Update: After painstakingly putting in several hundred hours I can confirm, this game is dead in the water. We're six months into release and the patch they just dropped broke the game and added virtually nothing (just new maps and minor tweaks). Sorry but this game is dead. IF you weren't aware, the dev team also laid off half of its staff.



UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER: This game is probably worse than it was at release and it's sad to see. A year later the only content released has been a couple BGs and maps. A whole year. Yeah, they'll put out more maps next week, but nobody is coming back for that. The game is dead.

The community is what makes the game the worst part. Sadly 90% of teammates online are leavers, rage quitters, team killers, or just flat out awful. With so few players left globally (only about 1,000 at a time), you'll also be matched with wildly mismatched ELOs. Overall, this franchise is likely dead.

The simplicity and atmosphere of COH's moment to moment gameplay is here, with immaculate detail.  Tactical positioning, clever countering, escalating power dynamics and the ever tense tug of war. 
The sweat and delight of this game's Skirmish mode has been present across all three games for me. 

The big new feature of COH 3 is the single player campaign on the tactical map. I've played it when it launched, and have started a fresh campaign more recently after updates to give it another roll. 
The turn to turn of the meta-layer is slow and lacking in meaningful decisions. I like the flavour of managing different stakeholders opinions on you, but ultimately think it gives a wide range of tools but no meaningful moment to moment decisions. It doesn't feel like you're playing against an opponent with the same mechanics as you. That said, whenever you're thrown into a mission or skirmish inside it, all that melts away, as the game goes back to what Company of Heroes is about. The missions bring a lot of variety to it, and I do worry that people not playing the campaign might miss out on the highs of those. 

Ardennes Assault brought in a really simple map layer, where you had three company's with a finite amount of condition, becoming increasingly ragged as you retreating Germans company's became stronger, and was absolutely beloved. It's arguably a choose your own adventure, with the majority of the map dynamics allowing you to choose what level of difficulty, with some minor allowances to rout troops. 
It also only required you to look at the map section for about 2 minutes max before jumping into the next match. 

The community has been pretty vocally angry about this game, and I remember them being vocally angry about Company of Heroes 2. It's a bloody shame that Relic have substantial layoffs, and may have to pivot to smaller scoping of development moving forward. 

Despite the excitement for a Italy spanning campaign, I think I'd love for a smaller scoped choice for future swings at this. A simple Ardennes Assault style metalayer of limited decisions, but hopefully meaningful one, and 8-12 great missions to complete (potentially set around the retreat from Dunkirk if I made a wish)

These are nit picks. The singleplayer campaign is one aspect of this, with a great multiplayer and skirmish mode, and it's own bespoke linear campaign on top. 

This is a positive review, because this game inspires absolute joy and passion. The bones of the game are ultimately unchanged and forever compelling as a tactics game. I love the atmosphere, the immaculate sound design, the moment to moment decision making. I love the specific regional accents and ambient dialogue. I love the leveraging of recon flares which feels much more accessible and useful compared to COH 2 when the sight lines were first introduced. The rock paper scissors of heavy machine guns, smoke grenades and mortars will never not be an exciting real time puzzle to solve. I'll never not panic when the opponent rushes out a tank and it feels like an unbreakable behemoth that can't be countered.

Long story short, this game was released in an unfinished state for a full AAA price with a lot of lack in features, content and balance. However it did have potential to become the ultimate CoH if passion was in their (the devs) heart.

Now, after almost a year since release, a lot of patches and fixes have come around and the game feels a lot more ""complete"" with Steel Sheperd update than ever before...

But it still not enough and doesn't hold up to the very first instalment. Somewhat like CoHO and CoH2, the gameplay is very campy and requires less micro. New battlegroups can be purchased with in game Merit (good luck) or currency unless you bought the expensive Premium edition. It encourages the player to either get the Premium edition or buy the battlegroup seperatly to be competitive, which is p2w...and btw surprise surprise new battlegroups are broken...see the trend here?!

Long story short, game still has bugs and DLC is still overpriced (just grind out the merit). Faction balance is decent and PvP has a more varied meta compared to release, actually a healthy balance. 

I still do not recommend the game at full price because Relic took a full year to fix the game while claiming it as a full release on launch. These practices are scummy and show that some devs don't take an interest in their work and aren't actually passionate about the games they are making. Don't get into an industry if you don't like what you do, just leave and make room for devs that care like those making BG3, ER, AoE2DE, HD2, etc.

Update 5: Relic walked it back on screwing over premium edition owners and made it so they did receive the DLC for free. This wouldn't have been possible if not for the community telling them how stupid they are for not doing so in the first place. The game balance has actually managed to achieve a somewhat solid balance across all factions, definitely some tweaking needs to be done but it is in a healthy state. Some of this was too late before player base dropped off, but a decent amount still play. Imo DLC and base game together are only worth $25 at best. It took basically a full year since release of the game (supposedly a full and not EA release) to actually be decent. Relic has managed to fuck up two beloved franchises in the third iteration WH40K:DoW 3 and now CoH 3. Great job! Weekly challenges are still bugged as sometimes they will refresh yet marked as completed and not give you ANY merit. Coincidentally this ""bug"" happened to me when I got close to the 10k merit required to unlock the DLC tech trees for free. This is just so annoying that something so basic is STILL broken after a year despite the last major update (Steel Shepherd) allegedly not only reworking challenges but also fixing them. 

Update 4: These dipshit devs have managed to still have bugged daily challenges in the game...how do you fuck up something so basic and still can't fix it? Yet you push out an ""expansion pack"" which is $17 and it has about $5 worth of content. Eat a dick Relic you're worse than Creative Assembly as at least CA admitted they fucked up their strategy game and even issued refunds.

Update 3: Still haven't implemented a hard/expert queue for AI matches. This is simple to do as you can use the exact same servers that host current AI matches and just have them implement the lobbies for hard/expert, it doesn't even require new infrastructure. Balance between factions is still utter trash, the new DLC introduced new tech lines for only 2/4 factions, whoever greenlit that for DLC is an absolute idiot. If the next DLC is introducing 2 tech trees for the other factions, that's just scummy as a monetization scheme. Relic is basically pulling a Creative Assembly and so far thinks they can get away with it because of the community shills who put up with this shit. To further describe how broken balance is look at the win rates for each factions in high elo and it becomes insanely apparent that Relic has no idea wtf they're doing with their balance.


Update 2: These dumb fucks released a $17 DLC and screwed over everyone who bought the premium version of the game (they don't get the DLC for free). I am not one of those people that got screwed, but I am updating the review because Relic is a POS for doing that. That is a scummy practice as it is customary to give premium edition buyers at least the first DLC free if not the first 4 DLCs (annual pass type of shit).

Update: I don't know what they broke with the last update, but now it is now possible to use CheatEngine and modify your resource values while in-game. Game is completely broken in PvP because of this. Have already ran into players (ironically mostly Chinese) that have been abusing this. The end of game stats screen even reflects the obscene influx of unexplained resources, that isn't even mathematically possible.

In regards to an update on balance, DAK used to be the most broken faction. Relic decided to nerf across the board for DAK (very lazily) and now they're the worst and they did the opposite for US which is now the best faction. I don't know who in Relic is deciding on the balance changes or even the process on how they should balance, but they should be fired as they don't know what they're doing at all.

Wait for a sale, this game honestly is worth $20 at best in its current state

The meta is so rigid that any deviation from it will cause you to lose matches in the early game with no hope of recovering. While CoH2 was very similar it gave some leeway for breaking away from the meta or at the very least giving room for error and recovery. CoH1 imo was the most lenient. Somehow with CoH3 we've basically entered a StarCraft state where build order in the early game is so important that it determines the outcome before the first conflict in-game. In most matches by the second conflict it will become glaringly apparent to even the most oblivious person who will win the match. 

The game simply isn't as fun as the previous 2 titles, but it looks nice at least? Bugs are still apparent and there are some bugs that will flat out make a unit dead weight because it won't function (towed mortars will sometimes glitch and become unusable as the game somehow thinks it is towed when it isn't or vice versa). 

Relic shit the bed on this one. I think they'll turn it around over time, but it is unacceptable in its current state. Balance is non-existent and once you learn DAK, there's no point to playing any other faction.",1691370147,1708683730,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

While some of their design additions are great, particularly around automation, some of the others make for a worse game for me - this might be different if you are more of a action rts or moba player.

The game has become to fast to give any meaningful purpose to units outside single player. I can see this makes for shorter matches, but it has become an apm fest that renders some unit types completely irrelevant. COH had some of these issues but not to this degree.

To start on a positive, the game graphics are very good, the sound effects are good, the multiplayer works without lag and syncing issues, and there are a variety of different strategies to try (even though most are not advisable in multiplayer). 

As for the negatives, for one, there are lots of bugs, from unit pathing to certain features not working as stated, such as healing or upgrades. Many might say that this is to be expected from a first version but I disagree. Sure, some level of bugs is to be expected but there are some very basic things that should have been tested, discovered, and fixed before a general release. Recall that this is not an early release game. Second, there are four factions that are very clearly not balanced. There are certain strategies for some that are going to be overwhelmingly successful despite the best efforts of even good players. Next, there aren't enough maps so games get boring since you pretty much have to do the same things over and over again. Last, there are no features allowing you to see replays of your own games or other players' games. This last omission is curious since they built this feature into the v1 release for Age of Empires IV, meaning that they know players (and streamers) would likely want something similar for a game that is supposedly more popular.

Overall, I think the game is very promising and can be fun, albeit frustrating if you are a newer player or are a player thinking you might make your way up the ladder (by the way, there is no official ranked mode, or ladder but there are sites that track this information real time that are no affiliated with Relic). Based on the above and the price point for this game, it would be best to wait another 3-6 months before buying it to see how Relic addresses some of these issues. Assuming they do, then the game could be very good. If they don't address them, or address them quickly, then the game could be viewed as boring and not worth the $60 purchase price.

UPDATE//

I am sorry. I have never been more excited for something and so wrong to judge - but this game is utter garbage; it literally spits on the entire franchise.
Nothing has been fixed since launch.
Content is a slog and incredibly slow.
The developers refuse to release modding tools to rival that of CoH2 - so some mods aren't able to be fully fleshed out as they were in earlier installments.
Same boring content and microtransactions.
Feels like someone fell asleep on this and nothing is being done - other than ""balancing"" which doesn't make sense because the little content that has been released is blatantly OP.

They tried hitting 3 different birds with one stone and missed all three.
It's obvious. They do not care. They are doing little to nothing to fix it.

The lads and I (who have over 3000 hours from the other franchise installments) have almost entirely remapped out game nights with playing Call to Arms Ostfront.

I went with Rangers, which are fun, and give a bit spice to the game. 
That being said, the biggest issue during this grind is how stale the game is playing the same 4-6 maps because of being forced to play either multiplayer or coop vs AI missions. 
Not being able to play modded maps, or anything to change the game up is understandable to not completely cheese the missions, but definitely makes it less of an enjoyable grind. 


I am happy that I was able to get some of the content without paying, but it's a bit stale and by no means worth $60 or $76 with the DLC. Catch a sale for $30 or so and it's probably worth it. 


At the announcement of the new ""expansion pack"" I can officially say this game is a lost cause. 
After 8 months of small updates, with absolutely no new content (aside from maps) which was already lacking from the start, the removal of units from the alpha and beta tests, and now the new commanders being locked behind a $16 ""Expansion"" that only gives 1 commander for 2 of the 4 factions? It's a joke. 
I really wanted to love this game, I have plenty of hours in this, and all company of heroes games, but I have to hang up my hat when the company repeatedly decides to slap it's community in the face over and over. 



Mechanics wise this game is pretty great in all honesty, but it fails in almost every single other aspect. 
Their very own previous title had a ton of ways to play, while this one was locked down to 12 different commanders in total across all nations. (I will acknowledge that this game launched with more content than 2 at launch, but I think it's fair to compare a game to it's predecessor that it's replacing at time the new title dropping, not launch to launch) 
Also the commander's in the previous title were between .99$ to $2.99.

Unfortunately, the lack of ""commanders"" for each faction really takes away a big chunk of the replayability of the game if you play the game the same way I do. 

Further more, in COH2 you can earn intels and skins after a certain number of wins; in coh3, custom games don't yield rewards of progressions in any form...

UNTIL recently, you can now do ""quests"" in Co-op vs AI or in multiplayer to earn merit to be used in the premium store, BUT the rewards are totally uninspiring.

This is made worse that in Coop vs AI mode, you cannot choose the AI difficulty, and it defaults to ""Normal"" difficulty, which gets really stale after a few games.

I have played for thousands of hours in the previous games, and I couldn't make it to 3 in this one without wanting to delete the thing from my computer.  I kept it around, ""maybe they will fix it"" instead, I got a microtransaction store.  Should we be surprised though?  Lets not forget what this same studio did with DOW3.  Maybe Relic needs to just stop making games for the PC, and try their hands at the next Candy Crush game.  Seems to be more in line with their skills.

I came back to play this several months later.  While a lot of the issues have been resolved, the campaign is still crap, and you are required to farm in game 'merit' currency which is earned by completing randomly generated ""challenges"" which rotate on a daily and weekly basis.  This currency, I assume, was meant as an alternative to the real money ""buy the stuff"" shop, but it also is the *only* way you can acquire additional battlegroup commanders.  Yep, the only thing on the shop that you might actually want is not available for purchase.  If these challenges were ""always on"" and not on a rotating basis, you could probably farm up the merit points fairly quickly, but since they are *not* you better hope you get stuff you are willing/able to do.  I for one, live in the third world, and while I have a very capable computer, playing online is basically out of the question, as my ping times are north of 500ms in most multiplayer games.  So how do I get my points?  Skirmishes.  You need to do ""vs ai"" matches?   NICE!  Oh, only in multiplayer though.  Killing an AI in skirmish doesn't count for this challenge for whatever reason, and you should know that starting a multiplayer lobby and just putting AI in it will not launch unless you have at least one other player in the lobby, so that's out for a work around.

Coming around to this again, the game still needs a LOT of work.  At least it isn't randomly crashing anymore, but a lot of these systems are poorly implement and COH 2 remains the superior title.  It MIGHT have something to do with this game being co-developed for the console market, which all the old boys around here will remember the term ""Consoleitis"" that we would use to refer to games that were obviously gimped or poorly optimised for PC on account of being co-developed.  This is still a stay away title, but I do log in every day to try and get my merit points.

If you have found a koala that may have been stolen, it is extremely important that you immediately contact local animal rescue organizations, veterinarians, or authorities for assistance. Caring for a koala requires specialized knowledge and experience in handling wildlife, as well as compliance with legal regulations for the protection and care of wild animals.

In general, the optimal diet for koalas consists of their natural food sources, which primarily consist of eucalyptus leaves. However, if a koala is in captivity or under care and does not have access to eucalyptus, you can try to obtain fresh eucalyptus branches. Make sure that the branches are free from pesticides or other harmful chemicals.

It is crucial that the koala receives appropriate medical care and is examined by professionals to determine if it has any injuries or health issues.

(6) Airstrike call-ins often glitch and the plane is gyrating in and out of the ground and plummeting in and out of the fundamental rules of gravity,
(7) Italian Campaign is ridiculously under stimulating, the half-cooked attempt to do a Total War turn base preparation phase before missions is so disenchanting. 
(8) The Ernst Rommel Africa Campaign has a superficial story and the missions are more representative of custom skirmishes cooked up by a 15 year old with a free afternoon on Age of Empires 2 scenario editor.
(9) There are approximately 6 maps on release, 2/3 are 1v1 only.
(10) Relic has been purposely dishonest and deceitful with their media releases, examples: (i) creating purchasable expansions that release content synonymous with a patch; (ii) declared the official release instead of acknowledging that the game was clearly still in beta and needed fanbase tlc; (iii) key gameplay updates turned out to be the insertion of an in-game store containing heartless unaesthetic limited access costumes with lazy unhistorical names to try and bait loyal fans into thinking that these items are valuable.
(11) More recently the play base has deteriorated due to its poor release so very often the servers are multinational and connection is poor.
(12) No comprehensive statistics - if it is a competitive RTS there needs to be in depth game analysis and more explicit descriptions of what units do for unfamiliar players (not me I know but it is a common problem of assuming people know what a Stug-D, Stug V is and how they differ in function. Lazy descriptions.
(13) A lot of careless re-skinning of menu features from COH2,
(14) There's plenty more but I think that is enough for this afternoon. 

Final Comment:

I love company, I hope RELIC find away to avoid going insolvent. This is definitely the end of the franchise.

If you just play the singleplayer the stuff like micro transactions (which sucks) won't affect you. 

I am having a really good time with this game! I am only playing single player, but so far it has been really fun. Completed the Italian campaign. I played a lot of COH 1 and 2. Mainly multiplayer on a semi high level. COH 1 was amazing with some flaws, COH 2 had some poor design choices, but so far COH 3 reminds me more of COH 1 in the dynamics and play style, but with improved graphics and UI. 

Again, not judging the multiplayer, but I am having fun with the single player part. Like rediscovering a gem, that has aged really well. Seems like an improvement on all fronts.

Nothing groundbreaking; just a seemingly solid title in a classic franchise and in a genre of games lacking in major releases. If you liked any other COH game you'll probably like this one. Gameplay feels a bit slow at times with how tanky infantry can be while in cover, but proper use of combined arms will always see you come out on top. Game has ran well for me and I've only had a few crashes during loading screens. Only real complaint is that the sound design could really use some work. A lot of weapon and cannon fire sounds pretty a like to each other. 

If you're looking at that mixed status and are feeling on the fence then I recommend simply trying the game out yourself and refund it if you really don't like what you see. A lot of the discussions have been childish and entitled. You'll see most negative reviews with only a half hour played and complaints about art style choices. Everyone is free to not like the direction Relic took with the visuals. I personally don't care for the direction either. However, the reaction to that decision and some other issues that ultimately boil down to nitpicks has been ridiculous. I've seen some people compare this game to Anthem or BF 2042. COH3 may not be your cup of tea and it certainly has flaws, but let's not compare it to games that are fundamentally broken from a game design standpoint. 

You know a lot of this reminds me of when COH2 launched. Sure, now it's apparently the height of the franchise, but when it came out people hated it. I completely stayed away from it for years based on those reactions despite loving COH1 and still playing that game to this day. Looking back on those negative reviews they seem just as dumb as the ones for this game. People unironically complained about the EASTERN FRONT being portrayed in a negative light. ""It's called Company of Heros not Company of Warcrimes!!!"" Ugh. I wonder how many potential fans will be turned away by all this?

The North African campaign I am not a fan of, it felt rushed. Its playable.
Graphics are good, the destruction in the environments are sweet, but there seems to be a lack of detail compared to COH and COH 2. Same with sound design, which lacks the ear splitting gun sounds and explosions from earlier entries. Sound design works, although at times i would notice not hearing MG fire when i could clearly see my MG42s tear apart enemies. I definitely miss the gore from earlier entries, here it is present but toned down. No more limbs flying across the battlefield.

Long time German player across all three games. Whoever balanced this game must have had lost a great grandparent in a concentration camp. German tanks are mostly a joke. The heavy ones that can be called in will either never see the battle field because you have already lost by then, or will be over-run by the four Shermans that have already been out for ten minutes before. Don't even get me started on the new ranger squad who relic decided would be a good idea to make an anti everything unit. There is also no reason to justify how long it takes for multiplayer balance patches to come out. They waste their dev times on ridiculous things such as a console version.

Then you have the barbaric DLC that they proudly released even though nothing free has been added yet.

1. The extra single-player company is a lie. You don't actually get it unless you pay money. It's the only NOT available for in-game points apparently.
2. WAY WORSE campaign mode. All unintended balance issues are magnified, narrative is FAR more implausible, character interactions are exactly what a middle-school child would imagine them to be and NOTHING more.
3. The promise that the tiny handful of devs who actually care about the game might survive SEGA and be around for CoH4, which we're all just waiting for.
4. The distinct possibility that devs who care about the game will be driven to suicide by SEGA management (please hold on! we love you!)


*Edit* I started with the German campaign. Changing my review from one to two thumbs down after finishing the Allied campaign. 

Dear Sega: I know you're smart enough to ask one former military professional to review your stories prior to launch, and the fact that they allowed you *so many* egregious errors (for example the italian theater was commanded by two bickering generals who delegate all tactical decisions to a corporal, E-2, fresh out of bootcamp enlisted guy,) its clear that you failed to command even one iota of respect in ANYONE who reviewed the game. The only reason these mistakes made it through is because, serially, people reviewing your product decided to let them. They decided to say nothing, and that speaks to your outreach. How did your product team (I've run many, and command industry-leading numbers) forget to ask basic questions like, ""does anything stand out as unreasonable in the story?""

On to technical matters. About 4-5 turns in, you'll experience a wait-time bug while loading the campaign map from a battle. Alt-tab doesn't kill the process, so just shitpost for 5-30 minutes. (Literally.) This isn't a hardware problem. Your game isn't ""too badass."" Fix yourselves.

*Original Review Follows*
Disgusting. Fans of CoH would be well advised to BOYCOTT THIS BULLSHIT. 

Easily the weakest excuse for a single-player campaign I've EVER seen. There's a whole ""Social Justice"" warning screen before EVERY mission that's a stark black field with white text telling the player that they might not have the stomach to play a game ""featuring"" the ""history of Jewish people.""

THEN THERE ARE ZERO JEWISH PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN!

No communication between product, design, and programming. Gross. Obscene. Insulting. Disgusting.

Jews, jewishness, jewish tropes or social norms, jewish ANYTHING is not present. I think at some point there's a warning message saying that one of the narrators is jewish? I don't know, I just know that JEW JEW JEW JEW JEW is screamed by the producers, but the designers didn't understand what ""make a game about jews being persecuted in north africa"" meant. (Possibly because North Africa was historically DEVOID OF JEWISH PERSECUTION? That might be it.) This isn't a review against anyone who worked FOR these producers, just an indictment against hollywood's idea that we goyim are still as impressionable as the poor dead heroes immortalized by games similar to this.

At least they didn't try to convince us that people were executed with masturbation machines again. That was a weird one. This isn't THAT weird, but it IS that out-of-place. This game's ""oh my god europeans were so mean to jews"" is about as laughable as the ""executed us with masturbation machines"" story from Nuremburg.

In short, CoH3 is stuck to my butt, it itches a lot, and no amount of wiping makes me feel clean.",1677474695,1707448935,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With the current state of the game the developers would need to release daily if not fucking hourly balance patches to maybe have a chance to rescue this game. And by rescue I mean have a player size of more than fucking ONE.

How any of the factions has been released in this state borders on insanity. I honestly think that the relic offices have a carbon-monoxide leak. I fear for their employees who must be convulsing on the floor as I write this.

The 'balance patches' which did get released are schizophrenic at best.

Honestly at this point, I hope the game fucking dies. I hope the developers and designers who worked on this never get a job in the gaming industry ever again. If you think that is harsh, just look up their fucking history of how the community had to forcefully guide them through the development process to get the game even in a playable state with their stupid ass 'co-development'.

The game play was enjoyable but the actual campaign is copy and paste skirmishes with a few cool missions here and there. The biggest let down of this game though is the fact that after all the build up of battling your way through Italy towards Rome, once you are a town or two away that's it, I didn't even realize the mission I was playing was the last mission. This game quite literally ends right before you reach Rome on the map and there is nothing else you can do. Why even bother putting Rome on the map or having a few more towns before Rome if the game ends with some random mission. Like I said previously, I do really like the game play but the campaigns feel like they were put together relatively quickly and the fact that they spend the entire game building up your approach to Rome for it to not even be a part of the game is such a dumb and completely lazy decision that causes such an underwhelming end to the game that it caused me to write my first review on steam.",1707194432,1707194432,False,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Guns are quiet as are heavy ordinance detonations...maybe they are airsoft guns? VA is lacking as is the background music and ambiance.  Basically sound is complete trash.UI is far too large again this is for console players, the main menu looks like a mobile game as do after game stats ect.There is a dlc store coming which will probably have all sorts of outlandish skins breaking immersion and realism even more.The pseudo total war campaign map is just filler keeping you from the actual RTS experience.

I bought the premium digital edition, and I desperately want this game to succeed. But something is rotten in the HQ of Relic. The game, has been a solid and fun game since launch, but with tons of minor mistakes,  a large amount of missing features and content. I was hoping, that this new patch and content release would push the game in the right direction, and I does, to some extent. It's good content and a much-needed breath of fresh air. But... and yes there is a huge but. 

As of launch of patch 1.4 with the “Hammer and Shield” dlc, the game crashes every other game in multiplayer. I have had one crash prior to the release of ""Hammer and Shield"" over the course of 200ish hours. The balance has been effectively ruined by the overall buff of indirect fire, and sector artillery abilities of certain units and battlegroups. The game crashes, and is a bunker indirect-fire no-fun zone. The games strength, cover usage, flanking, light vehicle play, team weapons, cool mechanics etc., is now relegated to getting bombed until the game crashes. There is still a huge lack of multiplayer and skirmish maps, which makes the experience at best repetitive and at worst extremely tiresome. Charging 16.99 € for the “Hammer and Shield” dlc, and calling it an expansion is an insult. 

Do not buy the game or the ""expansion"". Hold off til the game gets better. Company of Heroes 2 is a great game today, and had a disastrous launch back in 2013. I hope that the devs get to mitigate the large amounts of issues with the game, and that Company of Heroes 3 will be the great game it has potential to become, before SEGA (or relic themselves) destroys the franchise. 

Ps.  I will update this review down the line, as the game gets patched.

Edit: There are som serious issues with the matchmaking due to the low player counts. During my 1v1 plays, I frequently meet players that are alot higher ranked than me due to the low player count, which is first of all terrible matchmaking. Secondly, it is frustrating when you decide to go and play a game to have som fun, but you get your ass handed to you and an adress in your hand where you can come back if you were ever in need of an ass kicking.

UPDATE: So the game has changed, enough to make it enjoyable... auto matches actually have some criteria to matching players based on skill. One major thing I think they could further improve upon is the ricochet on the vehicles. As well as the fact that you cant drive through another vehicle like a ghost... there's a reason blocking was a tactic in COH2. That change along with greater variety of armor and doctrines would be great. I think two docs after a year is a bit weak. If you want your base to really get into COH3 give them more material to enjoy. Not campaigns, but multiplayer items. Upgrades, weapons, armor, etc. we will eat that shit up.

OLD REVIEW:yeah... so.... if you automatch, expect to get crushed because there's zero ranking structure... again...and again... and again....aaaaannnd again. I do enjoy the units and their capabilities. But man are the graphics cartoony. Also the sounds aren't as epic as COH2. As surprised as others by this work from creators. Was expecting more depth of graphics, more dynamic sounds, and especially a well established multiplayer structure. Looks like a totally new team developed this game from COH2. Hoping they overhaul the multiplayer and add items to make matchmaking fair, a legit rank structure, and even update the sounds for deeper bass and heavier more impactful explosions.

I absolutely love COH in general but to ask us to pay full price for a game that is literally bare is a tad frustrating. The campaign is blah as usual but the multiplayer is the backbone of this franchise and you launch it with only 3 battle groups per group and a handful of maps???? Unit selection is  frustrating, some of the animations for call ins and some audio is just overall crap. Thank god for mods to fix your zoom levels because obviously you guys dont get it!  It does not feel immersive and is mostly inaccurate to how these explosions would sound. The lighting when some of these explosions happen on darker maps should very quickly light up the surrounding area which it does not. The AI is even dumber then before except for dodging grenades which they seem capable almost every single time making them useless. Why would you launch a game so empty? Its like you guys at relic learned nothing from the launch of COH 2. Maybe in about 10 more years this game will finally become suitable?  

Soooo after being out for an entire year I still cannot recommend purchasing this game. Main reason is they have gotten alot of balancing issues fixed but they have not added any new content to speak of. We are still working with very few maps and very few battlegroups. Yes the community makes maps but I honestly do not feel like this game is worth the 60$ for the little content that is provided. For most users that remain playing the game, is for the multiplayer not the campaign. The game is close to where to it should have been at launch. By now we should have at least 6 battlegroups per faction. There is not a lack of WW2 gear to implement so I am not sure the problem. If Age of Empires can get new factions and units and maps why does the COH 3 team not do the same? I still feel like the effort is not there. You do not have to come up with a story line or spend money making and designing things all the content is handed to you on a silver platter RELIC.

Game is on its WAY to being better, the games are short ~ 15 minutes. You barely get to use any end game units. The multiplayer is cancer with no way to punish people who troll. 




12/6/2023 Updated

FYI - when you accept that EULA when you launch the game YOU GIVE UP ANY RIGHT TO A REFUND. That's shady. Proceed how you wish.

Games are REALLY short, about 15 minutes. The balance patch is a STEP in the right direction. YOU CAN EARN the expansion battle groups, for 10,000 merit. I wont be giving them any more money, but if you have the game. Play and give it a shot. If you don't have the game, it has it's perks, but CTA: Gates of Hell Ostfront might be a better bang for your buck.


9/14/2023
The game is in a much better state. Still needs work. The US and the airstrikes need fixed. If a plane is shot down it should have longer cool downs. But, it's getting there. If you're a COH fan, you finally.... maybe.... might add this to your library.


UPDATE- As of the newest patch emerald bear or something.

The game is *Better* but still not there, the multiplayer matches are too short, about 10 minutes a match. The balance is still off, the amount of allied air power is just WAY too much, playing as the US is just... easy...

Even with the patches, don't bother. I got denied the refund so I've played two games. It's clunky, vehicles skate around like they're on ice. They drive dumb ways. Don't buy it. Don't give them money for this garbage. My loss for buying it is your gain for someone telling you DONT BUY IT.

I bought it. I shouldn't have imo.

Gates of Hell does everything better. I bought this because I wanted the grand campaign and the Africa setting. But it.... doesn't feel like COH. It feels like CNC Generals. It's arcade, the vehicle combat is HORRIBLE. I will likely be begging for a refund even at 3.4 hours.

I originally had a positive review simply due to the release of this game being significantly better than its predecessor. 

Nearly 3 months into this game, there are issues with the most basic features of an RTS game. Controlling your units is an utterly frustrating task. Commanding a unit to go to a location most often than not will result in the unit taking what has been coded as the ""Best Path Available"". This can be significantly unintuitive simply because of the poor coding involved.

Ex: A unit will use a path or road instead of a more direct route. Instead of heading to a capture point directly, it will opt to travel down a trench because it can travel faster inside the ditch. However, the unit will pause or get hung up on the exit where the unit has to course correct. 

Tanks will opt to maneuver (f off steam this is a word) towards a road or path to complete any command. And unfortunately the coding dictates that the vehicles should travel to the center of a road causing bottle necks. A tank destroyer would use the road, exposing its side, to then turn and face the enemy. Potentially showing rear armor to a new flank... Instead of B lining thru the grass directly to the target.

Relic recently fixed the reverse issues. But, commanding a tank near a road on the far side of the map... In lapse, you could find a vehicle racing towards the frontline in reverse due to the bad code for pathing. (It took the quickest route to the road in reverse and continued to its destination backwards.)

I mean, it's the most, absolutely, basic design of a RTS to control the units under your command. Relic couldn't get that right. Rant over.

Edit: Relic have taken measures to fix many problems with the game and is currently in a very playable version.

Many of the issues I had with vehicle pathing have been fixed, tho other annoying issues have come up. Such as armored vehicles choosing to drive in large loops to travel to newly ordered nearby positions instead of just turning in place.

Multiplayer is the most balanced ANY Company of Heroes game has ever been. Tho there are still issues with units. Such as Rangers being what Shocktroopers were at the beginning of CoH2. Except they also get flamethrowers and bazookas.

Release Date:  23 February 2023

Strengths:
-Good multiplayer gameplay

Limitations:
-Less variety in factions and units
-Rating system is poorer than COH2 and looks like it is still in development
-Interface is inferior to COH2 
-Graphic animations especially bullets and explosions are slow and inferior to COH2

Conclusion:
COH3 has not been the worthy successor of COH2 which is still an awesome game. This is probably due to the fact that the actual Relic team has been disbanded and the new team just couldn’t replicate the gameplay, graphics or mechanics of COH2. This being said, the game is not bad though. Its multiplayer is fun to play and maybe the only reason to buy this game. Single player is absolutely crap. The game’s interface is inferior to COH1 and COH2. COH3 is made probably to please the kids rather than mature players. Graphics are OK but not better than COH2. Factions are Wehrmacht and Afrika Corps, Italians on the Axis side and USA, British on the Allies side. The positive aspects of COH3 is that they have brought several elements of COH1 into this game like multiple fuel points as opposed to only 2 per map in COH2, units like Flak88, motorcycle, ketenkrad etc. are available in this game. Several new tanks like panzer 3, black prince churchill, matilda, Italian light tanks etc. have been included. Infantry units are more or less the same only differing in weaponry here and there. Overall, it is a fairly decent game but definitely overpriced for the content it offers. But it is worth buying for the good multiplayer gameplay. It makes sense to buy it on sale.

I been sticking on COh2 for a long time because I love the fraction, maps, and commander with intel etc and the strategy game graphic, UI/UX design and units design with combat and path finding is extremely polished and I enjoy it. 

I avoided Coh3 for a while because I knew it would need more of a polish worked or adjustment once it came out. I brought Coh3 in December. I really enjoy the PVP and it's actually more exciting and more creative than Coh2. 

It hard to explains, but you can never compare Coh2 to Coh3. not in a bad way, but Coh3 is unique and have their own strategy. Even with 2,000 hours in Coh2 I had to do a lot of learning and made painful mistake to get used to the units and its fraction to understand its strength and weakness. 

After a while, I'm having so much fun in PVP and it been really exciting to see how tide of battle can just change with just a good flank or clever strategy attack.  

For the Campaign, it super fun. Italy and Africa is great. (also a good introduction for someone who never played any Coh)",1706491040,1706491040,True,41,8,0.655506432056427002,0,True,False,False

Update 2024 : Almost 1 year after the release, the game is still SUPER unbalanced, really isn't fun. I miss the good old days of COH1. Even COH2 which was also unbalanced was way better than this. It seems to me that RELIC decided to place the emphasis on selling you stuff from their store more than actually producing a game that is worth playing and balanced. Time to uninstall this crap, and yes I do not recommend it to anyone.

Old update :

Game was mediocre on release with lots of bugs and things they could have easily fixed before the release such as the team color fiasco. But they released a few patches that barely addresses any issues but they did spent a lot of time on the in-game store to have you spend money however!! Release shows where their priority is.

COH3 is all about spamming red smoke, British Artillery. Really boring..

After playing COH and COH2 for years, COH3 is a monumental piece of crap which I can't recommend to anyone. Avoid like the pest. It is not worth the money they charge and even at half the price I would not buy it.

The map design feels like a drop off in previous games, the factions feel like a step backwards, and the campaign while an innovative attempt to do something different, gets extremely stale and tedious halfway through. There is thankfully still a story campaign and while I found the missions in that campaign really fun and it delivered a very different angle (Rommel's Afrika Korps) they also made a very bizarre narrative choice in primarily following a Benhgazi family's story, none of which ever seems to connect to anything you are doing in the Campaign. And to top it all off the campaign just sort of ends, there wasn't really a climax and because the story isn't connect to the missions at all it felt very strange to see the credits just roll out of the blue.

The Italian campaign in my honest opinion is the best single player feature for CoH3. I really like the ability to manage several companies and go on various missions through the Italian countryside and having to find a delicate balance between Blitz'ing your way North to Rome, or creating defensive positions to protect against German counter attacks. Even now I'm still learning how to properly manage the companies through the advance North, as I've gotten a couple of companies nearly killed or cut off from supply by advancing too far, or driving into a defensive trap.

My only complaint for the campaign is that there is not a way to autocomplete some battles, which take place once you try to capture an enemy city, or defend a city you own. Some of these battles are scripted missions, which I can understand why you can not skip those. But others are generic skirmishes, which can be somewhat boring due to being repetitive having to do them over and over again.

My principal complaint for multiplayer, and my reason for not recommending it for multiplayer is the lack of proper unit control. I've looked carefully and could not find a way to select all of the same unit (EG: Panzergrenadiers), which takes valuable time to select them one at a time, especially since it's easier to have several of the same unit compared to CoH 2.

My other 2 complains are as follows:

The bland animations and sounds for explosive weapons - artillery, support guns and mortars. They sound almost cartoon like and the explosion effects are waaay under powered compared to Company of Heroes 2.

Last but not least, is the lack of insensitive to use specialized armor -EG: heavy tanks. In my personal experience playing multiplayer, I've found it's better to spam lower cost, lower pop cap tanks such as standard Shermans or Panzer IIIs rather than invest into a few Tigers or Easy 8 Shermans. In CoH 2 such special armor could help gain a notable advantage thanks to their improved capabilities such as higher health. But in CoH3, I feel that most armor of any kind is a bit too fragile. 

But then again, I started playing CoH 2 well into it's later years (December 2018), so I think it's safe to say that CoH 3 will take a while to catch up to a higher standard both in overall quality and to the playerbase's expectations.",1705960113,1705984646,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

COH2 had more factions, doctrines/commanders, better voicelines, sounds, and OST. This games OST is by far the most redundant and basic as shit thing I've witnessed for a continuation of a series that will probably die solely because of how little this game brings to its fanbase in comparison to its last release. The only thing I like about this game is that its more forgiving in combat in which time-to-kill for units isn't so quick that if your eyes were not GLUED to a particular unit, they'd evaporate before the units could say they were being attacked, let alone getting their shit absolutely rocked. I will also say the auto-pathing and macro for infantry is far better in this game though. If COH2 had a mod, or maybe an update that used things like auto-resupplying unit models once they completed their retreat, I garantee every single person who play this game would drop it hands down.

MP has significant balancing issues, and cut content.  Units from the single-player are not included in the MP armies. Despite widespread balancing complaints. 

The DLC battlegroups are plainly overpowered and meant to be to encourage you to buy them. 

I was shocked when I went onto forums, reddit and community hub to be greeted by months old comments talking about my exact issues, regarding balancing and build order. The Devs know what the problems are.  

This game has potential, and it can be a lot of fun with friends. But a combination of poor balancing, bad matchmaking, cut content and limited scope make this feel like a quality of life update to COH1, with worse balancing.  It is  not a successor to COH2 because of these balancing issues. 

To be worth full price this would need more factions, more battle groups and better balancing.  At current state I would struggle to say its worth more than £20. 

There are some brilliant QOL improvements over previous COH, auto-reinforce, better maps, a clearer UI and much improved graphics make this feel newer. Cover is king, you are rewarded for micro and grenades have a lot of utility in early/mid game. 

However arcade-like health bars, and odd explosive damage distribution, and sometimes random RNG losses mean this game leaves a lot to be desired.

List of Complaints:
-The game on release day should not have even passed for an internal alpha-test build.  It had constant Bug-splat (game-crashing, exit to Windows desktop), Map texture issues (Machine Guns shooting downhill through the ground at units they could not see), and a long list of missing features (namely extra Battlegroups)
-The recent Hammer and Shield DLC should have been a free update.  The game still is not ready for release without the update.  It does not have enough new content to warrant a price-tag.  Considering the ""new"" content still does not provide any gameplay alternative for 2 of the 4 factions.  Only Wehrmacht and USA got a single new Batlegroup (taking your choices from 3 to 4).  
-Still no separate ""ranked"" and ""casual"" queues, there is only ""Quick Match"" which lumps together the absolute noobs with pre-arranged squads of try-hards smurfing.  As a result, there is someone who quits in every single match.  Sometimes it is when your team is ahead, which is baffling to say the least.
-Simple common-sense balance changes are desperately needed.  Some infantry units laugh off a grenade directly beneath their feet, while others lose half their HP.
-My biggest complaint is the AI/pathing.  The units are just so stupid, it really breaks my immersion in the game.  If you know the one scene in Austin Powers where he somehow gets a small golf-cart wedged in a narrow corridor, that is how the vehicles behave in this game.  You have to babysit the pathing so very much on every unit, but vehicles are by far the worst.

Hopefully SEGA and Relic give this game the resources it really needs to shine.

The only upside is that you can earn these battle groups through gameplay, even if it might take a month to get enough in-game currency for it. 

Relic already had an established release flow in CoH2, they would release battle groups in-between major faction additions. We should have already had several battle groups and a new faction on the horizon, which is what worries me.

It's with a heavy heart that I write this review because I waited so long for this game. After 450 hours in COH 1 and 1700 in COH 2, I was so excited when this game was announced. Yet sadly, the absolutely fumbled this release and it is absolutely not worth playing.

Pros (There are some surprisingly)
+ Expanded light vehicle gameplay: They really made light vehicles a much bigger and more impactful part of the game.
+ Colorful and lively battlefields:  It is nice to see some pops of color in the map, and I think the maps are enjoyable to play as well.

I really tried to think of more, but I just can't there are soooo many ways this game falls short.

Cons
-Audio and Visuals: Somehow it feels like this game has downgraded from 2 in both of these areas somehow, even though it was released 10 years later.
-UI: Again, another downgrade from 2. The UI just looks and feels outdated and sluggish. 
-Unit Diversity: While it seems like there are a lot of different units, most of them actually don't feel any different to play. It is just not as meaningful to build a diversified army in this game, it just makes the gameplay bland and boring.
-Lack of Outplay Ability: This kind of goes with the above point, but skillful gameplay just doesn't feel rewarded in the same way. In 2, if you flanked with a couple of shock troop squads in the early/mid game, you could do some serious damage. Now, flanking maneuvers feel almost useless as enemy troops can just retreat with ease. It works the same for you, but it just feels boring that nothing you do is actually rewarded in this game. It just comes down to who can have the most units on the field, rather than who can most skillfully use what they have.
-Battlegroup System: I originally thought this was a cool idea, and it was at first, but it got stale so fast. Even though a lot of the commanders in 2 were similar, it felt that most of them actually impacted how you played. Battlegroups in this game just get so boring so quickly because there just doesn't seem to be any real identity to them, probably because like I said before, skillful play with elite units isn't really rewarded anymore.
-----MAPS: Oh my goodness, is it that hard to add new maps to a game's multiplayer pool. My friend and I have been playing the same maps since release almost a year ago now?? They added one 2v2 map in the new update. It's just ridiculous that they can't provide meaningful content in an overpriced DLC.
-DLC: To the point above, $17 is way to much for a garbage DLC that doesn't add any meaningful content. Most people play this game for the multiplayer, and adding only two new battlegroups and a few maps for that price is shameful.

There's probably more to add, but at this point, it seems fruitless. Coming from a diehard COH fan, this is a trash game, and doesn't even deserve to sit anywhere close alongside the other two entries in this franchise.

Game also seems to be more dominated by off map call ins and their counters in multiplayer, gameplay is much more like COH Online.

Still an issue with the battle groups and the expansion seeing its poorly explained how to use the new battlegroups, if you can at all.

Why are the flamethrowers the best infantry weapon in the game? Any infantry I put up against an flamethrower loses (even with multiple units).

Why can the Germans use a truck to get extra fuel and the Allies can't?

Why are German air strikes so much better than all of the ally air strike abilities?

Why does the German machine gun and anti tank guns have such a wider arc than the allies? 

Why are the German flamethrowers so much better than the allies?

Why do the Germans get such better emplacements than the allies?

Why do the Germans get flamethrower tanks so quickly in the game as well as half tracks?

Germans still get better commander abilities, weapons and tanks. American tanks are still under powered as well as their commander abilities. 

The game needs to be more balanced. You can not have one side more powerful than the other and still have the game be fair (everyone will just play German).

First off, let me say that the graphics are so realistic that I'm pretty sure I saw my soldiers checking their virtual watches and complaining about the weather. The attention to detail is so intense that I caught my general arguing with an AI tank about who had the right of way on the virtual battlefield.

Now, let's talk about the game's strategic depth. It's so deep that I'm convinced there's a secret level where you negotiate peace treaties and set up a diplomatic relations office right next to the enemy base. My soldiers are not just fighting; they're multitasking like it's the Battle of Gettysburg meets a TED Talk on time management.

The AI opponents are so clever that I suspect they've been taking strategy lessons from chess grandmasters. I half expect them to break into a game of poker during a ceasefire, just to keep things interesting.

But back to the WiFi issue. My connection drops more frequently than a clumsy juggler with greasy hands. I can't tell if I'm losing because of my tactical shortcomings or because my troops are staging a mutiny due to the unreliable internet service.

In conclusion, Company of Heroes 3 is a game that combines the thrill of battle with the frustration of a buffering YouTube video. If you can manage to keep a stable connection, you're in for a treat of epic proportions.

Although it is definitely not a balanced game it is headed in a good direction and has more to give in diversity of units than both CoH and CoH2 to start out with. Although CoH2 currently has way more content, that was after about 10+ years of reworks, hotfixes, game breaking bugs, and additional content before it was a fleshed out game. So at the moment, I would say that yes, CoH2 and possibly even CoH are better games at the moment I am typing this review up. However, if you'd like to experience some of the new features and better graphics than the other 2 predecessors, then get it on sale for it to be a good deal. Eventually this game will be better than the others, but 1 year in is not enough time for this to be reality yet. However, I personally will keep playing CoH3 to explore all the new units and battlegroup abilities it has to offer.

Also, keep this in mind when reading my response, I only play skirmish, custom game (multiplayer), and quickmatch (multiplayer) at the moment. And I've only really played these modes on the 2 predecessors as well because that is where these games shine brightest in the RTS realm of games. It is a lot of fun, but be mindful that this game still has a lot of updates and work ahead before it is fully worth the ~$60 it costs.

I hope people find this review helpful :)

DAK campaign is traditional RTS campaign and is really good, with diverse missions.

The game was rushed in state where even some unit icons were taken from the previous game. 
Let's start with the pros:
+It's company of heroes so it maintains the great squad based combat of previous games.
+ Multiplayer matches are a bit faster.
And that's all

Now cons:
- DAK campaign is narrated from civilians point of view and it brakes the immersion. This is WW2 RTS game, I'm not intersted in stories of civillians.
-Italian campaign is a cheap reap-off of total war style campaign but it lacks any thirills. There are very few skirmish maps that makes this mode really boring.
-Terrible opponents AI. This is probably the worst AI in the franchise. Mediocore player like me can beat the most difficult AI in 10 minutes.
- Sega and Relic decided that month after the releasy the most needed feature of the game was premium shop. No balancing changes, no polish or QoL updates- just a money shop to squeeze more money from player base.
- In multiplayer the game has really cheasy meta that makes the game not enjoyable to play as any faction.
My verdict- do not buy. The game can share the fate of DoW3 in upcoming months.
Attitude of developers didn't changed very much. They try to suck some more money from player base with overpriced DLC. I also noticed that they rised the price in my currency(Polish Zloty).

compared to the previous games in the series, this one gets boring fast and just lacks content to keep me hooked.

 The campaign idea was great, it reminded me of the campaign mod from LOTR BFME2. however you see so many of the same maps it get boring really fast. In fact I'd say the #1 problem for the game is general is the lacking of both in larger sizes size and different/unique locations.

This is the largest update thus far. Included with the DLC are two new Battle Groups. Very exciting, although they're a little OP. The main menu has been totally revamped; it both looks and feels much better. It's more similar to CoH2's menu layout now. Visually, they took things up a notch. If you have a top-shelf computer, you are going to be in for a real treat! Graphics are starting to look real nice! They finally added match replays too. These are just some of the highlights of this patch.

CoH3 is starting to get close to my original expectations. They decided to persevere and not go the route of DoW3. Relic needs to continue focus on adding multiplayer content in the form of Battle Groups and new maps. They need to keep giving this game the attention it deserves.

The Support upgrade a player chooses is too dependent one what battle group you use. Only one support group has a synergy with one other battlegroup. If you dont choose that one support upgrade you lose. Its too linear. Also the benefits for some of them imo are too strong and should be toned down to get people to want to choose others. 

 Suppression splash is huge, splitting infantry units works only if the two squads are almost completely opposite each other when in the firing arc. Need to be toned down by alot. Smoking AoE is also so small it is almost useless. It has to land on top of the unit you are smoking for an effect. Lack of artillery on US is shit. 

Scouts are useless unless they are vet one or get their upgrade. Doesn't even have a good sight radius. How is it that the scout squad can only do their job after investment? Increase their sight range by a bit more, like 4 or 5 when they stand still. 

US AT option early is a bazooka squad which is garbage. Cant even pressure a light vehicle well only keep it honest. Which means now you have a unit eating your economy due to upkeep. Change all vehicle acceleration and deceleration. increase the time it take for a vehicle to reach both top speed and how long it takes to stop. 

The Axis grenade launcher should should have a wind up before firing or smaller max range, not by much. All i see are people who get 3 to 4 squads of that shit and just wipe a squad. The back off to reload. There is no way to capitalize.

TL;DR - The game is a poor DLC to CoH2 and is not worth the full price. If you want to try it out, get it somewhere cheap.

Long version:
I've gotten 40% in the Italy Campaign and I already want to give up on it and try out the North Africa one (which is, as I've heard, also pretty lackluster). The game feels barebones. Graphics are virtually the same as CoH2, voice acting is extremely poor compared to the previous entries to the series and I won't even go into how dull the campaign is compared to it's predecessors. As I don't want to spoil anything, I'll just say that they couldn't go to the effort of making different characters when playing as the British (Indian) Company during the Italy Campaign. Instead, primary and side objectives are called out by generic American troopers (which are also used for the US companies).

Both CoH1 and CoH2 (especially CoH1) had engaging campaigns that made you feel like you were a part of the faction you were playing. While playing as the Kampfgruppe Lehr in the first CoH, one could feel the fervor of defending Germany when the tides have turned. That is a memento to a well thought out game. CoH3 is anything but that.

With all that said, I shall say that there is room for correction and I hope that Relic will get their act together and do precisely that, though I will say that it doesn't bode well that they're adding additional campaign content via an overpriced DLC for a game which is itself pretty much a DLC.",1704493544,1704493544,False,78,0,0.7470511794090271,0,True,False,False

I love that COH3 is a mix of COH and COH2.

4 faction are available.
High ground mechanics are a welcome improvement to game-play, but it's broken.

I'm not a fan of the new campaign format.
Squad management sucks, I can't do ctrl+left click to select units of the same kind. WHAT?!
Unit pathing is still kind of bad.

The Italien campaign has you playing a turn based mode along side normal missions and skirmish. If I compare  this to Battle for Middle Earth 2 that also has this mode it was kind of lack luster. The forced skirmish battles were a bit boring and it would have been nice with a autoresolve on those. Also it would have been cool to build up your company units.

Im about 50/50 on this one, but i do recommend buying this on sale but Not at full price. I picked this up on the winter sale after 8 months of it being out waiting for more work to be put in the game. 

Pros- Game play is a lot more responsive in my opinion with the movement feeling alot better. 
Units feel pretty good and everything feels like its decent at its role.
Graphically looks pretty good and I don't have any complaints here  with the game running very well at max 4k settings (rtx 4090) I realize thats not what most people have but performance here is significantly better than the past 2 games and is the main reason I would recommend this.  
Workshop support is very nice, I wish modders had even more options to tweak the game or add New units. 

Cons - The campaign map is a HUGE mis-step here. I understand what they were trying to do but its really tedious and ends abruptly. You spend all this time moving all these units just for the game to end at the winter line. There was very few actual unique missions with most being a rush type victory point control on the same 2 maps over and over with you being disadvantaged. They spent way to much time on this turn based interactive map that doesn't really play well at all , instead of making campaign content. The campaign was a fun point of these games in the past but this experience wasn't good.    
Your population cap is way to low / units pop count doesn't feel appropriate.  Manpower income is to slow for players and AI are overly buffed with cheat income as usual. Thankfully workshop mods are helpful here. 
The challenges for skins are ridiculous, you should just get points for completing matches or playing campaign.

The cover system works, pretty much everything is destructible, using explosives feels incredible, carefully positioning mortar and machine gun crews and microing infantry and tanks and is an absolutely delightful experience, and when all the pieces click together you really do feel like batma- Captain Winters, directing a company sized unit.

Which is a shame, cause the campaign is hilariously unfinished. It was awful at launch, got a rework since that made the map layer a little more tolerable and tried to make minor abilities like detachments less useless, and yet it still feels like youre beta testing an amateur 4x game. Companies have a progression system but the campaign isnt long enough to really specialize any of them, and most wont even reach the very cool upgrades. Unlocking the cool ""instantly deploy two sherman tanks"" ability feels like garbage when you get to use it once in the 20 hour campaign, on the turn before its abrupt, albeit historically accurate ending. Playing the scripted missions in the campaign is great, they play like small urban combat puzzles that the game give you some tools to solve and you have to figure out, but most of the campaign will be generic skirmishes. The campaign characters could have been interesting, in a world where their stories led anywhere and they were given time to develop. Overall the single player Italy campaign feels incredibly rushed out, with some very fun story missions that were clearly meant to have a better, more coherent connective tissue woven between them that just isnt there.

Quick rundown is: 

[list]
[*] You can only retreat infantry off the map using partisan buildings in the campaign. Which is turbo-stupid for a feature that should just be available at HQ. For everyone.
[*] You can only retreat vehicles off the map from the British Command Post and it only works sometimes. Also turbo-stupid for a feature everyone should have. 
[*] Vehicle AI is way, way dumber than CoH2 with wheeled vehicles sometimes turning in place, [strike] and sometimes doing donuts. [/strike] Tanks will try and turn around to drive to a location under fire instead of reversing. And get stuck on things.
[*] Tanks will quite literally try and path around retreating enemy units instead of just running them over.
[*] Campaign loads you up on basic infantry. Wanna build your own army? Sorry charlie. That unique company ain't playing any role here. Here's six riflemen units to clog up your popcap. Made worse since you usually can't retreat them off the field.
[*] Grand strat takes some influence from Total War, but nowhere near enough. Turns are limited by action points, not movement range. There's a reason TW doesn't do it.
[*] Africa Korps campaign isn't bad, but narratively jarring. The story has nothing to do with what you're doing, or is at best tangentially related.
[*] AI is massively stupid. Outright ignoring certain units or vehicles in their rosters even when set to max difficulty. And is hilariously easy to run circles around. Both in campaign and skirmish. They never, ever pick certain battlegroups
[*] Vehicles no longer have a chance to get abandoned when hit with a crit that would otherwise kill them. Fine for factions who can salvage, sucks for everyone else. 
[*] Unique vehicle damage like broken treads, jammed turrets or destroyed weapons is gone. You get only two types of vehicle damage, light and heavy engine damage. While the competitive scene likes this, it severely limits combat variety. Which is always bad.
[*] Units have broken or wrong animations. Most obvious is paratroopers acting like their M1 Carbines are bolt-action. 
[*] UI sucks and only tells you your units are in trouble half a second before they die, but screams at you every time your enemy so much as thinks about using artillery
[*] Artillery/indirect fire weapons elevation and their fire trajectories don't match. Their AOE markers also don't match the size of the deviation zone of where shells are landing
[*] Orders sometimes just don't go through. Telling engineers to build tank-traps or fighting positions for example sometimes just cancels with no reason as to why.This also applies to telling units to do things like throw grenades or vehicles to reverse out of danger.
[*] Certain factions AA is absolutely useless unless you build several 
[*]  No way to tell AA to ignore planes, especially frustrating when applied to dual-role emplacements like the 88. 

Like others have said, there's good bones here. But some mechanics were overthought, or not thought through enough. And please Relic, don't pull the ""core pillars of game design"" garbage to defend bad decisions here. Y'all should have known better.

UPDATE: 3/28/23

So as of today Relic has had the genius idea of releasing the store with their first big patch. I'll be crossing out what they fixed with each patch, when it's definitively fixed.

The store has a premium currency and a free currency. You have to buy two different sets of premium currency to get an entire color scheme for a faction, and it costs almost a third of the base price of the game to do so. When the game is in a state where it's worth roughly half of what they're asking. 

You cannot buy skin packs with free currency, and unlike the previous game where you got free currency just for playing matches, you now have to do idiotic challenges in the form of weekly and daily ""quests"" 

For reference, there was no premium currency in the previous game, and skin packs were sold as a whole package for a faction and cost about 5.99 USD. 

Absolutely clownish move on behalf of a company that doesn't have anywhere near the amount of goodwill necessary to implement something like this. The worst part of this is that we have quite literally seen this situation play out beat-for-beat with a different game this year that played out just as badly. Relic should know better.

UPDATE: 3/31/23 As of today, you can no longer earn the palette swap currency in custom matches. Unlike the previous game. The crack-heads in Relic's Management are really just taking the cake now.

UPDATE 1/3/24: Outside of city battles, all fights in the italian campaign are now auto-resolve only. You can no longer play the RTS part of your RTS game.",1678046480,1704292823,False,2,0,0.501084625720977783,0,True,False,False

The game is far from perfect, and CoH2 is a hugely successful game to stand up to. Yes, at first CoH3 was like a beta test, but many of the bugs and graphical issues have been fixed. The Italian campaign has been slightly improved. The multiplayer factions are diverse enough to allow you to have different and varied battles. The devs seem active and respond to bugs, imbalances and issues etc. The best thing recently is that the 'major update' is purchasable via in-game currency. You do NOT have to spend money on it. You can unlock the new factions in-game. Relic kindly gave me a free 10k Merit for some reason, which I bought the US faction. I am slowly working towards the Wermacht faction. The gameplay is very fun, and returning to CoH2 you can indeed see the graphics, gameplay and camera movement is quite dated.
The main problem is the dire lack of mod support, and the fact you cannot complete in-game weekly/daily missions with mods enabled.

Pros: 
Interesting and varied campaign in a often overlooked theatre of war. 
Varied multiplayer factions with diverse playstyles.
Updated graphics, bug fixes etc make this the best looking CoH game to date.
Revamped daily/weekly challenges are easier and encourage you to play all factions.
Niche reason but I absolutely adore the varied voice lines. It's a pleasure to listen to your troops talk and yell throughout the game.
Sound is ok but not amazing. Sounds a lot better but some rifles sound like peashooters.

Cons:
Italian campaign is fun but Germans never attack. It's just a slow slog of various maps. You basically cannot lose. Varied campaign maps.
Not many multiplayer maps compared to other CoH games. You will get bored quickly. This is weird because there are a lot of unused single player maps not available in multiplayer.
Worst thing is lack of mod support, and being unable to use mods for daily/weekly challenges. Benefit is the game is good enough to not need them.",1677691019,1704254622,True,0,0,0.513797283172607422,0,True,False,False

Each entry has had its ups and downs but CoH 3 has straight up been a buggy mess and unfortunately for the price that they are charging it is still unplayable.

I was able to squeeze in 16 hours, that went by so quickly. That my brain is spinning from the complete frustration of being locked out of continuing the Italian campaign due to a bug that I have come to find out happens often to other players. And this is after the MAJOR UPDATE that was just released recently. 

The game is so buggy that I have witnessed the code glitch and give me values that I should not have been seeing when my units get defeated. Or that the map for singleplayer produce code for when the units are damaged instead of the amount that is color coded. Its been so difficult to play without seeing something minor go wrong and up until me writing this confusing review, I considered it part of the game (like CoH 2, until the modding community released patches to fix the issues. Thank you to those who have the time and knowledge.) 

I genuinely regret purchasing this game even on sale, for the big mess that it is and sincerely hope this helps others understand that this should not be a fully released game at its current price point, let alone playable. 

I wish I had taken the time to screen grab everything I experienced, instead of keeping my hopes up that the game is worth it.

Afrika Korps campaign is mediocre, there are some good missions but I think the game doesn't push you hard enough time wise to assault positions. Story wise, I see what they were trying to do hopping between the jewish and nazi viewpoints - but its not very well executed. I think the story could have been better served by a separate partisan campaign that intertwines with the Afrika Korps one or by supplementing the cutscenes with narrative heavy partisan campaign maps. 

 Italian campaign is so buggy I got soft locked on the turn based portion, had to restart my campaign, had a different soft lock, and gave up. This was the main reason I bought the game, so this was pretty disappointing. I'm planning on revisiting it if it gets fixed.

The game was launched in a bad state, similiar to Age of Empires IV, heck I could say this one launched with even less feature and worse than AoE IV. But I believe they can turn things around too, with the recent 1.4 Update, the game is now in far more better state, BUT still need more polish imo, which I will talk about in a moment.

As for me, a Single Player enjoyer, I have fun times with the Italian Campaign, albeit there's been a three instance where the mission bugged and I can't finish it, forced to restart the whole mission again. And after it will get repetitive later down the line. So my opinion on the Italian Campaign is pretty mixed, while its fun, the bugs can get really irritating. 

The African Operation is your standard 8 mission linear Campaign where as the Deutsches Afrikakorps. I played a couple of the mission, its fun and I like it more than the Italian Campaign because its way less repetitive. 

For the Skirmishes, you have 4 faction right out of the gate this time around, unlike the previous entry which is only 2 and the rest come as a DLC. You have the standard US Forces, the returning British Forces, Wehrmacht, and the new Deutsches Afrikakorps which plays kinda similiar to OKW from CoH 2. While all factions are really fun and felt unique to one or another, the Commander system from CoH 2 is now replaced with Battlegroups, which function like a hybrid of the Commander and the Company from CoH 1, complete with the points tree to choose from. As for the bad, British Forces plays kinda weak to me (or maybe I'm just suck at the game LMAO) and there's still very few maps to play on. Relic promises to bring more maps in the future update so finger crossed on that.

Overall, despite of few annoyance with the bugs, I like it. And as for someone who can't get into CoH 2 but love CoH 1, CoH 3 is really felt like a mix of both. Feel like CoH 1 but with nice quality of life changes from 2 and more. Oh and as it right now (when this review published), there's very minimal microtransaction, only few skins and you can buy 2 additional Battlegroup with earnable Merits (which has far better grind than CoH2 lootbox system).

Pros:

-I like the asymmetry of the factions more so than CoH2. Perhaps I just never embraced CoH2's factions as much as I should have, but I like being able to paradrop Fallshirmpioneers and American HMG's at the beginning of a match in CoH3 (if I wish). CoH2 felt boring with the same ""builds"" over and over again. There's variety in how I play the game, how I defeat my opponent.

-I think I've maybe crashed 2-3 times in the span of almost a year with most of those crashes being when the game first launched (because devs and the QA teams just love sending out products that aren't finished). Certainly better than CoH2's constant crashes that even last to this day; less for me personally but still happens for other players.

Cons:

-The Italian campaign is boring. There is no soul. As much as some like to disrespect the CoH2 Soviet campaign, at the  very least it tried to invoke somewhat reasonable emotion or attention from the player. CoH1 was inspired by films and TV series like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. Enemy at the Gates influenced CoH2's campaign. But I'm sitting here wondering what CoH3's campaign is supposed to represent? Take inspiration from. Be influenced by. I got two commanders, one American and one British, telling me what to do when I don't give the slightest **** what they have to say. The Soviet commander in CoH2's campaign would kick the **** out of these two.

-The North Africa operation campaign is a little better, but still lacks any substance. I think they mention the plight of the Jews in Libya and then...do nothing with that information. There was also a cutscene where this Libyan is salty that the British bombed his hometown and he started to question the side he was fighting on...but the Germans were occupying his town and the British were attacking them there. All of it means nothing. I couldn't care less.

-SEGA fired a pretty big chunk of Relic after this games release which makes me wonder what really went down in the dev studio. I heard Dawn of War III wasn't well received and had its problems. Wonder if SEGA had enough. I think it's obvious the same people who made CoH1 and even CoH2 aren't around anymore, so who knows what's going to come from this game or franchise in the future.

-They really couldn't give Italy there own faction. I mean, come on, from the number of Italian units given to Afrika Korps, they honestly couldn't give a little more effort and make a separate Italian faction? I just know in another year we're going to receive the Soviets and it'll be right back to 3 Allies and 2 Axis factions yet again. I wanted an even faction split this game and hell they had the Italian theater to boot, but no.

I probably have a little more to say about CoH3, but maybe I'll edit this at a later date if I find something cool or hate. Balance is alright (except for Americans, F u Rangers). Certainly better than when this game released (unkillable Flak emplacement and OP flamethrowers LMAO).",1704002924,1704002924,False,5,0,0.524439871311187744,0,True,False,False

The DLC is a bit of a shambles really, it should of been free DLC no purchase is necessary for the way the game has been handled.
However the devs has made some remarkable improvements which should of been there since Alpha but whatever. I have to recommend this game, we need more people to play and not let this die like DoW3- at least this time we have consistent updates unlike DoW3....

Overall, the Italian campaign in COH3 has diverted from the original story telling to a more ""realistic strategic approach"" which led a drier approach compared to the original COH2 Russian campaign. The Italian campaign is somewhat lacking in terms of story telling (I get that people would compare this to the Russian story telling in COH2). Still, some missions are really fun. Given the UI seemed to be a bit of a downgrade compared to the COH2's epic UI, I understand why some people really get the feeling of getting a rip off. However, the game itself is actually pretty fun.

What I like most about COH3 is the North Africa Campaign which we have an opportunity to play as German Africa corp (HELLA HARD and FUN). It's really cool to play as the Axis, I really hope the developer would develop a sort of an opposing perspective.

P/S:
In this age of micro transaction and online multiplier gaming industry, the story arc is sometime forgotten. I guess what people really want is the feeling of immersion as to feel the heat and the difficulties which is best expressed in a hero/villain of a good story telling campaign. I sure hope that the developers would make the game that they once made while incorporating the new AI/technology.

------- 1.4 UPDATE -----------

I will say that I am bored of the CoH series in general, as I have played the series since 2006. However, CoH 3 was in a better launch state on release than CoH1 or CoH2 imo.

I played the game recently to see what the updates have done.

There has been some effort to update the UI and add some quality of life features, as well as the graphics in general.

My main issue with the game and always has been since I played early builds is that it offers nothing new for me. I feel it's a game I enjoyed massively from 2006 with better graphics and net code.

I can see the appeal for some people but for me I am not interested and I just got bored playing a few games and uninstalled it again.

I am much older now and I don't have as much time to play games. So, I need a game that has shorter queue times and shorter matches. CoH matches still take ages to finish and I feel quite burnt out after one or two games, win or lose, I just feel happy that the match is over rather than happy about a win. Which I don't think is good imo.

The series really needs a new game mode for team game players, I just don't think victory point control or annihilation are good modes for 3v3 and up. I did play some 2v2 and 1v1 and also got bored after a few games.

So for me, the game is going to have a negative review because I find it boring, I feel matches are draining and I feel unsatisfied after winning matches.",1680899411,1703953908,False,6,0,0.526315808296203613,0,True,False,False

Pros:
 up to date graphics, awesome.

Animations and mechanics of the game, awesome. you can scroll out far enough to watch AA take down a plane.
Made some of the buildings such as tanks traps and barb easier to place? yes but not yes to all. 
good designs, yes.
Ecstatic for the release? yes but couldn't afford to pre order. 

Can it be confusing? Not really no. you do have to get used to it like any game but there are some better hints compared to COH2.

Can you edit custom games? Yes, more than COH2 which is brilliant.

Cons:
Is there more content? no. If any, there's less. Think about it, the all unit mod for COH2 wasn't released at the same time as COH2 but after. COH3 got an all unit mod 3 days after release. that shows you the lack of content for playing to standard.

is there more units and different variations? no. if any, there's less for example, COH2 had five armies, this game has four. 

Is there still commanders? no, just battle groups which I do not like because, so far, you can pick up to three (similar to COH2) to go to battle with, but, you pick one in a game, you then don't get all the content from that battlegroup and have to stick with whatever decisions you have which isn't much. I do like the fact that the commander points are used to unlock them though.

Are the DLCs any good? so far, no. not at all. if anything, there's no point. expensive for nothing  and all reviews are saying that too. In COH2, you got your moneys worth and so far this year. the season pass is terrible.

Can you level up like COH2? I like the fact that it shows your rank but unlike COH2, you can only level up by PVP which is crap because I only play against bots. I preferred earning only 2000 points like COH2 because it was something to earn free/ basic  stuff with including perks that given a small boost to different units. 

Can you customise your profile? no. you couldn't in COH2 but it looks like you can in COH3 and it would be awesome. anyone who pre ordered does get a cool banner but that's it. you can't edi it or remove it.

can you build any where around your spawn? no. COH2 was much better and allowed you to build side by side, COH3 keeps having a LOT of building placement issues.

Is there more units and tanks compared to the old game? no. there's a lot less and feels less and you have to rely on the less powerful  which is unfair and not exciting. Im not saying a nashorn is weak, but I would like more options to back it up  than just a marder which gets annihilated late game and against veteran bots.

Are units any stronger or weaker? They are more weaker  but I do like the veteran levels have been kept which makes them a bit better but even then.

Can you buy more skins and commanders for your armies? Yes, but I get a massive feeling everytime looking at them and saying, they are not worth buying because there isnt many units for the skins to look nice with and like I previously mentioned, there isnt many battlegroups to choose from and they don't benefit each other in battle. for example, here's a recon plane that continues in a straight line from one side of the map to the other. And the only arty you have can't reach the area where you ping. 

How would I rate COH3:
There was a huge impatience for this game but sadly even though I recommend it, I still heavily recommend COH2. more content, and it doesn't make you feel shafted bu the developers. Releasing DLC that contains a drawing and a brush that is preferably weak in general for the matches is very bad especially for the price. trust me, the mods help cover this. 

I preferred the commanders and their perks from COH2 as they work with each other. For example, Russian's assault commander allows you to call in tanks and get self tank repair for it. a defensive commander allowed you to create either a 152mm or a 200 mm gun with recon which helped with long range engagements But, not in this, heres an artillary piece and a boost in infantry's verteran level. okay? 

Building tank traps are less messy compared to COH2 though . it was a nightmare trying to get a unit to create tank traps in a specific pattern. I generally expected MORE content for both standard game and DLC to make it more exciting. Especially more factions to make it far more interesting. As well, I absolutely loved mass artying areas on the map at once with all artery but in COH3, you have to do it individually which sucks. I do miss the russian faction because they are a more newbie army to play with and had some really amazing units like the 120mm mortar and 152 / 200 mm arty. not to mention the KV1 and ISU152. 

Play it if you want but its up to you. this is my review. 
I give it 7/10 BUT similar to my youtube channel, I am happy to change my review IF the developers do change and add stuff. 

Which do you prefer COH2 or COH3?

This is something I now regret having actually played this game and have found it is significantly better than it predecessor games. 

I have been playing the CoH series since the first and in particular I played CoH 2 the most, purchasing it as soon as it came out on steam since I love the Soviet Front history, and playing as the Soviet Union was an awesome experience. Every game was intense and I enjoyed every moment of it even when being thoroughly slaughtered which is kind of the point that many players miss is that you can have an awesome, replay saving worthy game, even when on the losing side of the battle. So when I compare CoH 3 I should be comparing it to CoH 2 and to this CoH 3 does not disappoint. 

Quality of Life changes  
1. Auto reinforce feature which reduces admin time during game
2. Automatic base building which frees up engineers for battle which 
 - In CoH 2 building led to some imbalances as sturm pioneers built quicker than everyone 
3. Towing functionality gives use to all those light non combatant trucks but serves a tactical purpose 
4. Tank riding makes mobile deployment of infantry easier 

Balance enhancements 
For those that bitch about balance just remember that balance has always been excruciating e.g. CoH 2
- Dual King Tiger with Dual shreck Volks blob
- Clown car with passenger sniper soviets (early)
- Instant fallscrimjager 
- Sim city Brits and PE points camping 
- Jet engine Panthers spam 
- Instant artillery kill stuka call in 
- Ober super humans spam 
- 4 man squad for Wehr means easier squad loss from mortar spam 
- Blobbing in general being a viable strategy 
Obviously balance is always a concern at the competitive level but I would like to remind everyone that this is always an iterative process 

Balance improvements from CoH 3 mechanics 
1. All factions base build which removes the whole sim city camping that was prevalent from Panzer Elite and British forces in CoH 2 
2. Emphasis on light vehicles and light tanks over heavy tanks (compared to CoH 2) means that an armoured rush usually consists of vehicles which can be knocked out by infantry and early AT or AA guns 
3. Due to the emphasis on light vehicles there isnt as much of that impenetrable wall of steel in the late game compared to CoH 2 which balances of the game for the side deprived of fuel resources 
4. Basic troop squad sizes are larger 5-6 means that squad integrity is better maintained compared to the lower sizes of the Wehr and British in CoH 2 
5. Gun and support weapon crews comparative sizes between factions 
6. Simple Doctrine options compared to the multiple generals of CoH 2 which makes balance easier

Really big disappointment for me, as a long term fan of the franchise I can definitely see why CoH2 still has more active players. Worth noting that I don't play PvP and even though I appreciate the focus on a lengthy dynamic campaign for CoH3 the whole things feels very plastic and soulless, I hate using the term ""woke"" but it best describes the way the narrative, characters and story are handled, it's almost like they hired failed Disney writers. The sound design is just terrible, neither being atmospheric or realistic, and the vehicles and animations are somehow worse than CoH2.

Too add insult to injury they have the b***s to release a so called massive expansion that literally only includes two doctrines that should have been a free content update. They have focused majorly on monetising the cash store with skins, all of which look as cartoony and bad as the base game skins anyway, like literally the skins are just different colours for your units. Pay $15 to get your infantry in a slightly different shade of brown.

I dont know why game companies think that 3rd instalments of games need to be so changed up. If people like the previous games, why go for a totally different design/method? just make the gameplay better/smoother, update the graphics and have new, interesting campaign/story for us. As much I as thoroughly enjoy turn based games, I cant help but wish they just stuck with the old method of a linear campaign. The map is impressive but moving companies around can be a boring as it means limited game-play.

To capture a town 3 things can happen;
1)Your company shoots the town and immediately captures it, done with no gameplay of fighting.
2)A skirmish happens and you play a small map with a simple objective like surround the enemy base, take out 3 enemy emplacements or have more victory points/tickets. Which overtime becomes boring as maps are always reused and switching between only those 3 objectives. The objectives are also a pain due to either the limited resources you're given at the start, the limited units your given or can recruit for that mission and the limited tickets your start with which can make you lose very quickly.
3) The town is part of a mission or side mission which is the only fun and variety in this game, which makes me enjoy them more than anything else.

The whole game makes me think this is both a massive step back or step down. It lacks so much of what the other games had. This game seems very limited on everything from units, specials, maps and doctrines to choose from and they have taken out a lot of features that CoH2 had that made it fun and unique, Such as being able to kill a tank crew and then steal the enemies tank. The lack of build-able emplacements or trenches make it so holding ground or RP trench warfare is no longer a option and the unlockables in the doctrines are limited and choosing one locks you out of anything interesting and limits you to just a few recruitable units like panthers or gun emplacements, which should be standard, they shouldn't be not locked.

The DLC feelsl ike something they rushed out for the people that paid the high price to include future DLC that they said would be coming this year so they threw out 2 quick battle groups before the end of the year .  But hey you can use them in the STILL Broken Italian Campaign.

It greatly needs a surrender vote button, more ranked maps, see last match stats and option to rejoin a map if the game crashed.

- Strange shot sounds of units. Some are very cool and even... cosmic? Some guns may sound like from star wars, like by Wirbelwind.
- Huge lack on units and universality of existing. Maybe it's the main idea behind US or wehrmacht, but I don't like that every riflemen squad has AT and AP grenades like soviet conscripts in COH2. It is only one example. There are much more of some sort things.
- Strange marketing strategy which expects from you to buy DLCs with doctrines, which aren't really interesting and cost very much.

Most important in the game is immersive.
- Tanks feel like papers which easily burn when destroyed.
- Rounds feel like playing a mobile game. Everything is filled with colors and low detailed effects. Objects, besides, are great detailed.

However, this is the third installment and as such it has a certain standard to uphold or even exceed and this game really falls short of that. Yes, the game has improved over time, but that does not excuse the fact that this game was near unplayable for the first few months after release. It is not like they had to experiment or reinvent the wheel or anything as Coh1 came out in 2006. They had 16 years or so experience from Coh1 and Coh2, along with countless feedback from a loyal and enthusiastic fan base to really bring an impressive work of art to the players that built on the previous two games. Nonetheless, They failed horrendously like they had absolutely no idea what they were doing, but all the while building up hype and presenting an unfinished product as if it was a masterpiece that had reached the very apex of human ingenuity with such a smug demeanor that would make even a used car salesman blush and topped off with a expensive AAA price tag. Honestly, this game should have at the very least come out in a state where the development of Coh2 ended. This game hasn't even caught up to the level of playability that Coh2 currently has yet. I'm not alone with this opinion either as I still see all of my friends who have Coh3 in their library still exclusively playing Coh2.

As a devoted fan of the CoH series, I embarked on Relic's latest journey with high hopes, only to find a game that shines in parts but stumbles in others.

[b][u]Pro:[/u][/b]
+ The Africa campaign was enjoyable, albeit not groundbreaking.
+ Skirmish and multiplayer modes are excellent, with four well-designed factions.
+ Tech trees and commander abilities add great depth to the gameplay.
+ New features like building breaches, auto-vault, and tank side armors are commendable improvements.

[b][u]Contra:[/u][/b]
- The Italian campaign is plagued with bugs, causing fatal errors.
- Absence of features like game replays, limited map selection, and a confusing menu.
- Lacks a distinct identity
- The game's current state does not justify its €60 price tag.

[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]
CoH3, with its blend of good improvements over its predecessor, still manages to be a [u]GOOD[/u] game, particularly in multiplayer. However, its lack of uniqueness and various shortcomings make it hard to recommend at its full price.

Also several months ago I played a demo/trial version they released a few months before launch, and it was horrifyingly buggy and low quality. (They didn't fix a single issue since that alpha version)

So with that in mind, my personal opinion about COH3 is that it is...to be frank and pile of hot garbage. A sad excuse for a game in general, but as for being a COH game its a not so funny joke. Again when comparing it to COH2, it has worse graphics, worse sound quality, worse icon/clip art quality, jankie and unbalance game play, ect. Putting the Campaign aside, because lets be honest everyone who played COH1&2 beat the campaign and then never touched it again, we all played skirmish and multiplayer for the vast majority of time. Anyway, the Campaign aside what the development team seemed to try to do was combine COH1's game play structure, with the type of buildings, vet system, command points and what not, with the game play feeling and flow of COH2, and they just don't mix. Even if we overlook the clear downgrade of graphics, audio and unbalanced game play, just the structure of the game itself is a deal breaker. (Haven't even mentioned the micro transactions, but that's just industry standard at this point.) You can hardly hear fighting going on just off screen and even if you can the sounds of the small arms, guns, artillery and tanks are so...""Soft spoken"" you can't tell the difference between a bolt action rifle or a Pk40 going off. There is no feed back to anything that you do or that happens to your units. In COH 2 if a Russian 203MM shell went off three screens over it would be incredibly loud and your screen would shake violently. Now theres...nothing. You could stare at your base while leveling the entire map with Arty and have no idea it's even happening. The colors of the screen and hud are bland, all the controls compared to COH2 are different, some even where removed so you have to relearn everything or accept that certain controls just don't exist anymore. 

At the end of the day it's clear that COH3 is some kind of weirdly disguised cash grab, there just dosn't seem to be even an once of love poured into this game and unless you can pick it up for 5$ 10 years from now just to see the horror for yourself, don't waste your money.

COH1 was my favorite RTS after I delved into it, and while I tried to get into COH2, being years late to the party had me highly confused at pretty much everything that was being thrown my way. So many of the commanders in that game had abilities that others also had, in different slots, so it made a very difficult learning curve that stunted my desire to really learn. Didn't help that certain bugs (ie, laggy main menu) hadn't been fixed despite the longevity of the game.

COH3 on the other hand is the sequel that I wanted. COH3 takes what's good from COH1, and grabs what they learned from COH2 to create a really fun experience. While the game isn't perfect, it's a lot of fun to dive into. My only complaints I can really say compared to COH1 is that the game features an in-game store and cosmetics can make it a bit trickier to tell what unit belongs to what team, however the big icon over each squad makes this mostly a non-issue, and the dynamic campaign is seemingly bugged/rebalanced to remove the ability to turn all overworld battles into various skirmishes (I really did like those), however the multiplayer is where I spend most of my time nowadays. All of the other bugs/issues I've had from the launch of the game have been addressed at this point.

The most recent update in December of 2023 was the first content drop we've gotten, and it's been pretty fun so far. Not necessarily worth the huge pricetag, but luckily you can grind out the ability to buy them with in-game currency.

I have played both COH and COH2 over the years and always loved the style of game. Not a hardcore COH or COH2 fan by any means. I have been playing this game consistently since launch and there have been consistent and significant updates along the way. With the recent release of Steel Shepherd and the 1.4 update, COH3 is playing the best it has since launch and it seems as though the update/hotfix cadence is increasing. This game, like many strategy games is extremely satisfying when you win and very frustrating when you lose. The close games lead to very engaging back and forth. Each faction plays differently and that allows for a steep learning curve, but good flexibility if you are frustrated with one faction. Performance on my PC has been just fine, the new visual update is definitely more appealing to me. This game does play faster (shorter matches) than previous entries, which I like. I don't have hours and hours to sit down and play this at once. So to be able to play 2-3 games in 75 minutes is great.

Is the game worth $60? For me yes, I have 500 hours since launch and proceeded to purchase the Battle groups right away. I think that if you dabble in the multiplayer, play single player skirmish with each faction and trial the single player campaign then you can easily get 50 hours out of this game

   Launch was bad, currently it is now just almost at the state of where it should have been on launch. Although some of you will have to pay for the first DLC. Sega screwed this up and it shows. They needed another year and a half of development time. We have loads of re-used art assets from CoH2, textures aren't great and audio isn't great. It really lost the dark and grittiness the franchise is known for. Though the gameplay can be very fun, it can be frustrating at times because cover matters more than it ever has. I'd recommend this, but only if it's on sale. 
  More updates will be coming, but I'm really hoping this isn't Relic's last title - they haven't had the best track record with their last couple releases - noting Dawn of War 3. Tired of the ""release it in beta, complete it later"" kind of AAA titles? Well, you'll find that here. This title will improve with time, they are great developers, just with a greedy publisher.

{Pros}
- Good Gameplay
- Always able to find a match
- Probably the most enjoyable base build system
- Replayable Campaign - it's more fun on the hardest difficulty

{Cons}
- Ignore Text Chat (People with no social skills play this)
- AAA 2023 graphics are somehow worse than CoH2 (2011)
- There's hardly any maps for each mode. 
- Game certainly has less content than CoH2's release
- Quantity over quality design with factions

Shitty launch with little to no support, prioritizing the introduction of micro-transactions instead of fixing the actual issues of tha game. Really small map pool. A campaign that is not interesting and actually felt bare bones compared to CoH2.

You're gonna have to try harder than that.

Positive/helpful (if you can call it that) Feedback:
Be sure to use the Grid Keys section in the controls keybinds so you can restore your keybinds to what an RTS is supposed to have, including Classic CoH2, something CoH3 does not offer by default. You know, A=Attack Move, S=Stop, R=Reinforce. Those types of things. Or just wage war on your keyboard and make your own custom Grid-Keys keybinds. Go crazy. No one can stop you. 
Apparently just replicating controls for CoH2 or Dawn of War Soulstorm is just OUT OF THE QUESTION for some reason. 
Yeah. Devs if you're reading this, you know EXACTLY what Feedback message I am from the most recent testing. Hopefully your Hoisin Nuggets aren't loaded when Sales numbers - chargebacks & refunds come out. 

Real Feedback:
Please wait a few months/years for the developers to fix problems. They very VERY clearly just pushed the Alpha environment of the game to Production and called it full release. 
Finished tutorial. Played 1v1 skirm against Standard AI. The game crashed and prevented me from doing Alt-F4, Alt-Tab out, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, nothing. No mouse to use. Had to forcefully restart PC to exit the game. 

Found out the game uses Denuvo. Had no idea what it was so I looked it up and it's an anti-tamper to prevent pirating. It also has been reported across multiple games to cause nothing but performance problems for your PC including bricking your CPU. Some players reporting that it brings your CPU usage to 100% so your OS will crash (funny, that exact thing happened to me). I will never purchase any game going forward that uses Denuvo. $39.99, $49.99, $59.99, doesn't matter the game. Your title is worth 0 dollars to me if it means that you're going to fucking destroy my $700 CPU. You're in lawsuit beaches at this point. I pray that you don't go full retard and jump in the water. 

Like other reviews have already stated:
- Machinegun Fire is quiet as a mouse
- There's no visual for Machineguns like there is in CoH2. If you're not paying attention you WILL lose squads
- Tanks look like Army Men 3D. 
- AI still, post-alpha, do very questionable things; especially AI Wehrmacht who appears to try to dig tunnels with their AA Turrets. 
- Supposed to be a bunch of factions but there's only 4. Instead of multiple factions they broke up those plans to create Battlegroups aka subfactions aka factionception. 
- The UI is just, idk what it is. It sucks. It doesn't do it for me. I know you can customize it but things like suppression or squad near death do not at all stand out.

Im sorry...  I just cant recommend this game as it stands.

I bought this for the campaign single player.  I always have.  The multiplayer stuff to me is an afterthought and honestly Ive rarely ever touched it.

The campaign here is hands DOWN the most tedious, boring, melatonin enhanced buttchugged nyquil enducing thing I have ever suffered through in my entire life.  Ive endured it for 7 hours now.. and Ive actually FOUGHT about 4 actual battles.  All of which I stomped the AI within 10-15 minutes tops.  So 1 hour of ACTUAL playing the game..  6 hours of staring at the boring uninspired dull map slogged my 2 companies across it for HOURS just to try and find SOMETHING to actually FIGHT.

Whats that?  A Gun emplacement?  Oh sorry, you just lost about 1/3rd your life (or more).  Yeah, you auto walked on it through the ""fog of war"".  Cant dodge it, Cant stop moving towards it, cant do anything except take it in the face.  Oh sorry.. its JUST outside your movement range (It ALWAYS will be) ... so end your turn so you can watch german planes fly across the giant map, and then spin in circles for 10 straight ()#*$ing minutes... start your next turn.  Engage and kill the gun emplacement..  Oops.  Sorry.. thats your turn!  Time to watch more planes fly in circles!!!  

Rinse.  Repeat.  Over.  and Over.  and OVER again.  For 6 Straight hours.

You paying 60 bucks for that?  Cause if the answer's yes... you need your head examined.  

I didnt even see any German armies running around trying to fight me.  Except for 1 scripted one that attacks your town in the beginning.  Just empty miles and miles of space.. filled with gun emplacements.  Game shoulda been called ""Company of Gun Emplacements 3""

and the bugs.. my GOD the bugs..  there's an airfield just north of my base.  Its somehow losing life every turn.  So I run up to repair it.  As SOON as I active the repair skill on it... BAM.  Crash to Desktop.  Every time.  Doesnt matter what or how or who does it.. the second its repaired.  INSANT crash.  

The UI is ok.. its not amazing or groundbreaking, but I think some people are over-reacting to it.

The view I think is also fine.  Anyone whining about how ""close"" the camera is needs to go load up the original Dawn of War series.  THEN come talk to me about the camera here.  

The entire campaign needs a MASSIVE overhaul to be even playable (It'll never get it.  They got their money from all the multiplayer kids.. the campaign will be forgotten quickly.)",1677992566,1703139754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Replays are in! Half the fun of the game is watching your heroic achievements replayed for you.
2) More Battlegroups! Only 2 so far but they are purchasable with in game experience points gained and so I have to give a double thumbs up to Relic for one, not making the DLC stupidly expensive, only ~$17, and also for giving players an opportunity to achieve the battlegroups without paying out of pocket. Well done.
3) While this can still occur, especially if you've been stomped most of the game, but a lot of balancing has occurred and infantry blobs will often end up as stew meat when facing high explosives.
4) Vehicles are in a good place of Risk/Reward. There are a few occasions when the Vehicle spam can occur when facing/playing specific battle groups, but overall it FEELS like it should, where vehicles can be hard countered, but when used correctly with infantry and vision, offer high damage fire support and maneuverability.
5) More maps! 

OUTDATED:
Unfortunately, CoH3 has a number of significant issues that make it so I can't recommend this game. 

Firstly, there are a lot of small touches that seem bizarre that they were overlooked. 
1. No Replays- The only way to watch a replay in this game is to hard code the game to launch a game file that is a saved temp file. It seems absurd to me that the game did not launch without a player to watch your replays. Not excusable in an RTS. 
2. It splits the difference between CoH1 & 2 battlegroups but doesn't pull it off well. In CoH2, you had a large selection of commanders but their tech tree was linear, in CoH1 you had only 3 commanders but there was more decision making along the tech paths. CoH3 looks like it might have more battlegroups in the future to give you some of the variety of CoH2 commanders, but currently it has only 3 and it plays like CoH1, but the command point system seems to be not optimized well.
3. Infantry blobs or unit spams are the opposite of what makes Company of Heroes RTS style a good game. COH is about coordinating different types of units to function in a combined and effective way. Spamming Infantry with Flamethrowers or Anti Tank rifles is exactly the opposite of the games play style, but unfortunately is effective.
4. Vehicle Game play feels worse, with vehicles feeling both too weak and at times unstoppable because their counters are either too strong or not at all available. Leading to a lack of fun element, with not being able to have engaging vehicle duels or heroic underdog achievements.
5. Map Design is a little weak and lack variety in engagement types or size. Overall the game FEELS much smaller, which is not good when in conjunction with issue #3. 

The game definitely has room to grow and I think in 2 years CoH3 may be able to join its older brothers 1&2 as an excellent Relic Entertainment RTS, but the developers of CoH3 are certainly not the same individuals who made 1 or 2 and have failed to fill the shoes for this title. I am hopeful that it will get better and I can change my review.

I used to play high Actions Per Minute (APM) RTS game before, but not any more.  The Tactical Pause in CoH3 does what the designers hoped for, makes the game accessible for players like me who don't want the stress and physical intensity of high APM games.  Note: I am talking about me and players like me, if you like high APM that's fine and in this game you don't have to use Tactical Pause--so this game is suitable for both audiences.  The Tactical Pause works even better than 'active pause' because you can queue up several orders for each unit.  
Overall, it's a good game.  Graphics, sound, game mechanics are good.  Not saying it's perfect, as a simple example the game doesn't have a switch to toggle off the intro movie so it doesn't start every time I start the game.  I'm glad I waited and didn't buy it initially but did buy it on sale after a recent major update.

Update 7 months later: Single player runs worse than launch RIP company of heroes save your money avoid at all cost.


from a single player perspective only

Audio: is horrible from voice acting to weapons it just sucks 4/10

graphics:  5/10. literally no difference between coh2 and this except coh2 runs smoother (I'm on a 3070 ti) unit animations are janky and assets are still missing. For a AAA game this is b.s they should've delayed another 6 months and made sure it was ready to go.  this feels like a reskin of COH 2

Gameplay: 4/10. Pathfinding is so bad it makes men of war pathfinding look like state of the art, wtf relic did you even test this game before launch, who are we kidding the launch is actually the beta. The Afrika Korp campaign is good and the missions are fun but why not do a campaign map? I know why because you want to milk a dlc out of it. The Italy campaign is such hot garbage, you should play a total war game for an hour and compare it to your game and patch this because the UI the map, the unit requistion everything is just bad you have a great concept that could be fun but you either screwed it up or we are just paying beta testers either way it's hot garbage.

Story: 1/10 Why??? the story makes no sense ww2 is chalk full of historical stories instead you hamfist the crap in north africa that I literally lost interest in after 3 missions, you could've done a story about the desert rats raiding the afrika korp or how Rommel went from the golden boy of the german army to him butting heads with Hitler and ultimately plotting to kill him, have any of you ever picked up a history book? Also why the name changes on Patton and monty? didn't want to pay royalties lmfao what a joke.

Overall in it's current state it's a 4/10 from a single player standpoint. I would rather smash my fingers with a hammer than play MP but if that's your cup of tea play the game how you want. but if you want a classic COH experience play the original it was much better and the graphics are not much different.",1677351861,1703030199,False,6,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I'D SAY THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS THE ONLY DECENT THING THIS ""GAME"" HAS TO OFFER. AND IT'S A SHAME, I'VE BEEN PLAYING COH FOR YEARS, ANTICIPATING AND YEARNING FOR COH3 TO COME OUT; DON'T GET THIS GAME. 0/10 IF YOU WANT A GOOD COH EXPERIENCE, PLAY COH1 OR 2, BOTH ARE 10 TIMES BETTER THAN THIS.

""HUGE"" UPDATE: This game looks amazing, the amount of details put into this world is genuinely astonishing. The units themselves are on par with the world that surrounds them. Regardless of what I'm about to say next; the atmosphere feels appropriate for the setting and nobody should take that away from the dev team. I'm not going to talk about the update itself but the game as a whole. Now, when it comes to balance, number of units available, diversity of said units, and utility and efficiency of said units,number of maps, diversity of maps, now that is entirely subpar. I'm not even comparing it to the old COH's because that should not be the goal. The goal SHOULD be to improve upon the prior games. I don't understand how we took one step forward and then two steps back. Then consistently were told how community feedback was a huge factor. Here are some major ways that would greatly reroute the road this game is going; adding unit diversity(base units not commander dependent), number of units(doesn't have to be crazy just a lot more than COH 2 at the very least), adding commanders(JUST USE COH 2 store but obviously improve on it), the M3 shouldn't need a center upgrade since the Germans don't need one for their half-track, make it balanced so that one is not stronger than the other until they get their upgrades(balance should be put above historical accuracy, obviously not to the point where two Stuarts destroy a Tiger, but by having at least 2-3 counters to 1 specific unit I swear to god that the bazooka team has to be the most ridiculous counter to an early flamethrower half-track or any armor for that matter although in general a good diversity unit), also if an upgraded german half track can wreck infantry I don't see why the M24 Chaffee can't also, and your telling me 4 quad cannons wouldn't pin an infantry unit just as fast as 1 MG42, and most importantly doing all of this FOR FREE. Jesus, an unfinished game with a DLC, really boys, I mean c'mon man wtf. Who in their right mind decided to release a DLC when all of the above should have been in the base game when it released. I'm all for supporting any company making an rts; obviously its not the most profitable, but it definitely has a steadfast community ready to support any means necessary. Also when you do make DLC's look at AOE4 their most recent pack contained as much content as this entire game, and somehow still managed to stay somewhat balanced and only cost $15! I mean that is passion, that is the devs telling their community that the game is more than just a cash grab but something they can proudly say they have under their belt. I hate to say it, but look at Apex and Fortnite, in the sense of their games being highly enjoyable and give stuff for free therefore people are willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money for even more stuff(which is ridiculous but obviously works) You make a GREAT game and the money will come in by itself. Better yet, do exactly what COH 2 does, make EVERYTHING achievable, by currency that can be earned for playing games(more for winning and good performance) and completing achievements, therefore giving people a reason to grind, but also giving a fast track to people willing to pay for it with actual currency. The fact of the matter is, you know all of this, just are unwilling to do it, and that is even more disheartening. If money is the goal(I know it is) than fix these title ending problems(some more than others), and then shower in gold. Just for the love of god complete the game. Not much is left, just a couple more changes, and then this game will be a masterpiece. I really hope some of this goes through to the devs, I know I might sound like a maniac ranting but, I don't feel this way with a lot of titles and would hate to see it die like DOW 3 did, god knows how many rts titles we have left. Also, give the customers who paid for the premium edition something more than an afterthought, I mean we paid $40 more for pretty much nothing.

1677280,153349656,76561198006887908,0,7,937,56,566,1708317814,"I've been following the CoH3 development and its general release very closely.  I've been an avid CoH player for many years starting with the original game then the sequel.  I've always been fond of the original CoH title since it's a rare gem in terms of gameplay and replay ability.  When CoH2 released I was excited for another CoH title and gladly bough the collector’s edition. This was also when THQ went bankrupt, and Relic became part of Sega.  I can only imagine what happened to CoH2 as a result from that change.  The result of CoH2 was quite a departure in the overall gameplay and replay ability that I loved so much from the original game.  The overall quality dropped quite a lot and was far more disappointed than I would have thought and the DLC's being released were not the DLC's (called expansions in those days…)  from Relic's older games that you would never think twice to purchase without question.  CoH2 really set the stage for my expectations of CoH3.  I would not preorder and wait until I felt satisfied that the game was worthwhile to play.

CoH3 sounded amazing when it was announced but the development was rushed to release.  Despite delaying the games release to a few months later the initial game release was quite unpolished and unfinished, but I would argue CoH2 even in its end state is far worse to the current state of CoH3.  I wasn't part of CoH3 until the recent patch of Steel Shepperd.  I have heard it bought quite the improvement to the game but even before then I didn't see it as bad as what CoH2 was mainly due to a pathetic game engine that bugsplatted all the time until it got better with the 64-bit version of CoH2 that got released later in its lifespan.  CoH3 from initial impressions is quite satisfying but I can only imagine the state of the game before German Shepherd.  I got used to how bad CoH2 ran and even on a decent system seemed to perform bad regardless of what hardware you used, but CoH3 doesn’t exhibit those issues.  I find CoH3 a pleasant departure from the performance issues of CoH2.  I’ve been playing only for a few hours, but I find the current state of the game is worth the buy if you get a 20% or more discount.

With the Steel Shepperd update came the first DLC (or expansion) as Relic calls it.  Its not an expansion all it provides is two battlegroups you can unlock for free using Merits and then a bunch of cosmetics.  The asking price for this content is very overpriced.  If you have prime gaming, you can get decent skins just from those drops.  The premium edition includes this DLC for free, but I would recommend you avoid the premium edition since its not justified by its price and what it provides players.  Most players who preordered the premium edition has been largely disappointed by what it provides for the money.

As much as I wish Relic would remain in its glory days of making some of the best games of all time it simply hasn’t been for quite some time.  Relic refuses to deliver what its player base wants, and it puts anything and everything behind a massive paywall.  I’m honestly not sure if this is a decision by Relic or Sega or both.  I would confidently say that the overall value of DLC’s is quite questionable for what you get, and I can only imagine how the future DLC content will be moving forward.  I would, however, expect overpriced skins or other cosmetics or new battlegroups that for those that rely on them can introduce a pay to win scenario if Relic decides to not offer them to be obtainable in game without spending real money (such as using Merits instead).

I would confidently say that CoH3 is a worthwhile title just be sure to be cautious of any DLC’s or Expansions that Relic might announce since it may not be what you may expect.  If you want a copy of CoH3 I would recommend purchasing the base game not the premium since it’s a better overall value in many regards.  I just hope that 10+ months later that Relic continues to support this game and not recreate the overall experience of CoH2 that left me very disappointed with a franchise that many hold dear in their hearts.  I have no issue supporting Relic, but Relic needs to support their fanbase and start going back to their roots for what made them so beloved for so many years.  I always have a glimmer of hope that Relic could do just that since CoH is still a great franchise!

Added remarks after playing the game: (I’ll add content/updates here to not diminish my original review)
For CoH3 specifically I’ve been playing Skirmishes and have noticed that playing the game the animations and the way the game plays is much improved compared to CoH2 and even CoH1.  The game feels very fluid compared to past CoH titles.  Arguably, CoH1 still has better visuals than CoH2, but I personally think currently CoH3 is better generally speaking.  CoH2 had some janky animations and odd things that would occur that CoH3 doesn’t exhibit such as dead units being able to attack you until they finally died – lol!  I do find that the character models don’t look overly improved from any of the older CoH titles and if you zoom into them, they don’t look much better and even loose a bit of detail and quality.  Perhaps Relic is using older models from the previous titles I’m honestly not sure but its not AAA title graphics but they sill look good none the less.  Keep in mind CoH games are far smaller games to install compared to AAA titles you are looking around 100GB’s per title.  They look fine when the camera is set to the default zoom.  I’ve also seen that CoH 3 has a decent map selection along with 4 factions to boot which past games you had to purchase expansions to get them.  I am also very pleased with the steam workshop coming to CoH3 where it was later integrated in CoH1 and 2 later in their life.  After a quick browse of the Steam Workshop for CoH3 there appears to be quite a wealth of content from maps, tuning packs and much more to choose from and it appears to be growing quite a lot.  I found once Relic stops patching the game the Steam Workshop brings a new life to the game which allows the game to remain engaging.  Overall, I find the factions and general gameplay elements such as the way the factions play along with the general controls to work quite well.  Maybe they are not optimally balanced, but their overall completeness feels quite better than previous titles.  It’s hard to explain but I felt in older games some of the factions clearly lacked in certain areas to a fault.  I feel in CoH3 there is something to work with the faction and its mechanics which is a welcome change.  I feel I can play as any faction and have some method to play the way I want to the way the faction plays.",1702266984,1702753679,True,64,4,0.68380206823348999,0,True,False,False

COH3 has the promise of becoming a brilliant RTS.

With the release of Hammer and Shield ""expansion"" the game is approaching an almost complete state. The updates to the UI and other graphics are brilliant, new sound design and two very flushed out battle-groups mark the end of the COH2 piecemeal commanders.

The engine performance is a marked upgrade and while the graphics are arguably lacking compared to even the original COH, they aren't offensive enough to cause any real harm. A four faction release is also a big plus but it may have been better to maaaybbbee have focused on polishing two factions first and release the next two in rapid succession to fulfil the legal promises of an ""expansion"" without resorting to a pitiful, review bombed pair of battle-groups.

The game still fails in its narrative. COH1 was the epitome of setting and tone done right. Graphic and sound design all worked towards a gritty and realistic war environment. COH2 was the edgy kid at the back of the class listening to Bring Me The Horizon that no one took seriously. COH3 doesn't feel like it knows what to be. It touts being a dark and gritty representation of war but is full of vibrant colours, tanks that look they're out of a ""my first army"" toy set and facepaint wearing Cherokee warrior skins. 

The campaign is poor, with comedic and stiff banter between the generals completing disrupting any sense of immersion, what's wrong with a sequential scenario based story campaign? But COH3 has one of those too! i hear you cry. Unfortunately It has the production value of a nativity play and is seriously lacking in comparison to even COH2's campaign.

Overall I still enjoyed the game, I love the COH series with a passion, but even with my bias approach, the game is currently an utter failure.

If you want immersive second world war then go play MoW, Call to Arms or Steel Division. COH3 aims to differentiate itself by being an excellent RTS first, with a poorly fitting WW2 coat. Yet the recent update ""Hammer and Shield"" has demonstrated the developers utter incompetence at balancing this game.

Skill issue, I know. But we find ourselves re treading the same pitifully unbalanced path that COH2 followed. The recent update has introduced a meta of sim citying, the same thing that had plagued an earlier build of COH2 and the developers have either not play tested it properly or there's a hydraulic leak in the vents at the office because it has become an unplayable bunker building simulator with more artillery call ins than the somme. Remember Achelous River? Imagine being able to recreate that on every map.

I had a friend who purchased every cosmetic in the store, who adamantly defended this game during it's unfinished initial release and I watched him give up today. If the developers continue to refine this game then it will one day reach the status of its predecessors but thing's like this that will whittle the fan base (and thus, the funding) down to an unsustainable level.

As a longtime fan of the franchise, I can confidently say that this installment not only lives up to the legacy of its predecessors but also raises the bar for the entire real-time strategy (RTS) genre.

From the moment you dive into the immersive campaign, you are instantly captivated by the stunning visuals and attention to detail. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular, showcasing the devastation of war in a way that feels almost too real. The meticulously designed environments, whether it's the charred ruins of a European village or the dense jungles of the Pacific, create an atmosphere that is as visually striking as it is emotionally evocative.

The gameplay mechanics have been refined to perfection, offering a seamless blend of strategy and action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The introduction of dynamic weather conditions and a day-night cycle adds a layer of complexity that forces players to adapt their tactics on the fly. This, coupled with the meticulously crafted maps, ensures that no two battles are ever the same, providing a level of replayability that is truly commendable.

One of the standout features of Company of Heroes 3 is the unprecedented attention to historical accuracy. The developers have spared no effort in meticulously researching and recreating the weaponry, vehicles, and uniforms of the era. This commitment to authenticity not only enhances the overall gaming experience but also serves as a testament to the dedication of the development team.

The single-player campaign is a rollercoaster of emotions, with a gripping narrative that unfolds against the backdrop of iconic World War II events. The character development is superb, making you genuinely care about the fates of the soldiers under your command. The storytelling is both poignant and thought-provoking, reminding players of the human cost of war.

Multiplayer mode, a cornerstone of the Company of Heroes franchise, has been further refined in this installment. The strategic depth and intense battles against human opponents are as thrilling as ever, and the addition of new factions and units ensures that veterans and newcomers alike will find something to suit their playstyle.

In terms of audio design, Company of Heroes 3 is a symphony of war. The thunderous roar of tanks, the staccato of machine gun fire, and the distant cries of soldiers create an auditory experience that is both immersive and spine-tingling. The soundtrack complements the on-screen action perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of each moment.

In conclusion, Company of Heroes 3 is a triumph in every sense of the word. It combines cutting-edge visuals, strategic depth, and a commitment to historical accuracy to create an RTS experience that stands head and shoulders above its peers. Whether you're a fan of the genre or a newcomer to the series, this game is an absolute must-play. Relic Entertainment has once again proven why they are masters of their craft, and Company of Heroes 3 is a testament to the power of exceptional game design.

The Hammer and Shield DLC is a DLC that is titled as though it's an expansion... that has, absolutely has, to be just to cover the obligation to supply 'one expansion' to the ultra-edition pre-orderers. It is a glorified DLC. It didn't even add one battlegroup to every faction...

The game itself is a mixed bag, too. Four factions, but each only has three battlegroups (now four, in some cases). There's literally no reason for a battlegroup loadout as things stand, because you could just have designed the game to allow four to be taken into a match. And if you play DAK, you don't even need four battlegroup slots as you still have just 3 choices, even with the DLC.

The Dynamic Campaign got some fixes, but it was fixing through subtraction... instead of making it a work by adding better open-field maps, they made every battle on the open map into an auto-resolve. That reduces the 'dynamic' part of the campaign back to something not that far from the North Africa linear experience. The dynamic campaign now just happens to also have this meta-game layer of chess to play around pre-set battles in the cities.

The presentation though is what is shattering to me. Gone are the soaring scores of music. Sound effects sound cheap. Art direction is pastel and vibrant instead of gritty. It's like between CoH2 and CoH3, an entirely different era of art aesthetics occurred here.

And worst of all, it just doesn't do anything that much better than CoH2 now does. While CoH2 also had a horrendous launch, it recovered enough to be a rather great game, and did so because it had some good presentation and at least began right away with the proper infrastructure for MP. CoH3 had to take months to add replays and even just win/loss tracking (which originally was done on an external site like it was a Half-Life mod back in 1999).

I am happy to be able to come back and make this update to my review. I have followed this game over the past year and replaying the game as each patch was released. 60 hours in the game and I have completed the campaign at least 6 times on harder difficulties. 

With the release of 1.4.0 this month, I can finally come back here and revise my comment with a positive update. With the 1.4.0 update we have seen many improvements, including additions to campaign, balancing, and an overhaul to the campaign map game play and AI. And I am very happy to be able to say these changes are a much appreciated improvement. 

- The Campaign map feels fluent and much better integrated with the game-play overall.
- The AI now pushes to take positions, flanks player entrenchments, and attempts to acquire the mission objectives.
- The Unit unlocks, skill points and abilities now feel much more useful.
-  Item and resource drops can now be retrieved reliably.
- Additional maps and tweaks to default starting positions no longer make the player feel like they are playing the same maps repeatedly.

To any COH franchise fans holding out on CoH3 because of the launch reviews and bad subsequent feedback. Hold out no longer, Relic has worked hard over the past year and they did not try to push DLC on us without addressing the core issues of the game. Imo Relic has shown those of us in the community that they are serious and have delivered something any CoH fan would be happy to have in their collection. 

Well Done Relic team, thank you for continuing to work on this game and taking our feedback seriously. I am more than pleased to be able to say this is now a game that I would certainly recommend for anyone looking for a good RTS game. 

--------------------
Original Review:
What can I say, I knew better than to buy this game and did anyways. I've been playing COH since before the original had any expansions. I participated in the closed alpha for COH3 last year and it took a half a day to write my review, and voiced a lot of concerns to their development team. And I read plenty of negative reviews for months after launch.

I thought I would still give it a try and after 70 hours of game play I can give an honest and thorough review. I wanted to like this game even after the fiasco Relic caused with COH2 when they added all that in-game micro transaction stuff and broke the games profile progression for many accounts. I should have known better, with how gamer developers are these days.  

COH3 is a huge disappointment, most people call this an unfinished game although I don't think I or Relic/SEGA would necessarily agree, after all it was finished enough for release. The game is however very much unpolished and poorly implemented in regards to actual game mechanics and performance. More than that however, the in game combat progression, diversity of game play and Veteran unlock progression shows very clearly the publisher and parent companies have pushed this game into release before it was ready.

Tactical Map:
- Tactical map animations are slow and choppy.
- Tactical map movement input is clumsy 
- Tactical map information popups and overlays interfere with the player ability to interface with the tactical map at times.
- Tactical map rendering glitches between turns required the user to zoom in and out again to restore textures. (zooming control input is inverted while map is glitched, this seems like an obvious and more serious bug occurring)
- Tactical map game play is where most of the story telling happens and is lacking impressiveness entirely What few cut scenes do exist are short and poorly animated or still shots all together.

Real Time play:
- NPC/AI players are not very challenging.
- Diversity of real-time maps is very lacking, (I don't think there are more than a half a dozen maps per theater/campaign.)
- Ease of movement and environment interaction does not always respond as expected. Commanding a squad into cover sometimes sends them running off in another direction.
- Real time map textures glitch, where players cannot pickup dropped weapons, supplied or crew weapons.
- Real time map NPC/AI player reactions are unpredictable and do not always make sense for the mission goal. (for example; NPC armies will bypass zone control points in domination, in favor of resource points)
- Real time map NPC/AI player are not challenging at all in lower difficulties and are only challenging in higher difficulties due to increased build and resource rates, Level of aggression is almost indecipherable. 

Tactical map game play and real time game play do not feel like a cohesive experience and the game overall leaves a lot to be desired. It is understandable why people would go back to COH2 after playing this game, even though COH2 did not end a a great place (not being bug free and all) it is a much better experience than that which is offered with COH3, it lease it feels cohesive and immersive. 

COH3 is a prime example of developers being pushed to add more features and get their target goals finished, but not being given time to do a good job. Publishers dont care about customers anymore and game companies spend as much in advertising as they do the actual cost of development, sometimes more. It is obvious with COH3 the publisher pushed for release before the game was ready and now we the 'valued' customer get to deal with a product that while finished in a technical sense, is not done.

I cannot recommend spending money on this game until Relic and SEGA get their act together. Releasing unfinished games is a predatory practice, to put it nicely.",1690485959,1702638565,True,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

I've been waiting for this game for years, as someone who replayed and enjoyed both Coh 1 and 2 multiple times, including the dlcs. Unfortunatley, it's not a game I can currently recommend due to few reasons:
1. It seems like no one had done any q.a on it before the release. Im not talking about small hidden issues, that sometimes can happen with some edge cases. The game won't let you load saves, for example, except for ones auto created at the beginning of each mission. Reloading a later save failed few times for me, and i found myself more than once restarting missions.

2. I liked the seriers for its campgains. CoH 2 was well written, the missions were excellent and diverse, the protagonist had an interesting background story, etc etc. None of this exists here. the skirmishes are mostly dull and much easier than they were. The strategic layer is useless and manily feels like a waste of time with more head ache in between the batttles.

3. The battles lack any depth. I was able to win almost all the skirmishes so far by scrapping enough resources to use off-map artillery and destroying the German hqs. maybe on 2 or 3 skirmishes i had to restart when it didnt work on the first attempt. thats it.

We really deserve more than that for a $50-60 game we all have been waiting for, for a few years.

update: during the last patch they added a link to a survey. which is nice. i guess. but the patch also broke my saved games, and they now crash the game whenever i try loading.

I've been playing the series since 2010, prior to that my rig dind't event dreamed of running the first title. CoH 2 I've played on launch and as much as it was cool, it didn't felt like CoH 2 and it received a lot of hate of the fanbase, just like CoH 3 now. The game really began to shine after the USF and OKW expansions wth the Brits giving the final thumbs up to the fans before the devs focused only on ballancing the multiplayer experience and adding a few commanders here and there.

CoH 3 have a much more fun campaing with a dynamic way to play it, even not being cinematic as the prior titles, its fun and challenging. The Afrikakorps campaing is short but will garantee a couple hours of fun and an interesting and educational story about german and british ocuppation in North Africa.

The devs are now working on bringing more content and I truly believe this will be a solid and rich game in the near future. I can't recommend paying full price but if you're a fan of the series as much as I it is worth giving a chance on the next sale if its at least 30% off.

For instance, the USF did not have CQB specialist before the update, so rangers fill that gap, and they also come with the ingame loot box where you put 90 munitions into a slot machine and pray that you will get the weapons you want or cope with what you get :)  (I actually love it because even if you get undesired weapons, there are still useful)
The coastal reserve also is a good addition to the Wher in the early game as they have non-neglectable damage as the Grens, so it might be even worth it to merge them with Gren to keep them fighting in the early game.

*my review will stay negative as long as the premium currency is still in the game - Relic CoH3 is a good game, and there is no need for you to nickel and dime us. Believe in yourself.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of the date this review is published, the game unpolished. It has some minor bugs, and its UI has terrible design and customisation. The unit movement also feel clunky especially when infantry entering and leaving the buildings. However, the core game play is really good fun and is a major step up from coh2. The map design and mechanics, for instance, are amazing. High ground, building placement, and control point placements encourage different play style.

Changed to negative review because of the patch 1.1: Operation Micro Transaction
- predatory in-game currency conversion rate (e.g.skin costs 1200 but you can only buy 1300)
- prioritise micro transaction over the other aspects of the game (more multiplayer maps, QoL, bugs, etc.)
- balance patch is still buggy (e.g. conversion from scout squad to pathfinders are still cheaper than buying pathfinders because now they spawn with 4 models, and still cost the same)


Post 1.1.4: The balance patch has improve the game, but the game is still unfinished as many features are still missing. Also, the predatory microtransaction remains unchanged.

1.1.5
- broke the replay command (community's work around lack of replay), 
- Buff the already good planes in team games for the sake of 1v1. Result: the USF still dont use ASC in 1v1 because the ISC is a much better choice in every way, the Plane are now broken in 3v3 and 4v4 games even without the broken damage!

Don't bother building AA guns or vehicles until they reduce the survivability of aircraft, they are worthless except against infantry. There are still issues with many models, not having the accurate weapons that the units should have, if you are a history buff, such as the german scout car, which has a squeeze bore and not the at rifle it should, or the German rifle grenade launcher, which was an at rifle with the barrel cut down to use as a grenade launcher (not the full length gun, as portrayed).

I've played mostly skirmishes on all difficulties (this is player vs AI), co-op (real players) vs AI, and several multiplayer matches for context.

I played 1 and 2 some but not enough to honestly consider myself a CoH fanboy until this game.

For all the mostly justified flack this game gets releasing in a certain state what there are much less negative reviews on (I am admittedly saying this anecdotally scrolling through a few pages of reviews) is how this game plays. Mechanically speaking what made Coh1 and 2 great is still here with some improvements to boot. So I thumbs up this game and support it like you do that family member who keeps saying they're going to change their life for the better and start to and maybe stumble on the way but eventually get there.

I do not.

The tactical gameplay is just not there - every unit does everything and you're just moving blobs around the map. There are no more choices to be made. Every faction feels extremely lacklustre, and my suspicion there is so they can sell you a ""dlc"" of more interesting options.

The art is disappointing - I don't mean the graphics, which to be fair are no worse (but also no better?) than the previous 2 titles. I mean the art: the commanders, the maps, the vehicle skins, the voices, the unit icons are all hands down terrible. In both CoH 1 and 2, you knew which commander was which and which faction was which just from the visual queues.
Every commander portrait in this looks like it was made using gen AI.

This clearly a micro-transaction vehicle. But it hasn't got the basics right. There is essentially no fun in playing the base game, so I don't think anyone is going to buy DLC in some faint hope of filling in all the cracks in this game.

This first DLC release has been extremely telling.

No one is sadder than me to have to report this not only does not live up to the hype, it fails to even match its own prequels.

Honestly - the fact that CoH 1 is still priced as it and it's still being purchased says more than any review.

Company of Heroes 3 simply plays better than all previous entries in the franchise. It has larger, more unique and more fleshed out factions where you can really get lost in the different tech trees. It has a a quite a lot of QoL improvements that make it easier to play than the predecessor while introducing a lot of additional complications and depth, simultaneously increasing both the skill ceiling and the skill floor, which I think is the ultimate goal of any RTS sequel. The new features are not mindblowing but they do add to the experience, especially towing, which I thought would be a clunky gimmick used for some singleplayer missions, but it's actually very playable even in intense multiplayer matches.

This time around gameplay is less focused aroud big heavy tanks and long range fights, so if you want hour long meatgrinders, I suppose CoH2 might still be better for that, but I think CoH3's more dynamic, faster battles are overall an improvement on the formula and really bring out the tactical positioning and fluid frontline based play that CoH is known for.

My previous review was very harsh on the singleplayer side of things, but after the recent update even that has been mostly fixed. Mission Design is tight and interesting plus between the giant dynamic and the linear african campaign there is a quite a lot of content for singleplayer enjoyers, so the campaigns might not win awards on their own, but they are still good enough.

Edit 26/05/2023 - Game seems to have been abandoned, same as DOW 3. Playerbase is half that of COH 2. Updates are adding totally the wrong things. Relic need to seriously think about their attitude towards game development. Such a shame.

I have the setting for AI set to standard, but for some reason spam armor and infantry way faster than i can keep up, i i end up losing alot of troops at the early onset of battle. I have panzers on my doorstep not even 20 minutes in the game. I also dont like the command point skirmishes. My way of thinking is, once ive captured a command point, shouldnt i gain back points that i lost? The command points diminish way too quickly, and I was enjoying the italian campaign but some are forced command point skirmishes. You should be given the option for annilihation map.

These developers have put together the multiplayer experience from the original COH without the expansions and the campaign. I was reminded by friends that COH2 was disappointing when it first came out; I can agree with that, but it was quickly saved by tons of added content and expansions that made it fun to play for years.  COH 3 can't say the same.  I won't pay $17 for an expansion for content that was developed in the first game.

Multiplayer games can be fun, but game matching is slow, and I seem to get the same 2 or 3 maps.  I recently reinstalled COH2; there's a lot of people still playing it, a wider variety of maps, and a ton more units to use.

More post game stats and easier to access game recordings would add a lot, but that's probably further down the pipeline.

Edit: Patch 1.4 does a lot to bring the necessary systems (replay system, improvements to UI/UX (map loading screens for instance and tactical map)) and a major graphical update which collectively make quite a impression after not having played for a while. The improvements to unit responsiveness are also quite noticeable as well.

Overall, I think I can say that the game has at least reached a 1.0 state that I would be satisfied with it on release. So I really have to commend the devs for being able to stick with CoH3 to get it to this state, I think it's a much more solid foundation that they can now finally get to the red meat of the content that people want, mainly more maps and more battlegroups.

With regard to the balance of the two new battlegroups (which probably would have been better marketed as a mini-expansion at best), the Italian Coastal's pretty insane right now, but I expect it'll be fixed eventually (this happens all the time in other games with new characters, etc so I'm not too phased by it). 

Vehicle acceleration is probably over-tuned as well, but the devs have shown a great deal of transparency and responsiveness to community feedback that I think it'll be addressed with time as well.

For those that played CoH2 (CoH1 was pretty solid on release in my mind), I think people can remember how rough a launch that was and it took a number of years for them to start getting the balance right. So I'm still willing to give CoH3 more time to improve as well, especially since it's reached a solid point where I'm having much more fun playing it than before.",1694906638,1702272967,True,1,0,0.523236691951751709,0,True,False,False

These ""updates"" feel like a band-aid fixes that should be included in the base game at the first place. They charged so much by only adding 2 commanders with only 1-2 unique units for 2 of the 4 playable factions. And yet these factions bring nothing new to the game at all. I feel stupid keeping hopes that one day Relic will fix this game. If you are reading this comment and thinking about whether you should buy this game or not, DON'T. Go buy CoH 2 which is way cheaper with better gaming experience (at least for me) . I once put more than 1000 hrs in this series but now CoH3 has successfully prevent me from playing this game anymore. 

COH3 is a game with quite inetesting game play mechanics and system and if you are into WWII themed RTS game you might like it. However, our dearest relic has once again ruin this wonderful game with their poor executions.

Camera
Seriously, we players have been talking about the camera level is too zoomed in and we want a wider camera level and yet we still don't get it. Also, if you are using double monitors you will find your mouse cursor is not locked in the game monitor. You have the skills to do it for AOE4 the why the fk u cant do it for this game? Even tho they made a setting using wasd to move your camera, I find that this will make the key-bindings for your units awkward to use in game. 

UI design
First, I don't get why the unit shortcuts are put at the bottom of the screen. It is so hard to see. CoH2 unit are put on the top left hand corner and it is soooooooooooooooo much better. Also, the UI takes up a lot of your screen. (30%~40%), which combining the very zoom-ed in camera makes you miss out so many things happening on the map.

Path finding 
 One of the reason that the launch for this game is postponed because the dev mentioned they want to improve the path finding issues. However, I don't see any significant improvements when comparing to CoH2. I will say they are better but not by a whole not as reversing your vehicles can still  be a pain in the ass to do in this game (the vehicle will some keep spinning around). Also, when you press retreat for the infantry, why the need to choose to run through 5 enemy infantry squad to try to escape because it is the shortest path instead of using a safer but longer path. I thought that retreating a squad means asking the squad to survive to fight the next battle, but not a mum asking her 10 year old son to rush back home

Graphics, basically the same as CoH1, some improvements, but again, not much.

Single player campaign, so far this is the mode i can praise the dev for. While the ai for this mode can sometimes be dumb, at least it brings a new and interesting mechanic for their campaign while keeping the charm of the gameplay 

Overall:
I think this game has a lot of potential to be good, but only if the devs listen to their community and made real adjustments. But knowing relic and looking at CoH2, all they do is most likely some balance changes, some dlcs with new factions and that is. sigh.",1677258134,1702042170,False,6,0,0,0,True,False,False

I dont agree with all of their decisions/directions that they are choosing to pursue (I cant stand how cartoonish everything looks, CoH2 hits harder on the realism as of now; I cant believe they advertised this game the way they did, it's nothing like in the first videos you see above here where everything is all smoothed out and decent looking etc). If you can wait, then wait for major fixes or a sale - whichever comes first I suppose (hopefully the fixes roll out sooner than later). CoH1 was a masterpiece that left giant shoes to be filled, CoH2 did its best to fill those shoes and we learned to accept the game slowly over time as they made fixes/polishing. I have some hope that they will do the same for CoH3, even despite their plans to bring this game over to consoles. This game definitely has the groundwork/potential to be something great. They just need to polish/fix/update everything and make the game look/sound/feel better. 

Seriously though, please let us ZOOM OUT more. Being on the 3rd game in the series now, I shouldnt have to download a mod to do this one simple thing that your entire customer base has requested. I have friends and know people that simply wont even touch a game like this due to the annoying zoom level (see the game Foxhole for example). I understand that you design your maps in such a way where not everything is meant to be seen, but that is a simple fix for you guys because we are not asking for miles and miles of zoom. We would merely like to be able to at the very least zoom out 25-100% more than what is currently possible. Just 2x/double the zoom, please. Touch up the planes and the sides of the maps and just give us a little bit of a zoom. Not everyone wants to play with the camera so close to their battlefield at all times. Many people are visual learners/players and need to be able to get a wide view of the battlefield with their own eyes to determine what exactly they want to do and how they want to do it. Considering modders give this to us where we can zoom to 10000% and the maps look like crap then you would think you would just want to give us a tiny bit of zoom (25-100% more). 

I expect a lot of development from you guys Relic - we paid you upfront (some pre-ordered) so please do well with the funds and just finish the product. Bug fixes, touching up/polishing graphics, sounds (this is a game of war... need more boom/bass), animations, voice lines, unit AI path, unit animation/movement, make everything look less like a cartoon please, need more maps, DLC's, added factions, UI overhaul/improvement (colors, everything, etc), fix the freaking out of game menu too its just ridiculous what you guys think is a finished game.... I could go on and on, but bottom line is that I am not refunding this game as I want to continue to believe that Relic will come through on this as they have before. Once with CoH1, CoH2 did its best at redeeming itself, and now we are here at #3. Lets make CoH great again! (Devs, please think with the mindset of: gameplay/tech from CoH1 and then graphics/heavy feel(much better movement in literally all units)/atmosphere from CoH2.

As of right now with the current state of the game, I would not recommend that you pay full price unless you are a huge fan of this series and you just cant wait any longer. Throw it on the wishlist and check back in throughout the year for dev updates, updated customer reviews, and maybe even a sale if they are still doing that bad by the time this would make it to a sale.

**Edit/Update as of 12/8/23**
I'm really wishing I could have refunded this game and spent my precious $60 elsewhere. For a serious fan of the CoH franchise, I could not feel more upset or cheated by the makers of CoH3. They lied, continue to lie, wont stop lying. Make no mistake, this is NOT a good product that shows development from the previous 2 installments as it should and was expected to do. Every single thing they tell you is just fluff or marketing, it is all untrue, this game is unrefined in every way and they stole everyone's cash and simply walked away. Just read their dev notes or dev plans; it takes them forever to do literally anything or to come out with literally anything at all. They do nothing. Its a joke and a very embarrassing one at that. Please take your money elsewhere, they do not have your best interest at heart here. Again, the company is full of sellouts and this game is just a CASH GRAB. You'll have a much better time just playing CoH1 & 2. I really wanted this game to work out, but just look at how horrid the reviews all are, anyone saying otherwise about this game is just stuck in the nostalgic past and really wants this to not be the dumpster fire that it is; they're just trying to relive the days of olde back when this game series really was the king of the WW2 RTS Strat category. Oh how the mighty has fallen....

Side note: 
This is the only review I have ever left for a video game in my entire life - that should say a lot about the state of this game; I really love CoH, so it's just a real bummer that this wasn't what it was made out to be. I could say once more how I think we should hold out even a slim amount of hope that one day they will right their wrongs with this game but lets be honest with the reality we are all living in coming up on 2024... games nowadays (mostly and especially larger titles) just aren't what they used to be, the studios/devs/producers aren't the same either. Everything is moving toward micro transactions and rehashed garbage that has already hit shelves before (not a lot of new/original games out there anymore). They don't need to come out with a banger anymore, they just need to market it well enough so we all buy it. Then they come out with minuscule amounts of content over large periods of time (try a decade) until they come out with another one we will all buy, thus the cycle repeats over and over again... dont even get me started on how ""politics"" has made its way into media/entertainment (ex. Star Wars Ep. 7-9 by Disney or something like Battlefield 5 specifically the campaign).",1677963547,1702039089,False,3,0,0.512946188449859619,0,True,False,False

this instalment is rather disappointing. barring the flashy display upgrades, the actual gameplay is mediocre at best. the story campaign was short, and the missions felt flat and weak; the open campaign was interesting at first, learning different mechanics and making strategic decisions. but eventually it settles into an uninteresting grind without much variety, and the battles felt very repetitive and generic.

skirmish play is also lacklustre, where once again lack of contrast and variety is the issue. it is a place dominated by cookiecutter metas patch after patch and attempts to be more creative is often unrewarding and felt like self-imposed penalty.

regrettably this game felt like little more than a simple cash-grab from a company who's sole aim is monetisation above and to the exclusion of all else. their focus on pushing micro-transactions via cosmetics in-game instead of developing contents of actual substance is unfortunately vindictive of this.

The campaigns are bad. Like, laughably bad, especially considering the high standards set by CoH1, Opposing Fronts and Ardennes Assault.

There are some vague hints of the former CoH1 glory in this, and when it clicks, it clicks. The team game balance is absolutely atrocious.

It's annoying, they may be close together, but they don't correlate like COH2. The new hotkeys are awful, IMO. 

I am keeping my fingers crossed that this gets much better fast because the bones are there. But after a decade, I expected a finished product. And, for good measure, FIX THE ZOOM.

It has improved a lot since launch and from what I have played of the recent update the axis can finally go toe to toe with the allies. The buff for the mg42 has made a great difference when play wermecht and the new battle group is a turtles dream come true. I personally like the Italian coastal reserves but they are only good on defense, even when supported with an mg42 team on offense they are not as good the grenadiers. I have not played with the ranges just yet but I am sure they are strong, as most things on the allies are. Again this recent update has improved a lot of the balancing, in my opinion, and it felt great to me but I am sure there is something broken then more active players will find. Now I would recommend this game if you feel that the current content is good enough for you but for most I would say to wait a little longer. Maybe for the next major update.

This means that if you play the British forces or the Afrika Korps then you only get 3 battle groups to play with, meaning less answer to new problems.

I am updating after the ""Steel Panther"" major update to say, I think the game is still fun, and I think the update made it better. Visuals look much better (more contrast/detailed, more vivid color), and the new maps are fun. Only two right now but I am hopeful they will continue to add more. I have *not* played the new ""expansion"", which honestly doesn't look like a good value to me, but like... we are grown ups and have a choice to buy it or not. It says what it is on the tin, so if you buy it and then complain about it that is kind of on you? Just my opinion, man.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I was going to wait a bit to write up a review so I could play through the whole campaign etc., but it seems like this game is getting a lot of what I would say is maybe a bit unfair harsh criticism, so I wanted to weigh in with some positive feedback. That isn't to say that I don't have some things I'd love to see changed with the game, but I don't think this is a bad game by any means.

For context, I was and still am a huge fan of the original Company of Heroes. I bought the game when it came out and have played it pretty regularly since then. I played CoH 2 as well, but I always preferred the first game. I say this because I think a lot of people seem to feel that CoH 2 was much better than 3 is, etc. Maybe for them that was the case, but I don't think that it is fair to say that is some universal truth.

Ok, on to CoH3. There are lots of folks who I have seen posting on Reddit etc. saying things like how it ""looks like a mobile game"" etc. If someone can show me the mobile games they are playing that look like this, I'm definitely interested. I certainly have not seen it. The game looks fantastic. There is some weirdness with the default settings, so if you boot up and find that it doesn't look how you would expect, give your settings a gander. For some reason my game defaulted to medium settings and 1080p resolution. My monitors native resolution is 1440p and my specs were more than sufficient to bump things up to high. Even just changing the resolution to the native for my monitor made a huge difference in how the game looked. Upping things to high/ultra, the game looks fantastic. Now, if you want to talk *art style*, I absolutely preferred the *art style* of CoH1 to either 2 or 3. To me, CoH1 holds up to this day because, even though the textures etc may not have been as high quality as the ones in 2 and 3, it had a fantastic art style - it was gritty where 3 is a bit ""shiny"" for lack of a better word, it managed to look a bit run down/drab while still being visually interesting and very readable, etc. But I don't think it is fair to say that because maybe the visual *style* of 1 was more to my liking, or maybe that I found it to be ""better"" that the visuals in this game are bad. The visuals are not bad - they are quite nice and I'd say absolutely on par with other modern RTS games that I have played, like AoE4.

There have also been some complaints about the audio. I would say that it isn't as high energy as the audio in CoH1 - there is definitely a more subdued feeling to the battles as far as the explosions and gunfire. But, again, it sounds great to me and it feels quite intense when you have a big fight going on. The voice acting is also, in my opinion, quite good.

The gameplay is great. If anyone is saying the gameplay isn't great, I don't know what they are talking about. Its the CoH formula - it hasn't substantially changed since the first game, in the same way that the Age of Empires formula is still largely similar. Its what makes Company of Heroes Company of Heroes. It's a ton of fun to play either with random folks online, against the AI, with friends. It's fantastic. Now if you want to criticize the game for not innovating or something, ok, sure, yeah, its largely the same formula since the original game. To me, that is a huge plus. I play CoH because I love the way the game plays. If they had changed it to be like Dawn of War 3, or like Age of Empires 2, or something like that, it might still have been cool, I guess, but it wouldn't have been Company of Heroes anymore, and I think that would have been a misstep. I love the way the game plays and I think they did a great job. One thing I do want to call out as a huge plus for me, is it feels like the number of units that you lose/kill is much lower in 3 than in 1 (and 2 from what I remember, but I had less experience with 2). I absolutely love this. It means that infantry squads stay viable for the *entire game*, and you don't have those situations where a single lucky grenade or lucky mortar blows up your triple veteran infantry squad. I think this is a massive plus because it opens up tons of new playstyles and a real skirmish feel to the battles. Light vehicles also remain more viable throughout the entire game. Company 1 kind of inevitably ended up with the endgame of artillery spam/heavy tanks. I have no problem with that, it has kept me entertained for several hours a week for almost 20 years, haha. But I also love the way that CoH3 plays. If I want the CoH1 or 2 vibes, I can hop back in to those games, no problem. It's awesome, in my opinion, to have many ways to play, and this game introduces a new feel on the classic formula. I'm all for that.

The one big disappointment for me would be the number of maps. It feels like there are very few maps available. I know that the community will make more maps with Essence Editor, and I am positive that Relic will introduce more maps down the road. My friend group and I play CoH1 a couple times a week and we love to just hang out, chat, catch up with everyone's life stuff, and play simple map with choke points against the AI like Vire River, Achelous, The Scheldt, etc. It's a real shame to me that there aren't really any ""choke point"" maps in CoH3 at launch, and I think there are only like 3 3v3 maps and 2 4v4 maps. I think that's is a real let down and I am surprised that Relic didn't include some of the classic maps from CoH1 and 2 in the lineup here. Even though I know they don't fit the campaign etc of CoH3, I think including them for multiplayer and skirmish would have just been a huge plus. 

I also know there have been some complaints about the campaign etc, bugs, all that. I do not doubt all those complaints are valid - I have not been able to play through the whole campaign yet, but I will update this review if I find anything game breaking etc. I like that Relic tried something new with the campaign and if it didn't land 100%, hey, that happens, they can iterate on it for the next game or in a DLC. The multiplayer of this game is mainly why I grabbed it, to play with friends, and for that it absolutely is checking all the boxes for me.

Anyways, this got really long and hopefully it makes sense and is helpful. I enjoy this game, I think it is worth the money if you like CoH as a series and you want to play multiplayer against other people, with friends, or against the AI. If you are already happy with CoH2 or 1 and don't want any changes from those games, obviously don't buy this game - it is a new game and isn't the same as those. If you like the series and want a new angle on it with some fresh visuals and gameplay ideas, yeah, pick this up, it's super cool.

Very buggy, unfinished glitchy mess. Tanks spin in circles and can't hit anything. Vehicle pathing and orientation is completely broken. The Allies British mortar emplacement and infantry AT gun spam is alive and well. They basically made COH2 worse both visually, technically and gameplay wise. The COH2 game from 2012-2013 actually looks and plays better than this *******. The sound is also bad and can't even zoom out or change the view angle. The menu system is very confusing with endless upgrades and the whole game feels like a charicature cartoon of COH2. It's like a Call of Duty mobile game console port RTS.

Tanks only seem to see about 20 m in front, always outranged by Allied units and flare spam, and there are no late war German tanks but plenty of late war Allied units.

Their first main patch adds an in game store and paid micro transactions for skin cosmetics. Meanwhile there are only two 4v4 maps and half the units from COH2.

Go play Men of War II when it comes out and you will see all the full features and content there from day one that COH3 doesn't have. COH3 is a WW2 game with no deployable howtizers or artillery on German side. Correction: They added one DLC now with one Italian artillery that you won't get to build because the game will be over by 20 min and you will get swarmed by allied infantry and tank spam. And three of those big shells can't even take out a tank hitting it from the top.

Update: If you criticise the game, the devs will ban you from the forums. The devs are the moderators. Anyway COH3 is a failure and disappointment compared to COH2. Now we have total radio silence since the store pay skin patch and most of the Relic staff were laid off. Definitely not worth any sort of full price. The game is dead and nowhere close to being playable or complete, and never will be. GAME OVER. Time to uninstall and move on.",1677313217,1701922149,False,5,0,0.572197854518890381,0,True,False,False

It commits three Sins in particular that drives me to write this review.

1. The Campaigns are derivative and boring at best and over sanitising and insulting at worst. 

The ""German"" Narrative campaign infuriated me because the story focuses on civilian population of Libya and Egypt rather than any German soldiers or commanders serving under Rommel. God forbid we have any sort of characters we can actually understand and bond with even though they served ""the bad guys"". Funnily Enough when you played as the SS...I mean ""Panzer Elite"" in the Opposing fronts in COH 1, No one cared. That's because we had a small but intensive and engaging story with characters based around real people who we saw go through the hellish defensive campaign of Market Garden and be affected by the chaotic battles that occured there.  The Italian Campaign is just a bland overly sanitised bore fest that takes the worst traits of Total war and uses them. After the Second or third skirmish your brain starts to decay.

2. They developed this to play on consoles.

I know this may not be a popular opinion but a console will never to catch up to a PC in performance. There will always be limitations to what it can achieve without risking frame rates or overly complicating the controls. As such any RTS game that is also available for console, will suffer in both graphical and gameplay mechanics. COH 3 is no execption. The Incredibly Zoomed in camera, simplified control layout, poor graphical quality and dumbed down mechanics railroads it's primary audience to accepting sub part quality just for those extra few potential console customers.

3. They went Straight for the money grabbing. 

This clearly was a decision made by a publisher executive or manager at Relic as it has all the hall marks of someone who maybe has seen a gameplay trailer of a game, one day, many years ago. Instead of spending time trying to re-build the faith and reputation that COH fans expected of Relic, instead we had microtransactions of fugly cosmetics that the promotional images look like stuff I'd see on Mod DB 10 years ago. but it's okay, we can get most of them for free if we complete a series of mind numbing challenges that reward merits for tasks that are either so dumb easy it insults the intelligence of starfish or so abstract you might as well not bother and many don't. To add the last straw to this insult. The ""DLC"" that just launched, After 10 months of just fixing and patching we get two doctrines and 2 maps oh and something for campaign but you're not playing that so it's just two doctrines. Now you can unlock the doctrines without paying for them...If you're willing to grind up to 10,000 merits EACH ONE.

In summary. This game is a monument to wasted potential and infuriatingly bad calls. It has moments of fun, but really you'd be far better off playing Call to Arms Gates of Hell Ostfront if you want a fun WW2 RTS. 

TLDR Play Call to arms : Ostfront. Its much better. 

P.S. If any Relic devs read this, TACTICAL PAUSE  IS JUST THE PAUSE BUTTON FOR SINGLEPLAYER YOU MORONS! DON'T FLUFF UP BASIC STUFF BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING ORIGINAL!

There are still things to work out (vehicle pathfinding is an ongoing work-in-progress) and the most recent DLC is definitely costing too much for what it provides, but the core gameplay and balance improvements over release CoH3 are quite major.  While before I viewed CoH3 as a 4.5 or 5 out of 10, I think CoH3 is edging into 6.5 - 7 out of 10, which means I feel like I can lean into giving it a positive review now.

Previous review: I had a positive review here originally.  The gameplay is great, and while balance is a bit off (as would be expected for a new game with as many variables to match against each other as this one does) the reason for changing the review is at this point I'm not sure I have confidence in Relic to fix balance in a timely manner.  We'll see how things shape up when their first real balance patch hits the field (which they've said won't be any time soon), but my recommendation to everyone is wait another 6 months to a year and then check in again.

Update (8/19/2023): The game is getting closer to being where it needs to be for a baseline positive review.  Improvements have been made to pathfinding, sound design, visual effects, battlegroup abilities, etc. but balance is still a bit off and can be frustrating.  Certain aspects of game design can also be frustrating (pathfinding isn't completely fixed yet, for example) so there are still a decent number of ""feelsbad"" moments where things don't perform as expected.

They have no counter barrage so people can just spam artillery and since your eyes can't be everywhere on the map while they push all your stuff will just artry to death.  Commander skills will probably go the same way the last game was where some will be op as hell and they will just push one unit up to spot and use commander ability to break whatever defence you have setup (which is already starting).  Takes forever to build units so building what you need happens to late to counter other pushes and builds because by the time it is built you've lost a ton of territory or units to hold anything.  Another thing is the tank movements are frustrating as hell because they can't seem to drive or are a hundrad and one trying to drive.  Should be if your click is behind the tank then the damn tank backs up not try doing a 3 point turn no matter how far behind that click is behind them.

CoH 3 has fewer commanders again and that give you a better understanding of your enemy. More strategy and thats a +

Also units has a slightly better hold out value and that let you keep your units alive a bit easier. Its so frustrating when you have 2 front combat and loose a unit where you are not looking. Now you got better time to switch forth and aft.

Graphic is quite nice, gameplay is great. I am veteran of CoH 1 and CoH 2. I don't know what about people are crying with ""mobile game"". It is not. I would say that it is mix of CoH1 and CoH2 (feels more like CoH1 in terms of gameplay).

Pathing of vehicles is totally messed up right now which is annoying, because CoH 2 had the same issues for quite a long time, but eventually they fixed it.

What I like:
+Factions are more assymetric than in CoH1 and CoH2.
+ Gampley is just great.
+ Graphics is nice. Not great, not terrible, but I like it.
+ Game run very smoothly.
+ a lot of options how to play, every factions has few ways how to tech/ what to build. I feel that there is a lot more of choices than in CoH2, but maybe because CoH3 is just new and I don't know it so well.

What I do not like:
- lack of animations (like wheels sometimes are just not spin around, or reloading animations etc).
- Pathing of vehicles is simply terrible.
- Bugs, like blocking units etc.
- Sound is not ""meaty enough"".
- Balance. I thought that it was quite good on release, but they made some patch which nerfed bad factions, buffed strongest. LELIC at his best.


To be honest game just don't deserve to hate that it gets. We had Hogwarts Legacy release few weeks ago, it is also nice game, but has a lot of issues (bugs, performance, lack of mechanics), but has great reviews. I don't know why we forgive some games more than the others. Every game on realease nowdays has issues. All issues of CoH 3 are easy solvable and even now it is TONS OF FUN.

EDIT: After more hours, Balance is going to the minuses. It is quite terrible right now.

EDIT 2: 28.03. I am changing my review to negative. All of above is still true, but Relic decided to not fix the balance, they have decided to add the shop at the first place. Disgusting. 2 of 4 factions are unplayable in 1vs1 matches right now.

EDIT: 06.12.2023

When compared to COH2 it has some nice QOL changes but the game essentially feels like a coh2 reskin but just with improved graphics and a new Theatre of War, definitely not worth $80-100 AUD.

Damage is still pathetic with infantry squads able to survive direct mortar hits, tank gun ranges are still short and enemies barely take damage from MG's at all-- they can run through it's fire across the open and throw an AT grenade at Armor with perfect accuracy.

All they needed to do was find a mix between COH2 and COH1 Blitzkrieg mod and they'd be looking fantastic, ONLY consider buying it if there is a 50% off sale.

============================================================================

It is with a heavy heart I give this a thumbs down.
-I bought at launch, from the beta test and all it seemed fun and I would say I've gotten my money's worth in enjoyment. Found it fun and liked much of the game even with some bugs still floating around. 
-I waited to give a review positive or negative until the update, because I had some worries with particular features that didn't do anything and a grayed out 'store' tab. 
-I was hoping, that store tab would be a 100% in game concept with rewards or points from multiplayer or challenges. However history with game companies has showed me don't turst.
-So with the update revealed I can say. It's a good game, feel free to buy on sale or even just buy. BUT DO NOT TOUCH THE CASH SHOP. Reject it. Feel free to not buy the game because of the cash shop. And the EXISTENCE of micro-transactions in ANY WAY, is why I take a game I enjoyed and give it a thumbs down. (And for those thinking 'well still got CoH2' remember it has a cash shop too.

====================================================================================

12/5 - Update: wow a paid dlc that adds 2 commanders for PvP and 1 Commander in campaign and some 'premium' skins for 16.99$ (USD). I'm going to set aside the fact that the few weeks leading up to this 'update and dlc release' I got an error in the game stating I needed to update it first before I could play anything (an update that wasn't even out yet!) and just focus on what the dlc and decisions going in have come across like. 

The fact the shop was introduced so early, the fact the game still feels lacking in places and the fact that they were quick to monetize skins was bad. I had crossed my fingers hoping their first real DLC would be additional Campaigns, or a large content drop like the old CoH DLCs but no, it's stuff that past games would've given for free or at the very least cheap. 

Relic/Sega whichever of you is helming these decisions, your priorities are clear. I wanted to love CoH3, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I did enjoy the campaign despite finding it lacking compared to past entries (feels like they just saw how people reacted to the US campaign in CoH2 and made that the main campaign fuck any narrative). But the greed at play has just kept putting me off since then. Since I already own the base game I'll likely circle to it more in the future to waste some time but I can't recommend anyone buy this game unless it is MAJORLY discounted and even then, make you are ready to resist the cash shop.",1679974119,1701834668,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here we are a year out, the devs have made some considerable changes to the game to help improve things.
Unfortunately, the entire community still seems to be upset about the bad state of the game at launch.

Cumulatively, and especially with the latest patch, a lot of issues have been addressed and the game is in a fine state (minus the constant desync crash bug)

Still, it took a year to get here and along with the update they released an DLC with some absurdly broken battlegroups and a desync bug causing constant disconnects from games.

The new battlegroups brought back the axis bunker spam with a vengeance.

For the allied, the rangers are straight up broken, I watched as 3 units stood around the field hospital almost completely unaffected by 3 units and a vehicle shooting at them.

There really feels like there's not much QA going on with this game, just pushing it straight out in a panicked rush to get the game in a better state to monetize the dwindling player base.

The game is fun, but the patching was approached with speed, skill, and precision of a blind donkey.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initially, I would've given this a positive review despite the initial issues and lackluster content on release.

Here we are 6 months after launch, I haven't seen much of anything that has markedly improved.

In fact, they even went as far as to remove the feature of adding units to multiple control groups...
Not sure if that's something people complained about but its something I used frequently, this is a step backwards where they very clearly needed to *add* things rather than *remove* features....

Not to mention the rampant disconnects from raging children, its a game... its not even ranked... the devs haven't even added *that* 6 months in and *after* their post-launch upgrades???

It has potential to get better; so here's hoping Sega lets Relic try to Redeem themselves.

The game can still make money down the road once a lot of issues are fixed.
If Sega (who constantly limits Relic) jumps then another good publisher should pick this one up.
_______________________________________________________________________

Older Review at Release is as follows:

Overall Relic Fails on many Levels.

CoH 3 feels like a ""Souless"" Pile of Garbage.
A Fast Paced Spammy Cheesy Console Focused RTS.
Worst than DoW 3 for me and that is saying a lot.

They just Introduced even ""More Bugs"" after co called fixing several bugs then with the same post they Announce their In-game Merit System that allows you to complete challenges to earn Merit to Unlock...............(wait for it)............... Skins.  

Slow and Clunky Gameplay that keeps a lot of the core COH Series Mechanics yet tries to implement a design so the game plays well on both the pc and console.  “A Fast Paced Arcady Mess”.

I love the new setting but everything about CoH 3 makes me miss CoH 2.  Why even try to enjoy CoH 3 when it is a downgrade from CoH 2?  At first I was glad I purchased CoH 3 but now I am even more disappointed than CoH 2's rough start.  So will the community come and save the game for the PC with some awesome mods that have better balance as Relic rushes to get this arcadey mess out the door for the Console Crowds?

CoH 3 looks inferior yet runs my card hotter than CoH 2 does.

Zoom way too far in.  The more I play it just to be fair and test it out the more it feels like a Halo Wars 2 Design Focus.  This could be the decision for the zoom level too.  Right now Victory belongs to the Faster Click and Faster Micro Manager because of this more Arcadey Approach.
  
You will need a Top End Graphics Card to Enjoy Max Settings otherwise you are defaulted to Mid.
Graphics are really dependant on each Map; some maps look better than others.

Oh and the Building Mechanic; Heavy Mg Teams do much better out in the open except when the Enemy player or Enemy AI Spams the Arty & Calls Ins which is pretty much almost instant death and for sure a Retreat. But oh wait you have to retreat all the way back to your base to the limited retreat system.... ya. :steamfacepalm:

Light vehicles take down buildings in seconds while Infantry survive with little to no damage depending on the vehicle.  Or you have enemy Infantry using x-ray vision and take out your infantry in seconds if they are in a building with small arms fire.

Overall Defensive Combat Seems Empty and Void
It's more efficient to be on the Offensive at all times; some may like this, I hate it. 
In real life combat cover should be there to stop the injury or bleed. 

Small arms from Infantry and Light Vehicles taking out Medium to heavy Armored Vehicles? 
Answer- Yes.  What a cheesy mess.  

Not a fan of Units automatically jumping over cover.  (console friendly approach?) 

Tactical pause is a nice touch at first, but is it really needed except in a SP Campaign.
Clunky Clunky Clunky; it appears it will be more beneficial with a console controller.

Breaching--->  so for 30 ammo you you have what a 3 sec chance to react so your 250 point cost unit does not get wiped out?   Nice balance Relic- Not. 

Pathing is really bad at times  (was like this in previous CoH games, CoH 1 still being the best.)  CoH 2 & the vehicles constantly turning in circles driving you mad, but in CoH 3 it will be the path direction they choose to take that will drive you nuts; again Victor to the Faster Micro Key Button Presser that can adjust on the move.   

So why try to redeem CoH 3?   
The initial design of the game had console pad support from the get go, so they clearly wanted to design the game in a more friendly way and it gets boring really quick at times.  So which start is worse between CoH 2 and CoH 3?  Answer:  the Console Friendly CoH 3 for sure.....

I would not have purchased the Premium knowing they would push this on us as a ""DLC"".

Priced as a AAA game but feels just like an open alpha.
Poor sound and full of visual hiccups, but mostly it's boring

Italian Campaign was horrible. 3 maps * 3 game type throughout of the campaign, with some dull missions in between. Turn based executed poorly
Story is unappealing and moronic

The North Africa campaign is better, though it's funny how the story follows a poor Jewish family enduring the Holocaust, while playing as Erwin Rommel - The least hated Nazi there is.
One minute you hear about the horrors and the effort against the Nazi occupation,
The other you are slaying the same forces trying to stop it.
Doesn't feel authentic at all.

Not once did this game excite me, in all 594 hours of gameplay
Gave them so many chances to fix it, to no avail

Can't believe I paid for the Premium edition

COH2 Is Much Much better, even COH.

** Steel Shepherd 1.4 Edit **
On the positive end, they have finally managed to fix a very broken game, and it only took them ten months and several so-called 'major updates'.
Admittedly, the game does look and feel better thus far (SP experience), with updated menus and UI/UX improvements.

On the unfortunate end, this is by no means an expansion pack, more like a micro-transaction with macro pricing. the fact that I already paid for that utter waste in advance made it feel even worse.
Relic now has the audacity to release an expansion pack with nothing in it but some maps, commanders ('battle groups') and cosmetics for actual money, while completely ignoring the fact that they released 
an unfinished game and kept us waiting for an expansion pack that never came.
There are no real reasons to replay the campaigns, and there are even less reasons to buy this game.

They should've released this pack for free with an apology attached.
Do not consume.

Update 12/5/2023 - Relic attempts to cash grab by charging $17 for two battlegroups that probably should have been in the $70 game at release.

- UI is still a mess. Why I cant modify it like Coh2. I want my Units on the right upper corner.

the sounds wasnt updated, they are too flat and I think i am 1000 miles away from battle.

Coh3 launches with more content than both COH1 and COH2 for a standard AAA title price, and for that I highly suggest the game if you're a fan of the previous two games. 

One MAJOR complaint I hear from my German friends is that this is the first COH game that doesnt have voiceover in the German language, which is highly disappointing. 

Gamplay wise Coh3 feels much closer to a revamped coh1 than it does coh2, and for me that makes it better. For some that makes it worse. The battlegroups, while there are currently less of them than COH2 commanders, drastically alter the dynamic of your tech tree similar to COH1. Which I also think is a superior system.

As the game gets updates and more content, I'm sure the reviews will improve. But I've been here since coh1 and I will tell you from personal taste that coh3 is actually a pretty great game with a fairly toxic community.",1677194720,1701803282,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I normally don't leave reviews, regardless of whether I like or dislike a game, but I'll make an exception for this. I'm a big fan of the franchise ever since I first played a demo of the original Company of Heroes at Gamescom. I love RTS games, and this was the wet dream of all players. Of course, it had its limitations, but they were manageable. I convinced all my friends to buy the game so we could play together, and we spent a lot of hours enjoying it.

Then Company of Heroes 2 dropped – a new setting, more complex tactics, and, most of all, more different units and compositions to style your game. At launch, it had a lot of problems, so after buying the game, I uninstalled it to play Company of Heroes 1 again. But after a year, the game played like a charm, and although different commanders were locked and easier to obtain through paying with real money, they were also unlockable through in-game currency.

Then Company of Heroes 3 was announced, and I was excited! So much that my friends, the same ones I convinced to buy the other two games, created a fake hard case of the game with pictures of me on it. Inside was a Steam gift card with which I pre-ordered the game. When it finally released, I played and played and played it. The gameplay was smooth for me, but the lack of basic things like multiple commanders and a new setting, which were present in the previous entries, disappointed me a little. I had hoped the game would finally visit the Japanese theater and include all previous factions in multiplayer for the ultimate Company of Heroes experience. Instead, we got an unrefined game even after one year of release, and the first big update that should include multiple commander choice/customization is a DLC? It feels like a joke. I don't work in the game industry, so I don't know if there are hidden reasons behind these paywalls and unfinished games coming out in the last couple of years. Or maybe it's because I'm getting older, and my standards are changing, but this doesn't feel like the game studio I convinced many of my friends to buy multiple games from so we could play together.

Company of Heroes is one of the games I always have installed on my PC. It's my go-to relax game after a hard day. I guess I'll have to go back to Company of Heroes 2.

It pains me to say, but if you haven't bought the game yet, I suggest you're better of investing the money to buy Company of Heroes 2 and its DLC. Then you have a more complete game than when you get this one...",1701774405,1701781779,False,312,4,0.915910482406616211,11,True,False,False

Played Company of Heroes 2 in the last 3 years on and off enjoying a good side game to LoL.

Did not initially buy the game as heard it had issues with mixed reviews. With DLC on the way and heard patch 1.4 was a very good fix i jumped in.

I found that the game has changed from the trailers to be more gritty what we like. I found that the Factions are similar which is great with a few neat twists. Haven't ran into anything broken playing multiplayer.

Also found game runs so smooth. I'm working with a Alienware X17 3080. I place it on 4k with AMD FSR 2 on balanced all the settings up high and damn it looks good. 

Overall its a great game now! Probably needs a few more battle groups which are effectively commanders now but all that content will come in time :). 

As a 33 year old, Hope this helps anyone who is a bit stuck with with if to buy or not and bored with all these other live service broken game world we now live in. Great game to jump into for a quick game between work, wife and doggos!

But the multiplayer offers the same unique rts unit-based experience that Coh1 and 2 offered. Despite a rocky release, Relic (the game developer) has demonstrated the will to make it right and has slowly put out consistent patches from release to fix the numerous bugs and add the quality of life changes the game needed. The multiplayer is very entertaining and it's fun to experiment with new builds. 1v1 and 2v2 in particular feel relatively balanced, with 2v2 being my personal favorite. 3v3 and 4v4 are also quite fun, though you'll run into the usual multiplayer problem of playing with people who throw the game intentionally or unintentionally, and the more people playing at once the more likely that scenario is. Still, multiplayer would benefit from at least double the number of maps and Relic has yet to solve the atrocious vehicle pathing. But overall I think there's more than enough here to get many hours out of and to keep coming back.

Regarding the new DLC and cosmetics. The cosmetics are just that, they look nice, I don't feel any need to buy them, and they don't change the game play at all. I think that's a totally acceptable, and quite frankly a very tame, way of approaching micro transactions in the modern day. People are also already complaining about the new DLC not having enough content. While I was also a little disappointed in there only being two battlegroups, the two groups seem very well thought out and unique. People also love to forget that $15 in 2023 just isn't what it was 17 years ago when COH1 was released or even 10 years ago when COH2 was released. To me, that is a price I will begrudgingly pay but ultimately be happy about because those two battlegroups will entertain me for many hours to come, and likely will for most who buy it.

This game is worth a shot and a lot of fun. I can't help but feel most the bad reviews are from people riding the classic gamer bandwagon of pointing to the (admittedly bad) mistakes relic has made in the past and ignoring the fact the game is in a pretty good spot now with more good content to come.",1701641506,1701641629,True,1,1,0.482655942440032959,0,True,False,False

The first major content patch focused on releasing a PREMIUM MICROTRANSACTION STORE. Instead of fixing their broken game, they are too busy adding real-money cosmetics. In a $60 AAA title. Fuck these developers. 

UPDATE 2:
After adding a microtransaction store in their first major update, they are now releasing a paid DLC instead of fixing the endless list of problems. Its hard to imagine what moron is in charge of this, but they destroyed one of the best RTS franchises ever. 


ORIGINAL REVIEW:
CoH1 is one of my favorite games and the best RTS of all time. 
CoH3 is an unplayable buggy mess that looks, sounds, and runs like shit.  Even if I look past all the other faults because of how much I love COH, I *literally* cannot play this game due to the zoom and stutter problems. My specs are comfortably above the ""recommended"". 

PROS:
-Its supposed to be CoH
-QoL improvements (e.g. auto-vault, auto-reinforce, etc.)

NEUTRALS:
-Campaign:  Although I've played hundreds of hours of COH, I've never played the campaign in any iteration of the game, so I have absolutely no opinion on that. I only play ranked multiplayer. 
-Mouse Pan Speed:  Default mouse pan speed is WAY too fast. Thankfully there is an option to reduce this (I recommend 50%).
-Mod Support:  At first glance, this seems like it should belong in the ""PROS"" section, but given how poor the current audio/textures in the game are, it seems like the real reason they are supporting this out the gate is because they expect the community to fix their game. 
-Arcade style unit highlights: these didn't bother me, but they seem completely pointless (and I can understand why they bother other players). The player can only control the squad, not the individual units, so what point is there in highlighting the individual units and completely destroying the immersion?  

CONS:
-ZOOMED IN. You cannot see half the battle because the camera is SO CLOSE. Why am I playing the game with a microscope? Its not the like the textures are any good for me to look at. You cannot zoom out. (the previous games also had this issue to an extent)
-Runs like shit. I have an i7 9th gen with an RTX 2070.  3v3 is *literally* unplayable. 2v2 was a stuttering mess.  1v1 is ""playable"" but it is NOT smooth. (NOTE: I even reduced my gfx to 1920x1080 but it still stutters)
-NO ONLINE RECONNECT (in 2023). If it crashes or you disconnect - too bad. 
-Hotkeys: QWERTY hotkeys.  NO LEGACY HOTKEYS. 
-Audio:  Why is everything so quiet? I've seen others mention that devs were going for ""realism"" instead of ""Hollywood"" -- I personally don't care about that. I need AUDIO CUES when playing a game. Can't hear anything unless you're zoomed in right on top of the action (this is also partly because if you aren't looking at something, it won't play the sounds, but the sounds it does play can barely be recognized....)
-NO RANKED MODE:  Selecting multiplayer puts you directly into an unranked matchmaking lobby. 
-Default setting is borderless window withOUT mouse constraints. This setting is impossible to play. Laughable that it is the 'default' option. Bonus points: Mouse constraint setting does NOT save on quit. You have to do it each time you load the game. 
-HUD is unfinished and backwards in design.
--Buildings DO NOT SHOW what unit they are building when you select them (its shown somewhere else on your hud). This is really important because it means you CANNOT CANCEL CONSTRUCTION via HOTKEY.  In order to cancel a unit that is being built, you have to click on the icon on the screen that shows you how far along the build progress is. This icon is always on your screen (to show you the build status) which means its possible to accidentally cancel a unit building due to misclick (selecting the building first is not necessary). This is a subtle but major flaw in the new HUD. 
--Text chat box is distorted. This is a really really amateur level mistake in a $60 game. 
--Tons of blank space, weird color choices, etc. This problem is magnified when you consider how immensely zoomed in the game already is. As others have said, it feels very much like a mobile UI.",1677368339,1701329345,False,22,5,0.543339908123016357,2,True,False,False
1677280,136556397,76561197991822782,0,11,2377,0,2050,1683852488,"Update Nov 2023: Removed some of my optimism from my previous post. I've been WANTING to give this game another chance after the devs had some time to fix and expand this game to be closer to par (sequels should be at least as good as their predecessors). Learning that Relic has the gall to ask players to pump more money into this wreck to MAYBE get a small part of what we all expected from this game at launch is the last straw. The CoH franchise is dead, long live CoH 2. Relic, maybe just move on to phone-based app ""games.""

Overall: I can't recommend this game at this price (and this is very much not the review I thought I'd be writing). I want to love this game, and wanted to love it from the moment I learned of its development.  Both of the previous titles in the franchise are all-time favorites of mine, so I was very excited to play the third installment, and admittedly, the bar was high. And therein lies my chief problem with this game. When a developer makes a new game in a well established franchise, with a player-base that deeply appreciates those games, the bare and shameful minimum for a sequel should be ""as good as the last game."" Unfortunately, this game failed to deliver across the board.  I am, however, convinced that CoH3 has the potential to be as good as CoH 2 at it's prime, it's just a shame that we have to wait for that day post-release after waiting so long for such a well-anticipated sequel. 

Grain of salt for this review: it's based on comp-stomps and a brief attempt at campaign play (brief because it was dull but more on that later). That being said, most of my time in the previous versions of the game were vs. AI and multiplayer. I did not have a desire to try multi-player with the current structure of the game. 

General: The factions at launch felt pretty dramatically off-balance; they all played in a very ""rock, paper scissors"" sort of way. That being said, while I actually think the Devs are on to something with their new ""battle group"" approach, some of these options were objectively superior to others. I felt like I learned the one best way to play each faction after about 3 games with each one. So, all of the factions get repetitive pretty quickly, a feeling that is exacerbated by the fact that there just aren't that many units in the game. There are plenty of units you will build once and never again because their price-per-performance value is so awful, and others you will need to crank out over and over again at the cyclic rate in every game to stay competitive. I realize that the previous games benefit from a significant amount of expansion content in terms of available units, but the lack of viable variety in unit structure on release felt either lazy or like a deliberate with-holding to ensure we buy expansion content later. Both approaches are disappointing. A final gripe on factions, units and balance (and this one goes back further than CoH3): all factions should have more early options for building defensive positions. I'm not sure if Relic keeps a ""military advisor"" on staff, but infantry spend a significant amount of their time ""practicing"" improving positions, at least make it more accessible across factions. Some quality of life improvements seem to have been implemented that we noticed at first... but then there were enough unit control and general UI issues that we were mostly to distracted by them to care. 

Campaign play: I understand Relic has already made some changes to campaign play, but the parts that I touched were un-engaging and tedious. Skirmishes themselves were satisfactorily challenging, but the open world map left me wondering why there were so many places to go and things to do when the correct answers felt obvious, choices didn't seem to have consequences, and the enemy was just sitting back and letting it all happen. I DID feel like there was a layer behind the surface that I didn't quite understand... I was selecting forces to build pretty much at random. But that's because the tutorial introducing the Total War style of campaign map was pretty bad, even for a veteran of those games. I didn't stick it out to learn the ropes because 1. it didn't seem to matter that I was missing some core mechanic or principle (if I even was), and I lost interest in my objective after about 2 hours. Maybe the other campaign is better. 

Visuals/Sound: It is a pretty game.... BUT something is still missing? Textures are definitely prettier, but it feels like their are fewer of them. Overall, it gave the maps a feeling of smallness in scale that probably isn't even fair to them - there were some interesting maps. After we switched back to CoH2 (because we did after about a week of seriously dedicating time to CoH3), we felt like overall, 2 comes across as a better looking game. And as I sit here and watch the screen shots roll by, that does't even make sense to me. This IS a good looking game, but the way it all comes together just leaves you feeling like there is somehow less visually going on. You probably won't notice this unless you go back and play CoH3. There are some positive changes here overall. For example, the way vehicles display damage as they get saltier is pretty awesome... but it does get drowned out by the fact that essentially every high veterancy vehicle you have will look like its been through a slap chop a few times, regardless of repair status. Again, visually it feels very ""half-way there."" Sound wise, the weaponry and sound effects sound great, but again, when we went back to 2, the ambient sound structure in that game felt way more full. Once again, half-way there. 

Summary: If you want to play the best version of CoH, stick to CoH2. It pains me to say that. For the price of this game, and the length of time the fan base waited for this sequel, we should have had a better product at launch. I really do believe that this game can still be the best game in the franchise, but it is about half-way there right now. And I don't say that too optimistically. Half way there means half way to go. This game needs a LOT of tweaking to get it across that finish line, and whether or not I bother with the next Relic game will depend on whether those of us that bought the game at or before launch see those improvements for free, or with DLC that we have to purchase. Either way, I don't expect to have that version of Company of Heroes for at least another year. If you're on the fence, hop back over to CoH2, and certainly don't pay full price for this version of the game. Hell, even if you're new to CoH, save yourself $30, and buy the better-looking, sounding, and playing CoH2 AND and an expansion! Seeing overall reviews for a Company of Heroes game as ""mixed"" says way more than I could in one review.

I think maybe AAA developers need to start adopting a cheaper-to-opt-in early access period the way ""indie"" studios do on the reg. They would get a lot of feedback to improve the game before ""full release,"" take less heat for the all-to-common half-assed releases we see so often from them, and still make plenty of cash to keep the stock value high. If these companies are going stick to formulaic cash cow development and make only token efforts to innovate, the least they could do is stop insulting their long-time fans with dud releases. We'll still buy your game if it's just a modern version of the old game we love(d), just do us the common courtesy of ensuring it's just as good.",1681270358,1701314297,False,6,0,0.53125,0,True,False,False

More words:
I found Company of heroes franchise on its second addition. I ended up purchases all DLC for that game, even showing up late to the original release. 
Since this point, there hasn't been a time ive not had some COH installed. 
That in perspective, #3, this release. Has been one of my favorite since. 

On release we had a rough start with COH3. However the developers listened, and created a step by step plan to assure things would change. They have kept to their word on working the balancing, map expansion, modder support, DLC release, bug patches, and changes that make me want to replay the game from the start to find all the cool new changes. Above all this has been a great experience for me. The difficult part is finding friends to routinely meet/ team-up.

Long story short, Relic put out an incomplete game and are yet to complete it.  They've spent time on making micro-transactions though so they can milk some more money out of you.  They have a progress system in place that hasn't started so there's not much point in playing.  They have a battle group system with 0 additional battle groups to swap out because they didn't launch with more than the minimum.  This is Cyberpunk level failure.  For a longer review.  Look below.

I'm a die hard fan of COH ever since the first one.  I've played other relic titles as well and dear lord did they drop the ball with COH 3.  Where did they go wrong?  The gameplay is just as smooth as before.  They even made the dominance of tanks to be a little more forgiving.  However, Relic has done just about every horrible thing that games have done recently.

The Campaign is terrible.  It's so easy and repetitive that you can basically just march forward on the hardest level.  Nothing like the skill it took to beat the Ardennes Assault.
Multiplayer is where the vast majority of my COH experience is and they left out so many things it makes you wonder if they did it on purpose just so that they could crank out a few easy updates.
At first, you couldn't see players names during combat so you didn't know who you were fighting.  Also, the colors on the mini map made no sense and were completely random making it hard to remember who is friend or foe.
From day one they didn't even have stat tracking.  9 months in, they don't have the ability to replay.
Now they have stat tracking, but i'm still ranked at the bottom because they don't have player progression.
But don't fear.  They have cosmetics that you can work toward.  But most of them are purchase only.  And now they want you to pay 17 bucks to get a few cosmetics and not have to work towards to battle groups that they should have rolled out a year ago.  Not to mention that this means that they are only launching 1 extra battle group for 2 out of 4 factions.  This game is incomplete.  I've played a TON of it and have very little to show for.

I purchased this game on release earlier this year. I have previously played Company of Heroes 2, and other Relic titles. 

This game released with two campaigns and multiplayer from the beginning. The two campaigns were a total war-like invasion of Italy campaign, and a sequenced campaign based on Rommel in North Africa. Two great scenes for what should have been great campaigns. 

The total war-like campaign was incomplete. Mission triggers would lock up making it unable to progress the campaign in nearly all the mandatory missions. There was a wide option to choose how to advance your forces (should i use bombers to soften the Germans before advancing my armored division, or use my newly created battleships to shore bombard?) but practically they did nothing to make the campaign easier, even on harder difficulties. The AI was incapable of defending settlements to the point you could run multiple divisions through a gauntlet of fire and attrition on the campaign map, take the required settlement, delete the depleted division and just recruit a new one. This has not been improved since launch. 

Multiplayer: 

On release an absolutely heavy German bias. For whatever reason on launch Relic decided giving the German-Italian faction a unit that could throw its own smoke at zero munitions cost, move faster when running out of smoke, and attack ground with a flamethrower (and the unit had 2 of them). This unit at vet 1 also got a heatseeking AT satchel for light-medium anti armor. 

There were several units like this, and after a few months they were patched all the way down into uselessness. 

This is a trend that has continued the entire time this game has been out. Paradrop planes being shot down by AA? Relic didn't buff their health, they just made paradrop planes invincible. 

From Launch to present Relic has prioritized cosmetic sales. Before any unit buffs or nerfs, long before any attempts at fixing the campaign ai, Relic unveiled their cosmetic store. 

The player pop has dropped from 19,397 peak to 2,620 peak in under a year. 

Now in order to get additional sales they are releasing an expansion for 17 dollars that includes a couple multiplayer maps, battle-groups that are more likely than not broken and won't see patches until well into the new year (if their track record is anything to show for it), and more cosmetics. 

Do not buy this game. Don't buy it for 60 dollars, don't buy it for 48 dollars, don't buy it for 20 dollars. You will be disappointed.

I have ten hours in, and I've played about four hours of skirmish, and another six hours of the Italian campaign. I prefer solo vs AI over the MP experience (generally speaking). 

I was pleased to find I am enjoying my time with COH3 this time around.
The campaign has been fun so far. and the skirmish is very decent. 

With the upcoming patch and DLC just around the corner, it seemed like a good time to take advantage of the sale. 

I feel the game is worth the money, and look forward to the rest of the campaign as well as the next one.
 
On release day I didn't have time to really give the campaign/game much of a chance and still stay under the two hour return window.  

I recommend the purchase, especially while on sale.

As the little mistakes build up managing your tilt becomes the core gameplay mechanic that decides whether you regroup and make a come back or succumb to increasingly rash decisions.

[b]Gameplay[/b] is solid and it is pretty fun

[b]Performance[/b] is pretty good, better than CoH2, that game still lags sometimes
[b]Content[/b] is kinda lackluster, there is not a lot of content at launch, but still way more than in CoH1 and CoH2 at their launches 

[h3] Cons [/h3]
The Zooming (in my opinion) should be further away, but this is the fault of the community, as many people did complain that the zoom is too far and that the tanks look small (this complains happened during the test from winter if I remember correctly)
Some bugs in the Italian campaign map and overall, User Interface looks like a wireframe just before creating actual assets. It also has unfinished assets (some of the portraits are still placeholders and have the CoH2 pictures) 
Some features are missing, but Relic did manage this pretty well as they stated this missing at launch features from the start. They've written an entire blog post with everything that the game will have and not have at launch.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3] 
If you wanna play the campaigns, go for the game, it is pretty fun - if you wanna have fun with the gameplay, go for it, if you just wanna play ranked and tryhard, I suggest you to wait, as there are a lot of broken tactics because the game is new, of course it won't be very balanced as there are no replays (just a work around for them), no real ranked system and so on at launch. 
But those will be added soon. I personally can't understand why people are hating so much. The game has a solid foundation and for real, even CoH1 had so many bugs and problems at the beginning (the matchmaking was trash, the people would remove you from lobbies 24/7 because you just started playing or because you have low rank, the community was toxic and so on)",1701007480,1701007480,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I think due to this studio running with bare bone crew, the expansions and updates are not being churned out as fast as we would've liked. There are still balancing issues such as the OP Advanced Logistics from the US that churns out men and tanks the longer the match goes. Overall CoH3 is heading in the right direction albeit with skeleton crew, hopefully they can improve on it faster.

Original review:

Emerald Bear patch turned Company of Heroes into Company of Strafes. Mobile anti-air can't shoot down plane, cheesy 8 nerfed a little but still an easy win button late game for Allies, and most disgusting of all, strafes. US AF has cheap air strafes with 2 passes that can almost guarantee to kill any MG or anti-tank squad unless you instantly hit the retreat button. Big patch every 3 months is too long.

The entire time your fighting to take over territory on your way to the location the game amps up as the final stage.  But then when you finish the section just before what you believe is the final stage, the game says ""Now onto _____"" and then the credits roll you right back to the main menu.   YOU NEVER GET TO FINISH THE MAIN CAMPAIGN!!! And the worst part is, it's almost set up like it will be future DLC... 

Compared to the previous installments, there aren't really any major improvements or implements.   While the main campaign map is drastically bigger than CoH2, and gives you access to naval and aircraft to assist, all they did was toss on a TBS game on the top layer.  It's like they took CoH2 and added RISK and bunch of skirmish matches to pad out the run time.   It feels like there are less unit types in this game than the previous.  And for what units there are in game, you can be sure they added dozens of purchasable cosmetic skins.

Then there's the side campaign... aka Nazis in Africa.  That plays out like a standard CoH campaign and feels like it was meant to be dlc for the original CoH.  And the worst part is the number of spelling and grammar mistakes.  I'm not a grammar nazi, but when the secondary objective says ""limit vehicle vosses"".... it just goes to show this is a beta release, being sold as fully released, with ""future upgrades and DLC coming soon""...

This game isn't just about strategic gameplay for me; it's a weekly rendezvous with childhood friends.

Gameplay-wise, it retains the essence of the first game, which is fantastic for someone who enjoyed the first game.

Each faction brings its unique flavor to the game, making it enjoyable to experiment and play with all of them. 

But where ""Company of Heroes 3"" truly shines is in its multiplayer aspect. It's a blast, especially when played with friends. Coordinating strategies, facing off against each other, or teaming up against others online.
In summary, ""Company of Heroes 3"" is a commendable successor that I highly recommend.

Mechanically this is the same game as the previous two, I guess you can build your base but why does that matter it's hardly a conflict area in most games, it looks very good and sounds good but gets boring quickly, the only measure of progress is earning points for skins so doesn't unlock any new gameplay.
The devs make a big song and dance out of the Italy campaign and their constant work on this, but as you only play one faction, it's only good for a couple of playthroughs, not sure who they think is playing the entire thing again each update because they have changed one aspect of it.
Content is incredibly slow, 3 commanders for each faction is rubbish, yeah they're trees but they are hardly much different on each branch and usually the game is over before you can use the high tech gear. The AI hasn't changed and makes no really advanced plays, and the map rotation is boring, modders make maps more frequently for the older titles than the devs do for this. I'm not gonna convince friends or otherwise to drop £50 on this when we are just going to be bored after a week

The bad:

The Italian campaign, which is the main campaign of the game gets reparative pretty quickly. It desperately needs more maps, different scenario's and above all smarter and more varied AI. You can autoresolve the minor battles, but if you are like me, that’s a theoretical option only.

At release the game lacked basic functionality such as ranked matches. This has been solved now, but it still annoys me that they would release a game in that state.

Balancing issues seem to be solved by creating new balancing issues. admittedly though the issues are getting smaller.

Stupid Idea to make reversing vehicles and pulling your infantry back to base the same button

The Good:

When you are playing against an equally strong (or in my case weak) opponent the matches can be very exciting and advantage can shift back and forth. 

There is more than one way to counter a threat leading to varied playstyles

I know I spend more time commenting on the bad, but the last to points really are what makes a RTS for me, so hence... Still a recommend.

[h3] VETERANS OF THE FRANCHISE [/h3] 

I'll say it upfront. COH3's launch and first year has been [b] infinitely [/b] better than that of COH2's a decade ago. Now understandably, that might sound pitiful still as it'd mean Relic learned little from COH2's release. For this? I'll concede it /is/ pitiful of them. However that doesn't remove the fact this game's launch is probably the /best/ we've seen out of Relic in over a decade. (DOW2 and COH2 both were worse than this on release, hands down.) So if you still love Relic and you're willing to forgive them for DOWIII's debacle. Then by all means, give them 40~60$USD. The Studio is in pretty bad shape and they're [b] genuinely [/b] trying to have this game go above and beyond the scope of COH2 without the incredibly predatory monetization it had. 

Anyone who proclaims the monetization of COH3 is worse than 2's, they're lying. Straight up. COH2 dime n' nickeled you for content from day 1 and had EXTREME cases of ""Pay-2-Win"" Commanders which released similar to that of MOBA Characters. (AKA Strong on release, balanced months after to pressure players to purchase.) COH3's monetization thus far has been EXCLUSIVELY cosmetics and- that is perhaps the most respectful and healthy form of monetizing a game without shattering the playerbase. 

[h3] FOR NEWCOMERS TO THE FRANCHISE [/h3] 

For anyone who's never played a Company of Heroes game. COH3 is a good place to hop on if you're not strapped for cash. Relic has made it clear they're going to focus heavily on this game and getting players to return to it. Now is as good time as any to join the community and follow it along as it grows. But more specifically...

- Single Player Customers

As far as Single Player goes. COH3 is the best in the franchise as far as gameplay goes. Narratively? COH1 is likely a bit stronger to most people. If you want a WW2 RTS that's easy to get into and play on your own for a solid amount of playtime. Go ahead and pick this game up. Though if you're looking for East-Front content than COH2 still is a good buy as well, however you might need to fork over a bit of cash for the ""mission"" packs that game release.

- PVP Enthusiasts

As a veteran of both COH 1 & 2's multiplayer scenes. This game by far has had the most variety in terms of player strategy (at least given the available selection.) Multiplayer in COH3 has been a blast and Relic genuinely has learned a LOT from its past mistakes in previous installments. Doctrine choices are incredibly impactful and due to the limited number of them you'll be able to memorize them for the 4 factions available within a reasonable timeframe. 

                                                                                    -----

Overall, as much as I love this game and franchise. It still has a long journey ahead of itself. But for now? It presents itself as Relic's most serious attempt at making a consumer-friendly in over a decade. Which at least to /me/ means a lot considering it's the 2020's. People tend to forget the terrible monetization Relic put on their games a decade ago just out of forgetting. I haven't...and I appreciate the effort they're putting into this. The team behind this has [b] heart [/b] but I'm afraid to say they've definitely lost a lot of talented workers during the 2010's.

So, I really wanted to continue supporting this game, because i do enjoy it, and I still feel like it got an unfairly bad wrap on launch. However, we're half a year in, and while we've gotten a couple more maps and a whole mess of balance changes (a lot good, some bad). But with the announcement of the next expansion being so barebones for such a pricetag, I can't continue recommending the product. Gonna leave my old review up for posterity's sake, though.

OLD REVIEW

Review-bombed to oblivion, and undeservedly so. There are bugs, missing polish, all sorts of faults like that that are almost unforgivable for a large studio in this day and age. 

And yet, the game is fun. The balance still needs to be worked on, and more maps would be nice, and i crave access to more battlegroups, but the game is fun and the multiplayer is fluid and engaging in a way I have a hard time making comparisons to. If I were to make any suggestions; play if you're willing to ignore a little polish to learn a game that probably plays the best in the series. Don't play if you're not willing to deal with a couple bugs and an assholish community.",1677190774,1700456957,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why:

1. Good ideas with mediocre execution. 
2. Too many bugs over shadow the ideas.
3. Too much reliance on the community for mod content, not enough official content.

Empathy for the Devs:

1. COH 3 was most likely re-written onto a new game engine or a new version of the COH 2 game engine. Like either they switched from Unity to Unreal or went from Unity 3.x to Unity 20xx.
2. Between new a campaign, new multi-player Battlegroups, and a rewrite, there were too many ideas to do and not enough development time.

Advice for Devs:

Don't over commit to a grand vision on top of a rewrite. The only teams that can pull that off are usually lead by the top 0.1% of game developers and designers. There must be more self-awareness of what can be accomplished with the given team and time.

Advice for Gamers:

If you're okay with bugs, then go for it. There are some fun ideas, and some bugs can be funny memes.

If you're not okay with bugs that break the gameplay immersion, if you're not okay with the thin amount of official content, then I recommend skipping this sequel.",1700445985,1700446087,False,5,0,0.537954568862915039,0,True,False,False

Is CoH3 better then Coh2?  The answer is a very clear no.  If anything, it feels like CoH2 is the upgrade. That doesn't make CoH3 a bad game. Just a slightly worse one.  I can apperciate them trying new things but I cannot grasp how they did the campaign for Adrennes assault so well and the campaign for this so badly. If they carbon copied it.  It would've been better. 

Instead it's really just a ton of extra meaningless fights or auto resolves with less then 10 story missions that are okay. The 2nd campaign is a little better directed but still lacks a lot.

CoH3 is as much a step forward as it is back from CoH2. For RTS fans on a budget I highly recommend purchasing CoH2 and DLC over CoH3 if you're looking for the best bang for your buck.

There's a new campaign map allowing you to pick where to go and what to attack in whatever order you want. However, the random fights attached to those decisions are the same cookie cutter maps and objectives over and over again. I must have received the same map and mission 4 times in a row. Overall the game-play is much the same as CoH2 but many of the in-game features that were made available in CoH2 seem to be missing at launch.

Zero realism as is the tradition, but its fun, engaging and looks...er ok? Some of the environment detail looks good but I have this horrible feeling it would have looked life-changing if they weren't making it for CONSOLES FFS!!!! Why just why? (yes I know they just want the money, greedy fools)

Finished the Italy campaign, I played this in the beta testing and love the addition of some turn-based strategy to make it a little more dynamic, emphasis on little as your veteran troops and vehicles return to the status of newbie grunt when you start each mission. So it feels a tiny bit like the strategy map is a little disconnected from what goes on in battles. You inevitably have to do some scripted missions to capture certain places, some don't need a battle, for the rest it's all skirmishes. Not going to lie but I swear I ended up playing 20 skirmishes on the same map?? Surely there could be more!?

Overall I do like this addition to the series, the Italy campaign does just about enough to give it some replayability, although it does seem to relentlessly push you in one direction. Also, the campaign map feels a little clunky and buggy, not quite as polished as one would expect. Some strange little details too like if you capture a region, any enemy emplacements etc just...stay there...forever, it feels a little odd. Some questionable 'upgrades' for your divisions when you earn points, some of them just didn't really seem all that worth it. Slightly disappointed they didn't bring more of the Ardennes Assault style need to preserve your troops and have persistent armies but I'm nit picking really. There's a lot of atmos which COH has always had and it's a good choice of WW2 theatre, don't think the med campaigns get a lot of attention and brings a different type of terrain with it which has been stylised well.

Some reasons:
After almost one year release, it does not have a reply system (you cannot watch reply in game).
After so many discussions in the community already, the devs are deaf and refuse to apply any penalty on early game quitters, so there are more and more of them, which makes normal players leave. 
Most of the updates (there are only few though, lol) make both control and communication harder and harder (e.g. signal icons now cover almost 10% of the map; vehicles now are not able to maneuver, they act as if they have their own thoughts).
Very buggy and inconsistent. But to be fair, they are slowly fixing them. But still you can easily feel it's an unfinished piece of work.",1700141447,1700141447,False,3,0,0.47568097710609436,0,True,False,False

Beyond disappointed. Over 2,000 hours on Company of Heroes 2, was so excited to play this game and they pushed it out half baked.

It runs like garbage compared to previous titles. The units all feel clunky and slow. The gameplay is so boring and less tactical than previous iterations. The game was lacking basic features at launch, they have added some since but it still feels half baked. The lack of maps is a disgrace. Company of Heroes 2 had a thriving community of map makers and to not leverage those and launch a game with only a handful of maps in each game mode is unfortunate. They had added a store into the game before they addressed many of the complaints at launch. The color options for teams makes it harder to play. Why would I be any color but blue, it makes zero sense.

I do like the feature that auto reinforces my units when they are at base.

Not only did the player count drop from over 40000 on launch to barely 3-4 thousand at peak times but there is litterally no obvious development. 

So even after several Updates there is no balance to be found.

While they might have made a few  changes to the infantry, the fact that even the lightest of allied tanks can steamroll the entire battlefield throuout the entire game is outright disgusting.
Short and simple:  Too Strong, Too Cheap, Appear way too early.

Despite the obvious fact, that  allied tanks are way too strong, the biggest problem is still the infantery. 
From the start of the game untill the end the standard british and american infantery can't be contested by any of the German counterparts. 
 
Once the commandos and paratroopers hit the field, the game is almost  impossible to win.
Why is it that allies are so much stronger than axis ???

How can anyone justifie this bullshit.

2. The Jaeger Infantery can be potentially be upgraded with a Tank hunting kit.  
But 90 Ammuniton for a single Panzerschreck is just mind boggling.         (Avoid the upgrade if possible)


3. Now the Stug. is literally just like the Marder with horrendously low range. It's effectiveness against infantry is semi at best.      (Personally I see no point in building it)


Also the ability of the  Us Forces, to drop Mgs on the battlefield should at least cost 1 command point.  Because right now its basically guaranteed Map control from the getgo.


The fact that the developers focused on the ingame store before even adressing the most basic functionality of the implemented, so called, features in combination with the totall lack of  progress in terms of content ( MultiplayerMaps, Battlegroups, the ability to surrender, etc.) just shows of how greedy and selfserving Sega and Relic really are.

This game was released far too early, I feel like I've paid full price (+ Premium Edition price) for an Alpha/Beta of COH3. The lack of content and the barely working AI are honestly shocking.

Currently, a full 6 months after release, there is virtually no additional single player content. Even the skins aren't usable in single player. 

The game has had some small fixes in recent months, but it is still littered with bugs. 

Just for an example of a bug which has still yet to be fixed, As of November the 9th 2023, the US M2A1 Howitzer still doesn't work.  

Overall, when the game broadly works well enough to play, it's pretty fun... but... COH3 seriously lacks content when compared to it's predecessors and the graphics are barely improved from their previous games. 
No noticeable improvements to the AI over the previous game, it's still terrible. 

The Relic developers seem to be more focused on producing skins for you to buy at exorbitant prices, rather than improving the quality and the core content of the game. 
Who on earth really wants to play a game like this on a PlayStation / Xbox anyway? What a complete waste of development time and money. Would have been better spent making sure the game was working on PC before even considering that!

The single-player campaign mode (both Italy and North Africa) have horrible acting voice-overs, the ""acting"" and their scripts are cringe-worthy. Seriously disappointing from a game that demands AAA prices. I expected something more immersive and more historically accurate. 

Whoever did the voice-acting and wrote the script for Rommel in the Desert campaign has a special place in hell! It was atrocious! He doesn't even sound German!

I think Relic have bitten off more than they can chew with COH3, they weren't ready, the game wasn't ready.

It might be better in 18 months time, hopefully after some changes of management at Relic.",1688977644,1699564040,False,25,0,0.633232951164245605,0,True,False,False

Today I’ll be reviewing “Company of Heroes 3” the latest RTS from Relic who has had some trouble the past few games rekindling that COH1 / DOW fire.  I’ve had some severe concerns about this game mainly due to the reviews seen prior and the commentary on it.  Were my concerns founded?  Let’s discuss!

War, War never Changes:  It’s an RTS, so at the core you know what we get here; drawing boxes around units and right clicking on things you want to not exist anymore.  In many ways you are getting exactly what we got from the predecessor, some saying with better sound and graphics others without.  I personally lean on the ‘better’ side for the most part.  I’m not a military historian but the sounds are good and impactful.  The biggest addition for single player is the pause button, an addition I absolutely love.  I am not a completive player, usually never PVP and if I am playing with other players it is co-op.  So adding this made my day.  I am continued to be disappointed that base building is still more of an afterthought though I do appreciate the ‘auto-build’ option that at least makes it easier to place production buildings.

Another Day, Another Beach:  Let’s talk about the big new addition of the game; the new campaign.  This can be best described as a board game with RTS mission blended in.  A match made for me ideally but there are some issues (mentioned later).  I really enjoyed the idea of a turn based world map that had real time battles but if you are think more of the Total War this is not it although you will be building several ‘armies’ that move around the map capturing territory that you will turn into more resources and abilities.  There is a light story but it’s mainly ‘get to the final objective while making 3 of your subordinates happy’.  There is also a more traditional campaign that plays more like a typical campaign with themed missions that tell a story.  I do like the overall intent of the campaign but I really would have liked to see an Allied and Axis campaign and a generic campaign map board game as an alternate mode (even as DLC).  One really cool addition in the campaign is the bonus missions in the skirmishes you have during the game, gaining more skill points but also making the mission interesting.

Embrace the Suck:  Okay, now for the negatives and most of these will be from the campaign mode itself that I simultaneously loved and was annoyed with.  To begin with the biggest issue with the game is the lack of details it tells you.  The campaign is the biggest violator of this; you just simply don’t know what does what or how it works and only by trial and error do you figure it out.  The game itself also struggles with this on the battlefield.  Yes, I know the defenses of my units (HP & Armor can be found) but what about my offensiveness, I’m sure that Tank Destroyer has more damage and penetration but how much more?  Where’s my stats, I need to see effectiveness, does that Rifle add +2 against infantry or +9?  All I know is that it’s ‘more effective’.  There are also some generic bugs, like repairing; sometimes the units will run in place, this appears to just be cosmetic but I’m not sure that’s true.  I will say that the biggest bug (and it should be easy to fix) is the emplacement bug on the campaign map, they are supposed to slowly degrade when out of supply…they don’t.

Overall, I enjoy COH3 and I know that isn’t exactly a popular opinion.  I am not a competitive player and never play PVP outside of my friends, I’d much rather grab two friends and play 3vAI than against.  Yes, there are plenty of areas for improvement, especially with the campaign but I enjoy the game so at this point I’ll recommend the game with the caveat that I have zero experience in online PVP.

I've been trying to appeal my community and multiplayer bans but they appear to do more than just ignore them, they most likely downright reject them and I bet enforcement@relic.com has added my IP/email to the ignore list.

The game launched as a buggy POS mess and remains in the current state. As soon as you get to the main menu you will wonder if you just bought a $50 title or a $5 indie game. The more I play the more I realize how much time and work you need to put in to this to even be able to lose gracefully in online skirmishes. The more I play the more I realize that I would rather be at my actual job getting paid than trying to learn how to play this game and have a somewhat decent time online. The single player is extremely boring and repetitive. The only thing that changes is the enemy AI's difficulty. I think it took me less than a week to beat the game in single player? And at no point did I learn anything new or helpful for online skirmishes, and at no point did I find myself having fun. Over 50 hours spent trying to learn online game play, watching guides, playing and practicing. It's truly NEVER a good experience for me as a new player. Maybe 1 out of 20 games you play against someone else who hasn't been playing the series competitively for a very long time. The rest of the time you're just going to be getting canned. The multiplayer is just a complete sandbox for experienced players to absolutely f*** on new players and then j*** each other off in their tournaments of 60 players. These 60 players are really the only people that enjoy the multiplayer side of this game. To add to this mess, the game just FEELS incomplete and rushed, the experienced players seem to say that the game is not enjoyable, and the balances of factions even at competition level are a complete joke. There's no actual tier system that works. You could be Bronze 3 with 10% win rate after 50 games and still be playing against extremely experienced players regularly. The only redeemable quality about this game is that THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR LEAVING/QUITTING GAMES EARLY. YOU CAN JUST LEAVE AT ANY POINT AND START UP A NEW GAME! WHAT A NIFTY TRICK! I just ended up just leaving every time the game stopped becoming fun because why not? You're going to lose anyways. Your opponent is always FAR better than you. How it took so many years and work to release this pile of hot garbage is beyond me. 
If you enjoy learning by losing constantly to better players, winning to players even worse than you or just not having a good time while you play video games, this game might be for you. But if you aren't interested in wasting your money and free time, I would stay away from this title. It's unfortunate that there aren't any good WW2 RTS multiplayer games anymore. After many many MANY attempts to enjoy this game in ANY capacity, I will be removing this from my library and forgetting about it. I suggest you save yourself the money unless you find this game years from now on sale for like $5 or something. That's truly all that the current content is worth. Just look at the content of the OVERWHELMINGLY terrible reviews and look at the content of the very few and far between good ones. 

I regret ever trying to get into Company of Heroes. I think I would rather go through learning League of Legends all over again before getting CoH 2 and 3. Look elsewhere funseekers, as you will find non here.",1677451991,1699251987,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In an attempt to make a great game they have added so many options that actually take away at first from getting into the meat of the game. 

Then you basically have only 4 maps that pretty much all play the same way. 

One thing I used to love about RTS's back in the day, was that good ones were challenging but had multiple ways to finish a map. 

Now its just rinse and repeat. I know decades ago they got away from resource management as the currency and large armies due to the graphics and memory demand . 

But if you going to cheap out and and just do flag capture and limit the player to only a few squads and vehicles that's fine.

Gitting gud depends knowing the units' strengths and weaknesses and learning how to combine them effectively, unlike other RTS games that are more about macro, amassing resources, producing tons of units, and CPM. Skirmishes are intense, strategic, and require your full attention. 

If you're fan of the prior CoH games but do not want to be patient while more maps are added and better balancing implemented, then maybe you should wait. For those CoH fans who are relentlessly panning this game and saying they'd rather play CoH2 for a couple of years, try to remember how long it took the devs to properly balance the factions in CoH2 and realize how difficult it is to really balance a game with this many factions, units, and other variables against all the cheesy bullshit that a large player community can come up with.

Thank u for wasting my time on a waiting screen lovely. I hope u lads are proud of your selfs. Releasing an unfinished product  that was ment to die after release because of these reasons.

Ppl don’t buy it if u wanne buy something buy COH2 but definitely not this one. If u like MP, just give it a hard pass. Buy something that has a decent rating and don’t fatten there greedy wallets. Just saying. I wish they made a law against shitty products so I can at least get a refund when shit this doo doo doesn’t do what it’s promised. It’s like the release of the new I phone with the change of the usb c cable because they were forced by the law.

pathfinding that is worse then COH1 

Tanks that when ordered to attack one target, will not prepare to attack the target you ordered until they are IN RANGE, wasting time you could have used to kill the target you want. instead shooting that one pioneer squad.

Italy campaign, no Italian faction. im so happy i bought the new COH1 DLC

Just play COH1, works better, looks better.

I consider this a significant step up in terms of Gameplay, from CoH2.
It combines aspects of CoH1 and CoH2 while delivering its own on top of it.
For example, it returns to the Doctrine style of CoH1 as opposed to commander selection.
And ultra light vehicles, Light vehicles and light tanks play a much larger role in the mid/late game.

Take this filthy casuals opinion.

We're not going to be able to relive the perfection that was Company of Heroes, or the glorious climb to excellency that became company of heroes 2.

Instead what we have here is an tragically under cooked game who's primary suffering is awful presentation. Re-Used Assets, Static and lifeless presentation to greet, and one severely pissed off fan-base.

There is only one catch though.

I'm actually enjoying the game.

Disregarding the noise, and the fact that purchasing this product continues to fuel the trend of push it out the door busted, and patch it later, there IS a compelling experience and future to be had here, some genuine surface level quality improvements and welcome updates to the engine. (Albeit, suffering form some questionable model quality problems) It's still undoubtedly Company of Heroes.

This installment was never meant to re-invent the genre. It's fair to have high expectations for something so groundbreaking and enjoyable as COH, especially in the climate that RTS has been under for years now. Still, I can't seem to advocate for the brutal negative feedback.

COH 3 Is truly mixed, and if I had the option of selecting that as an option I would.

This recommendation is based on very surface level subjects and limited involvement in the community, as well as truthful ignorance to the complex and statistical mechanisms of the game. (See opening statement) I don't expect the rest of the player-base to agree so take that as you will. As RTS players, we NEED To admit that Migration is difficult, it's  an experience based on learning, practice and muscle memory. Deviation from habit is not easy, and it's possible this is a contributing factor to some of the hateful feedback.

First off, battle groups is the right step forward. I never found the commanders in COH2 to be a compelling way of introducing abilities, much less with the inclusion of single digit stat adjustments. The battle groups system is a welcome and enjoyable simplification that I find to be enjoyably more thematic and easier to follow for new players.  

Secondly, I appreciate the visual language of the new theater and the map design logic. This is highly preferential, but I find the map design to be slightly more organic than previous installments, however I can accept that this might have functional trade off for most people. 

Finally, are some other quality of life mechanics changes, flamethrowers really punch, you can now retreat from buildings  which is a relieving feature, alongside squads auto-replenishing at base. Despite less than perfect sound design, the artillery impacts harder than ever.

Now, for the elephant in the room.

COH 2 featured five factions, and a functioning environmental mechanic for weather / cold.

This game removes said mechanic, without any interactive replacement. And is now a four faction experience.

I understand it does not fit the setting, but there is so much I feel is intended to be ""Left Behind"" for this sequel that it's difficult to advertise or recommend on a level of sheer content. COH3 could have been a tremendous opportunity to combine theaters and push the franchise (And even the genre) forward. It's a wasted chance to reconstruct hype, and perhaps even introduce the Pacific and japan as a playable faction.

Coh2 was slightly more complex, had more factions, more features, and in some cases more micro-detailing.

Still.

Ladies and Gentlemen, This is NOT the bad ending. 

Company of Heroes is not dead, and while the relic layoffs definitely don't indicate anything good for the development side, they could have cut their losses at this point if they wanted to. I can't say for sure if COH3 will live up to its predecessors, but It's not the absolute dumpster-fire it's being made out to be. 

Bear in mind, this is strictly speaking playing against friends, doing a few online matches.

I did not enjoy what little time I spent in the campaign. (Especially in comparison to COH 1's compelling story)
I also did not try the grand strategy inspired mode as this did not interest me. ( The effort is noticed though )

It's a risk, but I would hate for fans of the franchise to miss out on the future of COH entirely because they felt bitter about how this game released. If you are skeptical or unwilling, keep playing COH2 or COH1 for now and keep checking back in.

It's my hope they make efforts to combine what they have had for a more complete and robust experience. An ultimate COH if you will, but for now. This is what we have, a torn fan-base and a more than likely apprehensive development team.",1697721299,1697721437,True,154,3,0.846395194530487061,3,True,False,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having fun in the game so far (although still not finished the tutorial stages of the game yet), although i do agree with some peoples complaints about the FOV/zoom level in the game seems a bit extreme, i would like the ability to zoom out a little further to see the action on a grander scale than the tiny area your camera is locked to. Would have also preferred WASD to control the camera, but if i remember correctly that has always been the case in COH games.

The graphics are fine for me, i see lots of complaints about how the graphics are a decade out of date, but i personally don't have an issue with them, graphics have never been a deciding factor for me. 

The sounds however, DO seem like a significant downgrade. The guns just sound tinny and the audio overall lacks depth, if memory serves me right, the sounds in the first game were better than they are here, and seeing direct comparison videos with COH2, there is no question that the sounds here are a downgrade.

Performance is good on high/ultra settings on a 3060ti running at 2560x1440, again i have seen complaints about how it doesn't run very well, and that may well be the case for some people, but on my rig i have not yet seen any issues at all.

So far the battle maps have been small, i'm hoping they get much bigger when i reach the campaign proper as so far it has felt a bit cramped and squashed for space.

I have absolutely no interest in Multiplayer at all, so i am unable to comment on how that's playing out for people.

You are given options during the game and i think this is supposed to provide replayability, which sounds great, though from what i have seen so far they have made no difference whatsoever. This is another area i hope improves as i finish with the tutorial elements and move into the campaign.

Is it worth the £70 i paid for it? Its a tough one. I rarely buy games at this price point, and if COH2 was anything to go by, i have no doubt that there will be a trickle of DLC coming along which will be almost mandatory to get the feeling of a complete game.

This is one of those times i wish there were more options than simply thumbs up or thumbs down. May be wiser to wait a week or so and let the reviews stabilise somewhat, check out some YT videos, see what MP looks like if thats your thing, and then make a decision.",1677183314,1697547494,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Took them 4 months to add 2 new maps (which are absolutely horrible), balancing is absolutely broken and is being messed up further and further with each patch. Asking for 60$ is a joke, it´s not worth more than 9.99$.

**Edit after another 200 hours of playtime and couple of months of development.

Stay away from this game. Why you ask?

Matchmaking is absolutely broken. The system regularly queues up a team of 800 ELO players against top 25 world 1500+ ELO players. Nearly every match is a steamroll from one team with close matchups representing at maximum 1 out of every 10 games. 

Queue times are unbearable. Quick matchmaking playing the less played faction gives you queue times of about a minute up to 3 minutes, while playing the stronger faction can lead to and average queue time of 8-15 minutes. At certain times of the day you will straight up not find any matches at all. And once you find a match after 15 minutes of waiting, it again is either a steamroll, or players leave straight up, with no indication of improvement on the horizon.

Balancing updates have become even worse than before and it is painfully obvious that no one at Relic Entertainment has an idea how to handle both quality control and balancing tweaks. Given the massive failure this game has been they won´t go out and hire someone who can actually improve here, which is why the multiplayer future looks bleak.

Multiple game-breaking bugs remain in the game, still not addressed after months of complaints. Lobby bug requires multiple restart to play the game with friends, or for instance your large artillery pieces can lose their ability to shoot entirely, which on some occasions straight up loses you the game. No fixes offered after months, and a big tendency to introduce new bugs with each update...

Content updates are, months after release, utterly disappointing. Recently, an enjoyable 4v4 map has been added to the game, however, since launch and at the time of this review, the 4v4 map-pool has been expanded by a grand total of 2 maps. This development pace is laughable and just indicates that either no one is still developing content or that all resources are invested into the single-player experience. Since it is forgettable at best to play single player in the game, this spells doom for the long-term viability of the multi-player community and would just further underline the chaos that is Relic Entertainment. 

Demanding full price for this title is an insult to the community. Instead of trying to grow the game by reducing it´s price point they are committing to full greed mode.

The music is also pretty bad and boring compared to coh 1 and coh2, it feels like theres mosty silence in the background, there are also some bits straight up taken out of coh1. The singleplayer campaign is extremely forgettable, boring and IMO not worth playing, at all its nowhere near the levels of coh1 storytelling and somehow manages to be worse than the coh2 soviet campaign which was already a big meme at the time, a big part of the italy campaign are repetitive skirmish missions, which just get annoying to play as time goes on. The singleplayer AI is extremely easy to beat even on the hardest difficulty, there are however a bunch of units in the campaign that relic has not yet used in multiplayer,  with how greedy relic is i have 0 doubts these will be used in the december ''expansion'',  to sell units that are not new and already exist in the base game back to players in the form of ''new'' battlegroups(BTW if this happens this would literally mean that the people who payed 80$ for the premium edition paid extra for stuff they already had in advance). Also with how the player base is dwindling i doubt relic is gonna support this game much longer, there just isn't a playerbase to sell new DLCs to and its probably gonna go the DOW3 route. The modding community could easily save/revive this game(There are still people playing coh1 16-17 years after release just because of mods), but relic took the mod tools away just like they did with coh2 probably because they think it would impact sales of their DLCs. I would way at least another year just to make sure the game doesn't get abandoned before even considering buying it, and i would not pay over 25-30$ for it it is just not worth it.
TLDR: Game in current state is pretty bad, relic is greedy wait at least another year before buying and wait for a sale. The game is not worth over 25-30$, do not buy it for a singleplayer experience.

Overall some of the additions are nice, like the building clearing action for units...but coming from someone that plays the single campaign over just playing hours o multiplayer.....this has to be the worst Singe-player Campaign of the CoH series, now The North Africa Campaign gives us the elements of the of style.....even though it's a German Campaign told from the PoV of a Tunisian soldier fighting for the British & not the Germans.....and even tells of a Rebel sub plot that is only seen in these little drawings and not in game....but it was at least the style we have come to love. Then there the Italian Campaign....and while the whole 4x style is kinda cool for the overmap.....the battles.....well the battles suck unless it's a ""Mission"" Battle. Mission Battles are those tried and true story missions that would appear in other CoH games & even in the North African Campaign in this game....but then there's Skirmish Battles ( everything that's not a mission) Skirmish Battles are just Multiplayer game modes in Single-player campaign....WTF Relic....If I wanted this I would play the fucking Skirmish mode via AI not FUCKING CAMPAIGN MODE......these are basic Victory Point/Conquest/Annihilation game modes with a ""Bonus"" mission attached to make them seem like they fit in a campaign....and these Skirmish Battles ARE THE MAJORITY OF BATTLES IN CAMPAIGN.....hell you don't even get to partake in the Battle of Rome....the Campaign ends once you Reach Rome. Whats even sadder is the Loading Screen Image is an Image of the campaign map from Beta when you could have Machine gun or mortar detachment in you armies.....That's not how it works now......so they show a more fun game in the loading screen then what you get to play....God I hope the 1st xpac gives use something for for CoH 3 Campaign.....or else Relic will be known as the studio that can count to 3 but managers to never make it to 4 because they shit themselves at 3 (look up the Train Wreck of DoW3 if you don't understand that last part).

I have read through a lot of the negative reviews, and I feel like most are exaggerating or outright lying. I think most of the negative reviews come from CoH2 vet's that are mad, or afraid, to see the CoH2 playerbase diminish because of CoH3. Either that or they have a hard time adjusting to something new after thousands upon thousands of hours in CoH2. Similar discourse appeared when CoH2 dropped.
Telling people to ignore negative reviews feels patronizing and condescending, but also quite justified in this case.
Read on to find out why!

1---First off; my own CoH credentials. 
I feel like this step is unnecessary, when anyone that has played CoH3 has a right to their own opinion, but many use their CoH-series veterancy as a means to validate their negative reviews, and I will try to do the opposite.
I'm a CoH-series veteran, though my Steam play-time may tell you otherwise. I've played CoH1 a couple of thousand hours, way before it transfered to Steam, around 2007-2009-ish. I've ""only"" racked up about 600h in CoH2, but it's one of my most played games on Steam. I just never found the time to play CoH2 the way i played CoH1. I have a family, house, and kids, and I work a lot, which doesn't always leave much time to play games, but i've been playing CoH2 since it's beta and witnessed it's launch in 2013.
With that out of the way, let's try and answer some of the negative reviews.

2---ZOOOM!!
I've been reading a lot about the zoom level (the height of the camera, relative to the ground) in the game... Not all bad, but the reviewers that like it rarely use it as a point in their reviews, because it's been the same since 2007 (Nothing new to report).
The same veterans that give CoH3 flak for bringing new things to the table also seems to dislike the camera-height, which has been the same (basicaly) since the first CoH. This feels like false advertising, when in the next sentence they tell you to play CoH2 instead, with almost the same camera-height...
The camera-height in CoH has been a hot topic since forever. The only thing I can say is this; Camera-height has been the same for 16 years in this franchise, Relic won't change it drastically, they just won't. Hate it or love it, it is what it's always been - close to the action!

3---Graphics, and also atmosphere, I guess.
Many of the negative reviews bring up the graphics, saying the graphics are flatout bad. Others say it looks ""cartoonish"", probably in lack of better ways of describing the graphics.
The graphics look amazing. Definately a step up from CoH2! So how can people say it's cartoony? -Because there was a rendering bug in the Multiplayer Tech Test (mid Jan 2023, yes i played it, and yes the colours where wierd) which messed up lighting, shadows, weathering and grit on vehicles, and also the application of ambient occlusion on units and terrain.
This is fixed now. The game looks like the Steam-screenshots, under the condition that you have the hardware for it.

But reviewers are still standing fast on this, they still say it looks cartoony compared to CoH2. And those are our key words- ""compared to CoH2""... Let us compare CoH2 and CoH3; CoH2 is set on the eastern front theatre (half of the time in winter), and CoH3 is set in the mediterranean theatre. If we compare the two, Italy vs Russian winter, Italy just might come out looking a bit like a cartoon in this comparison.
My take is this; CoH3 is no more cartoon-looking than, let's say, Warthunder. It's a matter of preference, CoH3 wont look like ""Saving Private Ryan"", and there is nothing OBJECTIVELY wrong or broken about this. It's subjective, and needs to be emphasized as such. Consequently, this has absolutely no bearing on graphics being bad or good.

4---Audio.
Not unlike the graphics of the game, the audio was messed up during the Multiplayer Tech Test back in Jan. Many playtesters had the audio quality set to ""low"", due to some hard-ware auto-detect being broken, without realising. This led many to take to the streets (read Forums) and exclaim the audio was trash. The audio quality was never bad, it's very crisp. The audio mix was actually quite underwhelming on release, but this has been patched- in patch 1.02 i believe.

Yet again, not unlike with the graphics of the game, the negative reviewers stand fast after the patch, not budging-"" The audio is bad/trash compared to CoH1/2."" or ""It doesn't have the same oomph as CoH1/2.""
Do you see a pattern here? - Once again we end up in a comparison, between CoH3 and earlier iterations of CoH.
With the audio mix being fixed (mostly, some kinks/glitches remain to be fixed) I can pretty safely say that the fidelity of the audio in CoH3 surpasses both CoH1 and CoH2. The difference with between CoH3 and CoH1/2 is that Relic went the ""authentic""-route (source, Relic themselves) with the audio in CoH3. CoH3 won't sound like most Hollywood war movies- unlike CoH1/2 which do sound like Hollywood movies. 
This is again a matter of preference, it's not that CoH3 is objectively bad in this aspect.

5---""CoH3 should have been early-access""
This statement is exaggerating. The amount of content in CoH3 is objectively more than launch-CoH1/2. 
But reviewers still say this, in comparison to CoH2 mostly. When comparing content between CoH2 today, and CoH3 today, we have to remember that CoH2 has been out, and supported with updates, for 10 years already.
There is no content or feature missing when comparing CoH2-launch and CoH3-launch.

I have to say though, I am disappointed that there is no good way to watch replays, and no observer mode yet. These were not present in CoH2-release, but got patched in after about a year I think. I had hoped this was in CoH3-launch, but I have to wait. Yet again, nothing broken or game-breaking, and it wasn't in the other releases either. Consequently, it's not objectively worse than CoH1/2.

6---UI
The UI is not like in CoH1 or CoH2. It's not bad, it's just not the same. I can empathise with CoH-vet's being not too happy with the new UI (I'm not happy with it). To me, though, this is not a reason to tell new players to stay away, telling them the UI is broken or that it's trash. Because it's not broken or trash, it's just new and unfamiliar to us veterans. 
UI needs to be scalable with resolution though, it doesn't scale right now, which might be and issue if you play on 1440p or higher (Which I do).

I'm gonna sneak in the Tac-map here aswell; It's been patched, it's working as intended now. - patch 1.04. Some like the newest iteriation of the tac-map, som don't, utterly subjective in my opinion. But same goes here, vet's might feel one way, while new players wouldn't even think twice about it.

7---Balance (multiplayer)
Come on, the game has been out for a week. It has been played in-house by Relic and some testers before release, sure, but for real, come on. I don't know how many unique units there are in the game, 80 maybe? (quick mafs; about 20 per faction, 4 factions) Not only are there unique units for each faction, but also abilities, active and passive, and I'm not going to try and guess how many... Expecting the game to be balanced on release is just wishful thinking. There's a good reason to why we don't have a ranked season out the gate, let me just put it that way. 
-A second balance patch seems to be dropping in the baginning of next week, removing cheesy strats and tweaking meme-units. The first patch ever actually had som balancing of the DAK-faction in it, patch 1.01.",1677798853,1696446212,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

-It feels incomplete, I mean the in game store isn't event accessible yet, not that would improve much.
-I feel like the developers took elements from the previous games that they knew the players liked and jammed them into an new uniforms and tanks and then called it Company of Heroes 3, yeah it may be the AfrikaKorp, but they still play like the OKW from CoH2.
-I've noticed that the overlapping dynamic noises can get drowned out or lost. Like certain tank and machine gun audios just aren't there or a big explosion can cut all other noise of the battle, almost as if I've gone momentary deaf.
-I feel like I will have to come back to this game again in 6 months to a year and see what happens with the finished product, but after they nerfed CoH2 to death, let just say I'm not exactly holding my breath.

Alright Steam, I'll update my review.

Do Not Buy This Game!!!
Already a month from launch and the Devs need to go back and give the Gurkha Rifles a new voice over? Do to what, you guys whitewashing them to sound like Apu from the Simpsons?
Just this week you expand the in game store for more micro transactions for a few basic skins, but nothing else. No new command abilities, no new maps; just War Bond that cost more money.
Why should I spend anymore of my money on this half-assed game that could probably run better on my cellphone?
Look, this isn't just some angry rant. I've got 1400+ hours on CoH2 and 500+ on CoH1, I would consider myself a die hard fan of the games, and yes I am aware that CoH2 had many, many things wrong with it when it came out, but that's exactly the point. CoH2 and CoH1 are both over a decade old and Relic learned nothing from that or worse, forgot it all.
In the second game you can order weapons teams to face a certain direction once they've garrisoned a structure, in this game they can't. Why?
The Italian Dynamic Campaign isn't anything new, its just a demo for the next Total War they plan to make.
Coming soon: Total War WW2 Italian Front!!!!! 
Speaking of the Italian Dynamic, if you read what the new patches concern, you may notice that over half of them involve fixes for this campaign, mostly due to crashes. Which it still does, all the time.
The Africa Campaign is closer to a traditional CoH campaign; however, the narrative has nothing to due with the missions, has no impact on the overall war, and feels almost forced, like they are trying too hard to bring attention to something without overtly saying it (Holocaust= bad/ Nazis= evil)

I could go on, but I won't. 
Basically this whole game just disappoints me, it doesn't live up to the standards of the previous games, and is nothing more than a money grab riding on the coattails of CoH's success.
I say again:
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

Friday, September 29, 2023.
My God this game just disappoints me. I was secretly hoping that with all these new patches and hot fixes that this games play-ability MIGHT have improved from my last review update which I posted in back in April.
Turns out, no, no it has not. It feels completely the same from the last time I gave it a shot. Every problem I still had with it is still there; like no facing commands for garrisoned units while in structures , idiotic computer AI, and still has audio issues (I think its just one too many noises going on at once that the game just can't decide which ones to play when). All of this took me less than an hour to re-discover, oh and don't get me started on what is still a just a BS micro transaction farm that they call ""the in game store"".",1677655665,1695998890,False,4,0,0.500742912292480469,0,True,False,False

I was originally going to wait until this game goes on sale but I bought it for full price because I wanted to support Relic. Most of the bugs in my experience are interface related and I haven't seen many of them in terms of real-time game-play, which is where I think COH3 really shines. It really feels like the developer played COH1 and COH2 to find out what they could improve. Things like: Auto reinforce at HQ, Your troops auto jump over fences, you can tow support guns, your infantry can ride tanks, and the tactical pause for SP to name a few. There is a ton of audio and visual elements that they added that really freshen things up. They also modified how a lot of units look.

Then CoH3 being in a clearly unfinished state yet trying to convince players that its exactly in the state they intended as if we cant plainly see what state it is in.

It has become evident that either Relic of the greater powers at SEGA are either incapable of understanding what their consumers want and expect or just don't care about its consumers at all.

-No real diversion with battalion choices, primarily changes in call in abilities
-Some other stuff I probably missed

Pros: 
-Great voice acting as always with these games
-Elite infantry is fun

I've been a fan of the series since I was young, and I bought this game on launch. Its a two-dimensional, buggy, unbalanced mess.

The battles are stale and boring. Vehicles feel like paper, the sound design is hollow and flat, it has a more arcade-y feel to it. The dynamic single player campaign (which was a big draw for me) was extremely rote, railroaded, and buggy. The decisions that you make really change almost nothing at all, and the campaign is just a series of skirmish maps with some bad voice acting in between. I also had a campaign breaking bug on turn 10 or so that forced me to restart and man, I really couldn't be bothered.

On the plus side, the game looks really nice. Some people criticise the warm colour palette but its the Mediterranean theatre, a warm colour palette suits it much more than the cold blues, browns, and greys of COH2.

The final insult from this game was the first major patch. Instead of tweaking the sound design, or fixing campaign bugs, or re balancing vehicles, they instead added a cosmetic cash shop. I really feel for the developers who worked on this game, because a cash shop is obviously not what they wanted, it was clearly a decision taken higher up, but its a good indication of the new priorities at Relic. 

Give this game a miss unless its less than 10$. If you're looking to scratch that squad level WWII RTS itch, go play CTA: Ostfront, or even just go play COH2, its a better game than this.",1695140421,1695140421,False,9,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

It is not like it's predecessor Company of Heroes 2. The germans in this game are immensely downgraded but the allied forces too. They don't have any cool touch so I could positively review them.

It's on par with CoH2 in a lot of ways... and even fixes or adds some features.  But it did feel strange, the first few missions did not do a good job in convincing me that it was worth it.

Frankly, I expected to be wowed with the refinement and even further additional detail in graphics and special effects like they had brought with COH2.  But really, it just feels close to the same... there are differences but it's not having me go, ""wow.""

The additional campaign map is interesting, but I somehow probably would have preferred they spend that time refining, adding additional commander abilities and wowing me with the sequel than adding this new layer for single player.

Is it worth buying?  I think so, but probably at $30, 40 would be stretching it.  I got it for 42 and I was still on the fence.  But I really liked CoH2, and I'm enjoying playing CoH3.",1694918774,1694918774,True,16,3,0.649663150310516357,0,True,False,False

- Multiplayer: You have to restart the actual game once every few matches due to lag, this is after you wait 10+ min in a que. 

- Microtransactions: The store was up before the first major update.

- Limited Single-Player Content: I don't enjoy a single player campaign as if I was playing a multiplayer roster, they did this with the Americans in CoH:2 and it was just as bad. Single player should tell a story.

- Graphics / Effects: This game sounds, looks and preforms like dog****. The units are slow and ganky, theres no effects to the game that make you feel like you're in combat or look good enough for you to say wow, everything feels like it's washed out and the UI is some cookie cutter dog*** that looks like it's pulled from a web package. 
When you play CoH:2 there's times in a 4v4 where everyone caps mid 40 min in a game and you see 10 tanks shooting everything, stukas blowing everything up, fire, bullets and chaos, units smoking and exploding, you will never get that with this game. 

The fact they developed Age of Empires focused console play, and basically re skinned it to make CoH:3 is a insult to the fans of the series who are more than willing to support Relic and their content (More people are still playing CoH:2 than 3 right now).

[b]The single player campaign of COH3 delivers a solid game and an enjoyable experience. [/b]

It is still a COH/Relic game though with the known bugs and AI that seems to be huffing glue from time to time. To be fair: it is a lot better than in the previous games.

The world map (theater map) is a nice addition as well. It shows their vision and progress from ""Ardennes Assault"" (COH2 DLC) onwards. This adds replayability as well. 


[b]Multiplayer still needs a whole lotta love. [/b]

It can provide pleasant times, however, a lot of stuff seems to be missing. An easy example would be the random unique player-colours: Dark-orange-something for an ally, Red for an enemy and Green for another enemy is just plain bad and confusing. When using team-colours, every ally is yellow and there is no way to distinguish each ally.

The absence of thousand commanders feels refreshing, fun and still dynamic because of the choices in those commander tech trees.

And after playing it for some time, here is what I have to say.
Second game is a fucking masterpiece, it is 10 years old, still a blast to play, and doesn't even look that bad. In 2013 it wasn't even in the same league as COH3 is now. As a fan of the old games, I would expect the same from the new game, and I guess that is where all the hate comes from. BUT, in today's world COH2 is 10 years old and CoH3 feels better, looks better(even so it lacks atmosphere of the second game) and is better. Summary: if you are unfamiliar with this series, buy the game, or even better buy both of them, and see which one you like best.

Surely the game will become playable in about 2 to 5 years from now.. but releasing a what is basically a beta access as a full game surely says something about what we are to expect in the future.
But hey the release priority was to get the shop out not to work on better GUI in the actual match.

- many icons seem like placeholders that would be okay in a free mobile game - a major downgrade from previous games
- planes, bombs and artillery follow weird trajectiories that don't make sense half the time. Artillery doesn't even angle their gun half the time.
- Playing the Italian campaign once was enough for me to feel that it's repetitive, especially the later stages where germans do nothing at all (arguably less annoying than sending 5 unskippable recon planes every round), so much for replayability. Full of easy to replicate bugs too.
- We waited years for Coh2 to have a reload button for magazine vehicles... apparently CoH3 didn't see a need for one
- Fixed gun vehicles are completely unable to move their gun, they have to rotate the whole tank, creating lots of silly issues and devs already did some fix that simply buffed rotation speed etc, hopefuly it's a temporary fix and they're working on actual gun movemenent (they might not be doing that), because a lack of detail this big is just disappointing.
- Audio cues and visual feedback is lacking.


EDIT (08/09/2023):
As expected, the game is slowly being corrected and the multiplayer (I didn't check singleplayer) issues I mentioned (and many more) are being worked on. The game is still worse than CoH2 in many aspects, but give it something like a year or two and it might finally be what it should have been on release date.

Why? So you can use your airborne commander or 1/3 of content would not be able to play? SO STUPID and unbalanced hot mess!!!! They could had added this garbage to coh 2 with a patch for ten bucks..

The graphics or horrible. Not only because the tanks look like something from 1998, but also because nothing is optimized. I have a gaming laptop with AMD and a gaming desktop with NVIDIA. The AMD system stutters horribly on the campaign map, but works fine on battle maps. My desktop runs okay, although it certainly maxes out the 3060ti and 11700k. Given the look and feel of the game, that should never happen at 1080p.

As for the game play. Seriously, WTF? The Campaign still makes no sense. It is supposed to be open map, but you better follow along the storyline and hit those milestones on time. So much for fighting Italy the way you want. The resource cap makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Essentially, you better be defeating those milestones because the supplies you get will run out, regardless of the fact that you have them secure, or have enough ports, or have the support of the locals. This feels more like Sherman's march through the south than the liberation of Italy.

I won't go into the lack of customization for the skirmishes or single battles with or without other players. Then of course we move to the infamous balancing. It brings back bad memories of COH2. First one side is overpowered, then the other. I mean, you literally have historical data on everything and it's your third try at the same war. Is it really this hard? Quit worrying about people whining are trying to be ""balanced"" and just code the bloody things to what they were in the war. 

Wars aren't won on gadgets, it's won off tactics and adaptability. Just look the the current real one we have going on in eastern Europe. They're beating their enemy with remote control toys with bombs attached. The same thing happened in WW2.

That beeing said, this game doesn´t feel finished. It has no ranked mode, the sounds feel off/unfinished or glitches out sometimes and i encountered noumerous immersive, not gamplay breaking tough, bugs in the afrika corps campain. All in all, the game is fun but it is clearly not finished. They should have released it with early access marking, since this is clearly where it is at in this moment.

I will update this review as soon as the game feels completed and not like an early acess version.

Edit: Instead of fixing the game first and adding missing features like the replay system for example, wich the community found a way around for themselves to enable them for the game until they, a big developer studio, add it themselves.

So if Relic isn´t fixing the game and isn´t adding any of the missing features, where do all their resources go then? Propably into the shop wich seemed to be the biggest priority for them. So i can thank them for fucking me over by their 60€ full release and buy one full wehrmacht skin pack for another 60€, i don´t know who actually does that after beeing so obviously abused by that company, but it seems to work.

There were gamebreaking abilitys and units in the game on both axis and allies wich didn´t get fixed for weeks, but beeing able to abuse a mod to get your weeklys finished in ten minutes to get 1 or 2 free skins got fixed in 2 days. That summed up all the community needs to know in my opinion and shows where their prioritys lie.

Again this is a very good game, i like it, it is fun to play. But Relics buisness practises are just the lowest of low. The game clearly was released in early acess (bugs, balance, missing features) while beeing marketed as full release. And instead of fixing the mess first, they concentrate on squeezing more money out of their product by putting all their effort into the ingame store.

The first review I made on COH3 was a sort of ""on parole"" review, it was the new kid on the block. The first updated of the initial review was quite negative, a lots of missing parts that were already estabilished in COH2 and of course expected in the following title. Also I find not a good defense of some users that pointed the finger to the fact that COH3 was just released. It's a weak defense because the things that were already part of COH2 should be simply present in the following game title, it can be a missing part, is not something that in the end can gone missing and not noticed by the experienced players. 

[b][REVIEW UPDATE #2] [/b]

Now I wanna try again to help this title growing up giving a thumb up to COH3, at least for the programmatic effort put in this title by Relic and the fact that one way or another, they are collecting all the feedbacks and addressing the most game breaking glitches and bugs. 

Some are still present, the game is not polished, the update released that supposely fix the AI, it worked at 80%, but still there are some episodes when the AI moving from point A to point B still for unknown reasons choose the worst odd path exposing itself to the enemy fire and if you do not counteract immediately, well, you simply lose it. 

There are also glitches still present, when shots are fired through buildings, machine guns and AT from time to time can simply shoot directly through some buildings in various maps. 

[b] [GENERAL COMPLAINS][/b]

There is also by multiplayer side a general complain about the weakness of the AXIS infantry compared to ALLIES counterparts, but since I did not yet have experience in the MP can't tell. I played mostly the campaigns, skirmish (to help familiarize with the units and tactics) and COOP vs AI hard+ level. Those experience are so far positive nothing to complain about except for the glitches I described above. 

[b] [LESS COSMETICS MORE CONTENT][/b]

It seems in the end that the game is going somewhere, but need less effort in cosmetics at the moment and more on the substantial balance and expansion of new factions and units. 

Right now, after many patches the game is just one step forward of being plainly ""barebone"" compared to COH2. I understand that the idea to capitalize from the shop is parte of the business model these days, I do not blame this and I would enjoy spending money supporting a title that is completed in all his parts. 

[b] [STILL AN UNFINISHED GAME] [/b]

Something that COH3 is not yet. We had some steps forward, but COH3 is still behind by a large margin from what have been promised as new features in game and what was obviously expected to be already in a title that is the successor of COH2.

Terrible effort. The fact that Relic has been spamming small updates, bug fixes, and balancing changes since release is a testament to how unfinished the game was. Further exemplifying the smooth brain logic that doomed this game from the start: the first major update advertised cosmetics as one of the main features — because THATS what people were really looking for.

  I've been playing COH2 for the past 10+ years and when I heard the 3 was coming out, made by Sega and not THQ;  I wasn't expecting much.  But I gotta admit- they followed the gestalt pretty well and it's not too bad.  Still needs some polishing, so we'll see.

In the previous games the story flowed quite well and I was able to follow likable characters and understand the objectives of the game. In CoH3's Campaign, there was almost no point at which I wasn't confused. Upgrading units, following the characters and their storyline, completing objectives, none of it made any sense. Skirmishes were irritating and boring, making the game feel dragged out longer than it needed to be. The end was perhaps what I looked most forward to, yet I had no idea that the final mission was even taking place. UI is awful and hard to follow, and the fact that the game punishes you for upgrades you choose for your units is just sad. Do not buy this game, at least not now. It needs time, and I'm sure Relic will try and fix it, but I definitely regret spending $60 on a game that belongs to a franchise I love.

Single player campaign is a mixed bag. The scope of the Italian campaign is great. But missions are only engaging at highest difficulty setting. The variety of skirmish modes and map configurations provide a diversity of battles, yet becomes tedious. Thankfully there is auto-resolve. Campaign level strategy is more like an insurgency. There is no continuous front line that requires massing of forces for an assault or building defensive lines. Allied units are generally running around the map chasing missions (kind of like a low-mental blobbing strategy). While Axis units attempt to intercept allied units or strike into allied territory to recapture towns. The developers have put a lot of features and details into the campaign story and missions that makes single player interesting enough for casual play.

Multiplayer is great. Graphics and audio are great. Skirmish lengths are good. Skirmishes are usually completed within 20 - 40 minutes. And the different unit/firepower/pace elements work well together that make it is possible to bounce back from a significant blow to your forces. This is what makes CoH3 superior to CoH2 multiplayer. 

CoH2 multiplayer usually devolves into a meat grinder battle of attrition after 20 mins when there are competent players on both sides. And skirmishes can drag on for over a hour with high intensity feeding of bodies and munitions into a Bakhmut-esque grinder. 

CoH3 soars with more dynamic fights but falls with a lack of multiplayer maps (only 3 for each skirmish type) and the latest 4v4 release is a step backwards that encourages blobbing. Of course, blobbing appeals to CoH2 purists who find CoH3 ""unplayable"", so Relic had to do something to dumb-down the game after their histrionic disappointment at launch. But ultimately appealing to blobbers degrades the game that functions so much better when promoting effective combined arms and fire control that makes blobbing a bad strategy. Understandably fire control is too mentally challenging for blob enthusiasts who like running around chasing vulnerable opposing units.

Which brings me to another superiority of CoH3. The effective use of fire control means a lot of immature or challenged players hate CoH3 due to the ineffectiveness of blobbing (you will recognise them in Steam review by their hyperbolic negative comments of how atrocious CoH3 is compared to CoH2). And while there are occasionally toxic players dropping stupid comments in chat of CoH3, for the most part CoH3 skirmishes have pleasant and deeply thoughtful dialogue due to more skill required from a better class of player. In alcohol analogy, CoH3 is Clase Azul and CoH2 is Bud Light (pre-Dylan Mulvaney advertising). 

Also, CoH3 doesn't have players immediately dropping at start of match due to poor server connections.

Overall, CoH3 does seem like an incomplete product in terms of its reward system, store offerings, lack of multiplayer maps ... etc. But it has a lot room to grow and I still prefer CoH3 over CoH2 toilet water.

CoH3 I feel is a foundation. Not a solid one, but it IS a foundation. But you cant sell someone a foundation priced as a fully built house, and that's what CoH3 is doing.

It feels completely underbaked. The UI feels slapshod, and less intuitive than CoH2's UI. Pathfinding is still not what it should be. There are balance issues I read about on forum posts from ~5 Months ago that appear to still be in the game, or at least still viable enough that despite changes, people are willing to exploit them. 

There's also nowhere near enough variety in what factions can do. You can have more than 3 commanders per faction without making the game a bloated mess like CoH2 became in the end, and at $60, 3 Commanders per Faction isnt enough.

All in all this game should be priced around $25-30 for what it offers at this juncture and no more. But as it stands I cannot in good conscience recommend it at this price point.

People are also on here bashing the graphics. I have the graphics on maximum settings and think they look just fine. The destruction physics are very nice. Buildings crumble when they are destroyed. Tanks blow up nicely. I think it looks great overall!

I remember back when getting my first pc and with the gpu I got the 1st CoH. It was insane back then. Think this was like mid to late 2000's? Anyway, CoH3 is a welcoming return to that style of gameplay, with a few fine tweaks that make it interesting, and sometimes fun.

However,

This is not worth the price. The campaign is nice, especially the Italy one, although the world-map is a liiiiitle clunky-ish (not as refined as Total War), but it was interesting, until it just became monotonous, also with the drill down to actual missions or skirmishes running out of ideas around the middle of the campaign. becoming a bit of ""effort"" to complete and not actual fun. - but the length of it in general felt good. This was from the allied-side, which was nice.

The Africa campaign had a half-baked story with some boring characters and dialog... It was nice to take the battle outside of Europe, but it was painfully short, and left me wanting more - and a much better story.

Then.... That's the campaign??? I'm left wanting more? - like full price game, but you only get about 18 - 25 hours of actual campaign? if taking your time... So yeah. Not worth the price vs content ratio.

I encountered some bugs, nothing major. but most annoying is when you try to have something repaired, continue elsewhere on the map and come back, just to see the engineers glitching and not actually repairing. Some other graphical bugs and maybe unit bugs, but not game breaking.

I wish there was some more unit variety for each faction, like there are quite a few - but just like more, and different... It's literally like CoH 1, with some better graphics and small fine tuning here and there. Just leaves me feeling there's something missing, something more I want from this that I'm not getting...

Oh and the mortars really such, from the actual damage it does to the actual explosion sound and effect. so underwhelming. Tanks are cool and solid. Also wish I could have a higher unit cap or edit the actual skirmish some more to really give me some freedom on the battlefield. I guess it comes down to balancing, but yeah...

So its a no, buy when on sale.

COH3 needs now more maps, more content and generally polishnes. It's not perfect game, but personally I like it and brings me a lot of fun. I play only MP matches, so I can't recommend campaign of coh3. There aren't many great RTS games on the market, but COH3 has ambitious to be one of the greatest.",1692298826,1692298826,True,18,4,0.526144802570343018,0,True,False,False

The new mechanics like tank riding and breaching add a whole new range of ways to play from the previous games. And for anything that inst new its a hybrid of all the best bits from both previous Coh games.

The new campaign war map allows for a lot more replay ability although sacrificing a large amount of what a large portion of the player base liked about company of heroes, the characterization. And although yes it is a shame to not have the same quality of character within units I feel the gameplay makes up for this. I'm not quite sure why some people are saying that they don't react to things happening around them though as they pretty obviously do. Not to forget there was an entire post about all the new dynamic ways they interact with the world on their website. 

A lot of people are posting bad reviews based on bugs. And although I definitely believe they are experiencing those issues I would like to make it known that bugs are far from as common as those reviews might make you think. I have now played for about 190-ish hours and have only seen 3 bugs (the city walls of Potenza had a lighting glitch when I bombed it, the Anzio Annie crew where T posing but that has been patched and bunkers can be a bit weird to place sometimes). But that's it.

Based on my own time playing this game its completely stable and polished. (Again I'm not saying other people who ARE experiencing these bugs are lying, I'm just saying I am yet to encounter a second bug let alone 1 game-breaking one). In fact I would go as far as to say this is the second most polished game I have played since Tails of Iron. The loading times are near instant.",1677410059,1692293889,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game still needs a lot of work. I'm not sure why they haven't fixed the simple issues such as units bunching up on each other, getting stuck trying to enter/exit buildings, Missing a person or two in a unit because they are too busy running in place somewhere to join the fight. This should have been fixed in the first patch, however they were more concerned with implementing micro transactions and other garbage like skins that, quite honestly, stack up nicely next to a fresh dog turd. 

Originally my rating with a thumbs up, but I'm changing it until they can get their collective heads out of their rectums. I have put almost 300 hours into this game and I'm EXTREMELY disappointed.

The game needs work. There are definitely a good amount of bugs. The turn based is flawed to. If you can wait a few months to play it, I would recommend you do so.

It's like a whirlwind tour of ratings, where graphics are trying not to give anyone an eyeache, and consoles are flexing their muscles like bodybuilders with their brand-new dumbbells.

Gameplay gets a ""so-so"" on the solo scale, but it's like the real party starts when you invite your multiplayer pals. It's like showing up at a solo party and realizing the real action is in the VIP section.

And let's talk audio – gunfights are decent, but not quite ""COH 2 meets a dubstep rave"" level. It's like they're in a band that's pretty good, but not exactly headlining Coachella.

For PC requirements, it's like asking your computer to put on a ""moderately hard"" hat. It's a game of specs, but not the detective kind – the kind that decide whether your PC will throw a party or just awkwardly tap its foot.

Difficulty? More like ""easymode engaged"" – you could play this game with a mouse and a half-asleep cat in your lap. It's like beating a drum with one hand while catching a sandwich with the other – not exactly the ultimate test of skill.

And the story? Well, let's just say it's like a beard that's trying really hard to be deep and meaningful but ends up being more like a flavor-saver for your lunch. There's story, and then there's ""filler-story,"" and this one's firmly in the latter camp.

Game time? Like déjà vu with a twist. If you've played COH2, this game's like COH2's spiffier cousin. It's like having a favorite pair of shoes and then buying an almost identical pair because, well, who can resist shiny new laces?

Price? It's like shopping for that trendy jacket everyone's wearing – you'd only consider it if it's on sale. It's like spotting a slightly cooler version of your old jacket but realizing the price tag is just a tad too steep.

And lastly, bugs. Or should we say potential annoyance ninjas? So far, they're like the ninjas that haven't shown up to the party yet. Fingers crossed they don't crash it like an uninvited guest.

So, after this hilarious journey through ratings, specs, and metaphors, we've got a grand total of 7 out of 10 – which, in review terms, is like receiving a B+ in a class you didn't really want to take but ended up mildly enjoying.",1677195165,1692209598,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, I will say it crashes more than almost any other game I've played. I'm always on the edge as to whether the next click on mission / map load will result in a Bugsplat screen. Worse still, there are no autosaves in the missions themselves, so if you forget to save progress, you could find the entire thing lost if it crashes.

The first thing that SEGA and Relic Entertainment added shortly after release was the God damn cash shop, without any proper re-balancing of the units which lean once again too much in favor of the Wehraboos.

The U.I. is horrendous. Even the main menu looks like it came from a free-to-play mobile game, shoehorned onto PC without any second thought with disgraciously oversized buttons that look bland. The whole thing suffers of a ""Greyscale"" issue reminding me of the infamous ""brown filter"" found in every shooter of the early 2000s.

Even months after the release, we still don't have any customisation of our in-game profile : no avatar, no title, no banner to choose from. And I'm almost certain that even if they eventually release these, they will remain locked behind a paywall at that bloody cash shop which sells us a single pack of cosmetics for more than 10 euros/dollars each!

And as of Hotfix 1.2.2 for the Emerald Bear update, many people (mostly those who rely on AMD hardware to play) are unable to join multiplayer matches. Both in Versus and Co-op Against A.I. mind you, but that's not even listed as a major issue being investigated by the Support!

After many more tests, it turns out that even the Single Player campaign as well as the Graphic Test from the Settings are no longer working. I can't play a video-game which I've pre-ordered, even in a solo session.

Updated - 15 Aug 2023: 

Company of Heroes 3 is extremely unbalanced, making it akin to trying to play chess with a deck of cards. Winning through actual skill is just as likely as winning by flipping a coin. It seems like Relic should have named this game Company of Allies, as the only way to win as Axis is by not installing the game.

Lets start with the positive. Its much more like Company of Heroes 1 than 2. They brought base building back. They have an intriguing Civilization style gameboard on top of the RTS component for the Italian campaign that gives you hours upon hours of gamplay. 

Okay lets get to the negatives. The games been out about 6 months. Their promises to fix issues only comes with patches that cause as many issues as it fixes. And many of their issues are game breaking. For example you have a population cap on the gameboard. Lets say you need to disembark an Airborne company from a ship. If they glitch out; you can not deploy them from your ship onto shore. There is no company delete button. And after many hours of troubleshoot I was told the only solution is to restart the campaign (20 hours later) or load a save before they were built. Well if they were built 20 turns ago your also out several hours of dedicated progress. Or just deal with the heavy consequence that comes with having an unusuable company taking up your population cap that was crucial to an objective deployment... 

List of glitches that have never been fixed:

1) Engineers often have to be told 3 - 4 times to build a defensive emplacement or they simply won't do it.
2) Occasionally retreating forces will get caught in an animation loop back at base where they won't move. You have to kill them (which takes a lot of time to recover from) to get your pop cap back
3) Engineers repairing have to be told several times to repair something to unstick them from another animation loop glitch. or they simply won't repair
4) Your game crashes on all main missions randomly. This is called bugsplatting since this is the name of the error screen that pops up. You have to make sure to save a lot on main missions or you simply lose a lot of progress in game. 
5) I won't even talk about vehicle pathing......

Their official discord for Company of Heroes is a joke. Its the definition of hypocrisy. They make a game specifically depicting events of WW2 but if you have a discussion about the historical events its ""talking politics"" which is not allowed. Because evidently Relics depiction in game is the only allowed viewpoint. You can't cuss in discord; even though their product is filled with cussing.... And of course when I pointed this out it led to a quick ban from the official discord server. Discussing errors and glitches usually come with excuses and sidebar bug reports but the results are limited to nothing. Which leaves you with the impression that they already have your money... why should they care about fixing their product after? They won't even acknowledge that their ""overwhelming negative,"" now recently ""Mixed,"" review status leaves them more in question than the fans they punish for pointing it out.

As far as the other complaints, mods fix most of what people are bitching about. So I don’t see why the negative reviews are a thing. The only thing I can think of is if that people are just jumping on the hate train like every other game. Either your machine needs an upgrade or you just don’t like COH.

We purchased it day one and played it enthusiastically but, unfortunately, our enthusiasm quickly faded for this game. Here it is 6 months later and I've got less than 20 hours total in this game that I was confident would dominate my gaming time. Here's a brief list why (to be clear, this feedback is all limited to the multiplayer):

1. POST-GAME STATISTICS SCREEN COMPLETELY BROKEN. I am amazed that I don't see more people commenting about this absolutely broken and necessary feature of the game. At the end of every match you get a statistical analysis of how you performed with performance breakdowns by each player and unit over the timeline of the match. It is 100% WRONG. Myself and my friends always have several/all of the following: unit production missing, incorrect unit damage, incorrect unit deaths, incorrect unit kills, incomprehensible scores, etc. In fact, I have never played a match where the post-game statistics are even close to correctly representing anything that actually happened during the match. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM! Post-game statistics are how I learn to analyze my performance and get better, but with the stats absolutely missing and no option to save a watchable replay of the match (a missing feature from previous titles), the tools I have to improve my game are all but gone--one missing entirely, the other totally useless. This issue drives me insane, and I can't imagine how/why it is still broken.

2. EXTREMELY LIMITED MAP SELECTION. I play with two friends which means we require, at minimum, a 3v3 map. Given that there are 5 3v3 maps, and 3 4v4 maps available, we have a total of 8 maps to play on. For anyone looking to get life out of the multiplayer, either with friends or larger-scale battles online, this will get old extremely fast.

3. BROKEN AI. The AI need fixing. At no point does the AI ever feel like it's doing anything clever, but I get that's a subjective thing. Objectively, the difficulty rankings make no sense--there's no difference between Extra Hard and Expert--they're both equally smart/dumb in the same ways. The number of times that my friends and I have had to restart 10 minutes into a match because we realize that the AI has gotten stuck in its own base and can't find its way out is way too high (if I were to guess, I'd say we do this for about 15% of games played). Essentially, once you've countered the AI's primary tactic, that's it--you're done--because the AI won't do anything new, it will just double-down on that same tactic.

I wanted so badly to love this game, and there's promise here--if you notice, none of these complaints are unfixable. If anyone with any connection to Relic reads this, please, I beg you...
1) FIX POST-GAME STATISTICS
2) ADD MORE MULTIPLAYER MAPS
3) FIX THE AI

Company of Heroes has such a stellar legacy in CoH 1 & 2--they represent two of the best RTS's I have ever played, and I've been an avid RTS fan ever since the first Command and Conquer came out when I was a kid. It would be a shame to leave the franchise like this. 

In its current state, I can't recommend CoH 3, especially at $60. I hope that changes.",1691502097,1691502097,False,6,0,0.549196362495422363,0,True,False,False

The campaign is severely lackluster, especially the North Africa Campaign. Multiplayer side of the game, its best just to go to CoH2 where the friendly AI knows what they are doing, compared to the AI in this.

Campaigns

-North Africa Campaign: While you play as Erwin Rommel and command his forces, every cutscene/cinematic between missions is from the Allied Forces POV, which makes no god damn sense, especially considering that in the end of this side of the campaign, you still ultimately lose regardless of your performance in each mission you do.

-Italian Theatre campaign: You play as the Allied forces invading Italy from Northern Africa into Sicily and the surrounding areas outside Rome. This aspect of the game seems to have been featured more due to the RTS/Turn Based style campaign similar to that of Civilization or Total War. While there is very few cutscenes/cinematics through this campaign portion, its probably the only good part about this game

Custom Games/Multiplayer

The MP side of this game feels very lackluster due to the fact that since February, there is still only 3 commanders to choose from across the 4 playable factions (US, UK, Germans, and Afrikakorps). Each faction has probably 1 or 2 GO-TO commanders to choose, to easily dominate the enemy team. 

The units available to produce from buildings is very limited, especially when playing as the AfrikaKorps due to the fact that they get no Anti-Air available to produce that isn't locked behind the 4th building (armored corps building to produce the Flak 88) or locked behind a commander. If you play against the AI and you are playing as AfrikaKorps, good luck cause the AI tend to choose commanders that give constant strafing runs/bombing runs.

The resource gain (for munitions and Fuel) feels very slow in this game compared to Company of Heroes 1 and 2 where the only upside is that Manpower resource generation increases per generic capture point that you/friendlies capture. The almost complete lack of munitions generation hurts when you desperately need it for either the commander abilities or upgrading the VERY few infantry units with either LMGS, AT, Flamethrowers, etc. to try and counter the enemy in the early/mid game. 

Currently, There is only 3 factions that have the ability to equip an LMG to your Infantry are the US, British, and AfrikaKorps that isnt locked behind a commander. Wehrmacht lacking access to gaining the MG34 for the Grenadiers or for any of its other infantry units hurts severely, making you have to either choose a commander that grants access to STG-44s or build primarily the most expensive anti-infantry foot soldiers to counter the enemy mass infantry.

The AI difficulty naming convention makes no sense compared to the earlier Company of Heroes games, which were: easy, normal, hard, and expert; whilst in CoH3, the naming conventions are: Normal, Hard, Extra Hard, and Expert. I usually play against 2-3 Hard AI and 1 Expert AI in CoH2 and am able to make do and win a game, albeit with some difficulty, however with CoH3, playing against 2 Extra Hard AI feels like i'm playing against 2 Expert AI's for comparison.

In terms of maps, you are VERY limited in what maps you can actually choose from. There is 3 4v4 maps, 5 3v3 maps, 4 2v2 maps, and 5 1v1 maps, for a wopping grand total of 17 available maps to choose from

The game has been out for almost 6 months now and there seems to be no support whatsoever in addressing the issues plaguing this game, especially the lack of other commanders to choose from. US/British commanders have some of the more broken command abilities, mainly the anti infantry and anti vehicle strafing runs that loiter around and seem to engage targets outside of its engagement range. 

I would avoid purchasing this game until a much later date when a majority of the issues plaguing the game have been fixed, new commanders have been added, and more maps have been added to the pool to choose from. If you want to play a CoH game, then I would recommend CoH2 over this game for the mean time",1691472190,1691472190,False,2,0,0.523267805576324463,0,True,False,False

i dont really play multiplayer i go more for the theatrical WWII aesthetic ive found perfect mods for the perfect games i love. few things here n there is why i didnt give it a 10 but overall from what this game brings to the table if your a massive WWII junkie like me and love history and RTS games THIS GAMES FOR YOU

i cant stress this enough how detailed you can get to setting up your defenses its amazing i havent encountered anything like it yet the realism how they incorporated side hits and engine hits with explosions on tanks is great. the mechanics of full control of each and every tank is really fun feels like the movie FURY sometimes when i have 7 medium sherman tanks fighting one or two tiger heavy tanks and im having to back up while firing and their accuracy drops cause of the reverse motion...its just really fun once you get the hang of the mechanics and controls of every unit/vehicle.

animations now are more in depth as well than COH2 you see the tank crew pop out the hatch and catch fire as if the ammunition got hit.

or the animation that triggers when an entire squad gets wiped instantly and one lone survivor is trying to carry a fellow battle buddy away but their all dead no life bar left.. i watch all of these little details

infantry now instantly vaults over obstacles in their path

grenades are effective as hell if landed correct

not many bugs for me at all tbh

game runs smoothly just gotta know your requirements to how many players and how many populations per player should be in a game.

once again this is all single player custom or skirmish games ive played havent messed with multiplayer much at all so take this review how you want i hope it helps though. i bought this game less than 24 hrs ago and i have about 17 hrs as of now..

I played the original CoH1 years ago when I was in high school and it was certainly one of the best strategy WWII games at the time. So I have high standards when a new game is coming out in the series. 

When I played CoH2 - I think it was one of the worse games in the WWII strategy list. The devs put so much stress on DLC that it wrecked the game itself.

Sooooo... CoH3 made me keep an eye out for such awful focuses ... so far the game doesnt have such DLC focus - which is great... but the game itself has some flaws. The biggest is the overview map turn-based part of the game. I can speak for a lot of people when we say - WE JUST WANT LEVEL TO LEVEL - in Single Player. I dont want to waste my time doing turn based over-view map thing... its a big waste of time. There are also a ton of small bugs you will encounter time to time - its a big surprise they did not fix these yet.

Overall I still recommend the game. Its obvious SEGA took a risk and I can only guess pushed the devs on the release of the game due to the amount of bugs...

I played some COH 2 but it never resonated with me in the same way. COH 3 however does. I can't explicitly explain why but it just feels more like the original COH 1 experience that I enjoyed so much. I'll try my best to highlight its positives, as well as its faults, so that perhaps you feel incentive to try the game out for yourself and enjoy it as much as I have.

I will first touch upon multiplayer, as I believe that to be the best aspect of the game. I played COH 3 multiplayer on release, and I have regularly played during all of the major updates. I was here during the truly dark days on release where Wehrmacht Luftwaffe was absolutely lame and broken. I played when the US Air support center was buffed and was downright oppressive for Axis to play against. I have played in the ladder in all game modes with all factions and am familiar with every scummy tactic, bug and exploit abuse, cheat, and toxicity the game has to offer. All that being said I have enjoyed every second of my experience, granted some periods more than other. In its current state as of patch 1.22 I believe the factions are more or less well balanced towards each other with their respective strengths and weaknesses. There are still some outliers and bugs that are annoying, like Loiters continuing to target units outside of its effect range, and pathfinding can still be awkward for vehicles, but there are still actions you can use to minimize these effects. The one thing truly holding back the multiplayer scene is the map variety, there are very few maps in 3v3, but 4v4 especially. The devs are slowly  adding more maps into the game, and at least the maps they have added are pretty much the best maps in the pool. In the end I feel like this is a game that highly rewards you for personal skill, both tactically and in terms of individual unit micromanagement.  If you win its because of your own personal merit, and if you lose its because of your own personal shortcomings and the success of your opponent. You can always turn what looks like certain defeat into a scrappy win if you are bold enough, and yes, the occasional throw by an overconfident opponent. Remember all you need is 1 vp in the bank to win, and those are the sweetest victories. Learn the nuances of the factions, your own personal play style, position your units intelligently and if you have grit and determination you will improve and grow in your capabilities and will have some of the most satisfying battles in an RTS game.

Moving on to the campaigns I actually liked them. The Italian campaign is flawed but it provides a unique and interesting experience. It takes the form of a Total War style campaign map with armies you can maneuver around on the global map, you can build support buildings to provide buffs and abilities, and the campaign itself provides a good amount of playtime. I think my campaign lasted around 10 hours, but I also painted all of Italy blue. The map itself has 2 main battle types, skirmishes that you fight against the AI in minor towns and in field engagements, and the crafted mission battles. The biggest problem with the Italy campaign is the amount of skirmish battles you play against the AI. Though not unfun, as there is a good amount of variety in the types of battle you do, it can get tedious to chase down an enemy battlegroup thats being annoying. You can autoresolve these battles but that's generally risky and less efficient than playing it yourself. I figured out methods though that greatly streamlined the campaign experience.  Lock down battlegroups with partisan tactics so when they lose they cant retreat and you can destroy them in the next turn, and make sure you build alot of bombers to mop up damaged enemies, destroy fortifications, and soften up enemy towns. Damaging battlegroups with bombers also greatly increases your autoresolve power which makes it more convenient. Now, the hand crafted missions I believe make the campaign worthwhile. They are varied, engaging and difficult providing a great singleplayer experience. I forget the name of the mission itself, but one of my favorite battles is where you must relieve a landing force in need of assistance, but you must first endure an assault on your base whilst being shelled by ""Anzio Annie"" a giant railroad cannon. After that you must counterattack through entrenched positions while you are on the clock as the landing force is slowly getting destroyed, culminating in the capture of Anzio Annie itself. The cool part of this is its not just for decoration either as you can now use the cannon to shell the Axis forces in both the campaign map and in the tactical battles. There are numerous memorable missions that I could list off, but I encourage you to play the campaign and find which you like enjoy the most. The other campaign is playing as Rommel's Afrikakorps in North Africa. This is a much shorter and more traditional campaign experience than the Italian one. Here you simply follow through Rommel's real life  blitzkrieg through North Africa and is quite a lot of fun as well. Personally I actually liked the Italian campaign more as it had some truly epic battles like assaulting the Winter Line, but if you just want a simple set of well designed missions to play through without any bloat then the Africa campaign is suited for you. 

With regards to performance, I have an old rig at this point but the game still runs well, although on lower graphics settings. From my anecdotal experience FPS is stable and rarely has noticeable drops, and the game rarely crashes. I can probably count on the fingers of one hand in 280 hours of playing how many times the game has crashed. Cheating is also very rare, I have gotten drop hacked exactly twice and have fought very few opponents that I thought were even remotely map hacking, let alone blatantly. By now most of the noticeable bugs have been fixed and most games you play should be bug free or if there are bugs they are irrelevant  with two major exceptions: loiters and the 8-rad Armored car for Axis. Loiters will continue to target units for at least one additional pass  outside of the area of effect circle which can be very annoying and the 8-rad has a bugged fire rate causing it to shoot what feels like twice as fast giving it much more lethality than it should have. Both of these however will still not majorly impact the course of a game, loiters can be countered with Anti air and are generally quite expensive on munitions. The 8-rad can be screened by proper AT and hunted down by dedicated AT vehicles since it is quite squishy. Finally looking at graphics fidelity, the color palate is certainly brighter than in previous COH games, but in my opinion suits the context more of the bright summer Italian coast and the desert. Don't worry, you will get your gritty WW2 experience when you see men turned into giblets from howitzer shells while tanks get turned into burning coffins. The explosion effects, especially fire, seem quite good and wont leave you lacking in the destruction department. Weapon sfx is a bit of a mixed bag. Some weapons like the mg 42 or the BAR sound quite good, but others like the Stg-44s or garand sound a little weak. I think pretty much every vehicle weapon, from the Tigers 88 to the Quad 50 cals on the m16 halftrack, sound pretty satisfying however. 

Overall COH 3 is a game I would say has great bones. The base gameplay is very fun, IMO it is the best of the series. Infantry to vehicle balance seems quite well done, there is great QoL with reverse move and auto vault, and everything in the actual battle itself seems streamlined, from the UI to the performance. It has its issues which I hope get addressed, but for right now I think the game is in the best state its ever been in and i'm sure you will have a lot of fun.

The UI reminds me of an iPad game (not in the good way), especially compared to the clean and well done CoH2 UI. Performance during battles is passable but not good, especially for the level of graphics this game features compared to CoH2. Performance during the Total War battle map side is atrocious. Total War battle maps are 100 times nicer looking with much more intricate animations (like birds, smoke, etc.) but run fine. My frames drop to 5-10 on the battle map with absurd load times. No excuse for a game in 2023 to be barely playable in the battle map when Total War has had steady(ish) performance since Rome Total War. I've also had a couple of random crashes.
There are aspects of the game I really like. All the current units feel clean and well balanced. Vehicles are clean to drive and each vehicle feels like it serves a distinct purpose, but infantry is also fun and necessary to use. I love using artillery support in this game. It feels very powerful and the physics system in this game is awesome, calling in naval guns or 305mm artillery is devastating and satisfying as fuck. AI feels a little easy but I haven't tried it on harder difficulties (I also like to win, to be completely honest). The North Africa campaign was very fun even if I didn't give a shit about the boring ass story (the CoH2 Soviet story was way better). I also like the idea behind the battle map and it's definitely an improvement from the CoH2 Ardennes Assault battle map.
But yeah. The game is definitely just not finished. Factions are fun but faction rosters are way too small. Perfomance is really really bad. The campaign map is a good start but painfully outdated compared to say, Total War. Honestly a midpoint between the two games would be the perfect WW2 RTS. Maybe a year or two from now the devs will have finished the game and this review will be different but as of right now it's a don't buy unless it's on sale or you have money to burn.

Update: I went back and replayed the entire CoH2 Soviet campaign and it really just cemented how much worse this game is. While small QoL improvements are nice, performance, gameplay, enemy AI, story and bugs are atrocious compared to CoH2. Even the graphics aren't that much better, certainly not what I would expect from a game made almost 10 years later. For reference, Rome 2 Total War and Attila Total War were 2 years apart and the (already very good) R2 graphics were noticeably worse. 2 YEARS VERSUS 10!

- La manera en como el juego realiza el matchmaking no tiene sentido, el 80% de las veces que juego 4vs4 o 3vs3 mis teammates son inexpertos o no tienen el nivel suficiente al oponente lo que significa que a los 10 minutos de partida aproximadamente se retiran de la partida o el juego acabe muy rapido

- Ya han pasado 6 meses desde que el juego salio al mercado y todavia no existe la opcion de rendirse, algo que es muy basico y tuvo que haber sido puesto desde que salio el juego por primera vez. 

- Me parece que la parte donde queda MUCHO trabajo por hacer es en balance en las distintas equipos.
 Normalmente juego con los Allies (incluso desde que jugaba COH2) y todavia no me explico como sigue siendo posible que los AXIS tanto en COH2 como en COH3 sigan siendo OP. 
Unas de mis equipos favoritos son los USF y no logro entender como no tienen tropas de elites, tanques pesados (solo medium tanks) y lo mas importante la artilleria pesada lo cual el resto de los equipos poseen una variedad de estas mismas lo cual permite que puedas combinar distintas estrategias y hacerle frente al enemigo.

- Han pasado 6 meses y la cantidad de mapas que hay en cada categoria es absurda ya que deberian haber por lo menos 5 mapas por cada categoria (desde 1vs1, hasta 4vs4).

Lo que acabo de mencionar arriba son solo algunos puntos que me parecen que deberian arreglar a corto plazo para que el juego pueda por lo menos tener un poco mas de valor ya que siento que me estafaron al pagar  $100AUD por un juego que realmente vale $40.

After participating in the Campaign Beta and awaiting the finished product, at launch, I was playing through it feverishly only to drop it after taking Rome for the first time, and then returning more recently for a replay of the Italian Campaign on a higher difficulty before and after Emerald Bear, the third round of updates and refinements following launch.

Why I'd recommend it:
- Classic COH gameplay is here - it's fun to play, shorter play sessions are satisfying, and what makes it one of the best WWII games and RTS's in existence remains largely intact
- Unit banter is on point as always, and while the bickering of the Allied generals gets tiresome fast, the characters that narrate the action are entertaining
- New types of companies to explore like the US Special Forces and UK Indian Artillery Companies, while legacy factions like US Airborne and German Wehrmacht are largely familiar
- The Campaign map adds a new layer of strategy, building on CoH2's Ardennes Assault DLC and taking it new directions in ways that give more freedom but also feel a lot lower-stakes (or less stressful at least)
- Skill points can be used to customize your Company more than ever before, you can lean into what makes the company unique, or counter-balance it with armor, or make it more or less a Campaign map raider
- Italian resistance plays a unique role in both the campaign map and the actual missions, you can unlock valuable support by aiding their cause
- Command queue now gives you soooo much more control over your troops, tho in some cases it can make things a little too easy

What I wish was better or present:
- Despite purported improvements in pathfinding, you still have a lot of units getting stuck, turning into a ratking, or requiring more hand-holding on where to go
- As a history buff, I think it was a missed opportunity not to allow some form of playthrough according to the historical events - and it's currently very difficult to attempt a playthrough in this way because of the game systems
- Some Companies feel very absent - namely Canadians and British SF (I know the units are technically available, but it deserves to be done as a proper Company, just like US SF), hope these might enter the fray in a future update
- US Airborne feels too samey to previous inceptions, doesn't feel unique to either theater covered this time around, whereas previous they felt appropriate for Normandy or the Ardennes, here they just seem kinda generic and lack any theater-specific flavor
- Not enough of a challenge on the Campaign map aside from enemy Companies trying to Skirmish - these become so repetitive due to only a few different maps and scenario types being shuffled at random, you may often be inclined to auto-resolve when you just want to advance to your turn
- Weather/natural catastrophes like volcanos, mud, gas leaks, bad seas, scorched earth, etc. absent, there's no sense of the passage of time even though the weather and seasons had a huge effect on the real campaign - would have even been cool to have to manage the liberated Italian civilians and deal with things like sickness/disease and providing aid or they might sour to the Allies or something

The bottom line:
It has plenty to offer, and there's likely something that will scratch that WWII RTS itch and keep you hooked. There may not be enough as if now to truly sustain players more than the classics and surpass the successes of COH 1 and 2, but knowing that more is likely in the works for COH 3, I am having fun and looking forward to more.",1691024272,1691024549,True,4,0,0.501557648181915283,0,True,False,False

game is good don't get me wrong, but there is a number of issues, makes this game feel incomplete and also rushed with patches and game breaking changes.

1. graphics is not that good.
2. campaign is repetitive and story line isn't using the full potential of this game, the battles you go through are the same aside from a few main story skirmish battles that are enjoyable.
3. sound is trying to capture the old radios which i get but it falls short.

technical game breaking issues:
1. the recent faction balance is stupid and game breaking, if you want to enjoy the game play allies, which i hate, playing German faction after the announced nurf is stupid, tanks and vehicles are so weak vs allies that even a single Sherman can destroy a tiger tank easily which is BS, troops, bunkers etc have the same effect they are all useless in skirmish, you cant win if you choose German forces now, enjoy playing allies.

2. game keeps crashing through out campaign story mode, causing errors to my windows files, verifying the game deleted all my save games and now i am back to zero, all campaign progress is gone, and there is no fix for this to my knowledge.
3. Italian campaign is not working and broken
4. Africa corp campaign got stuck halfway through and then i could not complete it due to the errors and losing my save games.

devs are playing around with nurf and balance fixes where they should look at the main issues, which are game breaking issues and keeping the main story working properly, who asked for this nurf and why?, it doesn't make any sense but to piss off players and i will request a refund because of these dump moves its really frustrating, i played over 1000 hours in COH2 and was really hoping this would be something to replace that game but i think the new team is just not serious about this game its a quick cash grab for sure.

update:

i just played a Multiplayer match, its still garbage, the balance is a joke, Allied forces are so overpowered, if you want to win you have to play allied, seems like devs have chosen a side and we had to pay for that, either way if you are thinking of getting this game, DONT, its not worth it, i had to pay so you dont.

My only complaint is the daily challenges are very tedious to complete (i.e., destroy 2 Sherman tanks with Wehrmacht infantry).

You will have to play dozens of matches to get a single skin for a single unit. But if you're willing to dish out cash, you can buy the same cosmetic for the equivalent of $1 or $2.

While it is missing much of the flexibility that made COH1 and COH2 so engaging and gave them such a ""long tail"", there is great potential for growth here, if Relic can seize it. (New loadout options are a must, devs.)

REVISED FOLLOWING ""EMERALD BEAR"" PATCH:
This is one of the worst missteps I have personally seen from a game developer of Relic's calibre.

Far from rectifying issues, the recent patch introduced worse ones.

For example, they have somehow made the pathfinding even worse. In multiple games now, I have lost vehicles to ridiculous turning-circle antics (P4 tanks in particular), where instead of following the logical path, the vehicles instead circle around, often travelling into harm's way FOR NO REASON.

The balance is also currently awful, particularly because Allies can access even more deadly artillery than it was previously, and very early in the game to boot. (For the record, both sides had large-calibre artillery at the start of WW2. Not allowing Axis access to it until late game demonstrates, to my mind, a lack of education on the part of the balancing team. It also makes balancing EASIER when both sides can access very similar technologies. But I digress.)

I have decided to avoid this game until a future patch. In the interim, if you need a WW2 RTS fix, I recommend CoH2 or Men of War: Assault Squad.",1689844984,1690538147,False,0,0,0.510638296604156494,0,True,False,False

I can understand why people hate the campaign. I haven't played it personally but that may be a legitimate gripe. I can even understand some people don't even like this game that much. But to call it a ""mess"" or ""unplayable"" ...or, I seen this one idiot's review on here like ""Welp... CoH 1 and CoH 2 were good, guess it was just CoH's time."" It's REALLY not that bad. In fact, it's pretty good. 
A lot of the bugs and issues are really small things, like a machine gun animation getting stuck once in a while. But I never encountered anything seriously obnoxious or game breaking in my 30+ hours of playtime thru skirmish and multiplayer. And while people seem to LOVE complaining about the balancing, this is the first CoH game dropping with 4 factions at launch. The balancing isn't always perfect but how many RTS games drop with perfect balancing right off the bat anyways. And the 4 factions are fully-fledged. No half-assed factions with missing units or redundant playstyles. Each comes with it's own roster and style of play.
I will say some people can be turned off by the graphics, and for 2023 I can see that. CoH 3, really just in the infantry, can look very 'arcade-y' sometimes. The way there's not much physics between them and they just run thru eachother can be very jarring. Because normally CoH 3 does look really good. Contrary to dreary CoH 2, CoH 3 takes a brighter tone with a huge color palette. It really shows off in the maps and terrain, everything appears so vibrant and vivid. Even the infantry, aside from their sometimes jarring movement, do look really neat in their colorful uniforms.
The gameplay itself is basically a return to CoH 1, while still implementing all of the mechanics introduced in CoH 2 with several improvements. Everything... except for the commanders card system. CoH 3 uses the same 'tactics' skill tree as CoH 1. I have no problems with this, it worked in CoH 1 and it works here. But I can see this being divisive, as some people will miss the card system. 
I really don't understand why people are hating so much. This is a definite 7.5/10 that with the right tweaks can easily be a 9/10. CoH 3 is a competent CoH title. This is NOT DOW 3 all over again. This is actually a good game and if you see it on sale or you're just an old CoH fan I'd recommend it.",1690524733,1690525826,True,4,0,0.46570923924446106,0,True,False,False

Sure, I'll admit I'm probably going to keep playing the original CoH more than I'll play this game, but that's mainly just for nostalgia factor. If we're talking about the more technical side of gameplay, CoH3 has a lot more going on right now:
- Your infantry will automatically vault over obstacles
- True line of sight just like in CoH2
- Dynamic environment where the ruble from destroyed buildings can be used as cover instead of just being there for looks.
- Elevation of terrain matters now when in combat.
- Auto reinforcing which can be toggled if you so desire
And that's just off the top of my head. There's probably several other improvements or novel mechanics that I'm missing mainly but you get the gist of where I'm getting at as far as the technical side of things go.

Also, ""unfinished""? You mean to tell me that two full campaigns and four distinct factions is ""unfinished""? CoH1 and CoH2 only had 1 campaign and 2 factions when they were first released, and CoH2 had received a lot of hate for a good part of its early existence. So to claim that this game is unfinished when it has double the amount of content vs the first two games *at launch* is incredibly absurd. I could give less of a shit about multiplayer myself since I mostly play with friends instead of randos. 

Objectively this game gets a 7 or an 8/10. If you think I'm braindead for giving it that score, sure, we can go with that if it makes you sleep well at night. I'm still going to play this game and enjoy it.

Addendum: After having completed the Italian campaign, I will say that my thoughts on this game remain effectively the same. The core gameplay is good in my opinion. I can go more than two hours of gameplay without it crashing on me like some Coh1 mods and Coh2 matches tend to do (that being said, I will still play either of those games because nostalgia). If you think I'm stupid for having such an opinion, then that's your problem; if you don't like this game, good for you, go play something else then. At the end of the day it's not going to stop somebody who genuinely doesn't care about PvP from playing this game.

Single Player Italian Campaign lacks the story telling from the original game. It also lacks variety, most of the real time battles are repeats. The campaign feels like a slog to get through while the Total War-like campaign concept is refreshing but it takes too much away from the original concept.
Single Player North African Campaign has a similar problem of the Italian Campaign does such as story the cut scenes which focus on Jewish Bedouins makes no sense since the campaign is from the Axis point of view. At no point did I care about any of the characters in the campaign and while I get showing the Axis in any light other than the devil it makes the campaign seem one dimensional.

multi-player has similar problems as single player, balance is (was) constantly off like nobody at Relic or Sega thought to do a pre-release balance test. Also missing features common in past titles such as replays mode or added later on, like observer mode.

Right now, they are adjusting and balancing the game, as well as adding more content. It is super exciting to see more and more coming to the game for free and developing into an even better game. 

I've seen and heard lots of criticisms of this game, they usually fall into 2 major categories: 1) Bugs 2) Lack of content. 

1) Yes, there were a few bugs at launch, but they were not really that bad or noticeable in my opinion. A LOT of these bugs have been squashed and are no longer present in any form, especially the bad ones.

2) The campaigns didn't quite match up to the hype pre-launch, but both of the campaigns are fun to play and are enjoyable. The Italian Campaign has quite a few missions that start to feel repetitive toward the end of the campaign, but again, still fun to play. If you enjoyed previous campaigns in the franchise, then you'll like both of them. With some updates and changes (fixing repetition), the Italian Campaign could be perfect. 

As for multiplayer content: 

There is a limited selection of maps at the moment, with some maps being a scaled down version of the 4v4 maps. They have been adding to the selection of maps, which has been nice. There is also mod content with maps that supplement the base-game maps. (like the previous titles)

The base-game maps are still really good though. No complaints. 

Afrikakorps are a great new faction, way better than the OberKommandos of COH 2. I feel like they fill the gap that was always needed on the axis side with light mechanized units and early light vehicles. This balances out the weaknesses of the Wehrmacht and works great when both are working together. These vehicles are quite vulnerable though, so it is still balanced (Americans and British can counter this with early infantry AT). 

The Afrikakorps still get a lot of the great heavy tanks of the normal Wehrmacht, but they take longer to unlock and are more expensive. The allies need to shut down the Wehrmacht and the Afrikakorps before they can get the Tigers and Panther tanks in the late game. 

The British have gotten a rework since COH 1. They feel like a strong generalist, that relies on the battlegroup system to unlock the elite units needed to win. They are a pretty good counter to the Afrikakorps but can easily meet their match when facing the Wehrmacht's more dangerous heavy vehicles. 

The Americans and Wehrmacht work very much the same as COH 1, albeit with more improvements and leveling. You can upgrade and improve your units to make them very strong. Their leveling can leave some weaknesses though, so you need to level carefully in a competitive match. 

Overall: 

If you want a sequel to Company of Heroes 1, this is it. Company of Heroes 2 was fun and had a lot of improvements, but it felt lacking in what made the first one a classic. Company of Heroes 3 feels nice, like they are returning to their roots and finding the balance between new content and classic feel. 

I would 1000% recommend that you buy this game. During a sale or not during a sale, this game is a good deal. More content is coming, so that criticism will soon be resolved. 

My Ratings: 

COH 1 - 9.5/10 /with mods and nostalgia added (8.75 without mods)
COH 2 - 8/10
COH 3 - 9/10 /with room to grow 

My tips for game enjoyment in general - 

A) Don't have unrealistic expectations. They are working hard at new content and improvements, don't criticize them for falling short when they are clearly doing their best. (and the content is good!)

B) Make valid suggestions and bug reports if there are any, don't just criticize publicly without making clear how the devs are supposed to make improvements. 

Example: ""They made an in-game store with purchasable cosmetics :("" 

...What of it? How is the game supposed to make money and provide more content. All games do it and people pay for it. At least the store is for cosmetics and not for pay to win content.

If the content is bad and they are making the game worse (a la R6 siege), please criticize till the cows come home. If not, please refrain from posting your word garbage on the internet,

Old Review: The single player campaign focus from the devs really screwed the multiplayer community. I'm not sure if it's because they are trying to make the game playable on console but honestly the replayability here is atrocious. I've tried my very best to like this game as COH always held a fond place in my heart. Let's see where to start..., the camera view zoom and inability to adjust... just WHY? (Probably cause a console couldn't handle it..) Why do the machine guns sound like BB guns with the audio mix being so soft?? WHY does the COOP vs AI automatch ONLY have the second level of AI difficulty out of four with no option to change it? Why does the spacebar not move to the unit under distress as it has in all other COH titles? Why are there no player title frames yet since release other than the default and the pre-order? Why is there no rank system with minor rewards or major ones once major rank milestones or time in game has been met? I just don't get it.. So let's focus on a single player campaign with the multiplayer replayability being ignored. Don't you guys collect the COOP stats and SEE how many games have been played? Why not further develop the AI and the subsequent rewards system to keep players engaged and returning back? Why is there such a lack of official maps? Can someone not port over the old maps that were very popular from prior titles?

That above was my original review; and after a couple games and seeing the direction the game/developers are going, I will say we need to wait and take a closer look.

Game is in an early access state, playable but unfinished. Menus, UI, units and maps are lacking and the new microtransaction system will milk you like a gold digger. Be aware of the monster.
I'm not going to change my review to negative but the hype of the moment is longer gone, just hope for the best.

I will only comment on the single player aspect of this game. My biggest frustration is the lack of responsiveness, and plain command failure, when directing your troops, e.g. attach sticky bomb, you hear the acknowledgement, but the troop doesn't do it. So you have to do it again, I never had to do it a third time, never. Is it because the guy dies before he can deliver? Then it would happen maybe two, three, four times in a row as the troop is shredded, so no). In the heat of battle it has cost me the victory on many occasions. 

Also, engineer tank, heavy artillery is useless against other tanks when the opposing tank is right in front of it, so how does it miss? The frustration comes from the unresponsive nature of the troops in general. It lags.

Personally, I'm really enjoying Company of Heroes 3
I've read a lot of reviews on the game and I disagree and agree with a lot of points that some people have made (it's a new game it's not going to be perfect)
Of course there's things I dislike about the game, but they will just take time to adjust to or the developers with fix it in the future; I'm not just going to boycott them because ""tHiS nEw GaMe YoU rElEaSeD iNs'T a CoPy PaStE oF CoH2"".
Don't get me wrong I fucking love COH2 and nearly have 500hrs to show for that, but I knew COH3 wasn't going to be which is where I feel a lot of people have been let down.

If I could go back and knew what the games current state would be like on this date I probably wouldn't have bought the Giga Gamer Edition but honestly I'm not too bothered.
The thing that will kill this game is lack of content, sure the devs are about to release some new maps but what people want are new commanders (or Battlegroups) for the game. I know that's what I loved about COH 2, you were spoilt for choice which is where COH3 is lacking.

This is just my personal opinion and of course, just like the game, that is all subject to change.

As I've told all my friends that have shown interest in buying it:
If you want to buy it go ahead it's still a Company of Heroes game.
and to retouch on my first point - ""is it any good""

But the dream turned sour very fast. First the delay... I had already preordered the game before the delay was even announced. Delaying the game normally means either 2 things. 1.  The game is gonna have more polish and more content 2. The game is not even in working order has huge amounts of bugs and the devs seem to be sleeping on the project. Unfortunately the 2. option is what was the reality for COH3. 
Relic is known to release an unfinished game and fix and improve it with time so I waited.. and waited... and waited... and it appears that the game is almost as good as abandoned. It really upsets me because I feel that my 60 euros where completely wasted on buying COH2 again with less content. 
Campaign is okayish. If you are looking for a singleplayer experience you are going to get mediocre and very buggy mess. Sometimes when playing the campaign you are going to lose perception what even is a bug and what is a feature. The AI in Italian campaign is absolutely useless it goes either full agression or none at all in scenario 1 you bomb them to shreds with arti in scenario 2 the outoposts just get more annoying. 
Multiplayer. Unbalenced and with the lack of doctrines comes extreme repetion with no chance to adapt your strategy because picking any of the doctrines means pretty much nothing as you will be still stuck with the same units for most of the early to mid game.
In conclusion. Game is just non existant right now. If you want an good RTS just go play COH2 its extremely good game and haas content for years with the adition of mods. So is COH3 worth 60 euros? No absolutely not and the bonus content you got from the preorder is just a spit in a face for everyone that wanted to support the devs. I hope that the game becomes a game sometime soon but it just looks to be a wild dream.",1689671684,1689671684,False,8,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False

The actions of the troops, those little moments of madness that produce a result and the feeling of jeopardy and affection for your men. This is all fantastic but the campaign is sometimes a drag. In the campaign and in the battles there is little in the way of traditional strategy, its more run and retreat rather than management of options and tactics. I just completed expert and found the opposition to be feckless and frustrating rather than strategic. There is so much scope for this to be a grate game and maybe with modding it will be. I should caveat that I don't do much in the way of multiplayer but the single person campaign could be wonderful with a few tweaks and some thought to strategy. 

Two massive issues is Anzio and Monte Cassino, both are the main events in the game. You can bring two units outside of Monte Cassino and be told that you need to sort Anzio out first. This is odd and frustrating.  Anzio you need to use engineers to keep your base from being destroyed and this is maddeningly not alluded to at all. I only managed to beat this without doing this by sending a unit to destroy the gun one time in some kind of kamikaze action that surly wasn't correct although quite satisfyingly mental. 

Instead of all the skirmishes it would be great to have a changing scenario for each major town and to leave the big map to handle via strategic decisions the rest of the conflict.  I'm an older gamer at 47.

[h1]🎮 Gameplay and Story 📖[/h1]

[i]Company of Heroes 3[/i] (CoH3) is the latest installment in the series and focuses on the Mediterranean Theatres of World War 2.

There are currently two campaigns, one based in the Italian Peninsula and one in Northern Africa. I enjoyed them, although the storytelling was mediocre at best. They were unique as not many WW2 games have ever focused on these areas, which I really liked.

[i]CoH3[/i] also introduces a new campaign strategic ‘map’, where you move your armies and make decisions that will affect actual battles when they commence. I absolutely hated this map, it was slow and pointless, and there were no options to skip it. It does not make any sense to have it in a Company of Heroes game.

Another new feature is the new ‘line of sight’ mechanic, which adds vertical vision to units. This means that you won’t be able to shoot at units over cliffs or generally in positions higher than you. This is an interesting mechanic and a great strategic addition to the game.

Sadly, the campaign uses fictional main story characters, which is pointless and ruins immersion. And, once again, Nazi memorabilia or references are completely missing, whether they are in flags or text. 

[h1]💻 Graphics[/h1]

[i]CoH3[/i] has appealing graphics, whether they are buildings, units or terrain. Although units’ detail has been degraded when you zoom in close-up, I do not see this as an issue. I see it as an improvement on the first two games. Although you could see spectacular detail while zooming in on the older games, this was very heavy on your computer’s performance, for something you did for a split second. Making them less detailed while max zoomed in, gets rid of a little esthetic but gives you much better performance. Everything still looks great when you zoom out. 

[h1]🎤 Sounds and Music 🎶[/h1]

[i]CoH3[/i] contains realistic sounds and captivating music. Each explosion or gunshot is crisp and clean. Once again, each faction has many unique voice lines in their respective languages, increasing immersion. I played with Final A4000 earphones. Overall sound quality will be impacted by generic laptop speakers or cheaper speakers and headsets. 

[h1]👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Audience[/h1]

This game is best enjoyed by people in their late teens or adulthood. Not recommended for children due to violence, swearing and strategic depth. 

[h1]🔥 Performance[/h1]

System: Gigabyte G5 KF (11th Gen i5 12500H + RTX 4060 8GB 75W)

Frame rate can be quite unstable from time to time but generally achieves a higher frames than any of the prequels. The instability can be a little frustrating at times, especially when not much is happening on the map.

[h1]❓ Conclusion[/h1]

Overall, [i]CoH3[/i] is a solid game, but comes with a lot of issues and frustrations. If you liked the previous titles, you will be disappointed to an extent. The gameplay and story are there for those who can manage it, but I found it quickly put me off of playing, especially due to the new strategic map, and low-effort cutscenes. 

At this time I was unable to take any screenshots because the game just refused to load any skirmishes or campaigns. I will update in future.

It launched with more content than both coh1 and coh2 did at their launch. Bugs will be fixed, replay will be improved, more factions/maps/battlegroups will be added. The core game, mechanics, graphics, and content that are already there is superb.

These are things i really love about this game:
- The factions are incredibly well designed, and the battle group trees add a lot of depth and versatility. 
- The graphics and lighting are both leagues ahead coh2. I hate that unsaturated filter that plagues so many war games, and i'm so happy it is not at all present in this game. ww2 didn't have a sepia filter on it, it was as vibrant and clear as day.
- The mechanics like directional cover, height advantage, side armor, tank riding, better building destruction, and breach&clear are all wonderful additions to the game, and make it stand out from previous games in the series.
- The map design is fantastic. The new height advantage adds an entire new dimension to play around. The maps visual complexity and the diverse battlefields it creates is a stark improvement.
- I have to particularly mention the dust effect on desert maps is simply the best I've seen in a game. The way explosions kick up a thin cloud along the ground that gets swept away with the wind, or a tank going full speed kicking up sand behind it looks incredibly realistic.
- The sound design is really really good with excellent distant sound as well as super beefy mg sounds and great voice lines
- The way the destruction truly changes a map and units. Craters make light cover, buildings can be flattened for heavy cover. Tanks scorched black from fire. Entire battlefields pockmarked with shell holes.
- The single-player Italian campaign was a lot of fun, and was diverse enough to not feel stale It felt really tactical with the macro map of Italy.
- The multiplayer is super addictive. This is the first coh game where i am really diving into multiplayer, and it has been incredibly fun and also a huge challenge. I think the balance is in a pretty decent place right now. I see pretty diverse play styles, and not a whole lot of cheese with no counter.

Things i think can be improved upon:
- I think the single-player campaign ended pretty abruptly. The final mission was fun, but it didn't feel as grand as it should have been after 15 hours into the campaign.
- like many have said, it would be nice to view replays from an in-game menu with UI to analyze game play. Right now you have to use steam launch commands to watch a replay, and you'd need a mod to get UI for it.
- Leaving is an issue in team games. If you're playing with randoms, they will just leave if they are losing their lane because there is no surrender.
- Pathing is pretty rough right now with tanks taking insane routes and getting killed, but at the time of this review a fix and overhaul is coming in a week.
- The price tag is pretty steep. Worth it, but still steep. I remember getting coh1 for like $4 back in the day. I also remember when they gave it away for free.

Overall i think this game is fantastic. It is leagues ahead Coh1 and Coh2 in mechanics and features, and i think it will rival them in content when more DLC gets dropped. The improvements CoH3 brings vastly outweigh its shortcomings.",1689442937,1689443794,True,3,2,0.5,0,True,False,False

Some of the nuanced graphics are cool though like seeing bodies drop in buildings after a sniper hit.  Nice touch.

You fucked it up.

There's a serious lack of variety, so the game is ALWAYS the same. I was so eager to play this game, that before it came out I bought the whole package, preleased etc, but I am so disappointed by it that, while I still play, I don't recommend it to my friends because it lacks stuff.

Like, 4 factions is Ok. but only 3 ""commander"" for each one of them?
I will not even complain about the fact that even if you bought it big price, pre-release, the ""only"" thing you got is some skins to put only on ""one"" army.

The positives are in single player in particular, the Italian campaign is really good in terms of being able to fight on tactical battlegrounds but also move units strategically through the Italian theater and complete different challenges and tasks.  

North Africa leaves a bit to be desired, it's a shorter campaign where you fight as the Germans in a very straightforward manner reminiscent of the original Company of Heroes but it feels like a bit of a let down...comparisons will always be made with the Italian campaign and it seems backward and substandard compared with the multi-aspect control and more engaging game play you have throughout the Italian campaign.

The main reason this game sucks is because they just HAD to make it for Console and Switch as well. 

This one size fits all approach to the game is disastrous. The graphics are often lackluster. Many mechanics seem fruitless, and there is no proper instruction in the 'total war' style campaign. My companies can heal themselves and attack in the same turn? I dont get it.

Look, maybe this will be patched into something on par of COH 2, one can hope. I know I 'wasted' my money, but I had to see for myself just what the state of things is.

Update after 30 hours or so:

I'm having a lot of fun with the Italian Dynamic Campaign. Its not pretty, its pretty busted in some parts, but this is a good direction for them to go singleplayer wise. This grand strategy overlay with skirmishes and missions interlaced is actually very fun once you break out of the initial tutorial section. 

I hope they add another dynamic campaign. I'd love a German operation or even something like a coh 1 throwback like d-day, but as its meant to be.

The color palette is insanely oversaturated, its lost the ""gritty"" war feel of the previous games, the AI pathfinding is dumber than rocks and cant decide what direction to go around a goddamn bush with, the UI is terrible and it looks like they attempted to go a minimalist direction but got lost halfway through, and the models, textures, animations, and sounds are FAR worse than even COH2 which released in 2013. The voice acting and sounds are worse than even COH1, theyre fucking abysmal. It looks like a glorified mobile game, honest to god. On top of the outright scam of attempting to charge a full $60 for this game, in the completely and utterly (hopefully)unfinished state that its in.

Worst of all, the devs seem completely content with this, and would rather keep pumping out skins for the ingame store instead of working on the game. Since February, the devs have not pushed any significant updates addressing any of the mechanics or functionality of the game. Oh and the worst part as a mostly-PVE player? The AI is absolutely braindead easy. In COH1 if you attempted to go 1v3 against Expert AI, you'd probably stand a chance up until mid-game unless you had several chokepoints ready. In COH2 if you tried 1v3 against Expert, you'd get your ass royally handed to you within the first 10 minutes. I was able to 1v3 Expert AI after only 2 matches, on a completely open map, without using any buildable fortifications. And just a mini-gripe, the camera is also far too snappy and quick and removes a lot of cinematic ability from the game.

Im going to be real honest, this is probably a 2/10 for me. And those 2 points are only because it runs well. But I've asked for a refund in the meantime. I so dearly hoped this game would be good. I contemplated getting it for months since it released, slowly building that hope that maybe, JUST MAYBE, they would put some effort into it.

Easily the most polished in terms of graphics, terrain destruction, and control. The campaign, which I have barely begun to scratch the surface of, is the best CoH has ever done. The tactical approach on the campaign map is different and a welcome change. Decisions feel meaningful, units grow and take on specific roles in combat that carry over if you keep them alive. Something I've always wanted to see. There's also the ability to setup up defenses on the campaign map, making turtles like me very happy.

At it's worst it feels like CoH 2.5

Mechanically it's definitely the best of the series. 
Instead of a front and back half on vehicles there is now (finally) side armour! Things can be towed by vehicles, and in the case of bigger guns like the 88mm and 17pdr, it *must* be towed to move it. This can in turn create some shenanigans where you latch a decrewed gun onto a vehicle and run off with it. Trucks and halftracks that reinforce can now use an ability to recrew guns instead of having a squad recrew then reinforce both the squad and the gun. It also means lower tier, less effective AT has an attraction beyond cheaper; what happens if that heavy AT gun needs to be moved, and you can't? A 6 pdr/57mm can be pushed around.
The medium armour roster got spread out: a 75mm sherman or panzer 4 was 'the thing you get on the way to the bigger tank'. Now it's the actual main tank, which in turn means lighter armour like the crusader, or panzer 3 (a much requested unit from the fanbase) remain useful, and this in turn means when something heavily armoured like a churchill or a tiger I rumbles onto the battlefield, that single tiger is genuinely menacing. Some factions can recover vehicles for a resource cost, so it's not a free vehicle ability. Mods and maps are already coming out because unlike CoH2, they released them out of the gate (so if you dislike the zoomed in nature of the game, there's a mod to fix that!)

It's not perfect, of course. The AI feels a bit wonky sometimes, the american strafing run continues it's traddition of  murdering the crap out of german infantry (though at least this time it doesn't seem to instantly hit when the plane spawns offmap, giving AA time to stop it). 
Sound is criticised, and I agree it's not the same as 1 or 2; it seems to be leaning towards a more 'realistic' than 'hollywood' style sound which is especially noticeable with the explosions. The one that sticks out for me however is the sherman's engine audio; the shermans in CoH2 used audio sampled from an actual sherman and I believe it was done by relic's own people. Unless it's due to licensing I don't see why it wasn't copy-pasted into coh3. The sound of track links can be rather loud compared to engines for some vehicles (sherman for example) as well, though I suspect this is to help with player feedback-only specific vehicles seem to have it, and I have already caught myself registering ""Ah, here comes X"" in my mind.

Feels like a genuine apology for DoW3 at least.

The campaign was interesting at first until the bugs showed. The unit animations got interesting and then laggy to where it was taking about 2 mnutes just for the AI to have it's ""turn"". 

The ""campaign"" character discussions throughout become tiresome and repetitive. I don't mind other than not giving me the option to skip it. Especially since there is a skip option for other cut scenes.  

The in-game combat is ok. I wish they would've went more into the actual Italian presence in... Italy instead of just the Germans. The breach buildings capability is awesome and I love the pathfinders but, overall it feels like the developers copy and pasted the Company Of Heroes 2 game files, pasted, and colored some units differently. 

Even throughout the campaign the little details built up. Like invading skirmish mission city in the center of Italy and for some reason the map had a beach? That made no sense. Why is Britain doing a beach landing in the middle of landlocked Italy? And after about 50 turn I feel like I've seen all 5 map available played from all 4 corners. If it's going to be a required ""skirmish"" or ""campaign"" event then at least make them unique. 

I'm sad that COH3 got wrapped up into the release before ready  standard that all companies seem to push out. For some reason we continue to pay and support this.

Otherwise, yeah it's like we went back 15 or 20 years to the original Company of Heroes but, they learned they could get money from us. And it's likely to never be a polished product.

Joe Conti's character irks me. Basically the command structure are 2 Generals giving orders to a Captain who in turn gives orders to a Corporal. Which makes no sense. Yeah it doesn't affect the gameplay but could be done better. 
Having Indian artillery company and Italian partisans are a good mix and helps with diversity but the irksome John Conti is the voice for all.

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Lemon drizzle cake recipe you've come to the right place,,,

{ ingredients }

225g unsalted butter, softened
225g caster sugar
4 eggs
225g self-raising flour
1 lemon, zested

For the drizzle topping
1½ lemons, juiced
85g caster sugar

{ directions }

STEP 1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4

STEP 2
Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through

STEP 3
Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined

STEP 4
Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon

STEP 5
Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean

STEP 6
While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle

STEP 7
Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping

STEP 8
Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.",1687707460,1688123164,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

I really loved both part 1 and 2, and I find 3 to hold the same gameplay for the most part, but with a few minor additions and tweaks. The graphics are ""better"" but kinda all the same. I'd be able to tell the difference from part 2 and 3, but only because I'm looking at it as a programmer. As a gamer, the graphics aren't really an upgrade but there are very delightful subtleties. 

I bought this game for the single player mode and skirmish. The ""campaign"" story is pretty short, but there is a campaign where you liberate Germany and thats the real meat and bones of a story campaign in this edition.

The music is what it always is, orchestral drama, and I find it to be more of the same, but not as a bad thing. It fits the setting well and is in place with the rest of the series library.

I don't do multiplayer. Maybe its fun. 

From here on out, these are purely my thoughts and opinions in this review. I like the skirmishes, but it really feels like there are only two teams. It'd be nice if there was a liberation army of local peasants to add some diversity between Allies vs Axis. The allies teams will have british and american, their build style and units are completely different and the same goes with the nazis. Eh... I dunno. I'd just like a 3rd party to get invovled, I'm always a fan of rock/paper/shotgun situations and teams like in Starcraft 2 with the different races. 

I enjoyed the campaign mode and after beating it went back to do a bit more. That game mode alone is worth the price of admission I think, everything  else seems to be a bonus. It's basically a map, you move units around, they can engage in battle or set up defenses or take over cities. It's like moving pieces on a game board and that leads to battles where you fight the computer. Nice. Love it. 

As for the Italy setting... I dunno... I *REALLY* loved the Soviet cities and biting winters that were in part 2 and I miss it herebut its understandable this game mechanic is going to be missing because italy isn't going to suffer the record breaking winters the Soviets had. What Italy DOES have is mountainous landscape. It's where units on the higher territory get bonuses and thats cool because it gives look out points. They don't utilize this concept enough I think, because I'm being generous when I say lookouts. A bonified base of a lookout/strategic location would be amazing. 

Not really a fan of the desert stages, but I just don't even care about the lore of the Desert campaigns in real life. I'm a huge WW2 history buff and have been to some real world sites. I love the stories of what happened, the incredible bravery and the idea that brand new and terrifying weapons were being used at their grandest possibly to this day. But the desert setting just doesn't get me off. 

I got my hours of enjoyment in this game, and I think I'll revisit it in the future and enjoy some more skirmishes, and perhaps another Campaign playthrough.",1688014138,1688014138,True,12,2,0.520401895046234131,0,True,False,False

Company of Heroes 3 is essentially a watered down version of Company of Heroes 1 with none of the fun or immersion. This game was flawed from the start as it was designed for console and essentially ported to PC, despite all previous installments being PC exclusive.

So why is this game less compelling or fun than the previous games? It has fewer maps at release than the original Company of Heroes, there are very few units in the game overall, and they feel like generic copies of each other with different skins.

The graphics for CoH3 somehow manage to be worse than CoH1, looking very polygonal, like they rolled off the 3D modelling conveyor.

Then we get to the balance, and overall poor quality on release. The game had glaring issues on release, no leader boards, no profile customization which wouldn't be an issue if they didn't force you to have a ridiculous looking profile. On top of all of this, they decided to release the in-game store with fully functioning cash processing before addressing any of the game play issues. This is telling of their priorities and where this game is eventually going to end up, and that is they will develop and focus on the store and micro transactions rather than balancing their game or providing any real content or compelling reason to play. It can still be fun, don't get me wrong, but wait until it's on a steep discount Relic has turned this franchise into a bastard version of the Sims 4, payday 2, or cities skylines where you introductory price is massive, and you only get the corner pieces of the game, with the rest to be DLC'd to you at the low-low cost of $9.99 each, and 1,000 different ""packs"" to complete the puzzle.",1687917745,1687917745,False,9,0,0.527671754360198975,0,True,False,False

Now, I've survived some tough missions in my time, but this game takes it to a whole new level. So buckle up, 'cause we're divin' right in.

In Company of Heroes 3, you find yourself right in the thick of World War II, fightin' on the frontlines. Just like my own escapades, this game throws you into intense battles and demands quick thinkin' and strategic maneuvers. You'll be commandin' troops, takin' on missions, and fightin' against both the enemy and the unforgivin' elements of war.

The gameplay in Company of Heroes 3 is what you'd call a real-time strategy experience, partner. You'll be makin' split-second decisions, movin' your units, and orchestratin' battles on the fly. It's all about adaptin' to the ever-changin' battlefield, just like I did when I was navigatin' through the dangerous streets of New York.

Let me tell ya 'bout the visuals in this game. They're top-notch, partner. The attention to detail is incredible, from the realistic environments to the highly-detailed units. You'll feel like you're right there in the thick of the action, dodgin' bullets and makin' the tough calls. The graphics really immerse you in the gritty atmosphere of World War II, and it's a sight to behold.

Now, when it comes to the story, Company of Heroes 3 delivers. You'll be takin' on various missions, each with its own objectives and challenges. The narrative takes you through different theaters of the war, givin' you a glimpse into the struggles faced by soldiers on all fronts. It's like bein' a part of a larger campaign, fightin' for freedom and makin' tough choices to ensure victory.

One thing that stands out 'bout Company of Heroes 3 is the attention to historical accuracy and authenticity. The developers have really done their homework, partner. From the accurate portrayal of units and weaponry to the detailed maps based on real-world locations, it's clear that they've put in the effort to create an immersive World War II experience.

Now, just like any good mission, Company of Heroes 3 ain't without its challenges. You'll be facin' tough enemy AI and navigatin' complex battlefields. It takes grit, strategy, and quick thinkin' to come out on top. Some folks might find the difficulty level a bit unforgivin', but hey, that's the nature of war, ain't it?

One thing I appreciate 'bout Company of Heroes 3 is the multiplayer aspect. You can team up with friends or challenge other players in intense online battles. It adds a whole new dimension to the game and keeps the experience fresh and excitin'.

Now, just like any game, Company of Heroes 3 has its flaws. Some folks have reported occasional bugs or technical issues, but the developers have been workin' to address 'em with updates and patches. It's all part of the mission, partner, adaptin' and improvise when things don't go as planned.

So, if you're lookin' for a heart-pounding World War II experience, Company of Heroes 3 might just be the game for you. It's got strategic gameplay, immersive visuals, and a narrative that'll keep you hooked. Get ready to lead your troops, make the tough calls, and show the enemy what you're made of. Remember, in war, it's the ones who can adapt and overcome that come out on top. Stay sharp, soldier.",1687834042,1687834042,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

- Style: A step back from the last game tanks look like toys with coloured bar on them I get that is useful for Multiplayer

- Game play: Not bad not great. Same as old game but the vehicle feel unresponsive at time. The solo campaign mission as 
   far as I got are really boring. (Personal opinion alert)
- Content: Season pass and DLC are a Sin as the base game is pretty bare bone.
- Storytelling: Weird choice to recount the war from an outsider civilian perspective.  I get that you want to make us feel 
   that war is Bad but this is not something I want shove in my face when I play soldier. Also it make your own character feel

Ignoring all the bugs, which is nearly impossible, the game seems to be set up so that you can’t win, with a ridiculous, inconsistent “supply” line; meager early game rewards, which is when you need them the most; emplacements that require a whole turn to clear out, and somehow reduce a company’s strength by almost 50%. And there’s a million of them around bigger cities (historically accurate, but by the time you’re done clearing them out, you’ve gone about 16 objective updates and you no longer know what you’re playing.
I find the voiceovers to be the most bothersome thing. Much of the playerbase are historians, and most have high school degrees… “Will link up with the others when we get to Rome, that being our actual goal and all,” “drop every one of those motherfuckers,” “when those 42s open up, there is no pushing up.” People simply did not talk like that until Afghanistan. Biggest gamebreaker for me. I realize they tried something new, but there’s no way to have messed up this badly, which is actually really impressive. I will stay with games for a very long time, usually finding some redeeming qualities. In many respects, this is the worst game I have ever played… When you make the mistake of choosing to make a game about the southern front, it really has to be good. First AOE with no tactical pause, now this piece of garbage that looks like it was developed overnight, not over an entire decade by dozens of people.. I know where I’m not getting my games anymore.

I really liked CoH2 and I think this one improves on a lot of the grievances of that (e.g. over-arty shelling making infantry obsolete). I like the campaign and, while its not going to win any awards for its story, its a refreshing way to add some continuity to a skirmish manager. I only play single-player and there's a couple of which are great for adding the entire roster to each faction for all units (means you don't get shoe-horned into only a couple of 'key' units), so my review won't talk about the multiplayer aspects.

The pros:
- I like the unit balancing, the need for infantry even in the late game is pretty nice, and you need to keep up your mobile HQ to ensure you're not losing your best units
- Animations and tank engagements are good, I've found myself a couple of times just watching 2 evenly matched tanks duke it out to see which one is the lucky one (hoping its mine). I feel like that's a difficult thing to get right, but they've done well there. Also, if a 2nd tank comes along, it will shift the balance quite realistically.
- I like the variation of units for each faction. There's a good variety of tanks, infantry and support units that allow for a well complimented army.
- I [b] love [/b] the ability to tow heavy weapons.

The cons:
- Pathing is [b] awful[/b] and is somehow getting worse with each update. The final straw for me writing this review was watching my tank get stuck against another friendly tank in a field (no obstacles) that was trying to retreat - they just stared at each other and didn't move. Generally the pathing in CoH games has been lackluster, but it seems they set themselves a personal challenge to make it the worst yet before firing all the devs for this one. It is genuinely the worst pathing I've ever experienced in any game.
- The vanilla roster for each faction is lacking. It's pretty much a race to get to the big tanks and steamroll through with them. Mods help with this, but shouldn't be relying on mods to make the game fun.
- The campaign mechanics are pretty bad. Lots of unexplained options or annoying forced actions (e.g. you can auto resolve this big battle, but you MUST play this little skirmish that makes no difference). Lots of extra actions like shelling with your arty brigade... but they don't really do anything.
- And finally, the main reason you [b] shouldn't [/b] buy this game: the updates are making the game worse, not better. I think this game has a good amount of potential, but only if the devs know what they're doing/actually improve the game. Recently Relic fired most of the devs (I don't know if they're being replaced or just downsizing, but the core dev squad is gone) and whether its new and incompetent devs or big-wig execs pushing the devs to peddle [spoiler] pure shit [/spoiler], I don't know - but the final result of their input adds a minor amount but breaks a major amount. Let me give you an example. The latest patch added a new map (isn't that what the workshop is for?), not particularly something that players were desperate for, but it also tried to fix a whole bunch with planes. Instead, planes now 'die' but then fly around a bit more and crash in a random spot. On top of that, there's also a couple of bugs where pointers are gone or the map gets warped (because of destruction) beyond its bounds, so you click somewhere and it doesn't register because the mesh is warped. [b] And this was a minor patch [/b]. I'm convinced that pathing is worse too, but 'awful' and 'abysmal' are quite difficult to distinguish, i guess...

TL;DR:
Game had potential upon release, but poor management has meant that this is already worse and doesn't show much promise of getting better

TL;DR even that last bit:

1. Lack of official maps
---> Custom maps can be good, but a lot feel empty, prop-wise. Wish there were more official maps.
2. Menus are cheap looking and buggy. If you play COH2, the menus were very polished. This doesn't affect gameplay, but it does make the game feel like it was rushed to get to the finish line.
---> Most notable bugs are your battlegroups occasionally not matching your faction and dropping out of a party if you click ""Close"" in the results screen before the host does. ALSO, the stats don't always look like they're accurate.
3. Almost 4 months later and I still can't change my player logo or banner.

Otherwise, the gameplay is pretty solid and I like the environments. I'd say the game feels like a v0.8 or v0.9 of a game. You know,  where the core is there and hammered down, but there's much to be polished. I also miss the bulletins from COH2.",1686982706,1686982706,True,1,2,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics - Graphics seem muted or lacking ""soul"" as compared to COH1 or COH2. Visuals and animations seem off, they just lack the vibrancy and immersion of COH2 or COH1. Few visual bugs such as floating weapons, some odd clipping issues with articles of clothing etc. Please, please, please stop using bolt action animation with semi-automatic rifles please. You folks should have access to some weapon experts to get the animation and feel correct with small arms. Tanks seem to be animated well enough with suspension float and momentum.

Sound - The sounds of battle exist, nothing spectacular. You won't hear the cacophony of thunder of COH2 or COH1 in this submission. Mortars sound absolutely pathetic, like dropping pillows filled with the finest goose feathers onto shag carpet, and the MG42 could absolutely use more bark. Tank cannons surprisingly sound ok. However, I am a big fan of the tracked vehicle engine and track sounds.

Gameplay - Same tried and true formula of rock/paper/scissors. Some confusing and rather poorly explained changes like machine gun facing when placed into buildings. Like usual, some units are OP and some units and doctrines won't see much use as they are sub optimal. Same unit pathing issues remain, multiples of vehicles or infantry will struggle to navigate together in close proximity in a meaningful or logical way. Lots of Jennifer Lopez vehicle action where even properly micro'd vehicles will spend a lot of time twerking their rears in the face of your enemy. Rather poor sample of boring and bland maps on release. I hope to see more, well-inspired maps in the near future. One nice thing, you can load infantry squads onto tanks finally. Additionally, gone are the days of one shot squad-wipe grenades and tank or mortar rounds for the most part. 

Like too many games nowadays, this one feels like an uninspired, rushed submission by a relatively rookie dev team who are cutting their teeth at their respective talent positions. I guess all the good, senior devs have left or have retired as this issue seems to be prevalent across the whole gaming industry. Change the main menu UI and background picture please, the whole presentation is abysmal, and it is the first thing people see when they log into the game.

They didn't really add many features from COH 2. A bit embarrassing for a team of this size to spend this long and add so little. Reads like business needs won out over design way too much in their dev process.

The Bad:

 - Everything loads really slow even on max spec machine. Bizarre they didn't spend any time improving this.

 - The campaign (which has some nice moments but is pretty half baked) is a great new addition but it has a ton of bugs. Things feel really choppy and just like it was implemented really sloppy. Tons of weird visual stuff happen on the enemy turns. Overall it just moves so slow. It's boring at times.

 - Audio bugs - lots of weird audio stuff going on, sounds that make no sense in the campaign map.
- textures missing all the time. In the campaign map things get messed up and lose textures often, it happens in the real time battles as well. This is really bush league stuff. Shame on the devs and QA. 

 - Campaign map is stiff. Really lazy stuff, hard  to click units, movement is a bit shaky. Just feels unfinished. No polish.

 - They really actually didn't make much new content. They have the framework of the campaign but it feels like they rushed it (which makes no sense after 7 years). They have huge potential with the new campaign system but it feels like they are setting up to sell DLC forever and considering it is top price game it's embarrassing they didn't feel the need to put more content in there.

 - This is SEGA why they heck didn't they work closer with the Total War teams? Those guys have the campaign already sorted, instead they went and tried to build one on their own and it is clear the product teams didn't have a clear vision or grasp of the scope of what they needed to do in terms of content and how it all connects together in the campaign map.

- Really weird and poorly designed UI. It's chunky, feels like it's from 2010. Buttons have weird edges, just not a lot of effort in the design of the FE for some reason? 

 - Almost no improvements to COH2 UI. There is so much room for them to improve the ui. Feels like another company could come in and really clean up with some quality of life things if they could get the squad combat right. 

 - Pretty amateur audio work and voice acting implementation. They are trying to use voice acting but it's stiff and they won't let you skip  things. 

 - Horrible pacing in the campaign maps in a variety of ways but it comes back to, everything feels like it needs optimisation. So clunky even on top spec systems.

- It was in dev so long but still feels like it needed WAY more time. The people leading this work should be pretty embarrassed. It feels unprofessional with their implementation and literally no QA. 


The Good:

 - It's COH
 - Squad leveling is a lot better (although they won't let you carry units between battles which is major oversight)
 - Really fun battles, feels like the polish went into this stuff, but it was already quite good in COH2 so it's a bit questionable.
 - The campaign is awesome although has tons of room for improvement.
 - The air and sea stuff is really fun in the context of the campaign.
 - Co-op! Yes. This might be the best thing they added outside the grand campaign mode.",1677361473,1686765728,False,0,0,0.513833999633789063,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is very familiar from the previous 2 CoH games, with the addition of the Italian campaign map. The campaign map brings turn-based strategy to the high-level planning of the campaign instead of the linear story of the previous 2 titles.

The AI is much better than it used to be, and the turn-based strategy map requires you to manage multiple priorities with very limited resources. Overall, it's been a good challenge. I'm only about half-way to Rome, and this playthrough is probably already at 25 hours.

Real-time combat (with a tactical pause I never even used) is how the turn-based strategy encounters are resolved. Certain key strategic locations will have pre-determined ""Missions"" while unit-to-unit combat and smaller locations will have a ""Skirmish"" with one of a handful of pre-determined goals. While the skirmishes become a little repetitive, you _can_ skip them if you don't mind taking a bit more damage.

I think the combination of turn-based and real-time strategy works well, and makes the Italian campaign much more dynamic than previous CoH campaigns.

I was pretty late to play the CoH 2 (around 2017 - 2018) and there were not many players online at the time. This time I started with the alpha test, then made the pre-purchase just to experience more multiplayer games. By comparing the CoH 2 base version (only Soviet and Germany) with CoH 3, I will say CoH 2 is far more playable. As this game is a totally unfinished one, some of the aspects may get better, but I don't know whether I will wait for them like I uninstalled Battlefield 5 before many features were added.

Things are below CoH 2 level:
- Music. The music sounds like Di**ey cartoon.
- Soviet. Where the h**l is the Soviet? 
- The Campaign. I don't get the Italy Campaign ideas. I get it it's a new game mode, but we are not playing war chess here. I didn't feel any story line on the chess board. Also, if you just play on the map, the automatic resolve will make you lose much more. So you have to play manual repeatedly on the same maps with very little nuances. So boring. I was expecting some big endings but it just ended out of a sudden.
- Size. Infantry sizes are too small to observe. Yes you can adjust, with a sacrifice in the view range.
- Super tanks. The highest ranked vehicle by the WOT standard here is a tier 7 tiger. No more tiger II, or Pershing, or IS-3, etc. Don't let me pay for them later.
- Maps. I really don't want to see some of the maps any more.
- Bugs. Of course, there are too many bugs.

Things should have been improved:
- Vehicles still get blocked. Abandoned weapons are hard to clear out. Cannot be turned into gas. Once attached an abandoned weapon to a vehicle, there is no way to release it (should just be a bug)
- Mouse control of aiming vs moving. Artillery still moves to the target instead of aiming at it. Picking dropped weapon is also very hard.
- More play modes. I kept thinking why not just expand on the CoH 2 directly. Too many things feel identical or even worse to me.

Things that are better than CoH 2 (I do notice the good part):
- Retrieving infantry from buildings with one click, which is great.
- Infantries are more vulnerable
- More supportive units

Ironically, I purchased this game first time it was release so I would find more online players, finding there were actually fewer than CoH 2 in 2018.

I will select No to recommendation for now. If things get better, I may change it.",1686462385,1686462385,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite all their trailers claiming maximum choice, there's actually less playstyles than coh2, less commanders/abilities, like 2 maps (5, feels like 2), and mostly crappier units. Also all the ones that are chopped up versions of bigger maps do not play as well. Sure graphics are great, sure breaching buildings is cool, sure the half-baked campaigns are there (just actually look at the first half of the afrikakorps maps before you fizzle out, like wow last minute decision). 

It's hard to put your finger on it. Maybe it is just balancing but it feels kinda like a gameplay choice, some units utterly suck while most of the elite infantry squads can dominate the map with 2 upgraded weapons for the price of 1 most of the time (double flames, double mgs, mostly for germans ofc). The anti-infantry AAs all kinda suck imo, except the OKW towable one. No more punishing noobs with your Crusader that deletes blobs with strafing fire ability, now it just goes boom.......................................... boom................................................ Unless you pay munitions, then its boom.........boom.........................boom............boom. It's not bad, but it's not as good. And that one is related to the early war period I believe, not balance. But many unit abilities feel that way - less tactical ability use and more just using the regular unit for combat. Nades are still good though and implemented well. And I guess the AA is good for planes considering they all die in 2-3 hits.

The only thing that really stands out to me is the height advantage, that was a great addition imo. Also the rocket halftrack strike, graphically and damage, chefs kiss.",1686405179,1686405442,False,7,0,0.52457737922668457,0,True,False,False

Good game for its time, but it's 2023 and outdated. If I could go, back I'd punch myself in the face. CoH3 is by far MUCH BETTER in every aspect.

It's honestly unfortunate that the game has panned out like this. As others have stated, as a devoted fan of the franchise and somebody who enjoys RTS games, after the decisions that Relic has taken over the past few months I can no longer support someone purchasing this game.

The launch was smooth, though there were some teething problems.

The response?

""We fixed the camera settings like people asked!""

""We also added a monetized cosmetics system that is ever-present. Yes, we are aware that you already paid for the game. No, this is not the paid DLC, these are separate transactions that give you cosmetics and then you can also pay for the DLC.""

I never had issues running this game when it released. Yet now, I am lucky if I can play for an hour straight without a crash, freeze, or game performance running so low that it makes more sense to quit than trudge through it. Before the 'Poor cope' response comes in, I am running a 30- series graphics card with a late i7 processor. I don't even hit 50% of my system resource utilization when the game crashes.

Add the devs releasing 'Day 1 Mod Support' (which in hindsight seems to be an excuse to release a pathetic amount of base multiplayer content,) and then punishing you for using mods by making games with ANY mod or tuning pack ineligible for the weekly scraps you can spend hours grinding for to maybe, one day, get one cosmetic. (as a bit of a laugh, trying to put the word 'free' in the same sentence as 'skin' results in that phrase being censored.)

It's really sad to see Relic follow the disappointing release of Age of Empires IV by enforcing aggressive monetization tactics on yet another RTS under their umbrella. I'm not exactly sure what market they tried to appeal to, but none of those markets interact in such a way that this game would appeal to any of them.

This is the first Company of Heroes game where I have gone BACK to write a negative review. Imagine the cash grab and performance of COH 2 combined with the graphics of COH 1 and you will have a perfect representation of this game in its current state.",1677294078,1686081404,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The allied campaign, the character setting for the US and UK is very interesting, but i still prefer the good old CoH campaign instead of big fucking map and next turn next tune and next turn, if i want to play a grand strategy kind of game, I will play HOI or Total War, but here i want to play CoH. btw fuck the resistance, always act like we own them something.

There is ton of bugs and glitch still haven't been fix. and now they add a premium kind of currency, i have no problem with that since i won't pay for shit, but maybe fix most of the problems and bugs first? its basically common sense, you want people to pay for more? fix the game first.

Sound effect is really bad in this game, is either no sound at all or in bad quality, the rifle or gun just swing around the soldier sometime i guess my troops are Jedi scum or filthy sorcerer, US airborne with combine but the animation still bolt-action, i know some people don't care about those, but i do, i don't care would they fix them, i just want to point out these small problem 

Compare to the CoH 1 and 2, its pretty much downgrade, the overall quality of course, if they actually care for the player, the ""majority"" of the player base, and manage to fix the game, i will still consider its a ""not bad"" game, we shall see, if they still been retarded and don't care their fanbase and players, then doom for the CoH is imminent",1677237059,1685622032,False,0,0,0.473469823598861694,0,True,False,False

I told myself I was impressed by the frequent patches, and what seemed like an honest attempt to fix both balance problems and the plethora of bugs.

That all changed for me when their first major update was adding the in-game currency and store. I pre-ordered the game (for $80), and with all of the horrific bugs that were still out, and the obvious balance issues, their priority was to try to get more money out of their player base.

I can't defend this game anymore. Maybe we will get to a point where I feel like the game was worth the money, but we are ABSOLUTELY not there yet. I hope they eventually get their act together, but right now I couldn't be more disappointed.

If they continue to support the game, and it gets supported past this abysmal launch, it might be worth the money then.

The game is empty and quite unfinished, they say its in full release but it feels worse than the open beta testing, the latest update of writing this review (sapphire jackal and balancing change) didn't give much hope, bugfixes and a cosmetic store to try and get the last dollar out of this game. The truth is, its worse in every way from coh1-2, its not worth the money, 

I preordered this game expecting just a little too much, the mechanics in this game are nice but they don't do enough to keep me invested, the maps are little to none the variety of units is a little small, and match customization like in coh2 is zero.

 The only reason I play from time to time is thanks to the modding community, this is one of a few positives in this game.

(verdict): I would not recommend getting this game, it's not finished as of yet, it might change in the future but if Dawn of War 3 is anything to go by I wouldn't hold my breath. 

All we can do it wish and wait to see if this game gets the love it so desperately needs.

1. Balance - No game in history Got this correctly on the first months or even year of release. as you need  Tons of players with different levels of skills to have accurate data. as of time of writing this review for me balance has improve i play mostly US and i dont feel i loose / win games  due to balance i am a average player thought not Pro. 

2.  Audio / Icons / user interface - these are not game breaking - most of it are now fixed if not all

3.  Campaign - to be honest i did not bought the game for the campaign thought i did finished it.  I prefer the COH1 style of campaign compare to this.

what no one is emphasizing but they did a really great job for me.

1. Match Server - I live at South east Asia. I literally quite COH2 because of the 2 seconds delay when playing Multiplayer matches. No matter how good my internet is i have this issue. Since Launch of COH3 all the matches i have are Rock solid. good response and no delay.

2. Solid Game play - you may complain with the balance (which is fixable) but  the game play is just so solid for me . only COH2 is really comparable.


Is COH2 better than COH3 right now short answer is Yes. but it took COH2 at the minimum 6 to 7 years before it got to its current state and even then i still  have server delay issues.

Sequels are fraught, because you're competing with the image of a legendary game that lives in the heads of the fanbase-- and it's true, this doesn't revolutionize the genre the way Company of Heroes did in 2006, but it also didn't suffer the floundering monetization issues that plagued CoH2.  It has some launch issues-- balance is fluctuating quite a bit per patch, it needs more multiplayer maps, and I'd really enjoy a couple of additional factions. The single-player campaign is a mostly failed experiment. But comparing it apples to apples, Company of Heroes 3 is a solid modern implementation of the classic formula of its predecessors.

The reinforce in base is a good touch but sometimes my MG gets stuck in base for no reason and eats up my pops.

The game fails to prioritize making new maps and commanders and instead is worried about skins. Why would anyone care about skins in such early game is beyond me but seriously leave the skins to be created by the community to be voted into the matches.

To summarize in total:

The game lacks the intensity it used to have in coh 2 and lacks choice of commanders to use in combat, everyone play coh 2 for different commander capabilities and skills and there is just a vast amount of that in the old game. I hope the team really sit down and figure out it's priority before the game is gonna lose it's remaining average 3000 daily players.

1. Some icons are placeholders from CoH2, and this happens for a lot of units. For instance the DAK recon vehicle has the icon of the .50cal jeep from CoH2, one Marder III model (I think the M variant from Wehrmacht) has the icon of SU-85, and several others. This is simply sloppy. How long does it take to make a unit icon? 2 hours maybe? Come on Relic...

2. Several basic features from previous games were or still are missing. For instance, at release, you couldn't queue orders in the tacmap, or capture points. Then they added it a few weeks later. You cannot see player names on units in multiplayer,  some tooltips are missing, and few other small things that make the game feel unfinished.

3. After all the negative feedback, the devs did not change their road map and they still went for the in-game shop before prioritizing other vital things. This is simply a stupid move, most likely pushed by an idiot project manager/leader who should be replaced.

4. No ranked multiplayer after 3 months from release. I can understand that you don't want to release it immediately to have time to balance the game, but now... What's the excuse?

5. Poor map variety and they are mostly bad. Have the community build maps for you in an internal beta release.

6. VPs bleeding is way to fast. Put back the old CoH2 system.

And now for the positive things:

1. New game mechanics, very well though: Elevation mechanics is great, basically if your soldiers are above the enemy, the elevation will negate cover. Towable guns are a great addition. Auto-vault is great. Really. Well done, we needed it! And tank riders, that is so cool and useful to move infantry around.

2. Animations are way better than CoH2, in CoH2 every unit seems to move in slow motion, even when they aim, here they are more responsive, you see them slide into cover and duck. Tanks suspensions feel real.

3. First CoH ever to release with 4 factions, and they weren't even that horribly balanced (still at release DAK and UK were OP but not in a critical way, except the Tiger reserve that got nerfed the day after they released the game).

4. Finally after two games you can remap the keyboard.

5. Nice SP campaigns for those who are interested.

6. Old point system from CoH1, that is way better than CoH2. At least every game is not down to ""cut the only enemy fuel point"".

7. Tank armour is way better, now StuGs are not made of cardboard and a Tiger feels like a Tiger and doesn't get denied by long-range cheap tank destroyers like in CoH2 (I hated that mechanic so much, why should a SU-85 outrange a Tiger or a Panther no one knows).

8. No pay2win commanders, now we have 3 commander trees like in CoH1, way better to balance, but with more variety since some ability are exclusive and you have to choose which one you want. Way easier to balance. Probably they will release more in future, I hope not too many, otherwise it ends up like CoH2.

8. Mortars and indirect fire weapons are really dangerous. If you get barraged by a mortar and you try to stick around you get wiped. MGs area of suppression is great and denies blobbers excellently (and maybe this is why there are a lot of people saying ""CoH 2 is better"", because the real problem with CoH2 is the total absence of blob denial cheap units. Yes you have MGs but they are not nearly as effective, and all heavy anti-blob is relegated to a high tier for a high fuel cost.

Now let's discuss all the haters. Unfortunately, every time a CoH game/expansion is released, it is always the same story: Coh X was better than Coh X + 1. I have heard this with CoH2, it came out and everyone was ""CoH 1 is way better!"". There are still people saying that. CoH2 had its issues, but the improvements over CoH1 were many, first of all the sniper mechanics (the snipers with the predator suit were such bullshit, I would never go back to that) and the true sight. Moreover these people do not consider a simple thing: CoH2 is a TEN years old game, and it was basically garbage until 2017. It took 4 years to bring the game to a balanced multiplayer state. FOUR YEARS. And CoH 1 is no less, everyone forgets that in competitive multiplayer basically every match is Wehrmacht vs USA because the other factions are STILL, after 16 years, broken beyond remedy. Maybe these people started playing CoH1 or CoH2 4 or 5 years ago, so they never saw the dark days of those games, or they forgot, but let me remind you:

- Do you remember when Tales of Valor came out and the Kangaroo transport costed the same as a Panzer Elite 250, it had the health of a Sherman tank and you could basically load a bren section and a RE with PIAT and base rape the opponent unless he spent all the munitions in the world to mine every possible meter of the battlefield? And the 250 AT halftrack with the thread breaking shots that HALVES the health of any tank? And the awesome British LT that denies suppression? And what about CoH2? Have you played the game when there was coldtech, no tac map? Or when they released the Case Blue addon with the Elite Troops Doctrine and the Tiger Ace that took 20 minutes to destroy (yes you had no income anymore, but you could basically win the match with one unit)? Or when they released the Soviet Industry Commander that allowed you to roll out 3 T-34's at min 10? Or when they released the Western Front Armies, do you remember the OPKW? And the UKF, with the Bofourious that in one burst wiped out an entire squad, the Mortar (aka Mordor) Pit that coudl cover half of the map and one shot any squad? The Churchill that had (and still has) more health than a King Tiger? The 2016 patch that made the Stuart and AEC on the same level of T-70''s, while being cheaper and coming out 3 or 4 minutes early? And the ""click on the map to remove German units"" artillery cover ability that basically deleted everything on screen? And Tulip rockets that could brin a KT to 20% of its health with one salvo and also stun it at the same time? Do you remember that year  the automatch was stuck between 70 and 90% allied search, no one wanted to play Axis anymore, at the only competitive tournament of that year (I think it was the War Paint Championship), the only person who managed to win with Axis was DevM? And what about all the broken (still broken) commanders that no one managed to fix and for which every competitive tournament runs with the ""commander terminator"" mode, so that you cannot keep spamming ostturppen vs usa mechanized every single game?

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Am I annoyed that the game was released in this state? Yes, and some things really show sloppiness.
Is it better than CoH2? Yes and no. It has way better potential and several gameplay mechanics are better. But the game feels unifinished, and CoH2 simply has some features missing from this game that should have been there in the first place.
Does it deserve a negative review? No, definitely not. I am having fun. Way more fun than CoH2. This is one of those situations where I'd like Steam to have something in-between a negative and positive recommendation.",1685230048,1685230638,True,2,3,0.492310583591461182,0,True,False,False

Looking forward to the community maps whenever they start coming out. I feel like it is better than COH2, and on par with COH1 (my original favorite). I play on a lower-performance computer and it still does well.

60 Hours in: Still love it. I don't play PVP; it is not my style. I love the skirmish mode and campaign. The unit balance will take some time, but it's pretty good to try different styles of offense and defense with each faction. My favorite is mobile warfare with DAK or infnatry/Artillery overwhelm with the Brits. 

I think people are way overreacting. 

Sure, microtransactions are unfortunate, but just don't buy them then lol

After about three months since release, the only biggest addition to the game was the in-game store flooded with nearly all the items being sold for real money. Forget about buying something cool for the in-game currency. No profiles, no in-game statistics, no real progression, no replays, nothing core game related was added at all. Microtransactions? Sure, it's in!
Very bad direction. And the recent news about the layoffs at Relic. Sadly, that kinds of complements the grim picture of this game's state.
So now it's definitely a no-go, don't buy.
-----------------------------------------------------

Despite the rough start, Company of Heroes 3 has the same strong backbone like in the previous parts of the series. The core gameplay is extremely fun, strategic, and has nearly endless replayability. The Real-Time battles shine as always in the series. All 4 factions feel pretty unique and new, even though they have already been included in the previous CoH installations. The battlegroups with exclusive choices are very good, new mechanics like the tank riding and verticality as well as the introduction of the side armor profiles for tanks are all welcome additions. Balance is regularly being tweaked and adjusted.
However, the game feels unpolished and is not fully ready to be released as an AAA game yet. At the time of the writing, there are no basic features like progression, ranked ladder, customization, statistics, replays, observer mode, and so on. The UI could have been much better, the main menu feels just cheap. The graphics at the maximum preset doesn't look any good for 2023, it's fairly unambitious.
Still, the core gameplay with its brilliant and strategy-fun balanced RTS battles pulls the game off. Company of Heroes 3 definitely has the great potential to be the best in its genre over the last years. After some patches and polishing. 
There are high chances it will be a real RTS gem and a well-deserved addition to the CoH family in about 6 months or a year. I'll give it a thumbs up in advance.",1678402554,1685043555,False,1,0,0.518518567085266113,1,True,False,False

* Unplayable on release - I can't think of a major developer now that hasn't started releasing half-finished games
* Micro transactions before bug fixes
* I've only played single-player thus far, and would expect this to have the least amount of bugs and yet...
* So, so many bugs. A lot of the game-breaking ones have been fixed that I previously ran across, but no part of this game runs smooth or as it should except for maybe the main menu.

* Okay enough about bugs. This game has not improved in almost any way upon it's predecessors. Breaching, okay cool but now,
* Very, very small selection of maps. In just the Italian Campaign, minus ""special locations"", the same 3-4 battlefield maps  are used over and over. They just rotate starting location and/or what part of the map is usable.
* Graphics are arguably the same, just overall brighter - which is fine to me. It's an RTS, not and RPG.
* AI is extremely dumb even in ""Expert"" difficulty both on battlefields and the Italian Campaign map. They don't recapture locations, They have units that just sit around half the game. They don't use non-typical units like aircraft.
* Units are extremely unbalanced. Start the game with a jeep and armored car and you'll win 99% of the time.
* Secondary objectives don't matter
* Partisan map abilities don't matter
* Town abilities minus resources rarely matter
* It'd have been great if multiplayer included the ""Civilization"" type gameplay that's in the Italian Campaign

10+ years clearly isn't enough to have some ingenuity or integrity

Those people would fare better playing COH2, which they probably slammed as ""the worst game ever compared to COH1"" when it first released.

That being said, there's tons of bugs - including the one I am afflicted by, which is not being able to change the texture details above ""low"" which is the reason why I can't really rate anything else other than the sounds as of yet - but the beta was quite good looking, so based on that I can tell that when they'll fix it, it'll look good, too



EDIT:

After a few more hours in the game, the positive review doesn't change, HOWEVER.
The game is sadly a bit meh, I am sure it both CAN and WILL be better in time - I do not think the audio is bad like other people, I understand what the developers were aiming for and I agree - I also think the art style is okay, it's not bad.
I feel like the italian partisans and army could be integrated a little better in the factions, so I hope for either a dlc or (preferrably) some updates and expansions in that regard.
I also think it could be nice to either represent or let modders represent the different divisions and countries that fought in Italy Allies-wise, considering the poles, the FFL and even Brazilians participated in the Italian campaign, other than the Japanese-American division and some american natives - maybe these ideas could be integrated in the skin section of the game either by the devs or modders...

First thing to note, I must give my details. 3.7k hours in coh2 and ranked 48 in the world in teams of 4. Played since the near release of coh2 and dabbled in coh1. Hence I am more aware of mechanics and balance of the game. 

To quell the hesitation this is far from a bad game, but nor is it a perfect game. But compared to Relics last title this is far better as you can feel the passion and care they put into the game. So for a TLDR I recommend this game.

Now onto a more detailed review starting with positives:

 The new mechanics for coh3 is simply much better than its incarnation will the much appreciated side armor being introduced it now rewards players for flanking enemy tanks and no longer forced to drive head first just to go behind rear armor just to penetrate armor of enemy tanks. Along with some quality of life changes like auto vaulting and the breech(Although not quite usable depending on the skill of the enemy is nonetheless handy for specific situations like flushing out MG's in houses and outright killing the whole gun.) Among no longer losing whole squads due to unlucky 'RNG' when hit by a single mortar hit.

As for game play it is your simple fare, with 4 factions to start off with all mechanics for each faction are decently balanced well with no overpowering factions skewed on one side or the other(but there are notable 'unbalanced' options that exist on both allies and axis. But otherwise does not quite detract in the experiance. And some older tatcics that was annoying to face are now much more tame in this one allowing less stressful game play when fighting 'cheese' type of players(Looking at you mg34 coh2 suppressing just as soon as it shoots)

As for graphics, I have no gripes with it. Sure it may look a bit more colorful than 2 but it does fit the Mediterranean feel, the battle scarring on vehicles are really nice and animations are solid enough on most units. 

However we get to the negatives:

Balance on certain battle groups, units and the like. Now Relic has a rather interesting history with balance. Some notable unbalanced things that you can see in this game are notably DAK with the capacity to drop a 11 minute tiger for 800 manpower, planes from both British and Whermacht that can utterly kill full health tanks near instantly, AA so powerful on both sides that can virtually render planes dead in nanoseconds before they can drop air dropped units in your own base, battlegroup choices that are outright better than other choices in the same line, and some questionable skill choices for American units(SF commandos with a small close ranged 'snipe' ability to kill a single model instantly vs a time demo charge that can blow up bunkers and other hardy structures that are far more valuable) and the black Prince being a one time call in while Tigers can be replaced willy nilly when they die. 

Some quality of life changes that need to be implemented as well, unique colors should not give your allies a 'red' type of color which really screws with many people as 'red' colors dictate 'enemy' players. The friend/social system still acting off even after the beta test not being able to invite players despite them being friended and online by everyone in the lobby. 

Minor gripes

Some minor bugs are still a bit annoying, units getting stuck in terrain, units taking too long to follow a retreat command, certain abilities not informing you of drawbacks(Or being outright bugged Special operations battleground with the infantry buff preventing retreat on all infantry effected by it.) And audio bugs.

Final Conclusion:

Despite the negatives, Company of Heroes 3 is not a step back but instead a good step forward. However Relic does have a good bit of work ahead to polish the game in the coming months to rectify from glaring issues and top up some balance. But compared to their last title this has great potential to become a great RTS like Relic is known for. 

At the moment there are a lot of negative reviews, some mainly griping on super minor issues and others with valid concerns like myself. However I believe the positives outweigh the negatives so if your on the fence reading the reviews you should honestly give the game a shot and give it a go. Give the game your own shot and let your experience determine if you should stick with the game or pass. 

And a personal note for relic, remember to keep team games in mind for balance as well. But all in all well done Relic for not crushing my hopes a second time.

EDIT

As of post Operation Jackal and on May 24 2023 I can no longer recommend this game safely anymore. If you are buying this for single player you are more than welcome to but for anyone buying this for Multiplayer it is still not in the best shape of balance. It needs major polish which is slow to come out. I recommend waiting for the price to drop or waiting at last 10 months before buying this game. 

With a heavy heart I am very much disappointed with how coh3 has turned out. Currently treated as a live service game and feels more of an early access at the moment with little communication from Relic Themselves. Buy any of the precious company of heroes. Avoid this until around the start of 2024 if the ratings have improved by then and the community is not constantly ripping the game apart.

For those saying, ""the issues will be fixed"", or ""just give them some time"", I hope this puts an end to those delusions.

Sega already got it's $60-$80 from us, and more with an in-game monetized shop (which was rushed in anticipation of these layoffs, I'm sure). 

There is not only no further incentive to develop the game further, but there aren't even people around to do it.

This game was a colossal disaster. Coming from someone with over 10k hours in CoH1 (played way before it was available on Steam, and they went through several iterations as the franchise was absorbed under Sega), plus thousands of hours in CoH2, it's hard to watch my favorite franchise be ran into the ground like this.

I, like many others, pre-ordered CoH3. I played the alpha months before it came out, and it actually looked promising. However, as we got closer to launch and continued through the playtests, I realized there really was not much development happening. 

I brought new players to the game, friends who had seen my history with the franchise and made this their first purchase in the franchise. I could not be more sorry for them, not just for the money wasted, but the experience itself being such a huge letdown. 

If this series seems interesting to you, I suggest CoH2. CoH1 was a groundbreaking game, unlike any RTS at the time. It truly captured the hearts of so many for years, and the expansions were well-received, balanced, and welcome additions to the game. CoH2 is just an improved upon version of CoH1, with more adaptive gameplay, quality of life features, gameplay mechanics, customization of your armies.

CoH3 was an attempt to go back to something like CoH1, but retain the quality of life features CoH2 brought and even introduced some new ones that are helpful. However, it's an unfinished product. It's far too glitchy, crashes too often, and didn't go far enough in terms of introducing new features. Given that crashes are so common in this game more than any of its predecessors, the community was begging for a reconnect option. The community was neglected. None of the desired QoL features were implemented, and those that were, were low-priority.

tl;dr: Buy CoH2 instead on G2A.com or a similar website where you can get the game + expansions for <$10. There are more active players at any given time on CoH2 than there are CoH3 (and it's not even close, literally 10x as many people playing CoH2 at this very moment according to steam statistics).",1684960473,1684960473,False,17,0,0.537794828414916992,0,True,False,False

Recent news about the lay off of over 121 employees from Relic, will only drive more and more people away from this game. The game itself is fairly decent, however shows no innovation or drastic gameplay difference from company of heroes 2. My initial review was nothing but positivity and excitement for the future of this title, which is what stings the most about this new review. 

If you have been saving up for this game, or holding out until it matured, save your money and time.

This game is basically on the verge of a boycott, with the expensive microtransaction store, reduced support due to lay-offs, and radio silence since the announcement of restructuring their business. All of these indicators and signs are bringing back Dawn of War 3 vibes, and I really dont like that.

Relic does its best work when paired with another studio like microsoft, and we can see that love and attention in Age of Empires 4. And whilst this game definitely had that attention at the start, its becoming more and more clear that the business is more focused on meeting its profit line than it is on providing an experience for the community.

Sorry Relic, I really wish I could sing your praises, but this news and radio silence has got me questioning your commitment to the community.",1677670598,1684896397,False,0,0,0.524645745754241943,0,True,False,False

Cons:
1) I HATE being forced into Grand Strategy like Total War/Civ. I despise the level of micromanagement it takes, and taking the arbitrary points doesn't add anything to the game, it just prolongs the campaign. I just want to follow the Campaign story like the previous titles. Having this type as an OPTIONAL game mode for those that do enjoy it would have been just fine but I don't want to be forced into it.

2) Some definite refinement was skipped to get this title out. Although, this seems to be a pervasive issue across the industry as the business folks push an unfinished product. Graphical, audio, and interaction glitches are abound.

3) Microtransactions are truly a very disappointing turn here. For any reason. This game isn't free. It's at AAA pricing like everything else. Skins should be acquired through gameplay and achievements.

4) The weird loyalty system in the Campaign is utterly worthless. Just another thing to micromanage with no relevant impact on the game save some buffs and perhaps how much help you receive in the last mission.

Pros:
1) I actually didn't mind the voiceovers.

2) The actual combat and story missions are interesting and for the most part, what I expect from COH, minus the glitches and wonky balancing.",1684718987,1684718987,False,4,0,0,0,True,False,False

For online, pvp, playing with friends. This ain't it chief. 
Every aircraft call in looks like a toy plane being held by a toddler. Every gun shoots yellow tracers, tanks and arty rounds have smoke trails and travel really slow.

The game feels slow, clumsy and sluggish. What the two previous games had going, the sense of it portraying historical events and battles is gone with overly dramatic voice acting and cut-scenes that would make Netflix proud in how much it rose tints history. 

For competitive play I.E pvp actually like having commanders with different abilities. It let you bring 3 options into a game, and choose one of them later into the game, if you wanted or immediately if you had a specific build in mind. Playing less used commanders often threw opponents off their game.

1- many of the skills involved from prior COH's no longer exist

Vehicles rotate so fast that ""flanking"" to out micro a larger enemy tank is no longer viable- the bigger tank WILL win as it can rotate fast enough to keep hitting a smaller faster vehicle

Any sorta off map takes SO long to be called in, with flares, that even brand new noobs can avoid off-map strikes effortlessly (The time delay is longer than previously)

Remember in COH 1, unless you noticed immediately an off map was called, you had to retreat to save your troops? So even if it didnt hit, it likely gave you an opening to advance

Yeah, here, troops will casually walk outta the target area of any call in, not even phased, even if you are late to the action

2- Lack of any sort of valid matchmaking, meaning unless you play 1v1, you will CONSISTENTLY get clueless and useless teammates, which simply isnt worth my time.
COH 1 had a fantastic ranking system so 95% of the players in your match were similar skill- this is not the case here

The game itself delivers 4 very different factions, excellent faction design, solid balancing and great core gameplay. The snappy counter-system of the CoH-series is as good as it gets. Its great fun exploring all the different units and builds. 

Almost ironic how Relic (the developer) managed to get the difficult part (core game design) right, and lacks behind in simple features. But they seem to be aware of the (easy to fix) challenges and they re known for long-term support and improvement. 

I recommend in this rare case to rather listen to the public media reviews which consistently rate this game quite high.

This is one of the best combat-focused RTS games released in a decade. If you compare it to titles like Iron Harvest or similar – it is by far ahead in terms of gameplay depth and fun. Hope you enjoy.

Mechanically, the game is (mostly) sound. I haven't played multiplayer much so I can't vouch for balancing on anything there, but most of the units work roughly as they're meant to. This is the best thing about the game: it functions.

Graphics leave much to be desired. There are heaps of low-resolution textures on everything, from infantry models to buildings to vehicles (and yes, I do have the graphics settings up high at the very least). They only get uglier as they take damage. Even the ground looks awful compared to previous titles. And just for laughs, the M1 Carbine (the gun that US Airborne have) is apparently a bolt-action weapon..even though it wasn't in the first two games and I own one and can vouch for the fact that it isn't. The sound design is awful as well; forgettable music (which is not the case in the first two games), the quietest infantry weapons I've heard in an RTS, and recycled explosion sounds that are just louder with bigger booms.

Last but certainly not least, there is woke historical revisionism in the game. It's focused on the US; for some reason, in the US Riflemen squads, there is one black soldier. There's only ever one (tokenism much Relic?), and as far as I've seen, it's only in the Riflemen squads. The problem with this is not that I'm racist (if that's what anyone gets in their heads they're wrong), it's that the US military did not do this. Black US military units existed, I'm not denying that, but the US military did not randomly throw in a black soldier in mostly white squads. The US military was officially desegregated in 1947, two years after this war ended. To make this even worse, this appears recent, since Relic was smart enough in games 1 and 2 to not make this error. Recently it's become pretty popular to edit history for a narrative; CoH 3 is just the first thing this year to do it, and more have followed. This was done to look good to people who won't buy this anyway, nothing more. I won't even talk about the fact that the first serious update brought the in-game store and microtransactions online, since nobody likes that (myself included). Please, to any who read this, do the world a favor and don't get this game.

-The campaign is a significant step down from Ardennes Assault. The dialog is just bad. Conflict between the British and American commander is cartoonish. Mission maps feel uninspired. Setpiece battles are less impressive. AI is terrible. Objectives are often unclear-- some timed objectives are not tracked but others are. Some objectives don't make sense (""prepare anzio for capture""-- my troops reach Anzio and are blocked from attacking it?)  Points for adding a Total War-esque overworld map and another layer of strategy, but the execution is terrible. Many units (aircraft, emplacements) on the overworld map are a waste of your extremely limtied pop cap. 
-Multiplayer basically feels like COH2 but buggier, and without the different commanders, the cold mechanics, etc.
-Pop cap still 100. This alone is really disappointing.
-Basic player profile stuff from COH2 like nameplates, victory strikes, icons all missing. Players all have the same nameplate and title.
-Improperly re-used assets from COH2... the Wehrmacht grenade launcher uses the COH2 PIAT icon? What kind of alpha build nonsense is that?
-Very few maps. Multiplayer is very repetitive.
-No creative multiplayer gametypes. Would have liked to see game modes that play more with the game's mechanics; the ""rush-type"" rolling battlefield popularized by Battlefield and Isonzo might translate well here, or a defender-attacker mode that relies on defense construction mechanics. However there is none of that, just the same 3-objective capture-and-hold.
-Audio is inexcusably bad.
-No rewards or level up system.
-Core multiplayer functions like replays are missing.
-All cosmetics are microtransactions. The nerve of asking for more money from players with the game in this state is mind-boggling.

I won't get into the units and balance because that is a normal problem to have at launch for a RTS. What really feels like a slap in the face is the user interface. Lame music in the start screen with a poorly designed interface. No unit bulletins or buffs can be found, which was a unique quality from COH2 i expected see again. No replay section as well. The whole user interface feels empty. 
The skins being added in so early really added salt to the wound. Relic has an unfinished game with factions holding only 3 commanders. Small map selection with 4v4 having only a couple of maps. I know players will buy skins so whats the rush to pump them out? Not to mention the hideous skin gifted from pre-order. 
All in all I dont mind the art style and the gameplay is refreshing but its clear this game is not finished. The campaign, while ambitious, was tremendously boring. Consisting of small ai custom battles and the two most annoying generals fight over what approach to take. Buy the game when its cheaper and there is a handful of commanders.

But I've been playing COH2 up till COH3 launch and had been waiting a decade for this game. I also dont care a lick about multiplayer as I only play campaigns and AI skirmishes.

The game is fun and the graphics are fine, I feel that the hate people have against this game is a bit exaggerated.

But whenever you zoom in, the lack of polish and bugfixes clearly shows so the criticisms are not without merit. I'm not refunding because COH holds a special place in my heart and I know I'll keep playing it time to time, but those of you with less severe addiction should wait until 2025. Tbh imo this game is in a decent state for a modern release, but not the quality we should accept from AAA studios like Relic.

Also Lelic, don't ban me for voicing polite displeasure at the game, this aint your forums.

Edit: I'm sure there are many glitch compilations on youtube by now, but ""Company of Heroes 3: £70 Launch Edition"" from the youtube channel Inept is a good tangible thing to point people to on this game's release state.

Edit April 06 2023: The most visible lack of polish for me is animation. You see many units (especially if they're in the same squad) doing the same exact animation at the same time. You will also have issues building at a spot where you previously cancelled a building before. Wait, what's that I see? Oh nice, a microtransaction skin store. For SOME of the units in your faction, not even the full roster. Very niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice.

With that being said, the developers are very active and post sneak peeks of upcoming changes, fixes and updates often on twitter. The game is a work in progress and what's coming looks very promising. Initially, I'd thought of the game as an investment that would pay off and be playable later down the line.

You would think I would have learned my lesson with the pile of crap that was called DOW3.
I should have known to not trust Relic anymore to be able to develop a game for its Customers.
The campaign feels like they wanted to be a Total War game, but they failed miserably.

When you release a game it SHOULD have the cool stuff from the previous game at launch !
ranked
leaderboards
observer mode
replay system
unit crush
mg facing in buildings

What we got instead---
auto reinforce (which i love)
cosmetic store (who cares)
bugs bugs bugs
horrible pathing (unless you love spinning vehicles)
smaller playerbase than COH2 (a month after launch - is this the new DOW3 ?)

The core of the game is good, and has a ton of potential.
The problem is that this game sold as a release version at full price, and that just is not the case.
This game should have been billed as early access at best, and 1/2 the price.

The game feels like i paid to be a beta tester.

First time shame on you Relic (DOW3), and second time is shame on me (COH3).
This will probably be the last game I ever buy from Relic.
They have fallen hard since COH1 & COH2.

For what it worth I have watched the Dev live streams and map roads they have put out so hopefully they see this review.

The new campaign is 10/10, its a mix of Total War style but with the true to its roots CoH game play. I don't see what all the negative feedback is about, the units are smooth, the textures are great, game play is smooth, and the voice lines are solid. I am on turn 115 currently and have had the most fun in a CoH campaign out of all 3 games. 

The Skirmish and Coop vs AI / Multiplayer is GREAT! There is always a option for mods for maps, all units mod, and many many more to keep the game fresh, but iv'e had a great time with just the normal content. I have ran a handful of online matches and no disconnection issue and hardly any lag on multiple occasions. 

I genuinely hope that many of you read this and give the game a chance because truthfully speaking as a CoH vet...this game is in my opinion the best of the series.

I've played a few matches as the Axis and the difference is insane. I got units on the field, selected them, ordered them to destroy the unit they are meant to destroy and they do this successfully.

As the Allies my anti-tank gun gets attacked from the front by a tank, the tank takes some hits but almost no damage, then drives past my gun and destroys the entire crew. My upgraded anti-vehicle/bazooka infantry get absolutely slaughtered by the light/medium vehicles they are meant to destroy. The Allies lack any proper support weapons, apart from mortars (vickers and .30 both suck).

The only two reasons I still win matches are the amount of hours I've put into this series and the fact I only join parties and communicate via discord with people I know.

Relic has really messed up the launch of this game. Apart from gameplay there is not even a proper profile where I can see statistics or customize some medals and/or achievements to show off. They added some sort of inventory where you can equip skins for buildings, units and victory points. If only I could unlock some skins through achievements. Instead they added a store where I can buy mediocre skins for stupid amounts of money.

The biggest problem is that I'll continue playing this, knowing that it's ****. If you're looking to buy, wait for more patches and added content. Like CoH2 this will eventually get good after 3+ years.",1684189917,1684189917,False,6,0,0.539343655109405518,1,True,False,False

The battlegroups are also an absolute improvement over CoH2's commanders. With the frequent patches we have seen so far, I think CoH3 has a bright future ahead of it.

The Bad:
-Graphically unpolished.
-Planes look cartoonishly large and loiter in a pentagon-like pattern instead of a smooth circular motion. They also strafe/bomb in a check-like motion. It's embarrassing to watch in comparison to COH2.
-Vehicle pathing is awful (worse than COH2).
-Vehicles get stuck on each other.
-Hot keys are unresponsive, and commands generally feel like they have to be issued at least twice for a unit to respond.
-Single player 'Campaigns' are garbage. 
   -I like what Relic was going for with the Total War style Italian campaign, but the UI is incredibly bugged and 
    unresponsive, animations are clunky and again, it all just lacks polish.
   -I don't even know wtf Relic was going for with the Africa 'campaign.'
   -Neither campaign has anywhere near a compelling story.

The Good:
-It's another COH game, which has merit on its own. The franchise is great and I'm a huge fan, but in comparison to the 
  other COH games, this one is by far the worst.
-Improved infantry control and tactical cover.
-The unlockable abilities are much better than the old 'Generals' abilities that existed in COH2. Much more flexibility in 
 choosing which abilties to unlock throughout the match.
-Greater emphasis on light-medium vehicles, which is a nice change.
-The maps are nice, especially the Italian maps.

Update 5/13
-Hot keys are responsive now and commands do not need to be issued multiple times 
 anymore. 
-The game is still bugged. I've been trying to get through the Italian campaign but I've now had 2 skirmishes where all units become unresponsive and the AI goes brain dead. It's like everything gets stuck in neutral. Restarting the skirmish generally fixes the problem, but not every time, and I shouldn't have to do this anyway. 
-Verdict remains the same.

Verdict:
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. Wait for it to be updated, polished and fixed in the next 6-12 months. It's a huge bummer right now, but the game could achieve greatness if Relic keeps working on it.",1678043976,1684019453,False,5,0,0.534351944923400879,0,True,False,False

I have had to change my review to negative even though I still do enjoy the game, this is purely due to the lack of Map based content for multiplayer, it is a good game, however there is some serious map fatigue that needs to be addressed. as well as general balancing issues which I hope improves over time.",1677234466,1683920065,False,0,0,0.474185168743133545,0,True,False,False

The bugs are constant, the experience is shallow and unvaried, and it's continually frustrating seeing evidences of bad decisions by the developers. It's very limited for the series, regardless of the fact the other titles have been out for over a decade, they were fleshed out more at release.

I've been a fan of Company of Heroes since no1 launch.
To me, this feels a significant improvement over no 2.

Constant updates.
Good gameplay.
Fun coop skirmishes.

If I have any complaints, is that the price can maybe drop by $10 or $20.

Basic gameplay is fun, but there is not enough content to keep the game fun. Relic Entertainment has shown an incredible lack of care for the game and its players.[/i]

I loved Company of Heroes 2 and I [b]really[/b] wanted to love Company of Heroes 3 as well. Cynical about the current state of the gaming industry, but still hopeful for Relic Entertainment, I was foolish enough to buy this game for the full price on release. ""What could go wrong?"", I thought, ""They have the entirety of Company of Heroes 2 to use as reference! That game is great! This one will be better!"". I was wrong. I was so, so, wrong. And I am disappointed: with myself for buying a game early, with Relic for delivering such a shit product.
 
I've read and followed the online discussions. Forums, YouTube, Reddit (/r/companyofheroes), all that nonsense, and there seems to be a mixed reaction outside of Steam reviews. Let me be charitable: the [b]gameplay[/b] (mechanics etc.) is excellent. I can say that the foundation for an incredibly good RTS is here. In fact, and I hate to say this: Company of Heroes 3 is probably the best (recently released) RTS game out there, and will be for a long time. This frustrates me to no end, because it could have easily been so much better. 

Company of Heroes 3 has the audacity to re-use (art) assets from Company of Heroes 2 for units (and their portraits), to have a user interface which seems like it was created just a few days before release, a barely functional matchmaking system, a horrendous 'social system' for grouping up with friends, and a barely functioning 'new spin on the campaign' which, in reality, is just Ardennes Assault from Company of Heroes 2 but somehow [b]worse[/b]. But I don't care about all these things: they are matters of appearance and, at least to me, on the sideline. They are not the main issue, but they certainly radiate this lack of polish, or dare I say [b]care[/b]. The entire experience, the entire appearance of Company of Heroes 3, is one of an unfinished product. A game which was quickly slapped together (even if it wasn't!), then sold at full price. Qua appearance, Company of Heroes 3 is a slap in the face of everyone who loved Company of Heroes 2.

""But Timelord148, Company of Heroes 2 also had a shit release"". Yes! And you would imagine that Relic got their fucking act together and learned from those mistakes! I have not played Company of Heroes 2 around release, and even I know the horror stories just from a video online and some very angry men on a subreddit. Seriously, these developers (and this studio) get paid good money for the games they make (I hope) and they undergo such basic fuck ups as 'making the same mistake'? Not every lesson has to be learned twice you fucking idiots! 

But it is not even that which makes me so angry at Company of Heroes 3. The chief reason why I am telling you not to get this game, is because it is utterly devoid of content. I do not even want to start up the game to look at the amount of maps, so these numbers aren't exact, but the amount of maps per gamemode (4v4, 3v3 especially) are only one or two per mode. Even in the 2v2 and 1v1 modes (which I predominantly play(ed)) the amount of content is horrid. The game [b]has no content[/b]. There's four factions, but if you are planning on being remotely competitive then there are only two usable factions: Wehrmacht and USF. Every faction has only three battlegroups, with clear 'best picks'. Obviously you could attempt niche strategies or play for fun, but I reckon that winning (or at least a fair fight, the ability to win) is a major contributor to playing for fun. 

So here we have Relic being called out for a lack of content, and what do they do? They shove the worst, most hamfisted fucking monetisation update into their game in one of the first major updates! And, in line with the rest of their user interface, it looks like ass! It introduces challenges to obtain the ""free currency"" with objectives such as 'build 50 grenadiers'. What is the most efficient way to achieve this? Spam grenadiers. Throw your game(s), but get the currency. In theory, this can absolutely destroy games: you troll your own team (if you play in 2v2+), but your enemy also a bad game. I have no idea if this actually happened, but I can imagine it, and that is enough for me. 

Seriously: community modders (re)made maps (from previous games) and they were used in ""pro play"" within a week or so! I am absolutely certain that modders will provide entire new factions and/or battlegroups before Relic does. In fact: if I checked, I would probably find them. I am just too frustrated with this game to check. Relic, up until this point, has just proven that [b]they do not care[/b].

I am biased. I loved Company of Heroes 2. I am emotional, because I had such high expectations of this game. I might even be acting privileged, because I have no idea how making games works. Still: I have a right to be upset, I paid €60,- for this game and it has been nothing but a disappointment after the hype wore off. 

Company of Heroes 3 has the foundations in order and has the potential to be a great game. Basic gameplay is fun, but there is not enough content to [b]keep[/b] the game fun. Relic Entertainment has shown an incredible lack of care for the game and its players. I hope that Relic gets their act together, I truly do: I want to love Company of Heroes 3. I will return after x amount of updates, and I hope I will be able to change my review then.

Naturally, I had to pre-order the game because I was excited, despite my reservations after the Multiplayer Stress Test just a month before launch. The game then felt unfinished, unpolished. But it was a stress test, surely Relic would've spent the time after the stress test to iron out all the highlighted issues right? Wrong! At launch, the game had most of the issues from the stress test intact, and many still persist 3 weeks after launch. 

The UI literally feels like it's been done by an intern. Overlay menus don't have buttons to close them. The game still uses incorrect placeholder icons, many from COH2. Pathing is terrible. The Aircraft animations are a literal meme. It's clearly obvious that it's been rushed and is no where near complete. And what's worse is that they don't even offer regional pricing.

In its current state, I don't think this game is worth the 60 USD price tag.

Fantastic game. I am loving the new quality of life changes and slightly slower Time to Kill of this version over CoH2. I also love the return of Battlegroups from CoH1.

Game has some balance issues in multiplayer, but Relic is already issuing a patch so it’s good to know they’re listening. Outside of a few cheese strats in large team games that will be patched, the game feels mostly balanced between the factions.

Currently there are not a huge number of multiplayer maps for a specific mode, eg 3v3 has 3 while 4v4 has 2, there are a good deal of maps overall. Play all the modes to get the full experience and more maps will come in time.

Finally we have a new game that's half decent. Enjoy!",1683702319,1683702319,True,4,2,0.498673349618911743,0,True,False,False

- Completely amateur sound design. Effects volumes are completely out of balance to each other, some small arms sound like staple guns, others are deafening. Sounds also don't reflect distance. In previous COH games sound effects were very sharp when close to the camera, then became duller/faded with increasing distance (like the real world). No such affect here. After relying on this and other cues in Coh1/2 to absorb information, it's noticeably harder to maintain situational awareness in COH3.

- All round unresponsive controls.

Too many bugs, even GAMEBREAKING bugs in campaign - had to ALT+F4 the game a few times as it was the only option, thankfully there are alot of autosaves & I didn't loose any progress.
It really feels like they didn't do any sort of testing or simply ignored any sort of feedback from the testers, since alot of small bugs are so plain to see.

The campaign is very disappointing - best way to describe it is GENERIC, especially the mission objectives. While I like the idea of an ""Total War""-style campaign map, it's pretty shallow in comparison and gets boring quickly. But the biggest issue are the ""handmade story missions"" which should be the main part people care about in a singlerplayer campaign. They are VERY similiar to the random skirmishes in design and lack interesting objectives. Really just feels like a skirmish with some additional secondary objectives... Wth devs?!
Some missions were not working properly because they didn't count in certain aspects of specific units/companies you can bring along...
The ""dynamic"" aspect of the campaign has a few things that need improvement. The random skirmishes you encounter are super repetitive (there is like 3 different types that keep repeating over and over again) and you are somewhat forced to play them out yourself as the ""auto-resolve"" feature is useless because it always give you a 50-50 chance regardless of your skill as player or the units skill level, which is quite annoying after a few dozen skirmishes that all feel and play the same.

Huge flaws, many many visual bugs, and terrible pathfinding - are you a fan of watching your vehicles driving reverse for miles, thus with their rear facing towards the enemy? Or squads getting stuck on random objects/cover or simply refusing to follow your orders... And oh lord the absolute ugliest UI / HUD I've seen in a long time. It's the sort of UI you usually only see during testing an alpha / beta version of the game & later is replaced by some professional reworked interface.

And as others pointed out, the sound design is weak and lacks powerful weapon & explosion sounds. And the battle chatter of units should have the factions native language (e.g. German soldiers speaking German), blows my mind that they didn't do this!

Since there is still good parts to it and it can be fun, I'd just recommend to wait for a sale on this",1683037084,1683529882,False,7,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First off, let me say that the absolute gall of the game developers to try and paint the allied forces in a bad light on par with the national socialists during the north african campaign is absolutely despicable. The British Royal Air Force, not shockingly, did not have smart bombs to discriminately target Benghazi during air raids. If you thought woke politics wouldn't enter the sphere of WW2, and think that this is merely a storytelling device, head on over to their discord and see some of the taglines under creator's and others' names. Their only shame is not being able to add more pronouns to their pronoun picker. Absurd. 

Secondly, this is an unfinished and unpolished game. I should not be surprised because that's just what companies do now:

* Entire sections of the game that were not functional at launch now are! Except that they updated the paid store microtransaction portion of the game. This game was clearly not released in a full state.
* Unskippable and extremely long non-progress saveable features of the single player campaign are a huge waste of time. 
* Multiple things are missing/broken from multiplayer:
      - You cannot change anything about your profile, as that section of the game also doesn't exist; everyone is stuck with the same title and icon.
      - The stats section of the game once its finished is wonky at best and inaccurate at worst. 
        At the end of matches you will randomly be taken out of the stats roll-up for no reason, 
        extremely annoying when you want to check what worked and what didn't. 
      - Ranked play is unavailable, ELO is hidden. 
      - Custom matchmaking is non-existent
      - There are two maps - **2** maps - for each play type of 3vs3 and 4vs4, how this is 
         possible with such a long development time is beyond me. 
      -  An easy multiplayer exploit on day 1 hasn't been patched in, as soon as you see a 
         certain piece of equipment being deployed you just exit out of the match.
      - Multiplayer patch updates for strength of unit balance swings wildly. 
* The graphics are straight from 2008. Seriously bad. The camera zoom is a little absurd, but doable. For a game released in 2023 you'd expect more. Graphical glitches abound, from tank skins just going mute black, to vehicles having seizures because they're stationed on a slight bump, to animations not working whatsoever or stunting to the point of not working (Fire the effing panzershreck instead of constantly inching forward and re-doing your fire animation every time you even slightly shift position!). 

This is not a game you should buy, these are not developers or a company you should support.

I also didn't like coh2's gameplay over the first game, but this game feels much closer to the coh1 feel with a fresher look and unit changes.

The AI's not perfect by any means, feels less aggressive overall than coh1 even on the third of four difficulties, and who thought it was a good idea to have matchmade coop stuck on the medium difficulty???

Bottom line, I didn't even notice the store was in place, and I have no intention of making use of it now that I know.  The limited starting battle groups are a bit disappointing but for that delicious coh PvE that I love so much, this game refreshes that gameplay for me in a big way.

New units are cool with a few new ones.  Been waiting for an Italian and North Africa campaign set for a while now and I am glad they visited it this time around.  Would like to see Pacific Theater next.

The bad... the main bug I have come across is when completing a mission, the game just sits there with no control over your units and the campaign level you're on doesn't exit/advance to the next phase or back to the campaign map.  I have to use TM to kill the game and go play something else.  Hopefully they patch this soon because I have always loved this series.

Also, the load a saved game feature is weird to me.  I cannot find a LOAD saved game option anywhere.  I have to select Resume and it starts me all over for that certain mission.  I can then hit ESC and select LOAD from where I saved off ( I save occasionally).

As a big fan of COH 2, I knew I would likely enjoy this installment as well. COH 3 has a different feel compared to its predecessor. It reminds me of BFV. While it may not quite capture the essence of the original COH 1, I still find it enjoyable to play.

Graphics: The textures, animations, and physics have all seen upgrades compared to COH 2. Explosions might not be as massive as in COH 1, but the smoke effects and destruction are more impressive. The color palette leans towards a more cartoonish style, similar to the transition from BF 1 to BF V. However, you can easily make the visuals more realistic using Nvidia Freestyle.

Sound: The game utilizes a war tape sound design, which isn't as cinematic as Hollywood-style audio, but still provides a unique and immersive experience.

Gameplay: The Spearhead III mod enhances realism and fun, making the gameplay even more engaging.

I've enjoyed the two campaigns so far and I was stoked that one of them was akin to the COH2 campaign Ardennes Assault. The maps that are there are really fun to play. It's nice we have a mix of desert maps and Italy maps. The graphics are beautiful and the sound is nice.

That being said there is a lot of work that needs to get done to get this better than COH2.

* More maps
* Rework of the reward system. COH2 was nice in that at least when you played, you also gained something after a match. It feels bad to play an hour long game and not get closer to any of the rewards. Even if it's lesser amount than the achievements, it'd be nice.
*More battlegroup variation. I wish there were more battlegroups to expand the play styles.
* Ability to choose AI difficulty in bot match. I liked being able to queue up expert bot matches in COH2. In COH3, when you queue for a bot match it will only be on hard difficulty. If you want to play with other players vs expert bots, you need to create a custom game and wait for the lobby to fill.
* Post game stats in COH2 was much more flushes out. This one seems a little half baked.

This was a strong game. Ignore the haters that said it's not enough of an upgrade, I'd never played any previous version and this was a good mix of command and conquer meets Total War.

The guided campaign seemed incredibly short, but decent.

The conquest mode is attempting to be total war, and I thought it was a great concept to build on. 

Basically, you are attempting to retake Italy from the Nazis, and you play in a similar way as total war where you have different battalions you can move a certain amount per turn, and then battle other forces on the map or in towns.

The only cons are that there is no real city management, and the diversity of maps is limited.

For example, on one type of map you are to ""control certain points"" to limit the enemy's supplies. Once you do, you've won the battle. So I simply rushed the two undefended points as soon as the battle started and won easily.

That's why there needs to be more map/terrain types.

Soldier and vehicle variation is good.
Overall it's a step in a Very promising direction, but they need to make it harder and have a bigger world map to conquer. 

The addition of city management and the above would make it compete with Total War.",1683323778,1683323778,True,0,1,0.448684900999069214,0,True,False,False

Long-term Company of Heroes fan review: Very disappointed. COH 1 & 2 are my favorite games, with more hours in it then any other games I've played. I was very excited for this release, anticipating a fresh take on the classic, with what I thought would a decade of creative work. It's still COH so it can be fun. But the game feels like totally unfinished cheap reskin. Hopefully they put some work in and give it some strong updates/overhaul. It says a lot that COH2 has more primetime players each day. I feel ripped off. After 100 hours in I decided to uninstall. Tired of trying to force myself to like it and have fun. 

Pros: New skill trees add good diversity to the game. Between command center upgrades and the ability to select commander bonuses, you can really change up your play style! Squad models are delightfully high in detail with a nice set of dialogue and cosmetic actions. Units jump over obstacles, YES! Makes the gameplay more engaging and fun, however units occasionally get stuck on obstacles which seems to be a symptom of the new mechanics. Some vehicles can tow team weapons which is awesome! Units can ride on some tanks which is really cool, too! Unit models and vehicles look good.

Cons: There are only 2 maps for each multiplayer game mode. The explosion and weapon sounds are horrible compared to COH2. Unsure if it was intentional, but there seems to be a significant delay from input to action (running RTX 3070 45 GB RAM). The pathing somehow is worse than COH2 from retreats to commands. Moving team weapons is a nightmare compared to COH2, again unsure if this was intentional. The explosion graphics are arguably worse than the previous games as well.

- Graphics somehow managed to look worse than a game back in 2013 (CoH2).

- Sound is very 2D/low quality, sounds like it was recorded on a mobile phone, not much better than that of a browser game...

- Camera movement, lord in heaven, this camera is like a greased lightning. Turning down the sensitivity barely does anything. The zooming is atrocious.

- Stale campaign, but better than the generic Normandy landing that every other fucking WW2 game does.

- Gameplay is somewhat of an improvement, runs pretty well too.
 

However,the thing that ticked me off the most here is the """"""""Italian"""""""" faction. This is a game centered around the fronts that the Italians fought in, so here's the question: WHERE IS THE ITALIAN FACTION?
They shoehorned the Italians (a major force in the Mediterranian front) into the other factions, WHY THE FUCK ISN'T ITALY AN INDEPENDENT FACTION?

Overall, unfinished product that should've been in the oven for longer, if the devs remedy the things I've mentioned, the game could be a solid buy. The Steam Workshop is a welcomed addition too.

The more I play CoH3 the more the imbalance between the factions become clear. 
Examples:
I play German factions and many times I throw grenades at enemy troops with barely any effect while enemy grenades often nearly take down an entire squad of mortar, MG or other units. Another example are the weak Afrika Korps Panzer. Most of the time I don't dare sending them into battle because those tanks are so fragile, yet the main tank of this faction, is it not? Another case is when I use bombs (using one of the battlegroup abilities) often they don't have any effect on enemy troops either while some of the allied artillery shots, bombs or missiles seem to have the power of nuclear bombs taking out entire tanks (maybe even more than one) and nearly everything around it. 

To put it in a nutshell:
I often shook my head in situations as described above. For me it reduces the fun because I know that some of the units in the rooster are simply obsolete. I am already thinking of quitting after just a few weeks. 
I also think that the price for this game is ridiculously expensive. Way overpriced for a product that can be delivered online. The company even saves on distribution costs and the production of CDs etc. yet games become more expensive. 
Does this make sense?

UPDATE:
After a few more weeks and the latest update by Relic I decided to quit this game. After the update today it seemed as if the fallschirm pioneers of the wehrmacht have become obsolete. For instance I had three squads fight one american squad of 6 soldiers and the three fallschirm pioneer squads couldnt take them out even though two of them were behind cover, too. Those american squads were mowing through my troops like a knife through butter. Ridiculous.

Also it seems as if the team matches are unfair. Why? Because teams where the members know each other play random teams where players dont know each other. Obviously the random team is at a big disadvantage and in most cases when I am in a random team playing against teams like that we loose. I literally lose 9 out of 10 games with these teams almost every day. 

Needless to say that for me it dosn't have anything to do with fun anymore. I just want to play other players with my mediocre skill level but that is hardly the case ever.",1682804060,1683151062,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

To their credit, Relic has been communicating about their intentions, failures, and priorities, but it will be too little too late. They have lost the goodwill of the player base. 

Single-player is easy and boring. The ""Total War"" style campaign map was a novel idea, but it is absolutely ruined by poor game mechanics and a simple AI. After completing one play-through, there is little incentive to play again. 

Multiplayer is frustrating at its best. I can count the matches that I have enjoyed on one hand. Relic has failed to properly balance the game. They are playing catch up with game mechanic issues and bugs, some of which caused balancing issues. What balancing they have applied is heavy handed and without foresight.  Players will drop from matches after they lose their first engagement, or for whatever arbitrary reason they are frustrated with. There is no punishment for dropping out of games, and a ""surrender"" option is not available. Matchmaking is an erratic mess of poorly matched ELOs.

I can no longer recommend COH3 to people, instead of addressing key feedback, Relic has priotised money shop over key features like replays and the godawful sound design. Game is doomed if it continues like this.

[h1] Flawed but Fun[/h1]
These are my first impressions from the time I spent here and the techtests/beta before, for context I have played a been a fan of most of Relic's RTS games with about 3000 hours played across COH1 and COH2 and two decades of experience playing strategy games. I mostly play these games for the competitive 1v1 experience but will try my best to measure the game based on what I have played (1v1s, 2v2s, skirmishes with the AI and about half of the Italian SP campaign.) Personally I cautiously recommend it for [i]most[/i] strategy fans however I must say you have got to be ready for what you are in for, no harm waiting 6 months for the issues I will talk about to be fixed, its very similar to the situation with AOE4 were the game has come out half baked but with a foundation for a fun game.

[h1] Things I like:[/h1] 
-Single Player: the extra effort this game has on the campaign shows, the 2 campaigns seem very good with a mix of scripted missions and skirmishes with mutators kind of like Relic's better SP campaigns (Ardennes Assault and DOW:Dark Crusade.) There is a lot of choice with how to play and I think I could get some extra playthroughs of it. The Tactical Pause feature while I dont use it seems like a really interesting new way to play and I am sure some people can make use of it. The historical representation in these campaigns seems better than 1 and 2 with civilian stories and overlooked fronts in the war (eg Italy) and I think that's neat. I do have issues with some of the scripting and balance of the campaign which I will talk about later but the core is good.

-Release Factions: Having 4 factions on release I think was the right decision, theres a good variety between them and the new units have unique places in each army. 

-Graphics: I do notice some of the graphical problems, not sure if its the setup I have but some of the shots in cutscenes and realtime battles are unusually bright. Overall though I like the new art direction, COH2's more grounded colour palate never really worked with me outside of some of the snow maps, the more stylised equipment and uniforms help them pop out from the amazing environment designs. Oh explosions dont look great but thats a minor issue to me personally.

-Optimisation: This game runs better day 0 than COH2 has ever run on my computer, very impressed with this aspect of the game launch and pleasantly surprised considering how unstable 2 could get. Hell I could even theoretically run this on 4K on my midrange PC which is cool.

-Quality of Life: Rebindable hotkeys???? I actually cheered when I read that, never really taken a liking to grid hotkeys so it was 3rd party software to enjoy 2 for me. Workshop support too which is nice.

-Its still COH: I mean yeah? I am an addict to the squad based RTS format, some cool things have been done to shake this up (elevation, battlegroups, towing heavy weapons and breaching) but it still is feeling fresh and fun. Can't really find myself putting it down too long for this reason tbh.

[h1] Things I don't like:[/h1] 

-Sound: I know a lot of people are talking about this but it really needs to be said that this games sound design is diabolically bad. Disappointed the devs lied about it being fixed in the live version too which was an unnecessary rub in the wound for people who cared about this stuff. Effects are super underwhelming, abilities and vehicles seem to have no weight (no more shitting yourself hearing your opponents King Tiger rolling towards you through the fog of war or hearing your scout car hum filled with flamers down a road.) Machine guns can be barely heard not the beasts they were in 1 and 2, grenades sound like firecrackers and gone are the *bang* from mines goes off. I lose squads sometimes cos I don't even know they are underattack barely off camera. This needs to be fixed ASAP if I am to definitively recommend this game as its honestly embarrassing to release with it, real shame too cos I actually like the voice acting and dynamic music.

-Polish and Bugs: I think this is the part that is driving people up the wall the most, when im playing theres lots of moments where I am like ""why isnt this in?"" Short list of examples include: replays, UTX design, MP leaderboards, ingame report/mute feature, angling machine guns in buildings, unit command bugs, campaign save bugs, zoom level being in too close for the tall ambient buildings egeg. Other people have covered these better but I think I can summarise these as the game coming out half baked.

-MP Experience:
I have only really played a few games against people who were not completely new to the game so this section you have to take a pinch of salt. The readdition of callin tanks and economic abilities into COH3 I don't think is a good idea, especially in 2v2+ where such strategys seriously break the pace and flow of the game. Although they wound it back in the first patch I think its only going to cause more problems as the community gets the hang of the game. There is other balance problems but I think they will be easier to fix, mainly DAK vehicle spam being hard for US to handle and plane loiters being too powerful. In addition the maps on release pretty heavily vary in quality and are few in number. Some of the team maps in particular are comically imbalanced (cutoffs with exposed cover on one side of the map, plentiful green on the other) and leads to short games. Elevation in particular seems to be a problem point as well with varying degrees of quality.

Unit pathing seems good with the infantry with them spreading out a bit more weakening the wipe potential of explosive shells and tanks but with tanks it seems much worse. This combined with the removal of crushing and heavy crush (another bad decision) and the poor sound design makes tank control feel floatly and non-responsive rather than powerful and fun. This is another area I hope they work on soon. 

-Single Player Scripting and Balance:
So during my Italian campaign I noticed a few things, first of all the ""total war"" german map AI is far too passive, only really sending out scout planes and scripted attacks. This problem is made worse by how the map seemingly discourages direct engagements with powerful barrages, calldowns and static emplacements that seem to do far more damage to my companies than the realtime battles. This is a contrast to other dynamic campaigns Relic has released were previously mundane skirmishes were made much more interesting by the presence of an enemy ""commander"" (this games equivalent would be companies) were they would be some interesting diaglogue or special units you have to deal with. In addition the realtime battle AI is painfully easy to cheese, I had to make a meaninful effort not to cheese it or most of my battles would be over within 5 minutes with upgraded infantry available from minute 0. This games skirmish AI seems much more stable though so if you wanna comp stomp with a modded version this is probably a safe game when those mods start to pop up though.

As for the campaign scripting I found it unnecessarily poorly scripted, the map is slow to work with and is begging for a ""fast enemy movements"" to save myself from 5 minutes of end turn movements as the AI fruitlessly sends another ton of scout planes at me. Companies take or avoid damage from static emplacements seemingly at random and don't move around as cleanly as say a Total War army would. The navys also seem like an afterthought with Italian Destroyers getting stuck in out of bounds locations and coastal batteries not firing.",1677437828,1683046222,False,1,0,0.522613048553466797,0,True,False,False

TLDR: GAME IS GREAT. There are some bugs (see other reviews), but it's a step ahead of the old COHs at least. Singleplayer in particular is god tier.

I really don't understand the hate that this game is getting. I came to the reviews expecting to see 75%-90%, but instead saw a 54%. I was SHOCKED. I'm assuming those who don't recommend it have not played the previous COHs, or maybe opinions that contradict mine exist (lol), but I've had nothing but fun with this game. The bugs I've seen aren't even game breaking or immersion breaking imo, it's just something I look at and go ""oh lol what the heck"" and move on after 3 seconds. What makes this game good to me is the MUCH better graphics and audio quality than the old games along with the MANY QOL features and dynamic single player campaign. This game will be even better with mods when they come in, so honestly I have no cons for this game other than a few meaningless bugs here and there.

Remember COH 2 launched with just two. Each faction feels very unique and I am glad they listened to the community and finally added italian units. At launch single player was a little buggy with the dynamic campaign but the linear german campaign was very smooth. I feel for how much hate this game is getting and really wish people bombing this beloved franchise would understand how much work and effort goes into creating this game. Too often people take for granted what COH2 offers. I have played countless WW2 rts and fps games and the realism this franchise offers is unlike anything else, not to mention the mechanics being pretty user friendly when compared to say Men of War and Call to Arms. 

Also I would like to point out to people as well that COH2 took a very very long time to get to where it is now and was no where near where COH3 is now shortly after launch. I look forward to seeing what the developers do with DLCs and please continue to support this game and follow it up with content. This game can evolve I believe to eclipse COH2 with more DLC and further updates. 

For people hating on the addition of the store I get it but also understand these games require funding and I like that it gives you an option to grind for skins in a way that is better than COH2's loot system. The assignments are fun and encourage you to play different factions and try different builds. 

For the current balance of the game I'd say its in a decent spot the germans for once don't absolutely dominate. Though DAK could use some tweaks there early game is very very difficult. The US and British factions are a ton of fun and I really like that Relic has improved light vehicle game play and has made them viable even into mid game/early late game. I feel like they have learned a lot of lessons from previous titles and once you find solid builds every faction feels evenly matched. I also like the in game upgrade systems so that your infantry in particular scale better into late game. 

This game was certainly expensive I got the premium edition at full price. But I am happy to support this small studio and my favorite RTS franchise so overall I'd say it was worth it. The graphics are nice and contrary to what people say I do see an improvement, the textures and art style are just different and less gritty than COH2.

Keep in mind I have not played multiplayer. CoH3 has its flaws, but in the end I had fun and I appreciate the ambition of the dynamic campaign over a more traditional CoH experience. 

The good: 

The dynamic campaign took me about 26 hours to complete on standard difficulty. During my time on the overland map, I strategized, conducted support missions, and moved my forces. During combat encounters, there was a decent variety of skirmishes with varying objectives as well as scripted missions. 

The strategic map was neat. I enjoyed slowly capturing southern Italy town by town in the style of Total War or other grand strategy games. There is something immensely satisfying about it, and I really liked plotting my next move on the grand map. 

I found the variety of combat mission to be satisfying and engaging. You never had the same battle twice. Even if a map was recycled, the various skirmish objectives kept things feeling fresh. The scripted missions were generally fun and engaging. 

The skirmish battles, albeit easy on the standard difficulty, were really the bread and butter of the game. I found my self playing more of them than scripted missions, and they were very enjoyable. 

Company customization is a neat feature. As companies level up, you can choose from a wide variety of upgrades, support features, and advanced units for the company to have. Some companies I specialized to be more tank heavy, while others I made to be more support power focused, and customization of the companies kept things feeling fresh, as different companies fielded different units and abilities. 

Some complain about the graphics and recycled assets, but I generally paid no mind to that. To me, the game looked and sounded good enough. 

Coordinating my bombers and navy on the strategic map was fun, it was satisfying to see them make an impact in the grand scheme. 

The destruction physics were neat. Definitely noticeable. 

The bad:

Not being able to save during the combat encounters was frustrating. Sometimes I cant game for an hour straight, so it kept me from playing when I had fewer than 30 minutes to play. Its not a big deal, but not great either. 

Enemy AI is bad. In combat encounters It makes questionable decisions and frequently fails to put up a good fight. On the strategic map, it mostly throws units at your starting city, ignoring towns, airfields, and other undefended places along the way. It made it so I was not playing much defense except for a small portion of the map. 

The type of company you are controlling on the strategic map doesn’t really translate into the combat encounters. For example, if I move an armored company into a combat encounter, I spawn with the same infantry units that I would if I had moved a paratrooper company into that encounter. I get that the customization of those units makes a difference, but it would be neat to at least have different spawning units for the different companies. 

Some of the strategic map mechanics don’t make sense. I was generally swimming in all resources except ammunition. Each unit can fully heal or repair it-self each turn using a small amount of manpower, so it generally was easy to keep all my companies at full health. I could charge my paratrooper unit past a defensive machine gun emplacement, take damage, immediately heal that damage, and then attack my objective with full health. Why even have the machine gun emplacement there then? 

Microtransactions. They don’t impact the single player but its still sad to see. 

Balancing issues. I know its hard to balance a game with so many units but some units are just obvious choices. Mortars are a bit too useful, recon squads seem to be a waste of unit capacity. 

In conclusion, it might not live up to its predecessor at launch, but I appreciated its ambitious blend of grand strategy and squad-based tactics gameplay. Keep an eye on this game, as I am sure it will continue to be supported and will only get better and better.",1682740222,1682775720,True,63,19,0.64024055004119873,0,True,False,False

I've strictly been playing single player and casual online comp stomps with friends, hoping to recapture some of the fun we had playing the heck out of CoH1 at LAN parties and such. So far, so good!

The gameplay is a blast, and conducive to great, almost cinematic moments, just like the first game. Battles are dynamic, with an environment that evolves as it's destroyed and new defenses are built, and a front line that's constantly shifting. The game is flexible enough to reward both aggression and defensive postures, provided they are executed with some thought. Units are mostly effective in the ways you'd expect them to be, and can be pushed above and beyond with a bit of micro attention. The four factions all feel pretty distinct, and they and their three-each battlegroup offerings make for a lot of toys to play with. The AI isn't Deep Blue, but it can put up a challenge when it's asked to. Netcode and optimizations seem solid. Even for the absolute potato machine in our group, 3v3 online comp stomps run fine on the largest maps.

The single player Italy campaign has a bit of a Total War feel to it, with an overworld map that has you capturing territory, upgrading units and towns with additional abilities, building outposts to support real time battles, etc. It's maybe not as intricate as the Total War games, but it feels pretty ambitious for a more traditional RTS, and it nicely complements the more complex real time combat of CoH. For those real time battles, there seem to be a bunch of different missions structures that, so far, feel appropriate to the overworld conditions of the fight. These combine with the different company types, upgrade trees, and strategic assets to make each battle feel pretty fresh. The UX on the strategic map could use a bit of polish, but this mode has been a lot of fun, and I hope they release more of these campaigns. (I can't speak to the Africa campaign yet, but I'll update if I play it.)

I wouldn't complain about a few more maps, the ability to zoom out a bit further during real time play, or some kind of camera control during the AI's strategic turns in campaign mode. Those are genuinely my biggest gripes at this point though. The microtransactions are a bit of a turn off, but they're cosmetic, and they're tucked away, so ignoring them is easy. I'm sure there are balance issues that are affecting the PvP crowd. There always are, and I'm sure they'll work on them over time, but they aren't affecting me at the moment. The menu UI could be a little bit prettier, but it's functional, and I'm not sitting on the menus anyway, so I don't really care.

Honestly, this is the most fun I've had with an RTS game in a while, and that's not even mentioning the map editor, with probably the best public developer tool documentation I've ever seen, and the beginnings of mod support right out of the gate. I would encourage anyone who's curious to look beyond the brigade of negativity on this storefront, perhaps to some of the more even-keeled articles or video reviews out there. I hope the developers can see past this initial reaction, give this thing what polish it needs, and then support it for a long time.",1680324825,1682755919,True,3,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There is a real-time strategy part of the game for battles and a turn-based strategy part for the campaign map. I saw a gameplay demo that showed units using various types of terrain and buildings as cover. I was quite excited about that concept. And the first few hours playing were promising.

However, after a few hours, it turns out that there isn't that much strategy to the real time part. You need a mix of units, but it's not a fun formula like paper-rock-scissor for other games. (That's where one unit's weakness feeds and another unit whose weakness feeds another unit.) It's more like armored vehicles take out infantry real well. Armored vehicles are weak against a few special units. Like there is an anti-tank gun. However, if you have the armored vehicle drive in a circle around the anti-tank gun, the anti-tank gun will continuously try to set up for the new direction and never fire. It's nothing like Total War, where you set up a great battle line and have various tactical goals during the battle.

The campaign map is very boring. The only thing you can do is pick your next target. The upgrades for buildings are quite inconsequential and without much impact.

The terrible part is that the real-time battles become very repetitive quickly. I have a recipe that works each time. There is one type of battle that's about controlling territory quickly. I have a build sequence for troops. I send them out as quickly as possible. Usually, when there is the first combat contact, that's a great point to draw all the enemy units to. If you use protection like buildings, machine gun/mortar installations, or armored vehicles, you'll chew up the oncoming units like assembly work.

There is another type of mission that's about conquering territory without a base. That's usually solved by slowly advancing an armored vehicle. That way, the armored vehicle only encounters one or two units at a time and chews through them.",1682721577,1682721577,False,6,0,0.501424491405487061,0,True,False,False

This game lacks - leagues, player ranking or some other mechanism for tracking player progress - or its not working.
Sometimes you just steam roll through other players, next time you get steam rolled - it rarely is even fight.

There is too much great players that just wrecks you from the beginning.
If you are beginner or even mediocre player - you will get frustrated in this game.

As a result player base drops significantly. Probably some veterans will be left here for long run.

- imbalanced. The answer to every single situation in the campaign is hordes of infantry with a medical vehicle. If there's an MG add one armored car. Done. I felt like there was zero pressure to do anything else even when I was using an armored company.
- AI absent. Both in the campaign map and in battles, they just storm head on into whatever you have. Up the difficulty simply means they have more resources.
- With all the possibilities you have in the campaign map, it seems completely overloaded and many of the mechanics are barely explained, have no tooltips or are just kind of there without any explanation at all.

This game is in every way better than CoH2, and represents a steady progression of improvement by the series, down to the user interface and the graphics. The Americans feel better and so do the British. They feel more real as the game is set more of during a specific time and theater in the war and is better for it. Each stage of progression through each path feels valid.

The bad:
- Balance issues are present. I find the German artillery to be overpowered in comparison to that of the US and UK forces.
- It's more of a minor issue, but I was hoping for a heavy armour anti tank option for the US. Though considering such options were not available en mass at this stage in WWII, it is acceptable from a historical accuracy perspective. 
- In the Italian campaign overview mode, I just don't see the point in having supply emplacements, the unit population cost is prohibitively high, and with the amount of airfields dotted about the map, why opt for spending a lot of resources on an aircraft carrier?
- Command points in battles seem to have little to no use
- The variety of game types (capture the flag, annihilation, attrition) cannot be selected and if, like me, you don't like the attrition or capture the flag styles, this can be annoying. I like long running battles, damn it!

The grey area:
- Yes, you can purchase aesthetic skins in game, though that's not really my thing. I like the standard skins that come with the base game. But that's no different to COH 2 and not detrimental from my perspective, so I don't know why there are so many reviews trying to incite lynch mobs to take up arms over it.
- You have no ability to select or purchase different battlegroups (in COH 2 these would be 'commanders') in skirmish/online games. Though there does seem to be the footwork put in place for later content releases, but why not implement these at release? But there is enough variety currently to keep me entertained, so this neither a + or a -.

The good:
- The Italian campaign brings in a 'Total War' style of game play with an overview of the area of operations, which I massively approve of. 
- I don't know if it is just me, but the survivability of the US Sherman tanks in the campaign modes have been improved versus COH 2.
- My PC is fitted with an 11400F CPU, a 4080 OC GPU, and I use a 60hz monitor with FPS limited to 60 accordingly. COH 2 barely ran above 35 FPS when set to max settings on 4k. With the same settings on COH 3, there is no issue hitting the FPS limit no matter how many units are on the field.
- Speaking of graphics, it is a beautiful game!
- Firing from an elevated position, this puts your troops in a position where they take less damage, and those they are attacking take more. 

I'm sure there are points I'm missing, but these are the main ones, and as I said, no I'm not dissatisfied with the game. Yes, it is rough around the edges and maybe it should have had more time being spent on the finishing touches before release, but the same was said about COH 2 before it, and I have racked up 1000 hours on that and still love it.",1682309085,1682309085,True,1,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The Bad: The multiplayer balance is absolute TRASH in this game but otherwise it's kind of fun. The game heavily favors the Germans at literally every level of the game and on every map and devs just do not care about balancing it.

Overall, a lukewarm experience - plays similar to previous games and will be familiar to people who have played the franchise - this may be a bad thing - the game gets boring pretty quickly.  Not as fun as COH1 or the men of war series or the newish gates of hell game.


Biggest High Point:

The tactical campaign is a refreshing add and I've played it quite a bit - if they expanded on this  I could see it growing into a more robust experience. Right now it is kind of buggy and feels half-baked at times. The dialog and 'branching choices' are annoying though. 


Some Low Points:

The game is buggy. 

While I don't hate the idea of the cosmetics shop, I do not like that currency cannot be earned in skirmish play. Big wiff here for Relic.

There aren't enough maps to keep the game fresh - especially when playing comp stomps or skirmish games. Hopefully the community will make enough to keep the game going.

The 'breach' feature is horrible - a 'press button to win' system that does not belong in this game. This isn't advanced squad leader - this is a real time strategy games - please relic no more dumb features like this.

The overall story wrapper for the game tries to focus on the victims of war - sometimes doing so in a way that it feels like Relic is apologizing for making a war game. The story is weak and pandering and so misaligned with the game and, at times, seems like the game is scolding you for playing it. Relic should eject whatever designer/producer/director that put that brainfart in the game. Either make a WW2 game or don't - we didn't make you choose the subject - if you feel bad about making a war game, then don't, but don't scold your players.

Not enough innovation or attention to what COH players want to bridge the 10 year gap between COH2 and 3.",1682292617,1682294913,True,1,2,0,0,True,False,False

Devs currently don't do balance tweaking. They absolutely nerf the heck out of anything they perceive to be ""overperforming"" - the latest British changes are a great example.

Campaign Map: the campaign was enjoyable, I liked the dialogue and story. It had a pretty map with some fun missions. The only issue I have with the campaign is that the skirmishes you have on the campaign map do not match the battlefield map as they do for say in Rome Total War 2004. 9/10
Ai- I played the campaign on Expert and the Ai seemed way to easy. The Ai had lots of potential weapons to use and didn't respond well to flank attacks especially AT guns. As for my units, on multiple occasions I had engineers getting stuck and separating from the group which resulted in them being unable to repair or build. Overall the Ai seemed really dumb especially when compared to the prequel of this game COH2, in that game the Ai was aggressive even on normal and each map felt like a hard fought tug of war, whereas this game scripts Ai attacks based on capture points. 5/10
Maps: Besides the well designed missions, skirmish maps were very redundant. 7/10
Multiplayer: There does not seem to be a lot of variety in multiplayer, it really seems like a lot of maps were just copied over from COH 2, the lobbies are dead and there really isn't a lot of selection. 6/10
Replay Value: I only really see myself possibly replaying the campaign, I don't think I would play it for multiplayer since COH 2 has a greater selection. 5/10
Overall Score 6.5/10, I would not recommend this game at the moment, it feels unpolished.
Recommendation for this Company: I would recommend you give a free map update or open world campaign of like Greece or defending against the Japanese push southward and the fall of Singapore; something to fans to thank them for their hardcore dedication and dealing with these issues.

Overall I have been playing COH3 over COH2 and it has been a good experience. The game feels less memey due to the increased spread and survivability of squads which results in less wipes. Games also tend to have a quicker overall time of 30-45mins compared to 45-60min games of COH2. Well worth supporting this latest edition of the game as its starting with a strong foundation with plenty of room to grow.

Don't feel like reading the whole thing? 
Down at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game! :)

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Company of Heroes 3 is a bad game, but not for the reasons many players believe it to be. Complaints about skins, annoying cameras, and a lack of maps exist. Still, the trouble plaguing this title runs deeper and at the base. People should ask themselves not if the game is good or bad but how well it does the job of being an RTS. 

[h1] Control and Gameplay [/h1]
For starters, the controls are terrible. A good amount of key binding overlaps with movement, while the camera cannot be zoomed out enough. That is a big flaw as an RTS, seeing as it is a busy genre where the player got to keep tabs on all elements on the battlefield to consider options and make the best choices.

Having played GrimGrimoire Oncemore recently (which is not on PC, regrettably) shows me the main problem of Company of Heroes 3: The game is not an RTS at all. RTSs are about optimizing processes and using strategies to overcome unfavorable circumstances in Company of Heroes 3. The player can brute force most maps by blinding and sending units into the fray. That is a clear contrast to GrimGrimoire, where one mistake could very well send me back to the start of the level; there is no deep strategy gameplay in Company of Heroes 3.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965378331

Another problem is the bugs in the game and the units themselves. Tanks can overlay and get stuck together in the street, unable to move. At the same time, units themselves can have defensive options for a map and not be able to use them overall in the ensuing battles. In addition to that, the cover system is pointless. Rather than watch two riflemen shoot at each other from cover, it is far better to ambush with a unit from the side or behind, making the mechanic a waste of resources at best.

[h1] Graphics[/h1]
The game was tested with an RTX 2060, 36 GB of ram, Intel Core i7-11700K - Core i7 11th Gen Rocket Lake 8-Core 3.6 GHz LGA 1200. The game ran at +70 FPS with no issues.

The title graphics are excellent, and the models and map look solid enough to do the job. However, the ability to destroy the surrounding areas in the middle of the battle is more impressive. Spectacularly building collapse while explosions rise up the dirt in the ground, resulting in a gritty spectacle of the destruction that comes with war. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965378670

Sadly there is little in the way of flying and sea units, meaning that there are no beautiful oceans to see in the conflict or planes flying toward the enemy. The exclusion of the two types of units is a significant oversight on the game's part. It downplays its gameplay as an RTS and hurts what could have been more colorful maps.

[h1] Sound[/h1]
The sound was great, as the explosions have a profound impact, and the destruction of buildings as the debris falls is pleasant. That being said, the units themselves do not sound as significant due to the voice acting. It is far too generic and lacks the charm one could appreciate in the previous Company of Heroes games. The voice acting for the campaign also comes out stiff at times, and there is not much to add in the music department; this is not Command and Conquer, after all.

[h1] Story and Characters [/h1]
The game's story follows the Allies and their uneasy alliance in defeating the Germans. The player takes the role of the commander, whose job is to ensure that America, England, and Italy insurgents come together to create a powerful force on the battlefield.

Each faction will propose different approaches to the grand-scale war, and there is a decisive factor in which decisions need to be made. Choices affect how allies perceive the commander and the upgrades they will reward the player. Maxing out the relationship with a faction leader will lead to them supporting the player during the final stages of the war as allies on the battlefield.

[h1] Replayability [/h1]
Company of Heroes 3 only offers a little replayability if the player is a completionist and wants to max out all relations with the respective faction leaders. There is much content to explore in a lengthy campaign and further missions in the sub-campaign. The main issue is that the drive is like a chore sometimes, with a lot of clicking and waiting for supplies or movement. At the same time, the battles themselves have little tactical gameplay into them and are more brute force contests.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965379094

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Company of Heroes 3 appeared to be an exciting title for RTS players but ended up falling as a game that will keep their interest. Thanks to massive bugs and a lack of gameplay elements, it results in an inferior version of its predecessors. If you are looking for an RTS, I recommend going for Company of Heroes 2, Command and Conquer, or if you own a Nintendo Switch or PS4/PS5, GrimGrimoire Oncemore.

I started out on CoH and played CoH2 extensively and was looking forward to the arrival of CoH3. The game had the hallmarks of a relic release of wrong assets, abilities that didn't work/kinda broken and bugs, which should have been caught in play testing (if that even happened).

The disappointment has only snowballed from release, with not even 24hrs after release we already had a nerf patch (not even bug fixes), it took months to get assets fixed in the game (of which some are still broken, the M3 is still a Sherman in the build queue) and more ""balance"" patches before bug fixes. There is a distinct lack of maps so I hope you don't have more than 1 friend you play with. 

And the best part, we got a micro-transaction store with challenges that don't give you enough to get a single unit skin before most fixes. And you can only get a single unit skin with ""free"" currency. At least in CoH2 you could actually use the in game currency in the store to buy everything, you had the option of grinding your life away to actually not have to spend a single coin. Now if you want to have anything you're paying for it without the option of earning it the hard way, there's only the easy way Chris Handsome.

And the balance patch that was just dropped doesn't even address the balance issues they highlighted for each faction, Grenadiers are still Osttruppen, Brits still get multiple upgrades to create a solid all round tier 1 inf army. Why not fix the Jaeger issue by giving the panzerschreck to the Pz.Grenadier and reduce the squad size by 1 to 5, and keep Jaegers as a small recon team, as intended (CoH 2). And to actually convince people to use grenadiers why not give them an LMG, like how the riflemen get the BAR. And being assault troopers, I would kind of expect my Guastatori to be able to throw a satchel, they aren't like the other Luigi's, or Marco and his boots.

I could continue to ramble on but Relic will never actually try and fix anything, micro-transactions and a desire to be Twitch famous gets in the way of actual progress, because if Relic can't even copy and paste the stats of the 8-Rad from one faction to the other and no one notices for 2 months post release, clearly they don't care.

Slow content development (focused on crappy skins instead of maps?), perhaps with most resources moved towards PAID expansion development... when base game is still somewhat lackluster or unpolished in terms of skirmish maps, mod support or features (try to crush infantry with a tank, rotate an HMG team in a building or watch a replay). 

No mention of extra, national VA. No info on planned Battle Gropus. The pre-release BS mentioned ""frequent content drops"" with stuff like ""Last Tank Standing"" or some other BS, like that'd be the thing we're looking for in this game.

The battlegroups are still a step back from the doctrine system of the first game, several aren't coherent at all and many fear a repeat of the pay2win battlegroup nonsense the second game had. As of writing the balance isn't great, with a few units being so glaringly overpowerd [like jaegers], or undertuned [american light armor, the 221 scout] that its hard to imagine how they even got past testing. They've already been nerfed, but boys rifles should have never made it past the open beta to release in the state they were in.

The campaign is very ~whatever~ the shitty total war knockoff mode irrelevant, and despite having the Italian campaign and north african campaign relic refused to release a playable italian army and instead just stuffed italian allied units into the  german afrika corps. 

The game released with a bare minimum of maps, which is one of the most annoying parts of actually playing online right now, but I guess not having nonsense like the sheldt back is a positive.

A few maps, a point and click campaign that is cool if you like doing nothing.

If you are planning to buy CoH3 primarily for the single player campaign, the game still currently has bugs that can break your campaign.

If you are planning to primarily play pvp online matches the player base is now very small and CoH3 has even fewer players than CoH2 both on average and at peak hours(steamcharts numbers).

The other game ruining issues I listed below are still in the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I loved the first two COH games and sunk thousands of hours into them.  When COH 3 was announced I pre purchased the Digital Premium Edition immediately because I was looking forward to this game for years, however, after playing only 10 hours I already regretted my purchase. 

Many reviews here have already stated the balance issues and all the features and mechanics from the past games that have been changed or removed, however, the main reason I do not recommend this title is the numerous game ruining bugs.

For instance

Unresponsive units - 
Telling a squad to pickup/man a dropped weapon and they just wont or will run up to it but do nothing(applies to both squad weapons and unmanned heavy weapons). I have had units get stuck for no apparent reason and the simply ignore any orders given to them. Sometimes after exiting a building or retreating they will also become unresponsive.

Bizarre pathing issues - Telling a vehicle to move to a location but it decides to go around in circles (this applies to both normal and reverse move orders). Sometimes when units are called into the map they get stuck outside the map and never showing up but still affect your population limit.

Odd Terrain interactions for projectiles - If there are any objects in between a tank and its target a weird issue can arise where a tanks shots will always collide with terrain and always miss its target.

This latest installment in the series takes a step backward in many respects, particularly regarding its visuals and audio.

The game feels flat and uninspired compared to the previous games' visceral and immersive war sphere. The graphics lack the same level of detail and texture that made the previous games so stunning. The sound design also suffers from a lack of depth and punch, with explosions and gunfire feeling muted and unimpressive. Overall, the game lacks the same tension and excitement that made previous games memorable.

But it's not just the visuals and audio lacking in CoH3. The game also has a shockingly minimal amount of content, especially when it comes to multiplayer. With only two 4v4 maps at launch, the lack of variety is frankly abysmal. It's hard to see how the developers could have thought this was acceptable, given that multiplayer is such a crucial part of the game.

Even more frustrating is the game's greed, with the first thing patched into the game being an in-game store filled with outrageously expensive micro-transactions. This feels like a slap in the face to the community, who would have preferred bug fixes, balance tweaks, or other Quality-of-life improvements.

Overall, Company of Heroes 3 is a disappointment. It falls far short of the spirit and cultivated package that made Company of Heroes 2 the best game in the franchise. It's disheartening to see the state of the game at launch, but I can only hope that with time, it will slowly pull itself from the game and become the game the fans deserve.",1681798394,1681798821,False,6,0,0.505158603191375732,0,True,False,False

First off, the balance is hopelessly broken. Units feel super squishy, and the worst part of COH games, the blobs, are absolute king. There's no way to punish an early game blobber as USF, for example.

Second of all the camera is awful. It feels way too zoomed in, and half the time the tall buildings are in the way so you can't see what's going on. 

Third, the UI is terrible. It feels like they didn't have any experienced UX people on the team. The placement of windows and elements feels off. The UI is confusing at times. It's missing basic things like tooltips for units and items in space. And it just looks bad more than anything.

Why am I saying this? I will explain with examples: the previous version of this game, COH2 (which I played a considerable amount of and am familiar with) is a masterpiece game that has been perfected over time. Professional gameplay and great sounding music. The unique explosions and exciting captures of the appearance of the forces, which are made with stunning details (for example, the dirt of the soldiers and skin tanks), even the photos that are displayed on the main screen of the game and the beginning of the game, the end of the game, are very skillfully selected. All of these indicate a masterpiece game that needs to be completed, which has been completed to an acceptable extent with the addition of various factions of new forces and the changes of forces. But Company of Heroes 3 is not a good game. I admit that the gameplay has improved. The music and voice overs have dropped a lot, the conflicts (for example, the collision of the tank fire mortar) have become very, very weak. The appearance of the troops has improved in terms of quality, but they are clean and washed. And finally, is this game going to be completed? A weak game that wants to be completed!!!!!
In my opinion, it would have been much better if you completed COH2 because it still has great potential and can turn from a masterpiece to a legendary game, but it is clear that completing COH2 does not cost its fans and players, so a new version is exactly This COH2 could reach the same legendary game with positive updates.

The once great name of Company of Heroes is officially dead.
The devs appear have no interest in making a balanced, fun for all to play game. 
It has gotten so bad that when players of equal skill are playing each other, who ever is playing axis is assured a win.
And that's not just my opinion. Checkout spilt milk's video entitled ""Company Of heroes 3 is an Unbalanced MESS"" on YouTube. 100% accurate, can verify.
its not fun being an allied main, its not fun always getting rolled in the mid to late game.
I don't give a flying f*ck about the single player if the thing that makes the game lasting, the multiplayer is about as fun as getting railed by a baseball bat covered in razer wire. 
CoH has always had an axis bias, but its never been this bad before. Its intolerable, and I wish, so wish I could get a dam refund, but you cant know how bad it is in just 2 hours of play time. 
Please don't encourage this kind of bullshit in the future by buying this garbage now. Let another studio take over the franchise, or just let it die. But something this broken, where the devs refuse to even acknowledge the issue, needs to be allowed to die. 
Examples: playing as the US. keeping your infantry competitive requires that you spend lots of fuel to do so. as a result, its not uncommon for the axis player to get 2, 3 or even 4 tanks out before you can get even a single measly Sherman that is worse then a Panzer 3 or Panzer 4, especially when they already have several of them. either you let your infantry get railed to save up for tank, or you let the axis players just roll you later on. Either way you lose.

However over the past couple of weeks there's been very little communication from the developers that any of these issues are being addressed or even acknowledged. We are still missing basic quality-of-life changes that have existed in their previous CoH games for over a decade, and the amount of bugs in Company Of Heroes 3 in its current state is laughable. Relic seem to have absolutely no shame though, and instead of prioritising any of the numerous game-breaking bugs thought it prudent to add an in-game store filled with extortionately overpriced cosmetic skins - mere weeks after being released in a state which can only generously be called ""unfinished"". To place that in context we still have no ranked playlist, no way to review match history or replays, no form of player progression, and a very limited number of multiplayer maps (some of which are recycled depending on the amount of players).

While it's funny to watch youtube compilations of the terrible UI choices, misspelled and mislabelled maps and units, weapons floating erratically in the air above your troops and poorly scripted NPC characters waving their arms around, there's plenty of meaningful bugs in this game which do actively disrupt gameplay. Pathing is atrocious; retreating troops will often take an illogical route back to HQ which will result in their deaths, and tanks will spin on the spot as they constantly recalculate the best way to reach the position you've given them. Squads will sometimes overlap the placement of soldiers behind cover meaning you can lose an entire squad to a single tank shell or grenade. Weapons teams with multiple surviving soldiers will occasionally retreat out of bounds never to be seen again, while some squads are split across such a large distance that they're impossible to order from one location to the next. Artillery breaks when it's re-crewed, dropped weapons glitch through the floor and can't be recovered, and we haven't even got started on the complete lack of suppression which means every game comes down to huge blobs of infantry rushing forward directly into machine gun fire with total indifference - a tactic which is being universally exploited at all levels, even by some of the best players in the world. Simply put, the game is a mess.

I played Company Of Heroes 2 for years and I've had some enjoyable games in Company Of Heroes 3, but the post-release support simply hasn't been up to scratch for a full price release from a Developer of this pedigree. The game should not have been released in this state, and players are absolutely justified in being upset about it.",1680402866,1681615788,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Victory points are very fast
No profiles page to see stats or match history present.
No ability to view leaderboards in-game.
No ranked matchmaking in multiplayer.
Fallschirmjagers missing 3D models.
Missing surrender option.
No inventory system - you cannot change the badge, banner, title, basically anything related to your ingame profile personalization.
Only 3 Battlegroups per faction (same amount as in beta). As a result, there are units currently in the game that are unable to be accessed in multiplayer due to there not being a battlegroup made for them.
Only 2 4v4 MP maps (same amount as in beta).
Only 3 3v3 MP maps (same amount as in beta).
No earning of credits after games, meaning no way for us to earn said free credits to later buy things in the in-game store like in COH2.
Untitled Italian unit with Adrian helmet seen in Relic's official COH3 screenshots is nowhere to be seen in the game.
Unable to queue capture orders on the tactical map.
No way to view the map at the end of the game.
No chat room server support.
After the game ends, there is no way to chat with your opponents or teammates.
No ability to name your multiplayer game.
No background sounds of birds chirping, faded gunfire in the distance, etc that was present in previous entries to give off that 'COH vibe'.
No player names showing over units when hovered over them.
No player list in-game in multiplayer (can't tell if human teammate got replaced by AI)
No leaderboards for pre-made teams.
No crushing infantry with heavy vehicles.
Not being able to ram tanks into buildings to create holes anymore (building destruction physics).
Unit statistics not viewable in game, nor what their advantages are.
Not being able to rebind modifier keys like Shift, Alt, and Tab. For example, this makes this a no-buy for some who are left-handed and don’t use a traditional hand placement on a keyboard.
No scroll speed setting (edge panning speed) for those who don't use WASD or arrows as default.
Cannot multi-select control groups with Shift + Numbers, instead it assigns multiple control groups to individual units.
No ability to click on a dropped lmg or anti tank weapon to see exactly what kind of weapon it is.
'Temporary' main menu UI from beta still remaining in full release.
Tiny soundtrack compared to previous COH games.
No ability to have the camera follow a unit you double clicked on (either the unit or it portrait). This was present in COH1/2.
No Bulletin system.
No Observer mode.
Unable to see crew weapons built in post-match stats screen.
No replays (although a workaround is available).
Unable to invite friends from Steam, directly from the steam UI and steam overlay.
Disappointing state of modding tools. Many possibilities were promised by Relic pre-launch in terms of modding, but it seems that turned out to be false and in reality the options are very limited.
Only English language voice tracks.
Bugs:
Devil's Brigade DLC not unlocking for the launch edition of the game for everyone.
Global Unit Control Position keeps resetting itself after each game.
AI failing to attack you in campaign unless scripted.
Custom game server browser broken. For example, you can only see 9 games, no sorting, no searching, no paging of the list. The top 9 games are usually never launched with an AFK host.
Instances where crew served weapons (for example, a US MG Squad and a mortar squad) both got ""stuck"" in a green covered position (which they were not really stuck or surrounded since it was open behind them) after pressing retreat.
254 Recon Tractor has the ability to call in free offmap mortars, at vet 1 it gains the ability to lock and have an improved barrage overwriting the default one.
US Airborne troops infinite spawn glitch.
Capture point bug. For example, the enemy did not loose tickets. We had 400, they had 39. We still held one, but we tickled down until we lost.
Pings have several seconds of sound delay.
Base building flashing between textures when anti-aliasing is set to high.
Some portraits or icons may appear lower resolution or not scaling correctly to the user interface.
Infantry units having their 'engines be broken'.
Flickering walls bug.
Sound and graphics begin to stutter after certain amount of playtime. Restarting the game fixes.
Airborne models reload their carbines like they are a bolt action.
Some team weapons have their animation speed ramped up way too fast. Example, the Brit heavy mortar.
The Behind Enemy Lines ability for the US Airborne does not function as intended.
When capturing a team weapon, your units adopt previous owner/faction voice lines.
One of the US At gun voice lines is completely bugged, the voice sounds like a squeaky robot.
Howitzers do not angle their guns correctly when firing. They do not match the angle of the shells leaving the cannon.
Some units get stuck when exiting a building depending on surrounding geometry.
Sometimes abilities will overlap existing abilities instead of moving to an empty square in the HUD. This often occurs when upgrading units or unlocking new Veterancy abilities.
Not being able to click on top of the big notifications.
Unable to save skirmish settings.
Icons don’t show when an ability is in use. The only shown the cooldown after the ability end. For example, when I order an mortar to barrage a target out of its range i can’t tell if walked up to the fitting range and started barraging from its icon.
Sometimes cast ability’s are ignored. For example, like when a tank isn’t in range and I cast a Panzerschrank the grenadiers just ignore the order and keep walking somewhere else.
Unit icons inside buildings being off screen unless you can see the whole building, causing you to get suppressed without knowing from where its coming.
No autosave in campaign.
After match stats are hilariously broken and inaccurate.
Minimap has no indicator of which specific unit is selected if you are tabbing through several.
When using ""walking stuka"" is a circle, which doesn't fit the barrage itself which is instead an oval like shape.
Ultra texture option is locked out for no reason (although a workaround is available).
Pathfinding for vehicles is terrible.
Friends who are online and in-game don’t show up as online or inviteable many times.
Reticle/marker: when you send/direct multiple units to a spot shows only arrow, not the dots+arrow representing each group in the selection.
Things currently in COH3 needing improvement:
In-game visuals look too washed out/bland, require better lightning/contrast. As such, soldiers also tend to blend with the ground, sometimes not being able to instantly see where the model is standing.
Wonky, at times brain dead in-game AI.
Pings are still barely noticeable. COH2 it was too loud and spammy, now it makes barely any sound and hard / impossible to find.
Tank explosions need work. For example, an exploding tank will only become static and give off a tame explosion VFX, unlike in COH2 where it would physically shake, create larger more dynamic explosion, and you would see parts and bodies flying off.
Poor sound mixing. Extremely muffled and needs revamp.
When up

- The kill counters are hard to find on units now. You’ve got to hover over the experience bar. Makes it hard for viewers to tell at a glance. Just makes no sense.
- Missing audio cues for grenades being lobbed (specifically satchel charges)
- Units getting stuck after exiting certain houses.
- No ingame leaderboards
- No proper social system ingame to chat with the rest of the community
- No option to rejoin after disconnecting (it’s 2023 we should have this option now…)
- No observer mode
- No proper replay system
- No depth to ingame tips and guides/ build orders
- The tactical map is a mess with unit cards covering other unit cards
- Machineguns in buildings missing their face direction button.

    -There has been far too few maps in multiplayer since launch, either add some maps from the workshop or pay some of the veteran map makers from CoH2 to produce some. Playing the same 2 maps on repeat got old fast.

    - Release balance patches every 2 weeks max, not every 2 months.

    -Remove unit momentum, it negatively effects unit responsiveness, and remove height advantage until the maps are competently designed enough to incorporate it properly.

   -Fix everything fixed in CoH2 that is now broken in CoH3, like unit responsiveness, barbed wire trapping units whilst they build it and mines wiping entire squads.

Is the game as bad as some say. No. Is it perfect? No far from it. The real answer is somewhere in the middle. And of course we have to address the elephant in the room that is the shop which does allow you to purchase with in game currency. Of course you can pay real money for cosmetics. The issue is if you are going to charge for cosmetics and even entertain the idea of microtransactions? Your game had better be extremely polished. 

Company of Heroes 3 is not without it's flaws so let's address these first. The visuals are fine and the change in theater brings a fresh color palette from that of COH 1 and COH 2's respective campaigns. Buildings and units are nicely modeled and generally animated well. However there are some quirks. I noticed some german armored units vibrating while idle to the point it looked comical as if the tank was epileptic and having a seizure. Meanwhile other units like the M4 are wonderfully modeled and animated with some backwash effects from the gun being fired. 

Audio had felt less impactful than previous iterations of COH however seeing a comparison to a hotfix it does appear they have tried to at least address some of these audio issues. 

A number of people have noted bugs, but my personal experience has largely been bug free. The worst that I might have had is some pathing issues which...has been an issue for COH 1 and COH 2. 

The UI in general is fairly plain and basic. It's functional but I feel the UI as it is takes up too much screen real estate. This is compounded by a camera that feels too restrictive. I would like to see the camera able to be zoomed out a bit more during skirmish battles.

Most of my experience has been spent in the Italy campaign, though I noticed other folks citing inbalance or issues with ""Blobs"" in skirmish. Blobs have been an issue since COH1. I am not sure what the solution might be here other than to ramp up the AOE but then does that have a cascading effect elsewhere? 

I mentioned the Italy campaign so let's talk about it. COH3 seems to be drawing inspiration from Total War. It's an intriguing idea as I had thought a WWII total war might be cool. Unfortunately while the idea is sound I don't think the execution is quite there. You only field a few units at any given time on the campaign map like Total War. So there is some strategic thinking involved. Certain cities give certain bonuses so you again have to choose where you want to focus. The issue I think is that the AI on this campaign map is a bit too passive. Outside of some scripted encounters I only really saw the enemy try to push back once and even then it was something where I could just call on a B-25 and wipe out any immediate threat. 

The Italy campaign does have some fresh ideas however. Your various allies will from time to time highlight an optional objective for you to complete on the campaign map. Completing it improves ""loyalty"" and gives you further benefits. Sprinkled about the map are ""missons"" that are more scripted and the variety in these is actually pretty solid. Other smaller missions like capturing an enigma machine with commandos are short and fun affairs with the end result being able to see enemy troop movements in fog of war. 

Another thing I appreciate is that you aren't pidgeonholed into a faction. This also helps mission variety. One mission you may be playing the US, another may have you play as the UK. Special mention must be made to the fact that the UK feels like proper commonwealth forces including Indian Artillery as well as Gurkas. I believe you also have some Scots in the mix as well. This jumping between factions encourages you to learn the various kits each bring to the table. Further abilities are researched and unlocked. Further adding to the dynamism of the Italy campaign is that if you bomb a city and then attack it with infantry? That map will reflect the actions made on the campaign map. 

I have not played the German campaign yet. I would push back against the notion that the devs were lazy or that the game lacks effort. You are getting two campaigns with more factions available at launch than either of the previous COH titles. Some folks question the ambition of Relic. While not all the new things have hit the mark? I do think credit should be given that they did try something new rather than just retread or redo COH 1 or 2 with a different theater. 

I would recommend it if you are a fan of the first two games but do know that the game may have some bugs, or other issues. I'd definitely recommend checking it out in a few months after more patches or during a sale.

After playing CoH1&2 over years with great enthusiasm, sadly after the release of CoH3, I have to say, Relic as a developer, and SEGA as a publisher don't deserve your money. Sorry, to all you hard working developers there, but this is true. So many years of experience and a such a loyal fan base and you are close to to drive another franchise against the wall (DoW3); while your co-drivers and back-seat-drivers scream: ""Pull aside, and listen"". My critique is honestly not about the balancing of the factions. I admit, that this is really hard to do. I really don't want to be in the developers shoes on this issues. However, balancing it is not the major problem of CoH3 but it is connected to it. What makes my angry is the following: Relic-SEGA released a full-price-title, that is full of wrong icons (e.g. Kettenkrad is represented as a jeep in the menu, Marder was represented a long time as SU76 in game, a unit which is not even in the game). Even worse, for these use of  icons from CoH2 (e.g. the loiters, reinforce on Airborne etc.). How lazy is that? You could have polished them at least. You don't have an replay / observer mode, or the option to surrender. I mean, just days after release community members developed an observer tool for that, which is now frequently used within the community. And you couldn't? And in the case of the surrender, it is just a button, isn't it?. Fellas, I am honest, these is are just some examples of very basic issues that are missing at this stage and which were there in CoH2 when it was released. But what pisses me off is, five weeks after release you introduce two in-game currencies and a shop for cosmetics, but still don't have a ranked mode? If you thought about a way to kick all competitive CoH2 players straight in the face, that's the way to do that. I don't want to talk about the other problems in too much detail. Anyway just to mention a few, like the stupid friend / group matchmaking settings or stripping away core mechanics of CoH2/  make them worse (e.g. drive overs, full health-re-crews of team weapons, which you want to address later; when?). What where you thinking when you were were developing the game? Let's make a great WW2-RTS for everyone? Didn't you hear? WW2 will never enter the great e-sport scene no matter how much you simplify the gaming mechanics or adjust the graphics to a more comic-style art. It's still WW2! Relic/SEGA seem not be at all genuinely interested in the gaming experience of the dedicated player base - these people that are actually into the setting - but in the communities money (see the last patch, introducing an in-game store instead of fixing basic issues). A advise for the marketing experts at Relic/ SEGA: If you lose your hard-base consumers your brand will crush, especially if your brand is controversial. Baseline for all of you considering to buy CoH3: If you search for a single player RTS-experience set in WW2-North Africa / Italy, maybe this game is fine. I do not know, hence I was going for the MP-experience and never played the SP-mode. If you searching for a decent MP like in CoH2, wait until the game is for sale. If you are lucky, and the people responsible for this mess will start listening, you might get it then. In the current state, CoH3 is not worth more then 20 Euros / Dollars or the equivalent of it. But most likely, until the game is on sales for such a price, it will be dead - like DoW 3. I also would make a bet: Soon Relic/ SEGA will start selling doctrines/ commanders over their in-game shop and finally skip any thoughts about balancing. UPDATE: Meanwhile challenges were introduced which basically force you to grind (in a RTS!, WTF! did you hired some of the WarThunder-Developers?) to get some free in-game currency (building 20 tank traps with British Forces??? Kill 50 vehicles with this and that??? Seriously??? Even Pro-Games admit, that this is almost impossible time-wise to achieve). Good job Relic / SEGA. I am a CoH diehard like I was a Dawn Of War diehard. From time to time I will check, if things will change.  But I assume, it will not.

There are a lot of refreshing new units and features, but you can quickly see that the game was rushed and postponing the launch wasn't enough the fix.

The campaing style is original, but quickly becomes repetitive and boring. The maps are always the same: they just rotate some a bit to give you a sense that it is different. The computer doesn't take good decisions to try to push you back while he has all the arsenal to do so. Like, why the hell did they give him so many howitzers to just don't use them? They have created some complex features to use for strategic purposes (like the detachments and emplacements to build) to be just useless because the computer isn't a challenge to play against, even on expert difficulty.

For skirmishes, there is simply a lack of maps at launch. It looks like they though that giving that job to passionate map makers would be cheaper to do than to do it themselves and it shows. In PvE, the computer difficulty is also too easy, so you quickly become bored after a couple a games on the hardest setting.

If you're curious about the game, I would say don't buy it at full price and wait for it to go on sale because at 80$, it's not worth it. They had some good ideas, but the execution is bad so far.

The multiplayer is is usually fast paced, competitive and quite fun. Pulling off a daring strategic maneuver to turn the tide of a game is very satisfying and something interesting happens in most close battles. I've lost many more games than I've won and the fact that I've still generally enjoyed my experience is a testament to the core gameplay being enjoyable. Each of the armies has their own strengths, weaknesses, and play-style though infantry blobs are ubiquitous. Players generally don't say anything or are polite.  

If you prefer the campaign and don't want to play multiplayer, don't buy this game yet. Wait for a sale because there simply isn't enough content & what content exists isn't engaging or innovative enough to justify the current price point.  You can find better experiences for less. 

Here is where I would like to advocate for a little more character work in these games. Rommel, Patton, Eisenhower are all intelligent, charismatic, and bold leaders among a sea of contemporary heroes. Use real correspondence, tell real histories, there's no reason a WWII story should be tasteless. As a student of history I can say there's a more authentic, engaging story to tell than what we got here. 

Ultimately, I think this game has been worth the money for me based on my enjoyment of setting & the multiplayer action that's kept me hooked while I build my confidence as a RTS gamer. Is it worth full price right now? Perhaps not, but it will be eventually and what does exist is enjoyable if you know what you're looking for.

Overall feels like it's still in beta, with the price tag they're charging it's just not acceptable. I'd recommend waiting 6-12 months while they finish the game

While a lot of the information they give in terms of map placement, abilities, unit info, etc is pretty much the same as previous cohs it just feels really clunky and arcadey. The main menu is a bit annoying, doesn't sign post stuff well, sends you straight back to main menu after a multiplayer match so you have to click through and make your selections again (doesn't take long but it's just annoying, plus sometimes reverts your faction if you're not paying attention).

The sound feels like they've tried to go for a more realistic vibe but it just feels less gritty than coh 1 & 2 and I don't feel as immersed in the game. Graphics feel like a massive step backwards too, feels really cartoonie and not sure if it's just me but the proportions feel slightly off compared to the terrain.

Balancing isn't great either so tend to see the same strategies played by certain factions, currently only 3 commanders/battalion options that i could see for each faction (assuming they'll release some more in future for cash) so multiplayer feels a bit boring, plus there's no ladder at moment adding to feel that it isn't a finished game.

Singleplayer campaigns I haven't actually played as I've always loved the multiplayer aspect of coh. There are some quality of life benefits vs 2 and some of the new unit types (static field guns that you can tow with trucks) are cool but overall the pros of this game could've just been added on to coh2 and you would have a much much better game. Really disappointed in relic, feels like a bit of a cash grab from a faithful community

#Update - they've made some changes but really hasn't had much of an impact on balance, if anything it's just made it worse and you're forced to play a certain way otherwise you just get steam rolled, kills any kind of creative play.

Alright, boys. Let's talk. At the time of writing, I've played this game about 36 hours. I've been a fan of Relic since I was a kid starting with the original ""Dawn of War"", and this is the cliche squad based combat that you expect to see from them. However, this game is clearly incomplete. You can see it the second you launch it and make it to the title screen. You're immediately met with a stationary background and 4 options. Now, I'm not saying that a stationary background is bad or anything, just very simple compared to CoH 2 with music and flags that change based on your chosen army. Moving on, into the Skirmish menu you are faced with 4 armies to choose from at the start, which is MUCH better than CoH2, and boy was that game heavy in the microtransactions, but we will get to that. There are plenty of maps to play on with 4 full armies that have 3 different commanders each. Honestly, not too shabby compared to CoH2's launch. But when you start a match in skirmish, it immediately loses connection to the servers. Now, that's not a problem at all because it still lets you play the match in it's entirety, but it just feels like they have to rig their application in some way to include a feature that has and will always be a staple in RTSs. Clicking out of that window and continuing into the match is pretty fun. Great cover based system that encourages flanking and use of abilities to destroy your enemy, Classic relic. However, If you're some joe Schmoe like me who gets off work and just wants to vibe with a shitty IPA and do a ""Comp-Stomp"" or two this will quickly become frustrating because the CPUs CLEARLY can see through the fog of war. I've had multiple instances where I have a defensive line and the enemy is dropping smoke shells on my tanks as they are being built in my base across the map where they have absolutely no units. Is this the end of the world? No, of course not, but do we expect better from a Major developer and especially a massive publisher? Absolutely. And that's really the heart of this review, I shouldn't lower my expectations for something that I've waited on for, what, like, 5 years now? Sure, call me old because I expect a game to launch like ""Dawn of War: Dark Crusade"" with a kick-ass single player with exceptional elements and the ability to play multiple armies with a huge battlemap, but this game should have significantly more content for a game that was developed over 5 years. Will this keep me from buying the next game that relic puts out? No, because maybe they will listen to their fans and change this bad boy into something it should be. I just expect significantly better (I.E., a complete game) from Relic. I miss the days when you guys were cool...

It really is an experience that is dividing my personal opinion as well. Also take note that for me multiplayer is the key aspect of Company of Heroes franchise. I'm writing this after 1,5 months from release.

One youtuber nailed it down after release: ""The game has very good bones"". But the meat on top is partly so poorly prepared it's making for a meal that is hard to digest. The engine is a big improvement over CoH2 even if some people are complaining over the graphics. It runs so much better compared to the previous game and there are a lot more details on building destruction etc. Also loading times are greatly reduced from the previous title. And in multiplayer you can notice that input delay is nowhere near the levels of CoH2. Which means you can actually focus on actual gameplay instead of adjusting yourself to what ever input delay exists on each match. Automatic vaulting of obstacles is a very welcome addition among other things that lets you focus on more important things on the battlefield.

Unfortunately pathfinding of vehicles and team weapons with wheels did not receive a similar overhaul from CoH2. They are still doing their dance of death if given the opportunity and since this game no longer allows vehicles to ""phase"" through each other in some situations you are literally going to get stuck without even noticing it untill you are thinking ""Where is my panzer support? I ordered it five minutes ago!"". So basically Quality of Life hangs on the edge of a very sharp blade regarding these aspects.

I didn't find the single player campaings appealing enough to invest more time into them. The North Africa campaing is a huge missed opportunity story wise. The missions are basically generic ""capture these points"" or ""defend this area untill x"". The story in the cutscenes between missions feels completely disconnected from the core idea of Company of Heroes franchise. Why not tell the story about the men and generals who fought in North Africa? Rommel? Montgomery? Tiger 131? Encountering Matilda tanks with inferior anti-tank guns? It's all missing. I didn't touch the Italian campaing, but even it has it's own little historical inaccuracies and unpolished campaing mechanics.

It appears to me that Relic has divided their limited resources too much. Trying to achieve too much with too little resources. The engine is fine but the content not acceptably polished. Multiplayer is still seeking balance and Relic focused most of their attention on getting the ingame store opened instead of treating the actual game with their full attention for the first crucial month. The first major patch with the title ""Operation Saphire Jackal"" still didn't even begin the first ranked season. Instead we still only have ""unranked"" mode that does have a matchmaking system, you just don't officially have a rank that you could easily check ingame. Introducing micro transactions with a buy-only ingame currency really is a slap in the face to all fans of this franchise.

This is basically what happens in modern days of gaming industry. And it has robbed this franchise it's opportunity to shine from day 1. I'm not saying this game is not going to improve over time, but how on earth are they going to keep people playing this game if the release left this hard of an impression. And most importantly: how do they expect new people to be attracted to the franchise?

The game was basically released in an Beta development phase, so I would suggest you give it a pass untill a much later date when some of the most glaring issues might get fixed.",1681023702,1681023702,False,13,0,0.539748966693878174,0,True,False,False

I mean we all should've expected as much from the studio that took Dawn of War and drained it of life.

This game doesn't feel like anything special, it feels bland. The visuals are good and the units are neat (although there aren't NEARLY enough), the animations are great. But none of it is enough to distract from the uninspired gameplay itself.

I keep trying to play it and like it, but I just end up wishing I was playing COH2.

The maps? Uninspired and claustrophobic.

The units? Strangely recycled with other nations and the available selection makes no sense.
USA doesn't have: Lee, Stuart M3A1, Stuart M5A1, Pershing, Jumbo, Calliope, just to name the obvious.

The Brits DO have the Stuart M3A1 and the Lee/Grant though. WTF?

No Russia, and Italy's units are at least half german.

No Tiger II but there is a Panther.

Italy gets some German units even Germany doesn't get.

This game was made with competitive play in mind and competitive play only, an idea that should've been aborted in the womb somehow infected all of Relic. They tried to take COH to eSports and of course it failed.

If they somehow make another COH I'll be very cautious but hopefull that they just try to make a fun game for once, a fun game to play by yourself or with friends.

TL;DR: The game is, honestly quite excellent. Its a bit rough around the edges here and there; but the core game loop is better than all previous entries in the series and the performance is also far better than most released games in the past decade or so. 

EDIT: Max review length hit already, check comments for additional updates.

====================================================================
[b]The points I have been seeing:[/b]

[i]The graphics are bad[/i]: Are they? How so? They seem fine to me. The textures look at or near the quality in the screenshots on the store page; maybe there's some more bugs on specific hardware? If so I'd probably report that as it seems unintentional. Is there a desire for more god rays? More fancy shadows? More bloom? Motion Blur? I really don't know what the ask is here.

What I did notice is that the performance seems to be far better than any previous entry. 144 FPS without any dips or drops is a pretty rare and cool thing to see. Maybe the graphics don't look like Atomic Hearts but I can't say I care much when the game runs smooth like butter.

[i]The game lacks features[/i]: What features? This is usually done in comparison to COH2, but as I recall, COH2 launched with only 2 factions and only a single campaign with just minor little missions for the other faction. They then trickled in other modes and factions as dlc for 10-20 bucks a pop. There are also more maps than the launch of COH2 as well; What exactly is missing here?

Most posts seem to neglect mentioning anything. I suppose the only things I'd say that I actually noticed were a page for profile edits and some minor quality of life aspects such as game recordings or player names. There's also no progression system but, again, I'm not really sure why these are so important that they ruin the entire experience, these all seem, extra to me.

[i]The sound design is bad[/i]: The sound design is ""realistic"" (at least according to the devs) which means that its not going to sound like a movie. Its going to sound real, its going to pop and crackle, and it isn't going to have the oomph (except the stukas apparently). Which, yeah, I enjoy the more boom boom pow than the crackle, but I don't really see how that warrants a negative review. I know there have been some people whose sound quality was defaulting to ""low"" and making the game sound like tin can pasta; but apparently that's an easy fix so /shrug.

I wouldn't mind a more hollywood sounding experience, I like the extra big thundering boom noises and massive over the top explosions a bit more than the realistic sort of vibe they seem to be going for here; but I can't say that should warrant a negative review, seems petty.

[i]The UI is bad[/i]: This seems subjective to me. If you want to cram the entire set of menu buttons onto a tiny window that takes up less screen space than a steam notification I mean, I guess? It seems perfectly servicable to me. I think the thing to really look at is UX and besides the kind of fuggly social menu, the number of clicks required to perform certain tasks is properly minimized and the only thing I can't seem to find is a profile editor. You can click twice and get into a game and the in-game UI is straight out of COH2 but with more open space to see the actual game so, huh? 

There are definitely UX improvements to be made (The way to cancel constructions wasn't immediately obvious to me, likewise upgrades (in a few instances I struggled to find it until it was literally too late to cancel)); additionally map pings don't seem to be particularly noticable (very hard to spot and hear) but maybe this will wind up being better after I play with it more, who can say. 

[i]The game is buggy[/i]: I can't speak to this one. In my time in the betas and alphas as well as at full release I have not experienced much if any noticable bugs, the only time I saw anything break would be vehicles bouncing like its a gmod corpse. But honestly, I find those sorts of things funny so I don't really know if they're worth complaining about. IF your game crashes or has weird issues, just report a bug and the devs will probably get back to you on it. The game seems about as stable if not more stable than coh1 and coh2 so, again, might just be my machine.

======================================================================

If you notice, there seems to be one particular thing lacking from most of the negative reviews. And that's actually discussing the gameplay. You can probably guess why.

I've been around the COH franchise long enough to remember all of the design faults and issues with both balancing and design and the gameplay critiques from both of the oldies. And I am beyond impressed with the way that COH3 seems to have taken all of that feedback into account in their design. One good example is that of COH2's vehicle balancing. The design choices of the game meant that light vehicles had far less effectiveness in the long term due to the larger amounts of heavy armored units. Leaving early games fairly vehicle dry and late games front-loaded with armor. COH3 solves this by making light and medium units king and giving access to them almost immediately with the efficiency to actually stick around in conflicts and not just get torn apart as soon as the game enters mid. Another great example would be pacing, COH1 and COH2 were always slow to get started and basically had a lot of players who would just try to sit and turtle for 8 minutes. COH3's map design and pacing are much, much quicker, making for snappier combat encounters and more emphasis on using everything in your tool kit just to hold positions and cover ground; the game feels better for it.

There are other things, but I'm not exactly amazing at describing them, suffice to say the experience feels like an improved upon version of everything that game before and targeting of the exact pain points you might have had.

All of the factions also play and feel particularly unique (unlike in COH2 where the two starting factions basically played identically). There is an absolute gem of a game here and it saddens me to see so many people railing on it for, honestly petty reasons. 

Oh, also, workshop support day1 is pretty neat too.

The only real thing I can critique here is the price, 60 bucks feels a tad too steep; somewhere around the 40-45 mark would probably fit better. But then again I don't really know what sort of game I'd describe as worth 60 dollars anyways, so that might also just be a nitpick.

=======================================================================

There's definitely polish points to be made, certain things like player names would be nice to have and I wouldn't mind some progression paths; but this lack of polish doesn't really hinder the experience. The game runs amazing, the game plays amazing, I wouldn't give it an A+ but I definitely wouldn't give it an F either. I think a B- is probably fair in the game's current state.

If the game did not receive any additional updates, I would probably still recommend it, which is why I just, do not understand the negativity. It seems entirely fickle. But I suppose I also don't put a ton of emphasis on presentation when I decide if a game is good or not. How it looks or how it sounds doesn't matter as much as the core experience to me. And that core experience here is something I think anyone who is a fan of RTS games can get behind.",1677199746,1680976636,True,480,9,0.791359901428222656,48,True,False,False

TL;DR I want it to be good but it sucks and Relic doesn't really seem to understand what's wrong, and are focusing on the wrong stuff.
The good: 
Idk, I like the graphics. Other people hate them but I think it's neat, but other than that I like the ideas behind a lot of the concepts. Brits have fun arty, but that's about it. 
The bad:
The game, at least 2 months after launch is SOOOOOOOOO buggy. 
-Units will send one dude while the rest of the group stays back, but they still take damage? That was something in the beta
-MG's will just not setup sometimes
-Pathing is so awful. Tanks run into eachother a l l  t h e  t i m e
-It appears AA at least half the time doesn't choose to shoot down planes
-There's more but that's just what I can remember off the top of my head in bugs.
On top of the bugs, I know we all joke/think axis bias is real in games like war thunder or WoT etc. but in this game it's GLARING. Everyone plays Axis not just because they're wheraboos, but because you can cheese the crap out of the early game and ruin it for the allied players. I'm an ally main and this is what I hate:
-Pizza (The M13/40) tanks swarming ANY allied tank and murdering it. I've lost Churchills to three of them. 
-Bers spam. Why are there 5 bersagleri sprinting across the map faster than my dingo scout car
-Panzer III: This thing just flys and it's cheap early game. I've had these things get into my base at 15 min and just ruin the game for me
-Luft spam: Oh boy first second the wher player can drop a basically free squad that murders my infantry section with NO upgrades
-Why are there 8 kradschutzen chasing my boys at minute 5. 
The Ugly:
Relic can't fix the bugs, don't know why they're happening, say they fix them then haven't and Balance the allies by making them weaker and barely address how powerful the axis are. Yeah we got the luft spam kinda fixed, but they're still way too powerful. Allies got no buffs in the last patch, and got nerfs on pathfinders. It makes no sense????

[b]To add insult to injury: [/b] 
Relic decided adding an in-game store to this game, a practically unfinished game at that, was the right move for patch 1. Are you kidding?

You  had us going with you latest balance pacth.I thought  they'd fix some serious issues and they came out and nerfed the allies even more. 
Nex patch? They'll make the Axis auto-win, every time they load into an auto-match?
And if you choose Allies, the game will auto uninstall and when you install it again, you'll have to sign a deal only to play axis?
The final straw was when they had the nerve and audacity to put an in-game shop and ask for money (overpriced) for skins. Devs are abusing their player-base, where 99 % of them are hard working dudes, who like to go in the gym, and relax with some rts games.

This game is not even half-finished - right now they should be ashamed of themselves - they messed up! They released a game that is so buggy, it's not even funny. and that missed so many basic COH2 features. All they had to do was to copy the template of COH2.
They drop a game, with no replays, can't even get the faction colors right, had to make a fix, that  really didn't fix it. 10 bloody years, to get it right, and they messed up big time.
And it's not just me saying it, look at the playing numbers - they will just keep declining and declining and declining, till the game is empty, and people go back to COH2 or leave any Relic game of the future. 
It's pure scam and a sick symptom of the game industry  - that they can get away with that, without be taken to court.

I’ll keep it short and say that for every QOL improvements that was implemented, there are questionable drawbacks and lack of polish in its current state.

The Pros:
+ Unit details looks great
+ Environment are nice and dynamic 
+ Moderately better voice acting
+ Better in game performance 
+ New mechanics & QOL improvements (simplified base building, auto reinforcements)
+ New gameplay mechanics are great (tank riding, towing weapons platform, breaching to prevent building camping)

The Cons:
- The subpar music that lacks the epicness of COH2
- No replay button to assess multiplayer performance post match
- The overall visuals while look great seems too cheerful and mobile game-esqued
- Typical match ends too quickly, resulting in those with a early game head start usually consistently winning and with no epic comebacks
- Game’s UI are harder to see and everything looks the same. COH2’s UI is implemented better
- The icons are now very bland, some ripped off from COH2 but missing the background, creating an unfinished look
- Tanks and vehicles animation now absorbs shots rather than being pushed upon warhead impact like COH2, leading to the feeling of controlling toys rather than battle tanks
- Infantry’s animation is mixed but I see plenty of shortcuts like not reloading an mg properly or medic healing themselves instead of patching others
- Sounds are realistic according to devs but lacks punch, again adding to feeling like you’re controlling toy soldiers
- Bugs in beta was not resolved like keeping unit icons on the top right, bugging veteran players

Neutral:
Campaigns are not my thing so I have not tried them and has no comments 

Relic games usually has a rough start and I am optimistic that these can be patched. The question is, how long will it take and what would the player base looks like in the end

Regardless, it was a pleasant surprise to see the franchise still alive and get a new installment, and since the announcement I've been following non-stop and took part in the Beta and tech-tests. Got the digital premium edition and was stoked for this thing to drop on launch day.

And then I actually played the game.

Nothing changed from the betas. The CoH 2 placeholder tooltip images are still there, there is no functioning replay system to watch prior played games. There is no in-game leaderboard, no chat rooms, an extreme lack of maps, no surrender option for multiplayer, no vetos for map selection in automatch, the lack of all this physically HURTS.

For Triple AAA price this should NOT be a thing, and im astounded that they even allowed the game to release in this state, even after delaying the release date  claiming that they were ""fixing stuff"".  

And here's the thing, the gameplay is actually fucking fun. I think the combat mechanics have been refined even above CoH 2 levels. They even innovated and added new mechanics; the addition of tank riding with infantry, tanks being actually green cover from small arms fire, towing anti-tank guns, seemless vaulting, and elevation changing the dynamic of firefights. All of this stuff is logical and realistic but yet isn't cumbersome or difficult which makes fights have even more weight behind them and im all for it. The four factions all feel distinct with unique units and abilities, and not copies of each other which I feared for. Balance is obviously not yet achieved but thats to be expected right after launch where players need to break things out.  

The gameplay is great but the whole presentation and interface sucks, uncharacteristic of Relic and absolutely unacceptable for an 60 dollar strategy game in 2023. To make matters even worse Relic has decided to implement an in-game store to try to make even more money with cosmetics instead of actually fixing these glaring issues or gameplay balance. Really feels like a jab in the side when you copped the Premium edition only to get 5 USF exclusive skins for an extra 20 dollars and then they drop an in-game store with even more paid skins after you got virtually nothing for the upgrade.

I cannot recommend this game in an unfinished state such as this and at such an exhorbitant price. If you're like me though and are financially irresponsible with your money, then by all means give this game a shot, it can still be fun, especially for the campaign playthrus.

tl;dr

+ Four factions on launch, all distinctive playstyles, units, doctrines, and tech upgrades.
+ Great gameplay mechanics, a refinement over CoH 2, 
+ Italy Dynamic campaign is fun, unique and innovative.
+ Linear DAK campaign, refreshing to see playable german campaign
+ Steam workshop support, will probably be the thing saving this game
+ a CoH game through and through; emphasis placed on knowing your unit abilties, their weaknesses, using cover, concealment, terrain, and then a combined arms approach to break down your opponent with superior micro management of your own units.


- No in-game replays
- No in-game leaderboard
- User interface in the menus and IG is cluttered, difficult to navigate and does not present information in a clear or concise way.
- Majority of Placeholder tooltip and UI assets are from CoH 2, lazy and actually confuses players that have played both games 
- visuals for a 2023 game are disappointing 
- no surrender button or way to review the battle field after a match ends
- no way to look at a player's stats in a lobby match
- no map vetoes for automatch
- lack of playable maps
- Tactical map is actually worse than CoH 1 tactical map, big unit icons interrupt mouse drag box.
- In-game pings are not obvious on the mini-map and do not indicate urgency.
- No crush for medium/heavy vehicles
- another fucking in-game store for micro transactions, the easiest way to get skins cause the merit points required to get a skin from challenges are ridiculously high.

PROS:

Campaign is a lot of fun and far more than I expected from a COH - yes it is a slog at some points and a little rough in terms of the campaign mechanics but worth playing it for the battle of Monte Cassino alone imo.

The factions are fun and varied, me and my friends all prefer different factions - and each are interesting to play.

Looks - as a massive nerd, I love how detailed and faithful the units look, like the Sherman, Greyhound and Marder. Brilliant, just a joy.

The classic control gamemode is as fun as ever and me and my two friends could play it over and over again

Cons:

Some balance issues for sure and vehicle pathing can be awkward but not the worst ive seen.

I've only played it for an hour.

This isn't an in depth review but.

-At launch, the game has no way in game to view replays, you can do it through a roundabout way but you have only pause as your replay option, no replay tools or speed up buttom.

-At launch leaderboards are not built into the game and you have to go through to this janky site to be able to do any of that.

-At launch your singleplayer, what was historically actually the main feature of an RTS, the prime reason we all played RTSs to begin with, is broken.

-Glitches abound.

-Reusing icons and many models from previous COHs.

-A Grayed out Store button (hmmmmmm) for a 60 (in my country 80CAD) game.

This is not the Company of Heroes of my childhood or High School years, 
Now then let's get this review underway. The dynamic campaign uses virtually the exact same maps over and over again with slight differences. Each ""mission"" if you could call them that, has nearly the exact same set of objectives which are extremely easy. For example there is one ""mission"" objective set in which you are to capture two points directly outside the enemy HQ and hold them for a little under two minutes to force the enemy to surrender. You can end the mission in around 5 minutes just by rushing those two caps. 

Honestly campaign feels like skirmish but in a reskin because the dev team was too lazy to write a decent campaign (CoH1  had the best IMHO), there are also quite a few UI issues such as the wrong unit icon being used when a voice line is played, repetitive voicelines, and many more issues I have with the game. Overall it felt like the downgraded the game for console and stuck us PC players with the console version as a beta test

The single player aspect is broken in to two separate campaigns, one covering the invasion of Italy and one covering the North Africa Campaign (specifically the exploits of the German Side/Erwin Rommel). Both of these campaigns are very different from one another. The Italian campaign plays out similart to CoH 2: Ardennes Assault, where you control different company types such as US Airborne, US Special Forces, US Armored Division, UK Armored Division and UK Indian Artillery. Meanwhile, the North Africa campaign plays similar to the original campaign of CoH 2 where you play through a sequence of historical battles and follow more of a narrative rather than an open-ended ""dynamic campaign.

In the Italian campaign, the companies end up being extremely similar with the only differences being the special units you can summon as an ability and a few other random abilities. You also unlock all of them by the end so the initial choice between them has very little effect on the outcome. As you move through the campaign you can conquer a variety of different areas, but most of these areas end up using the exact same map for the skirmishes and it becomes extremely repetitive. I would estimate 90% of the battles are the same skirmish type battles that make up the multiplayer side, and when combined with the fact that the it's a cycle of only a handful of maps this aspect becomes extremely tedious after awhile. The other 10% are main story missions where the objectives are scripted and have variety between them, which are definitely the highlight of this campaign for me. There are also light aspects of total war diplomacy, in that you have to manage your relationship with 3 different commanders (US general, British general, Italian partisan leader) which are altered by certain choices throughout the campaign, but this is an extremely half-baked idea where it is extremely easy to get all 3 to max before the ending. The partisan leader is also almost completely forgotten about/unnecessary and your access to partisan troops is near non-existent throughout the entire campaign and I really don't know why they would even bother adding them outside of being able to say ""yes they were important in real life so of course we put them in.""

Meanwhile, the North Africa campaign has none of the aspects of the Italian campaign outside of actual in-battle gameplay mechanics. It is entirely focused on story-based/scripted missions and you do not get to choose how you play through it or what missions you do. I much prefer this campaign as I like the missions actually being different each time and not using the exact same map for the majority of my battles, but on the same note it does make it feel much shorter in comparison. It also doesn't truly feel like it is following a story, or progressing towards an obvious objective, rather you are just moving from random battle to random battle. It also just suddenly ends which I get is how the North Africa campaign (especially Rommels part in it) happened but normally final missions have that ""this is the end"" feeling and in this campaign I didn't realize it was the last mission until the credits just randomly started rolling.

It feels like the developers were trying please everyone but end up pleasing no one. By trying to include every aspect from CoH 2 and Ardennes Assault they created half-baked versions of both campaigns. They really should have followed their process from CoH 2 where they develop one of these campaigns fully and then release the other as a DLC so that they could make them feel more complete/in-depth but instead both feel sort of disappointing.

With close to 40 hours on the game, it is feeling very stale. I thought there would be new battle groups/doctrines by now. None were added. New maps? No. None were added. Modding tools, new units, and custom maps? There are some but very limited. Honestly, feels like the CoH3 devs are making the community and modders do most of the work. Really disappointed on how this launched. The game is still lacking basic features (different teammates having different colours). They added the store before adding more content. Disappointed... You can't even mod the single player campaign. We all fell prey to the marketing. I was wearing my rose coloured glasses when I wrote my first review. 

Don't buy it until they apologise and fix all of this.  

ORIGINAL REVIEW IS BELOW

It's back. Thank god, it's back. COH 3 is pretty good. Better than the launch of COH 2, and feels a bit more arcade than the COH 1. Graphics are decent, but it's not you great grandpa's Normandy invasion PTSD moments. You want realism? Go play Hell Let Loose. You really want war? Go help Ukraine out and give your life to a cause that really matters. 

Audio is ""decent"". Not the best but not bad. 

Steam workshop is what is going to make it amazing. And if you have friends, that helps too. The destruction is nice too. 

Interested to see what the post launch support looks like! 

Scared still to buy it?

Since the lack of balance has been talked to death, I feel that something that is not brought up very often is the complete lack of ""atmosphere"" that the game has. It utterly fails to make me invested in it unlike the previous games. 

There is basically no soundtrack, the only times I can remember actual music is the menu music and the little tune you hear at the very end of the game. 

I have never gotten a ""rewarding"" feeling from playing this game, both you and your enemy will sit in green cover at long range and slowly damage eachother while having a reinforcement truck right behind the squads fighting so you often just sit there in your chair thinking about your sad life as both units slowly deal damage to eachother.

Since the TTK (time to kill) is so incredibly low, pulling off a flank with short-range troops is often not worth it as not only is it a risky move, but you don't deal that much damage if you get close. Your squad will get focused by the several enemy squads that reinforce next to the truck and forced to retreat, should have invested in a long-range squad that can sit in green cover and continously reinforce instead, bucko.

It really feels like the game is not trying to take itself seriously either, with the incredibly over the top and honestly cringe skins you got from pre-ordering the game making your units look like they are taken straight out of Hollywood. It is an incredible tone shift compared to the older games that did I did not feel portrayed war as somekind of fun activity you did with friends.

I have also studied Games Design and Computing and I know for a fact that all of the following things are completely possible and that the team who created COH3 can make all of them possible. 

I have played all Company Of Heroes games ever made since the beginning. This means from 2006 to 2023, roughly 17 years! I was 16 years when I started playing.   I remember when I used to play a battle for 8 hours without moving from my chair or pausing the game because it was so intense and challenging!  Long and endless nights of play time, over and over again! With that being said, I can safely say I do know what i am talking about. 

Company of Heroes 3 does not only have the potential to be the greatest RTS game of 2023 ,but of ALL TIME!

Despite this potential, COH3 may never reach this level, unless developers will implement the following features:

A WORLD MAP - just like the one from the Italian Campaign, but on a larger scale. This should include all Major Powers and countries that participated in WW2. 

Imagine having the option to choose between FRANCE, ITALY, USA, GREAT BRITAIN, GERMANY, JAPAN, SOVIET RUSSIA, etc
Yes, I do know there are other games that use this type of map and where you can choose to be who you want to be BUT, none of those games have the gameplay mechanics of COH. They do not have the same level of quality in terms of graphics, physics, etc. 

Binding the concept of the WORLD MAP and COH RTS features would indeed create a TOTAL WAR, a WORLD WAR where players can experience what it actually means to go to war. 

This would imply of course introducing new features, such as DIPLOMACY, SPIES, LOGISTICS(such as in ITALY CAMPAIGN but on a larger, more in-depth scale) , basically merging TURN BASED with RTS in the most harmonic way possible. 

Each Faction would have unique features. 
You could create many armies, battalions, have multiple commanders. 

Having the Italy Campaign of COH3 and Ardennes Assault campaign from COH2 as references is a great asset.   These campaigns could potentially be used as a source of inspiration and a foundation upon which all of the featured mentioned before could be added. 

Just imagine the following: 

Being in charge of multiple armies in the same time.

Appointing generals, promoting troops, customising your armies.

Unlocking new technologies as the years progress. 

Having the options to follow historical events or create your own path and alter history.

Plan your very own Invasions, Campaigns.

Build your own armies and fight on the Eastern front and Western front or on multiple fronts at the same time.

Declare War! or Sign Peace Treaties.

Choose from Historical Leaders or create your own. 

Having a much detailed Veterancy System( not just 3 or 5 levels of veterancy) where your troops will maintain their level of Veterancy throughout the entire war! 

Have a much wider music selection where players can choose what music they can listen to while embarking upon this great crusade. 

Unlock unique troops and having the ability to fully customise their uniforms, badges, names, colours, symbols, weapons, equipment. 

Further expand the Aerial Warfare and Naval Warfare by adding more units and features, such as Submarines. 

larger SCALE MAPS for RTS BATTLES where players can fight longer battles.

A wider, more in-depth and personalised Research Tree that may allow players to focus on different aspects such as: WARFARE, ECONOMY, INFRASTRUCTURE, DIPLOMACY, TECHNOLOGY, etc . 

Having your faction leader issue unique historical orders, such as Order 227

If Relic Entertainment or Sega wish to contact me , I have written down in very high detail many other features that would make up the perfect game. I hope that these features will be added in the next COH game , if not in the current one. 

With this being said, COH 3 is a nice game however:

Instead of offering players the above experience, COH3 came up with a very restricted campaign which is great in many ways but far too easy and not long enough, which is more of a tease than anything. 

 The Main Menu is not very attractive. COH2 had a much better MENU. This looks like a downgrade, even comparing it to the original 2006 game. 

I also think that:

COH3's Gameplay is very fluent and balanced, and the graphics are excellent.

Love the new mechanics and how buildings are turned into dust in a very realistic way. 

I often find battles do not last long enough.

Let me know if you like my review!

If any other TRUE COH brother wishes to add any other features to the list above , feel free to write them in the comments!

It's a fun game, and is a fresh experience from CoH 1 and CoH 2, but there's one BIG problem.

Relic, PLEASE change the Unique player-specific colours back to CoH 2's, or at the very least make it an option. The current options are horrendous for colourblind people.

Example: enemy purple is way too visually similar to allied blue, enemy red way too visually similar to allied orange. There is a lot of eye strain because of this and I struggle to differentiate friend from foe, especially when looking at the tac map which is already a cluttered mess.

There's already a lot of red flags that show the UX/UI designers haphazardly designed the HUD features throughout the game's early alpha and beta, so it's no surprise they completely neglected colourblind-friendly designs when they were so focused on shipping out a decent looking HUD last minute.

To work around this, I unfortunately have to leave it on team-based colours (blue for me, yellow for all allies, and red for all enemies), otherwise 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 becomes unplayable.

However, the issue with this is there's no way to tell who owns which unit like in CoH 2, where you could see the playername on the selected unit, or hold CTRL to see the player's name on the unit. 4v4 is an absolute disaster for this reason. I can never tell which ally's units I'm looking at, or if I'm fighting multiple opponents on the same VP.

It may be not be important to everyone, but there's likely a lot of other people who have this issue and it isn't just me. Please consider a colourblind mode for the HUD, or a CoH 2 option for the player-specific colours.",1677479980,1680750029,True,0,1,0.407407373189926147,0,True,False,False

Edit: So I beat the Italy campaign. 

The implementation of the overworld map and RTS map (ala TotalWar) is pretty good idea wise. The choices it makes sometimes is weird though (where if I attack sometimes I will get a defense scenario, etc.) 

The UI in the campaign also has issues. For example, you have to attack the monastery before the US bombs it, however the quest log doesn't tell you the prereqs, you have to know to hover over the monastery to see the requirements. By the time I figured this out, it was too late for me to make a landing at the train artillery city (I ended up dropping paratroopers on it) AND attack the monastery. However, since IRL the monastery was bombed during the war, this was the canon choice and I'm not too upset by it. This is also true of events like 'cure malaria' where I brought a unit to do the medic heal function but it wanted me to deploy a transport plane and drop supplies. 

For the most part it was ok though. The characters were a little annoying (like the American general complains that the British general wants supplies, and the British general says he doesn't like ice cream... yeah idk). 

Some bugs beyond UI, like when one of my bombers was just sitting in the water and I couldn't scrap it, so basically for 30 turns it just sat there. 

The few story missions there are (where you aren't just in a random skirmish or scenario like ""defend your MG nest"" or ""attack their MG nest"") can be fun. Though I was meh about the final mission, as while controlling 2 armies made it feel more epic, the Germans just kind of sat there while I bombarded them with air strikes/artillery/etc. which made it kinda less epic.

I'll do the North Africa campaign next, but I don't think it would make me recommend the game. I would like a DoW4 where ship battles ala Gothic Armada 2, troop battles ala DoW1/2, solo battles ala Spacemarine, and campaign battles ala this, totalwar, crusaderkings, etc. formed a complete experience... but I dream...

Final update: 
Nah the other campaign, while closer to CoH2, is meh. It actually emphasized something I missed in the previous review, the vehicles drive horribly. Sometimes they reverse like you tell them, sometimes they go on a joy ride and get themselves killed.

I could say that the Campaign sucks, or that the balance is goofed, that the strategic depth is lost in the sheer stupidity of a blob of guys standing out of cover getting shot by tank shells (?); or a mass of medium tanks being virtually unkillable.

I could talk about how tanks will drive in circles, lurch suddenly in a direction you don't want them to, or spin in place at the worst possible times.

This COH seems to combine some of COH and COH 2. There are details and features that really improve the experience IMO.

Single Player should improve with updates, there are a few issues with it. I dont play Multiplayer so I have no idea about balance on that part.

Im running this game on a very old system.

I expected it to be a rough ride going in, and I have to admit, I found it to be fun in its current state.  Now that being said, there are no shortage of improvements and quality of life updates that Relic needs to implement asap.  If you were to compare CoH2 in its current state, with all of its DLCs side by side with CoH3 in its current state, I currently feel like CoH2 is better overall.  I must admit though, the foundation and bones of CoH3 are good!  The core gameplay is enjoyable, and if updated, patched, and improved enough, it could one day rival or even potentially surpass its predecessors.  

RELIC/SEGA - Need to get their game developers to go back over CoH2 with all of the DLCS with closer attention to detail and play a bunch more skirmishes together.  Then they need to closely review and compare all of the features that were in that game at its peak and compare it to CoH3 in its current state.  Lastly, they need to review the community's reviews (including the top review here on Steam), and address all of the issues that arise accordingly.  It will take time to do this properly.  That's fine!  If they do it right, then CoH3 will become a solid 9/10 or greater in time. 

Some of the new mechanics and tactical abilities in CoH3 are great!  I enjoy breaching occupied buildings, and having infantry ride on the back of tanks to get across terrain quicker.

On the other hand, where are all of the basic mechanics that we had in the game prior?  Why can't we surrender a match once it's 10 minutes in like we used to?  Why can't we adjust the scale of how large our HUD is?  Seriously, my tactical selections and mini-map eat up about a 3rd of my 4k monitor's real estate.  What's with that?  Speaking of resolutions, why are some of them restricted unless you play in windowed mode?  The UI/HUD, menu, and adjustable options are very basic, and their quality cheapens the overall feel of the game.  They need to be overhauled.  Speaking over things that need to be overhauled, some of the sound design in this game is extremely rough.  The voice lines of most of the units I've heard so far are solid, but some of the guns, and vehicles sounds like they are still using drafted stand-ins that you wouldn't expect to hear in a fully-flushed and released game with a $60.00 price tag.  I like the factions, I feel like they need a few more units in them, even if they are just imports from the previous games, at this point, I'd welcome the verity.  

Neat ideas I'd like to see added?  Not required - but it would be cool to have a tech-level option in custom games for early war and late war tech.  I get it, North Africa and Italy used some much older tech than was used in 44' and 45', but it would be neat to have the option to enable later war technology within the options so players could experiment and play around with tactics using those units.  Just a thought.

All and all, I think it's fun.  I think $60.00 in it's current state is a big ask, I think $30.00 or $40.00 tops would be more fitting for the content included, but it is enjoyable.  

Lets cross our fingers Relic/Sega will continue to play close attention to this title, patch, update, and polish the current framework they have into a proper squeal that would be expected in the Company of Heroes franchise.  After all, we only get about 1 title every decade or so, and I'd hate to see it putter out when it has the potential to be just as good or better than the others in time if handled properly.",1680670237,1680670237,True,7,3,0.530919432640075684,0,True,False,False

I have 215 hours under my belt and have been a log term COH fan with 1000+ hours on previous titles playing all factions. I have played the sigleplayer, but mostly the multiplayer. It would be nice if they had a unit index with stats in the game menu like you can see hovering over units in the game. Fortunatly they did fix one issues I had with the recent patch by putting the stats for emplacments since they are missing it in the end game statistics. I would like to know how well my Flak 88 did in conparison to others. Overall a really great game with a bit of polishing needed for perfection.

Positives:
______________

+ Great graphics and ray tracing capabilities.
+ Two campaigns and multiplayer modes.
+ Four different factions (armies) rather than just 2 that COH2 released with.
+ Good combination of turn-based and real-time tactics.
+ Keybind customization has been a massive improvment. 
+ Fun and easy to play.
+ Achievements and trading cards.
+ Most issues dont effect gamplay or have a very minimal effect.
+ I love that radar allows you to see if the unit is infantry or vehicle but does not allow you to see the type  unlike previous COH. 
+ Gameplay improvements like auto vaulting, side armor, riding on tanks, towing guns, height advantage.
+ No crashes or game breaking issues wich is more than you can say for allot of other tripple A releases these days. 
+ Side armour and destruction characteristis are all amazing. 
+ Canadian, Australian, and other units as well as more maps to come.
+ Recent patches addressed balancing issues such as Wermact Ketten geting upgraded and caping upgraded resource points from the start. 
+ Good player base with adverage players at 9,157.8 in last month. 
+ Daily and Weekly Challenges as well as unlockable skins keep the game going as well. 	

Negatives:
_______________

- There are some important features still to be added in game such as replay system and in game rank system.
- I think pathing has been mentioned in other reviews as an issue as well and I am sure they will adress it. It has happened to me three times since release and I have a decent ammount of hours at 215.  Edit: Looks like the recent patch has fixed some pathing issues so to be seen if this is entierly resolved. 
- Little disapointed in the current background art for the game. Iron harvest had amazing artists.
- If you liked the defensive sim city play of British then that is no longer a thing unless they add new battlegroups that allow it.
- Price tag is quite high but comparable to other tripple A games these days (approx $80 CAD).
- They have skins in the main menu but it would be great to have the stats in an in game ecyclopidia as well. 
- Missing the surrender button from previous COH titles.
- Some units have wrong icons (Kettenkrad is represented as a jeep in the Menu).
- No separate heath bar for both the crew and the health of team weapons like the Flak 88.
- Increaced zoom out would have been a good overall COH improvment but it remans the same.
- Can't view the map at the end of the game.
- No multiplayer turn based mode. 


Company of Heroes 3 is quite fun and detailed, with lots of new content to come and allot of replayability value.

Aside from the multiplayer test that took place before launch, I've played only single-player in COH3. I have over 500 hours in COH2 and I have a decent understanding of what the multiplayer experience is like in COH3 at the moment. Let's talk about things that all players would experience: UI, sound, gameplay. 

The UI is horrible. The main menu alone has yards of wasted space and for some reason several important menu pages are hidden behind a hamburger menu at the top right of the screen. This would make sense on a mobile phone screen, but not on a modern computer monitor. The campaign UI is also really bad, as there are (or were before patches) many elements that were clearly placeholders or used old wording. There's hardly any explanation for many elements. Like why can't a certain company unlock a certain unit? No idea, because there's no helper text or hover text. How do I do things? Why do things happen? No explanation for a lot of it. But they did go through the extra effort of making extremely annoying characters that talk constantly while you play. Cutscenes are STILL not skippable. The campaign will never be pleasant to replay if we can never skip all the crap we've already seen and heard. All in all, it's like they needed another 3 - 6 months on the UI alone.

The sound is forgettable, the music is sad compared to the previous title, and there really is no atmosphere at all. Seems like no inspiration here.

Gameplay is okay, its much like the previous games. But it is not as good as the previous games because of the vehicle pathing which is absolutely garbage, AI, and the aforementioned UI. 

Then of course there's the business practices: cosmetics store drops while the game is in the toilet and the community wants to see progress on making the game's quality match the expectations.

Maybe in time I'll come back to a better executed game and maybe I'll even buy some cosmetics, but this has been a terrible launch. Relic comes off as money hungry and untrustworthy when they launch a game in this condition. Don't forget, they even delayed it from the Nov 2022 launch.

A hotfix then came out to fix players ability to farm dailies, the dailies themselves are fucking terrible. If you think blobbing is bad how about, ""build and upgrade 5 panzerjaegers in a single multiplayer game"" shit is ridiculous. Relics priority isnt even fixing the game but pushing out cash grabs. The TTK for infantry units is waaaayy to long.

However, with this latest patch, Operation Sapphire Jackal, they introduced an incredibly shortsighted store and challenge system. If you did not enjoy the grind in CoH 2 it was made worse in the sequel. 

Only thing CoH 3 does better than its predecessor with regards to micro-transactions is that they are not yet selling Battlegroups (previously ""Commanders"" in CoH 2) and that is it. In lieu of paying straight cash for an item you now have to purchase premium currency called ""War Bonds"". CoH 2's free in-game currency ""Supply"" is now called ""Merit"" but only obtained by interacting with the challenge system. Additionally, where in CoH 2 you could earn damn near everything for free including commanders (after a ridiculous amount of time of course) it is not possible to earn the premium skins in CoH 3. Those are only available with the War Bonds. 

And I do mean a ridiculous amount of time. I have 5,800+ hours into CoH 2.

This system is broken up into two categories: Weekly and Daily. They range from quickly achievable (build 3 mg nests in one match), to ridiculous time sinks (kill 50 vehicles as whatever faction), to counter-intuitive (upgrade 5 squads with X weapon in a match), or irritatingly specific (Kill 50 of X type of vehicles/unit). If you're a PvP player you can kiss some of these challenges goodbye as you may never see, or need, the type of unit required for challenge completion. 

Merit skins are put into a ""Highlights"" section of the store which comes complete with a FOMO (fear of missing out) timer at the top. But you can buy them with War Bonds! So don't miss out!.........

Again, CoH 3 has a solid foundation but Relic/Sega needs to pull their heads out. Currently this game does not respect your time, your intelligence, or your wallet (Give an  'F' for those that bought the ""Premium"" edition). Also, as you can see from other negative reviews, actual gameplay has taken a step back from CoH 2 in some areas. 

Hell, Battlegroups haven't even been mentioned by Relic on whether or not they'll charge for those again as well. If the current challenge system, and the old ""Supply"" cost of Commanders in CoH 2, and time required to unlock just one are anything to go off of...Yeah, no thanks.

I have about 2000ish hours in coh2 multiplayer, combat in coh3 feels too different from coh2 for me to be fun, and there's one big reason for that:

Combat has way less consequences than in coh2. Time to kill is way lower, forward reinforcement is everywhere. This actively encourages sitting near your reinforcement truck or emplacements and blobbing in order to kill infantry fast enough. and discourages big flanks or dives like the ones that were the norm in coh2. This turns coh3 into a game of ""who can kill the other teams reinforcement truck first"" and ""which player can make the other blob retreat first""

Like there's a mission where you get given a 17 pounder AT gun but after that mission you never see it again, you can't get that gun ever again, they have a 17 pound artillery gun but but it doesn't act as an AT gun like the one you get in a mission, just an AT gun you have to tell where to bombard. Infantry fights are now slow and awful, before if you had units in full cover and an enemy unit came at them in open ground they'd be dead in seconds, NOW the infantry miss 70% of their shots, the shots that do hit barely do any damage, it's like watching people throw tiny sticks at eachother for 10 minutes. The US airborne special unit is absolutely useless. In previous COH the US paras were amazing units, they killed so quickly at CQB when upgraded with Thompsons they shredded enemies  now they can't be upgraded to have Thompsons and the carbine's are fucking terrible, you run them up to an enemy unit and they still barely do any damage and then mostly die, and you can't engage with them from further ranges because the Carbines miss all the time and inflict so little damage that using the Airborne company is a waste of time. The time to kill is just ridiculously long, they've made the game aesthetic's waaaay too colourful and cartoony, the stupid unit colour system where vehicles have red and blue strips down them break my immersion and realism in the game, like I'm not a retard I can tell the difference between Allied and Axis troops without everything being painted blue/yellow and red. NO FIREFLY TANK for British forces. This game is a mere shadow in comparison to COH and COH 2 hell I still think COH is the best one but I can't play it anymore because it goes spastic on windows 10. The units are awful in each faction SOME are okay the rest can't win any fights on their own and tanks omg the TANKS are horrible shots when shooting at infantry they miss all the fucking time and can take an M4 sherman 5 minutes just to kill a single squad, watching it shoot it's MG's at infantry and watching the health bar slowly go down makes my brain hurt only way to make them effective is upgrading the 50. mounted at the top but I'm sorry the front and turret 30.'s should kill infantry quickly instead of acting like water guns. The art style is too colourful making the game look like it's a slice of life anime or fortnite rather than a gruesome war. I'm ranting like fuck but I just hate seeing whats been done here. I liked the idea of the Italian campaign all they had to do was import the units from COH 2 improve the visuals a little bit and add new mechanics in and keep the art style the same dark war time feely shit and slap in new campaigns, but no for the sake of trying to be creative and take it in a new direction they've completely ruined the feel of the previous 2 games. In fact it feels like a completely different franchise in a bad way. It's just terrible. Oh yeah and the tutorial gives you Matilda tanks, go into campaign... no Matilda's. WHY? why only add units in here and there but not make them available in game. The game design is just poor. It's like it was made for sheltered 8 year olds rather than for the long term COH players.

This game is....nothing special. The gameplay is no different from COH 1 or 2. The graphics are no better than COH 2 and the art style is bad. Everything looks muddy and lacks character, while somehow being more ""colorful"".

The North African campaign is dull. The overarching story feels disconnected and the individual mission narratives feel like the add-ons for COH (i.e. low production value) without the interesting mission structure. The missions are rote and by the numbers.

The Italian campaign could have been good, but its quite flawed. The story is non-existent, which would have been acceptable if it was like Total Warhammer and produced awesome emergent situations & storytelling. But that is not the case. The strategy layer is dull, clunky, and the enemy AI it sits around and waits for you to attack it. The real-time battles are just skirmishes against AI, or the occasional set-piece mission which have no unique mechanics or stories.

Overall this game isn't great. If you've played COH 1 or 2, then there is not enough new here for a good singleplayer experience. If you're new to COH it might be worth playing, but I recommend the COH 1 campaign over this game.",1680580728,1680580728,False,11,0,0.54805290699005127,0,True,False,False

There are many quality of life features that, in no excusable way, are missing from this game. 

Relic has shown now with their latest update that they dont give a single fuck about this games current state. With their first major patch they released their store of over priced, predatory, and unfinished ""premium"" content. Alongside the store  they included basic balance and a couple quality of life additions that they pass as ""features"" of their unfinished shell of a game. 

In a sad state of today's game companies, this game would be passable at an initial price tag of 10-20$. But as a full price game, this game is no where near complete and no where near worth the $60 price tag. I imagine in a year or so this game will finally resemble something of a proper Company of Heroes sequel. But today it isnt even close.

I do have to point out that I started playing this franchise in Coh2 and I never got the chance to try Coh1 so keep that in mind.

Company of heroes 3 is not like 2 in a sense that how the flow of the game works and unit diversity through upgrade path. It plays differently and stuff that common and normal in Company of Heroes 2 does not apply to Company of Heroes 3. The game is a lot of fun but due to harsh reality that is heavy changes on balance adjustments, missing important features and lots of small bugs makes it hard to recommend. Currently as of this patch 1.1.1 they have implemented store in the main menu and patched the game several times with hotfixes and one normal patch. Despite all of this, it is telling that the game still needs a lot of work. They have this fixation to nerf several things at once while buffing the opposite at the same patch. Balance changes such as unit's effective, cost, and build time and how ability/veterancy requirment interact.

Some bugs / weird design choice decision are brutal for a game like this and these are the issues I can point out immediately.

- Smoke canister from tanks (Wehrmacht) do not work.
- Sniper will focus on vehicle for some reason, revealing itself.
- Mainline squad units holding their gun while it's floating in the air. 
- Pathfinding for medium and heavy tanks is awkward. They sometimes take weird route path and sometimes spins when confused with environment.
- Any MG Squad in all faction is not strong against blobbing strategy or at least does not really feel like it. I did not find MG to be powerful against large blob of infantry, relative to Coh2 in my experience at least.

There's more I can point out but the conclusion here is that there are some really good improvement when compared to Company of Heroes 2 and yet the issues stand out more, like a stain on a shirt that can't be removed due to problem(s) with the people in decision of this game. They clearly put a lot of work and yet it still needed more time even with delayed schedule. Thankfully the foundation of the game is great and I hope the people in decision of this game can make use of this to work on the problem without impacting the rules of this game (The foundation)

Ultimately I believe Company of Heroes 3 will surpass Company of Heroes 2 but the one to make that change into reality is nor me or the community. That is for Relic or whoever in charge of decision to answer. They can put money where their mouth is and focus on improving the new experience of Company of Heroes franchise or continue with halfassed changes.

Single campaign is decent-mediocre at its best. I appreciate the effort but it is brainless activity. And all because AI cant stand a chance, not much of a challenge more like a constant effortless tutorial.

- VP matches last barely like 15 mins. Who takes the early lead, wins the game. In a good RTS matches tides turns plenty of time during the match, but this doesn't give a chance for it before the time runs out. No time to even build a first tank before times up. Mostly infantry (read OP flamethrowers) vs infantry. Those rare times when the teams are even, it's pretty enjoyable game.
- Only few maps. Mostly open areas which favors either side.
- No ranked, no ranks, no stats, nothing about it.
- Map zoom is terrible but playable.

+ Atleast first COH which graphics is very well optimized.

this game couldve been a masterpiece but instead you fucked up pretty hard
first you promised a release of the game and let people preorder it for a ton of money, even though you knew you could never hold the date of the first release
then you have to delay the release into 2023, promising the community a nice finished game
and what did we get on the actual release? a fricking unfinished beta with a bland campaign, tons of bugs, a shitty ui and with coh2 symbols still as placeholder...
and for that crap you charged people 70€
now, 3 months later you could think the devs are working on bugfixes, balancing and overall game improvements
but hell no, the first thing that comes to their mind is implementing a fkn shop system like in a mobile game...where you, which allready did spend 70 bucks, can spend even more money 
so that shows whats really in the developers minds: 
1)release an unfinished game
2)implement a shop system where you can buy shitty unrealistic skins for real money
3)profit

The only upgrade are the animations for vehicle destruction being really nice. My units don't retreat when I say retreat. Instead, they stand there and get shot at and die despite having the retreat symbol above their head. I've got alot of experience of the COH games on both 1 and 2. 

Current smooth brain meta: German medical car. Use medical car literally anywhere in the first 5 minutes of the game, and you'll win. On some match, my 6 man US rifle squad chased down a 2 man assault gren squad. The 2 men run for like.. 300 meters ALL THE WAY back to the medical car without taking any losses, fully reinforce, turn around and attack my guys. I had to retreat. Apparently I have a better chance at winning the lottery than my 6 man squad not killing the remaining 2 in an assault gren squad despite them being shot in the back. 

Simple solution and I don't have to be a game dev to figure it out: if the medical car or the SQUAD is in combat, it cannot reinforce squads. Only halftracks should be able to reinforce in combat, that at least gives players more time before that halftrack gets out onto the field. Currently, frontline presence is way to strong with a medical car in the back just reinforcing everything, including blobs

Other complaints:
When I tell my vehicles to face forward, they do a couple of U turns before finally facing forward.
Bersaglieri are now overpowered
Everything is way too bright 
Height advantage and cover are extremely inconsistent. My squads will be behind concrete and still not have green cover.
Pressing R to reverse move vehicles is inconsistent, most of the time I have to micro the vehicles reverse retreat path alot just to ensure that the juicy fat ass rear armor doesn't get presented to the enemy
Blobbing is still a problem
Any unit paradropping anywhere on the map at the start of the game is terrible, this needs to be fixed

Final thoughts:
Literally wait till this game is on sale for 5 dollars, don't spend 60 dollars on it. Currently, game is not worth 60 dollars.

They have fixed some bugs, but the balance in this game is a joke and with the latest patch (waited 4 weeks for it) they changed barely anything in the balance.  It is still a massive blob/attack move win the game on some factions.  What did they do with their latest patch after the community at all levels was asking for changes?  They put in a store to ring more money out of people.

Feels like a barely supported title they are going to try and cash grab and milk until the population dies, we already have 5 to 10 minute queues to play the game because of population decline.

I’m a long time fan of the series, starting with COH2, then falling in love with the 1st opus that I found being a gem. 
The story driven campaigns in CoH1&2 were just so immersive. Graphics were
astonishing at the time of the release. 
CoH1 was so good, it event got modded by some fans of the community to create new fronts, armies, or missions/campaigns. 

Unfortunately, I have the impression CoH3 has been rushed to meet with its already delayed release date, and that new generations don't need such immersion and strategy anymore.

The african campaign is just empty with no good story driven missions. I finished it though, and my feeling was, ""That's it ???!!!, boring.""
The italian campaign in its core is a very good idea. But it lacks some kind of""energy"". It feels (after finishing the campaign) too linear and repetitive apart of the few story driven missions appearing here and there that could be good if there was a bit of strrategy. But no, it's just always the same scenario that happens at the end. enemy units are placed always in a same kind of manner, that you can nearly predic what's going to happen.
 
Its game mechanics feel unachieved, moves on the map are very slow (no option to trigger fast or slow), skirmish missions are too repetitive, and once you’ve understood the AI, it becomes a piece of cake to finish it within minutes whether it is defensive or agressive mode. 

Also, I don’t like that all the factions look the same in terms of building mechanics.At the end, you don't feel much difference. Or, it should be obvious. 
I loved the british able to move their biildings around the map, and the two so different german factions on CoH1&,or2. It gave more depth to the strategy you are going to need if you chosed one or another. 

I always stick to these advices, ""don’t change too much a receipe that is successful, add some new improvements, etc…, like the strategic map, but the core of the game should stick to its roots. 
Graphically, yeah lah, it's ok. But you can see it hasn't changed much from the 2nd opus.
Mission tasks appearing in the middle of the screen at the beginning and in the middle of a game in the campaign are extremely annoying
So, finally I rate it 4 out of 10. I don't wait anymore for a Massive update that would change drastically the game, because I know it's not going to happen.

I don't know what developpers think, but it seems that to their eyes we are stupid and blind.
Men Of War 2 is going to be the same as COH3. I participated to the open beta Multiplayer, and it's even worse than COH3, where MOW Assault Squad 2 was wonderful.

This game should be post-boned another year and should refund all the purchases.




EDIT:

After playing this game for almost 100 hours I can with my full heart say that this game was designed for nothing more than to be a money grabber. It is not made with passion but Only money in mind.

90% of the times you loose everything it boils down to pathfinding which has not improved since 2006. But actually got worse. The developpers have not put enough love into the game and EVERYWHERE you see where they've made shortcuts. Wether this is visuals or game mechanics.

Update 1 of the game was:

NEW CONTENT. WE INCLUDED A STORE SO YOU CAN PURCHASE SKINS. No new battlegroups. No new divisions. No balance remake. No new Maps. No matchmaking system (it takes up to 10 minutes to find a match, and yes this is unranked). Which leads me to: No player progression. No Ranked games. 

These are ALL basic functions that you'd expect on LAUNCH. But basic features like replay is nonexistant. The match statistics throws you out after 10-15 seconds. And reporting a player crashed the game.

All in all this is a AAA game

I loved the games massively, in fact going so far as to saying I love the Relic style strategy games in general, owning all of the DoW games and their respective DLC too. But I wanted to lay down the Pro's & Con's for his game so you can make an informed decision.

Pro's:
- The game is fun! In terms of gameplay, it runs smoothly, the action feels just like a Company of Heroes title and it really makes me want to play another round with units feeling responsive while remaining balanced from what I've seen. 
- Maximum graphics at 144FPS without any dropping.
- The Voice acting is brilliant. I love all the British forces voices, listening to them just gives me a sense of nostalgia and I know a lot of work has been put into this area of development.
- Loading times are super quick! I am running off of an NVMe and each game loads within moments.
- Where I had a few crashes in the Multiplayer play test, the developers seem to have righted all of that and fingers cross, no issues whatsoever thus far.
- Strategic Single-Player pausing element is incredibly fun and really well done. I love this element and it really brings a new level to the gameplay.
- In game talent/tech tree system is very fun and nicely laid out to make the game more varied from match to match.

Grey Area:
- Personally I have found the AI to be fairly good within the limited time I've been playing, finding the enemy AI - Tough Difficulty -  to be a decent amount of resistance, however I have heard from other others that the AI replacements in online play have been dreadful. I wanted to note this as my personal experience has been positive.

Con's:
- This game looks dated by today's standard. The models have more detail than in CoH2 and the ground textures look better but honestly, this game looks like it was made not long after CoH2. It really isn't doing any favours for the game. The game looks a lot more sterile than the previous games too and with so much of the action taking place within the Desert; you would have hoped for the game to include something thematic like sandstorms - as they did with the snowstorms in CoH2 - or to at least have more times of the day so each map felt more distinct.
- The audio is lacking punch in it's combat sections. Admittedly this makes it easy to distinguish where things are happening on and around the screen but War is chaotic and if you go back to CoH1 or 2 you will find a much more immersive experience.
- CAMERA ZOOM! This genuinely made me cross. The game feels too zoomed in at all times! This is an issue I have had with all CoH games but I really wish they would allow us to zoom out more. If I could rectify anything about the game first, it would be this!
- The Campaign (from the limited time I've had with it) serves more as a tutorial system as you progress - something that many games do - but is fairly boring to be honest. I couldn't tell you much about a single mission I have played as nothing has really managed to stand out thus far.
- The pre-order incentive is crap. It basically focuses on the US alone and makes the infantry look so out of place. In my opinion it should have focused on giving a little something for each faction and kept it realistic. Genuinely disappointed here.
- There seems to be a lack of so much! What I mean by this is; No profile customisation, no replay system, you get kicked out at the end of online matches so you don't get long to see the stats, no match history section and no final layer of polish. 
- The price tag is honestly just too high for what we got. It doesn't feel like a punchy, heavy hitting ""Triple A"" title.

My overall thoughts: 
I enjoy the gameplay and want to play some more, but I don't know for how long. It doesn't feel like it expands upon the previous games formula at all. Spending £70 - going for Premium due to my love of the series - on a title in 2023 should make you feel like you're playing a ""Triple A"" game but honestly, that is not how I'm feeling. I feel let down, overcharged and underwhelmed by this game. Relic has not learned from Dawn of War 3 and I can see myself uninstalling the game and waiting for 6 months for DLC and patches to see where the game has progressed. Save your money for when it's discounted and keep an eye on how the developers react in the next few months. There is definitely some fun to be had here but I am very much on the fence as to how I feel about it and certainly wish I hadn't pre-ordered and waited for a discount as the incentive was very lacklustre for me.",1677298461,1680380391,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The UI is a contender for worst UI of 2023.
We waited patiently for an update only to be given cosmetics and an online store in lieu of much needed fixes and improvements.

The sound direction they've gone for is simply poor. They try to justify it as cinematic, but it's not - it's bad.

Numerous bugs and imbalances that take you weeks to fix and the game still has a buch of issues and imbalances in the opposite direction still. You have a very limited variety of maps, factions and commanders at the release of the game. So far it seems like you rushed the release because you were pushed to and needed to make some money right away. Ok thats pretty standard nowadays unfortunately. THEN you decide to release the so unticipaded store in the worst possible manner, again in an attempt to make quick easy money. There are not skins for every unit or vehicle in any faction. You have bundles that have specific units and vehicles included in it and if someone wants to get a complete set of a skin for a SPECIFIC faction he needs to buy multiple bundles that are not even available at the same time. And don't get me started at the fact that you released a tundra skin for Vehrmacht when there is NO GOD DAMN WINTER MAP at this point. At the same time we are given the ""option"" to farm some Merit in order to be able to get a very small percentage of the skins that you are releasing in the game but there is ALSO a catch. Not only do we have to play specific factions in order to complete some of the challenges, even though we may simply not like playing some of them. Not only we have to play in multiplayer mode or random co-op mode even though we may also not like playing in these modes. Now after your last update you also make custom games and map mods unable to give Merit to players. In a game where you rely heavily on moders to generate maps for your game in order to keep it interesting and exciting, you just removed the option of being able to farm Merit (a god damn digital product) from moded maps. Like what the hell are you even thinking at this point when making any of the decisions you are making? All these decisions just make me think that you care very little about your player base because not only you imply an atrocious, mobile game inspired, store but you also want to make players play the game the way YOU want to instead of letting them just play it the way they want to. All in all i am very dissapointed in how you are handling the game in every way so far and especially after the store release. I really wish you will at some point get your shit together and start listening to players and start delivering what they deserve and what you are supposed to instead of trying to make this game a cash crab patch after patch. At this state I dont recommend to anyone playing this game not because it is a bad game, because it is not, but because Relic doesn't respect its player base or the money that they paid to play their game.",1680272619,1680272826,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bugs
Yes, there are a lot of those. Missing not playing audio sounds. Visuals not executing well. Weird and funny bodies that jitter around. Weathering effects that just look weird. Overall a general lack of polish (by comparisaon to AoE4 at launch).

Audio
I think that is my biggest problem at the moment. Previous titles had distinctive audio samples that you could pick apart and were able to tell whats going on by just closing your eyes and listening. In Coh3 that is not possible. Some sounds are weak and and you can hardly distinguish them from other sources (e.g. machine guns). In some cases that might be fixed with loudness range but now a K98 sounds like a shot but a MG42 sounds like a BB gun on auto fire. the same could also be said for grenades and mortar fire. Realism aside its a game and audio queues are a big deal when it comes to assess the chaos of Company of Heroes.

Comparing it to the newly launched Coh3 wouldn´t been fair as it lacks the polish of the last 10 years. Its a new game and engine. However, if you are looking for a fully polished and refined experience maybe you should continue with Coh2 until 3 is ready.

Developers are more concerned with selling skins in the store then players having a good experience in the auto match.
Only 2 maps for 2v2 auto match.  Other maps are never selected in auto match
only 2 maps for 4v4 auto match.
auto match vs the computer has no difficulty settings....
Hot keys have changed from COH2 and can not be changed.
lack of ranked auto match
tanks can not crush people
not enough maps at launch
Lack of bridge maps.  Maps like lyon and Vire are classic maps and need to be in the game.  Players have always loved bridge maps to play against the computer.
too zoomed in
only 3 doctrines..... i really liked the COH2 profile of commanders that you could pick the 3 that best suited your playing style. with only 3 commanders it is more like COH 1.
units move very slow
Mg facing in houses is bad
menu buttons in the top right hand side in the match host screen can not be closed once opened.  these block out the ability to add and remove players on the right side of the screen
Graphic look the same as COH2
Campaign sucks
when do you get to play COH3 in campaign.... 20 minutes in nothing but auto combat
No way to surrender the match.....lame
I get kicked after automatch verses the comp after my game before I can read the stats.
the building seem to be too tall for how zoomed in the game is.. hard to see around some tall buildings
Missing theater of war mode from COH2..... I really liked that mode.  More Historical accurate weapons and tanks.
battles take much longer.  cover is very strong.  Must make flamers to counter the cover.  Grenades should be more effective against heavy cover.   Buildings are weaker because of building assault function.
double click to build base buildings is very nice upgrade
when you get kicked from a custom game it kick you all the way out the the front page, not just back to the custom game screen.
Tactical Pause added orders to units while paused not changes orders.... this is different then COH 1 & 2..... I do not like this feature 
Lack Of sniper units....only the Wher an USA have a sniper....I like snipers.  I miss the old British sniper with cheap arty smoke.


New Features
elevation advantage
auto vaulting
auto reinforce
towing weapons 
troops ride on tanks
auto base building

New units
flak cannon that is hybrid of mg and AT gun - good against infantry and light Armour

No Surrender function

I am excited for the future of this game.

Even though still stand by what I said, the addition of such abhorent mtx filled store to the game is unacceptable for a 60-80 dollar/euro game I'm all for keeping the game runing but this is redicoulus, the daily and weekly challeges are nice but but they should let you earn everything everything that is in the game.

I've got hundreds of hours in both of those games, as a fan of the franchise I can take a balanced perspective here. The Sapphire Jackal ""update"" does nothing except add an in game cash shop for cosmetics. 1 month after release this is not what we needed and shows Relic is taking this in the wrong direction. That is what inspires me to post this review.

The launch overall: 
The launch of this game is actually pretty good compared to COH 2. COH 2 only launched with 2 factions, where as this launched with 4. Coh 2 also had bugs and glitches just like this game, it also went through a long time period of the meta being totally broken, but from a casual player perspective this might not be noticeable. The campaign in this game is also more substantial albeit a bit repetitive.

Pro:
+4 factions at launch.
+Solid gameplay 
+Less buggy then coh2 at launch
+Good singleplayer.

Con:
-Not enough maps in multiplayer
-Only 3 battle-groups per faction leading to a lack of options
-Repetitive multiplayer
-No replays
-No way to tell which player is named which on your team
- No surrender button
-Shorter games. (in 1v1 or 2v2 you might never get to tanks because the game ends too fast)
-Insulting first update with the cash shop.
-Graphics are worse then the previous game, yet more demanding on hardware.

Given that - Relic still have the gall to release the ingame store featuring skins that are real money only.

I will never change this review going forward since Relic decided that after releasing an unfinished game; that their priority for update 1.1 should be to push out micro-transactions and a barely functional marketplace instead of fixing the game. This type of cancer is destroying gaming, an absolute disgrace.

Game is vast compared to predecessors and has a slew of improvements in nearly every metric. That said, the game is unfinished and literally has some placeholder icons still. It feels like I paid to beta test. The multiplayer is far from finished, with barely any functionality to the Multiplayer menus/UI/Lobby. There are very few maps too. The commanders feel complete and there are plenty, time will tell which are balanced. The campaign for North Africa is well done and feels well finished. The Italy campaign with its new campaign map gameplay seems hollow and does not feel as if it has changed much since its beta release except in scope of the campaign map.

The concept of the game is cool, but it is so poorly done I can't recommend it, unfortunately. The armor is completely broken and absolutely ruins the game. You'll have Pz. III tanks with a 50mm knocking out M4A3E8 Shermans armed with 76mm's that went through Pz. III's and Pz. IV's like tissue paper and armor that shrugged off 50mm rounds in real life. Then on the flip side you have M3 Stuarts (lower armored versions of the M5 with the same 37mm gun) going toe to toe with Panthers, armor from all factions taking a dozen hits from antitank rockets such as bazookas and panzerschrecks. Then you have the M16 with four .50cal HMG's hammering infantry that charge straight through the fire, barely taking any damage, then an 8-Rad not only wiping the M16, it takes half a dozen bazooka hits as it absolutely shreds a commando team.

I bring up the updates as a bonus because updates show they are still working on it, but the updates are actually a con in this case as with every update it seems to make it worse. They've introduced a store, which you can earn in-game currency by completing challenges, but the challenges REQUIRE you to play multiplayer (solo vs. AI doesn't earn currency), and, someone did the math, to earn the currency through challenges will take literal weeks to unlock anything. So, while they have a broken armor system with terrible balances and completely unrealistic damage systems, missions that are bugged so you have to restart them [b](have experienced)[/b], and campaign breaking bugs preventing some from completing the Italian campaign [b](have not experienced)[/b], they are adding a store to take more of your money instead of fixing many of the glaring problems the game has.

Hopefully modders can save this because I'm losing faith that the devs can since a lot of these problems were prevalent in the betas and were discussed at length, but have yet to be fixed.

Sega's acquisition of Relic almost destroyed CoH 2, launching with buggy code, limited gameplay options, and an esport focus. It was only after a year of fan pushback that the game was saved, made playable, and made generally enjoyable.

With the development of CoH 3, Relic doubled down on their 'community involvement', and had done a fantastic job of hyping up this game, selling us on aspects like major mod-abilty, and all new game mechanics.

Then it released.
-Unfinished content
-Game breaking bugs.
-(arguably) The worst ingame Ai of the series 
-Content unashamedly ripped from CoH 1 &2 and pasted in jarringly
-A weird departure from long established game controls
-A base building system that makes Halo Wars' seem like a better idea.
-Limited maps, with limited replay factor
-A modding system so locked down it makes CoH 2 look open source (with the general consensus that this is to prevent modders adding content they wish to sell us in battlegroups later)

And to show that they have been thoroughly corrupted by Sega, the first real update and bug fix comes wholesale with a predatory ingame real money cosmetic system, which is a far cry from the way it worked in CoH2.
On top of the £50/70 asking price.

Don't get me wrong, the game introduces some really nice new features (new to the franchise at least), and can be fun to play - just not for long sessions or even daily.

Company of Heroes 2 had a lot going for it but I got annoyed by all the microtransactions and went back to CoH1. When CoH3 was announced, my great-nephew (yes, I'm that old), whom I'd recently introduced to the original CoH, was very excited about it and so I pre-ordered it for him for Christmas. Since I was the one he primarily played with, I ordered a copy for myself.

At first I was ecstatic with the game - I thought the graphics were fine in spite of the prevailing opinions, I liked the familiar feel to the original so I was able to jump right in, I liked the new Afrika Korps content, and I thought it had a lot going for it. Sure, it was a little buggy, but what game isn't right after release? And sure, there weren't a lot of mulitplayer maps available, but I knew that they would be making that a priority with future content, updates, and fixes.

So . . . . imagine my surprise when their first major update comes along and, yes, while some balance and bug issues were addressed, the thing they were most excited about was, not new multiplayer maps or additional content, but, get this, their online store. Yep. They made their online store, which is charging ridiculous amounts for skins, their priority. It's Company of Heroes 2 all over again. I was really hoping that CoH3 would be more than just a Relic money grab, but, alas, it doesn't appear to be going that direction.

If you are like me and really enjoyed the original CoH with its expansions, I would urge you to just stick with that and give CoH3 a pass for now.

While this game is amazing and I have been a fan since COH I can not say that I would recommend this game for a full price. Let me tell you why that is as of it's current state. 

PROS:
1) The COH game-play we all know and love. Relic has expanded on fundamental game-play that we all love such as cover. Now most engineer units and even some basic infantry units can build sandbag cover for fortification. That small detail adds strategic value to the game-play. 
2) Each unit has an ability that is unlocked through veteran status. Relic has given each player a reason to keep each unit alive. As each unit ranks up they unlock their ability. Those abilities are no longer unlocked through the upgrade feature. 
3) Each faction has a three commander type (Infantry, Armor or Mixed). Each commander has two tech trees that the player can then build off of. This gives the player the ability to shape the battle as it unfolds. 

CONS:

1) The game was released incomplete. Relic kinda screwed all of the loyal players with some simple features missing on release. Examples of those simple features are custom loadouts and skins for the players profile such as the plates for the players profile. With the new update they attempted to fix that but fell short (extremely short). 
2) With the new update (Operation Sapphire Jackal) Relic also added Challenges, which would promise the players with currency in the shop for cosmetics mentioned earlier. The downfall of those challenges? They reward a small amount for a large grind and the shop has very little to offer in return for the amount of time.
3) Paid Content. Most of the material in the shop requires the player to pay in war bonds which the player can purchase with money. I for one have no problem supporting Relic or any studio that has a great product in return for my investment but since the game was delayed and the store was released after the game then I feel hesitant on supporting more lazy content in the future. 

Overall this game is great, if you want a slightly better version of COH2 with very little content (including maps, I mean 4 maps per player count?). Relic has left me feeling empty and bored with COH3 which is a shame because I was extremely pumped when it was announced. Now it's hard for me to even look at the desktop icon and muster up enough self dignity to double click and watch as I waste another 45 minutes of my life on a match in order to kill 50 tanks as a certain faction. Trying to receive 400 dollars towards a 1000 cosmetic skin.

If you haven't purchased yet then wait. Give this game a year and I'm sure Relic will figure out their mistakes. If not then I'm sad to say...this is the end of COH.",1680079505,1680079505,True,23,3,0.611577749252319336,0,True,False,False

I won't deny the gameplay is great, the basic framework of the game is good and I have enjoyed a solid amount of the gameplay. But everything surrounding the gameplay is unacceptable for a fully priced AAA game that was delayed for polish. 

So many basic functions and UI aspects from the first two games are missing, 

- No surrender button, even post patch 1
- Only fixed team colours post patch 1 despite complaints during pre-alpha and beta
- Can only view player list by opening main menu
- Can't view what player is what colour
- Call in spawn issues that cause them to remain off map and uncontrollable
- No vehicle crush or infantry pushing, but vehicles can't path around one another because there is vehicle collision
- Some of the worst vehicle pathfinding I have ever seen
- Patch 1 added trimmed down 4v4 maps for 3v3, they couldn't be bothered to trim the minimap as well
- Post Game stat screen kicks you out after a certain time
- Post Game stat screen is often incorrect, showing models lost for some units and squads for others
- Barely any multiplayer maps on release
- A massive amount of bugs for a game that was delayed
- New ingame store has almost nothing available for purchase with the hard-to-obtain ingame currency, instead requiring actual cash payments.

On top of that, balancing is all over the place. This I can understand, balance has to be worked on once players get their hands on the game, but at the current state on top of everything else it makes the experience just unenjoyable.

This is all after the game was delayed, I can't imagine the state it would have been in on the original release date. And now, with the first patch, they announce their ingame store for cosmetics and accompanying ingame currencies. Out of the 16 packs in the store, only a single skin can be purchased with ingame currency, which based on the amount you gain from completing their ridiculous challenges (kill 50 tanks as british, things like that), mean you need to complete around 20 weekly challenges for a single skin. You can purchase their other currency for actual money, but obviously never in the increments that they actually sell the skins for. An Ingame store was introduced in Company of Heroes 2, the currency was obtainable in CoH 2. If you wanted, you could get every skin, minus those made by the community, for ingame currency and just from playing a game till the end. This could have been ported over into CoH 3, instead they decided to go for the option that will milk them the most money for the least effort. All on top of an $80 price tag for what is essentially an unfinished product. 

Company of Heroes 3 is a complete disappointment from a AAA game perspective, riddled with a lack of basic quality of life features, bugs, terrible balancing, and UI problems. Relics first major patch introduced a new way for them to get money rather than addressing many of these issues. As a longtime Company of Heroes fan, Company of Heroes 3 is a shameful and infuriating product that takes 1 step forward and 3 back for absolutely no reason.

For me, the core gameplay is fine. I enjoy it. I mainly play on comp stomp skirmishes and single player campaigns so for me, balance between factions is negligible issue. I would recommend other reviews for balance issues within a PvP/Competitive sense. What I have issue here, is everything else.

Single Player:

I have issues in this area that do not allow me to fully enjoy the content they have released. I currently suffer from a bug that has been there from launch. At the midpoint of the Italy grand campaign I have been soft locked. No amount of reloading the save can help me. The issues stems from an enemy AI unit on the overworld map trying to talk out of bounds (in this case the sea), failing and then repeating this in a constant loop. This soft locks the game as the enemy turn will not end. One would have to start again and hope the conditions of the softlock don't happen again. This bug has been from the start and has affected numerous people so I had hoped it would be a priority issue they could fixe. Sadly after the month and week of game release, it still persists. I was enjoying the campaign till this point. There are small issues that persist but they are not game breaking, just immersion. Core gameplay is mostly unaffected. I have to say, no campaign can be good if you can't finish it due to bugs.

The German narrative campaign single player campaign is hard to enjoy so I did not finish it. A had little too much romanticism of Rommel and the n a z i's to be enjoyable. With it's narrative of a Benghazi Jewish narrator and playing as a German makes it feel like the story it's trying to tell falls flat on it's face since you need to win as a German to continue. The juxtaposition between the two points leaves me confused, was this meant to be a British campaign when the story was wrote? I'm not sure what the goals as making this campaign.

Multiplayer Components:

Again, I mainly play on comp stomp skirmishes. So this covers what I can do with that. So I'll talk about AI tactics and maps.
Map I feel a bit under whelmed. While we have a workshop for fan made maps, it's not been out long enough to get some nice maps out. There are a few I like to play which have been made from the ground up but there are a lot that need work. I hope to see the tools used in the future with more experience under the belt so we can all get some banger maps. This isn't a fault of the game, just a thought for the future purchase you might make.
The relic made maps we have, look great. The quantity of them is....a bit meh. 
We have at the moment...
5, 1V1 maps
4, 2V2 maps
3, 3V3 maps
2, 4v4 maps

When you play with a couple of friends as a comp stomper your options get limited quickly. I expected a bit more at release and while I don't know what COH2 had I expected more from a modern 2023 game. Modded maps help alleviate this a bit but right now, expected to recognise maps fairly quickly. A shame since I saw many interested assets from single player (like garrisonable train carts and large pieces like Monte Cassio not used in any multiplayer maps).
The in game store.
I won't lie, I'm a bit of a whale since I got more money than time.
However the in game store really has some awful practices
 There is ONE good thing it does that other cash shops usually.
The smallest currency bundle is 600 Warbonds (premium currency)
A small infantry cosmetic pack is 540. 
This leaves you 60 left over. Usually this means you're stuck with it unless you buy more.
However there is single unit packs that cost 60, meaning you at least have something to use up what's left over.
That is the only ""good thing"" I can say and even that's not really praise, just convenient

Now the bad part...
The cosmetic packs... It's not good.

So. What is released atm is inadequate, over priced and just flat out lying at times.

Inadequate.
They are inadequate by not having an entire faction covered with a certain style. While you might have your afrikakorps assault grenadiers dressed up, your pioneers and basic grenadier units still in vanilla clothes. You may get your StuG dressed up but your Italian tanks have no options to buy. Half an army atm can be dressed up in a new style, the rest are stuck in vanilla. makes for a very mismatched army visually. 

Over priced.
Right now, to dress up half your army with the new cosmetics. It will cost you roughly £17/$20. So to dress up half of 2 factions is more than half the base game cost.
This ain't good, I can't fanboy justify that, no matter how hard you spin it.

Lying.
Really simple here.
the 17 pounder Green Skin pack in store has the crew and a truck in camo as it's picture on the store.
There is no list of items in the purchase so you can only go on the picture here.
I brought it, the truck shown in the picture was not included. No pack has it. It's a simple outright lie to have it shown in store. The 17 pounder unit always comes with a truck when used in game.",1680039936,1680060059,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,False

On my system performance is fine. After 11 hours I haven't run into any major bugs. I've completed the DAK campaign and started the Italian campaign, and done a few skirmish battles. I can see many changes were made in between the last open beta and release. 

If you are a fan of CoH1 in particular (as it plays more like that one to me rather than CoH2) then it's an easier recommendation.

Edit: I can no longer recommend this game in it's current state. The arrival of an absolutely dreadful store of cosmetics, and the prices they want to charge for unit skins is beyond terrible.

They changed the way progression works completely, there's no more tweaking and upgrading specific parts of your factions with unit boosts, there is still only the base 3 battlegroups that came on release. 

In order to get unit skins (which you unlocked for free just from playing in CoH2) you need pay real money (premium in-game currency) in the store, or if you want, you can spend all week doing the unit and faction specific challenges to save up enough merit (the in-game currency you can earn) just to unlock a single unit skin for a single faction. There was one skin for a German vehicle unit that was 4000 merit points, that would take a month worth of challenges to earn... for 1 unit!!! The worst part of the challenges is they make you play the game in ways you don't enjoy playing, using certain factions, and units, destroying specific units with other specific units... what an absolute fail.

I'm guessing there is new developer management since CoH2 because this game is unrecognizable. Save yourself the money and keep playing CoH2. I'm uninstalling and going back to CoH2.",1677201483,1680042931,False,2,0,0.508490204811096191,0,True,False,False

To begin with, I love COH and I love this game. There are a lot of interesting things that this third installment brings that myself and I am sure many others enjoy as well. That being said, this game was released in an unfinished state. There are multiple game altering bugs which can literally lose games for you (All of which I have experienced in multiplayer). There is still not a ranked mode or annihilation in multiplayer (Not including AI games) over a month in and I feel like I am normally playing the same map 5 times in a row sometimes. Not to mention the fact that even though they have acknowledged multiple times that the zoom feature is awful and that they were going to fix it, it has not been changed. I am pretty sure there was a mod in the workshop DAY ONE that fixed this issue. Literally check and see, it is the most subscribed mod for this game. 

The single player Italian campaign, while I admit was an ambitious and appreciated attempt as something new, felt like a 20 hour grueling crawl of game play. I played this BEFORE they introduced the first balance changes on it so take this with a grain of salt unless it is still all true. You play a small skirmish on the same map every other turn. It gets to the point where you just do not want to engage battles anymore because winning does not even guarantee that the opponents solider is defeated. I know that the opportunity of retreat is something that actually exists but it does not enhance at all in this situation for me. I loved the previous single player modes in all the previous games. 

The single player African campaign, in my opinion is much better than the Italian one. Unfortunately, it is pretty short. I felt like this was more like previous campaigns presented in the series. I know that it is historically accurate that the Axis lost the Africa campaign but winning every single map only to hear a voice over say how badly you were defeated felt weird to me. Anyways, I wish that we had a 20+ hour campaign more like this one. 

POST-OPERATION SAPPHIRE JACKAL:
Obviously this patch came out today so this comes with less experience than the first part of this post, but I have not seen any bugs yet. The vehicle pathing is still ABYSMAL. I think this is absolutely the worst part of the entire multiplayer experience. Why is my vehicle (sometimes) required to rotate in order to reverse when it is already facing the correct direction? It isn't even consistent either so you never know when it is going to happen. There is still not an option to save a recording of your game which mind boggling for me. I could be wrong but I feel like this was a day one feature for COH2. I know that I brought this up in the previous section as well, but I wish so badly there was an option to play ranked as well. Ultimately, like most people have brought up in other reviews, this game feels unfinished. I am very happy with all the hard work the devs are putting in to fix bugs and balance gameplay. You will never find a perfect multiplayer RTS released day one without any bugs or with perfect balancing. I just wish that this had a few more months in the oven. It needs more maps and game modes. I think four is a fine amount of factions to start with and all four are equally diverse, but I feel almost underwhelmed at the variety of defensive options for certain situations. 

Finally, I cannot believe the absolute insult of microtransactions released with this patch. They have introduced a shop system with points that you can both earn and buy. I do not care at all if people want to spend money on skins. It helps support the game and it gives people what they want (as long as it is not pay to win or gambling). But to put literally every single skin pack except for one behind a money wall is absurd to me. Not to mention that it will take literal months to even be able to afford that one pack because of how little in game currency you earn from these tasks. I know the people making the game are not at fault for this and I am sure they would do things differently if they could, but I really hope that things improve because with a dedicated fanbase that is already so disgruntled, I could see a lot of people going back to COH2. I cannot recommend this game in its current state when the previous titles are miles about more polished than this one. Normally I would just shake off polish because the older games have been out much longer, but the quantity in this game is so lackluster that I cannot. I will continue to play it and continue to scream every time one of my tanks drive into a crowd of bazooka carrying infantry even though I have hit reverse 50 times, but I will not ignore it the fact it is happening.",1680041805,1680041868,False,4,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game developers make games to make money. We all know this.  That said i find it completely unexceptionable to release a game that clearly is not finished. 

further more how they have the balls to open a MICRO-TRANSACTION store BEFORE FIXING  the game. 62% like the game on steam which is not great relic! 

Here still are the problems you can experience playing!

CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

SOUND

Weak sound quality particularly the mortar, when the machine gun gets going the sound should make you sh** yourself, currently its laughable. Tanks sound like pee shooters. It is missing that immersive impact a war with bullets and bombs bring.

ART

Main menu background  for first impressions on a game is shocking! My nephew looked like he painted it!

Infantry and engineers fell lazy. For example in a section you have LCPL/CPL/TRP LDR/ ETC. however on EVERY infantrymen is a LCPL patch on the arm in the unit? Each soldier look identical apart from the one guy with the moustache. More effort to craft the sections faces and organise the equipment on the soldiers differently so they don't all look identical would be a nice touch! COH2 had this detail?

Animations are off. Loading artillery shells lack again detail in comparison to COH1 years ago.

PAK guns feel off. Easily flanked and get wiped with one or two tank shells making it useless at times so you just end up never producing one and going tank instead.

No weather system at all unlike previous instalments. It does actually rain in Italy sometimes. 

The damage system is also questionable. Vehicles fall apart like Lego once defeated?

My biggest issue the Italian campaign was so poorly done it felt like a absolute grind to finish and i was only half way in. Unbelievable amount of bugs and mission design and execution lacked complete detail. You know the missions are bad when you get  dull briefings on the missions that lack detail and creativity. It all frustratingly just didn't  work. 

African campaign same story. They had a great opportunity to tell the story of Rommel campaign across Africa and decide to tell the story from innocent bystanders that you never play as and then play as Rommel and it just felt off and not interesting. Doesn't help either when the voice acting for the Germans is atrocious. German fractions offend every German playing this game with no doubt, The Germans should speak German not some dodgy German Canadian Irish at times lol 

Those complaining i cant understand German when playing as the Germans should learn. The Germans playing this game can mostly speak English after all. Plus more immersive and more points for the details it clearly is missing. 

I write this review because i have never seen a gaming company (Relic) push the boundaries and release a complete mess with such disregard for its fan base. A major patch after a month that focuses on the store to ask for more money after not producing the goods is ballsy! We want better sound and better art work. We want more love put into the game. Read the comments i am speaking for many!  We want you to listen to the fan base instead of trying to squeeze more money out of them. Get it right and we give you more money.

There is clearly cosmetics, but other than pre-purchase stuff there is no sign of anything, other than the ""store"" button that is still grayed out.

Store FAQ
Q: Are there be premium currecy?
A: Of course, you are welcome to pay 5€ to skin some of your infantry and around 10 for some of your vehicles. This is of course only for a single faction.

Q: I played a lot already, will i get some currency to buy some skins?
A: Of course not!

Q: But i can just play multiplayer and gather a bit of currency to eventually buy some skins right, like every other game?
A: Nope!

Q: So there is no way to earn ""free"" cosmetics?
A: Sure there is, there are some random Daily and weekly quest, you could get a skin for a single infantry unit in just a week!. In a month or so you will have unlocked all 4 skins for the avaliable 4 units!
And if you are comitted and play for another 3-4 weeks, you might be able to buy the single vehicle skin for the single faction avaliable for the non premium currency!

Q: so there is only 4 infantry skins and 1 Vehicle skin?
A: Of course not!, we have several different themed cosmetic sets, you just need to shell out actual money for those.",1677281622,1680037896,False,8,2,0.529140233993530273,0,True,False,False

One month after release many bugs, placeholder icons from CoH2, ugly or bad UI elements all remain issues. No new content has been added except an exploitative cash shop identical in form to what earned Warhammer 40,000: Darktide negative reviews.

This game just came out, and in a poor state that many considered a rushed / early access release, yet the 1.1.0 update is mostly an embarrassing cash shop that isn't even enticing to the gullible.

Credit to the developers who got many bugfixes into this patch, but I am changing my review to be negative, and it will likely stay that way for a long time.

[u] Original Review [/u]

For multiplayer, this is a direct upgrade to Company of Heroes 2.

I have hundreds of hours in COH2 (and likely thousands pre-steam in COH1), and have now had a day to queue multiplayer after finishing the DAK campaign and dipping my toes into the Italian 'Total War' campaign mode. While these campaigns are not on par with the excellence of the franchise's past, the DAK campaign was a lot of fun (except for the second mission, but finale was excellent!) and the Italian campaign mode is actually really cool—and I don't typically enjoy these campaign modes at all.

The multiplayer is identical to the 'Tech Test' beta, if you played it. But that tech test, to me, was a pristine successor to the dated COH2 multiplayer. It does nothing to break the mold, but it is a breath of fresh air, new tech trees, new build orders, maps, meta, new balance issues to complain about... and if you loved COH1 or COH2 multiplayer, this is a great fit for you.

Now, there are [b] glaring [/b] issues that must be addressed...

The menu and many UI elements appear like (or noticeably are) placeholders. You do not feel like this is a finished game when you launch and load the main menu. But you do when you are playing it. It's bizarre. Aesthetically its boring, and customisation features (face plates, player icons) are missing. There are no skins from achievements to equip, no way to view last match stats, no replays or observer mode. These are core features we should all expect to be in the game at launch. The 'Unique Colours' options, which helps identify players in 4v4 mode, has no colour theory behind it and causes unbelievable confusion and is mandatory to keep off until fixed, when this worked fine in COH2.

These issues make this launch a disappointment. But yet, I love to play COH3, as I have loved to play COH since 2006.

If you love Company of Heroes, and want to fight on the ladder or in skirmish, I promise you—get through the ugly unfinished menu and window dressing, and the best COH experience to date is there waiting for you as soon as you press play.

It's hard to say if this is a recommendation or not. It's a bizarre type of unfinished release, where the gameplay is intact and solid. But its wonderfully fun, it's wonderfully COH, and therefore I give it my thumbs up.

Pros:
-Gameplay is a great refinement of the formula
-Campaigns modes range from adequate to cool and unique
-Variety of launch factions and new units to play with
-Visuals are quite good (particularly destruction)
-Voice lines are great

Cons
-Audio and SFX are subpar and sometimes bugged
-Missing profile customisation features
-Ugly placeholder Menu/UI elements
-No unlocks or progression in game at launch
-Price point is high for a video game

Despite this, it was still fun. However I cannot excuse these faults when, with the first major patch there is now an egregious cosmetic store with weekly/daily challenges that you can't switch out so force you to play certain factions/certain unit types and give out pitiful free currency amounts, 
With which only SOME cosmetics can even be bought with free currency - currently there is only ONE out of the SIXTEEN non-featured items you can get for free, which is a single stuka desert skin requiring you to complete more than a months worth of weekly challenges,
(Additionally, a week gives 900 free currency, and the stuka costs 4000. While there are daily challenges you can get, that void of 400 stinks of intentionally making people fed up and enticing them to succumb to buying premium currency out of annoyance. 
As well as uneven premium currency purchase options so you will always have some premium currency left over encouraging you to buy more. 
AND, the highlights/featured cosmetics are on a weekly timer and not available in the 'All Cosemtics' section, so they are absolutely intending to prey on FOMO. 
:):):) 

Not worth it at all if you just want to play multiplayer. More people are still playing COH2 which provides a better experience. 
And for the love of god, STOP MAKING EXCUSES/SACRIFICES ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR BELOVED FRANCHISE TO FAIL. 
If you're worried they will cancel development on the game just because it's not profitable enough, therefore you buy cosmetics you're a chump. Plain and simple. 
The CEO's who make these decisions will ALWAYS rule that the game is not profitable enough. There can never be enough profit. As soon as they deem they can make more money elsewhere they will ditch the game anyway, community be damned, and you will have done nothing but encourage their negative business practices for future games. But be sure they will take advantage of the above sentiment and squeeze you dry on the way out.  

If this is the way the franchise is heading, I would rather it just died. 
You can still go back to COH2, and if you don't want to do that, move onto another game/franchise that actually respects you. 
Sure there are the passionate everyday staff in the company who will want to improve things, but they hold no power over what the company does.

Its safe to say that I cannot recommend this title for anyone at this current price.  To have the audacity to even ask £70 for a few awful cosmetics that makes Activision look generous with what their offering is practically outrageous!  Not to mention including the upcoming expansion that we no idea about, already setting a bad look for the product before we've even initialised the game yet.  That being said, I do feel that this title has been unfairly judged by fellow critics - an overreaction by the audience to the bad pricing that is, of course, understandable.  As it happens, I've had and will still have a lot of fun playing this recent addition, only I don't feel great about the amount I paid for this due to how it mostly feels like a beta test.  Without a doubt, no surprise given you can tell it was clearly released too early.  It's worth noting that I had neutral to almost low expectations and it still managed to disappoint.  If your a hardcore fan then you'll probably have a blast with this but for the rest, either wait for the price to drop, a sale or if you haven't already, purchase any of the previous instalments like the first one with its superbly made extra content that only costs you £20 in total.

How has this game released too early you might ask?  Ignoring the hilariously, still closed store or the re-used icons for a few of the units and abilities, some of which are just placeholders with no relevance whatsoever.  Lets start with the skirmish map selection, the very first I noticed when loading up which I personally find to be ""okay"" but nothing more than that.  Now, I don't know what the main issues are in terms of the technicalities however, I will say that there's nothing really iconic about the selection.  In the past, we've had memorable maps like Lyon, Villers-Bocage, Steppes as well as Sittard Summer which was originally a community map put into rotation but in spite of that, you see my point.  At the same time, I do feel that there is a lack of maps this time though this something I'm unsure of, albeit made worse with them being used in the Italian Campaign.  Also, would you like to guess on what modes we have now?  If you were thinking of anything innovative then you would be wrong in that regard so instead the correct answer is same ones we've had since this genre began.  This is the third game in the series and the options presented are still victory control plus annihilation, an embarrassingly lost opportunity for something fresh like a paradrop invasion mode or a convoy, attack and defence preset.  Nope, guess its left up to the modding community to do the rest I'm afraid that do a grand job with the ideas they have as shown in throughout the online world.  Another thing that irritates me is how little customisation there is for our matches with features such as controlling the weather behaviour has been completely absent since the original release of the first game.  Not even having a replacement for the blizzard effects from the second installation with a sandstorm variant for the Northern African themed locations.

Gameplay is pretty much what you would expect as a Company Of Heroes title, perhaps a lot less epic for lack of a better term with a few tweaks and features such as troops riding tanks and towing.  Nothing really of any remarkable note other than the quality of life improvements such as the auto-reinforce.  The introduction of four factions this time is immeasurably nice to have but the issue is that most of them feel underwhelming - their is a significant lack of unique units that would of helped change things up a bit.  Not just that but we've already played the likes of the British, the Americans, the Wehrmacht for the past few games now with the only exception being the Afrika Corps.  Sure, their a lot of fun to play as well as difficult to replace given the historical events, of course.  It just would be nice to have down the line more factions like the Canadians being a separate entity with their own strategic formula or even Axis Italy with a few German technology thrown in there for balance.  Same can be said towards a number of different things like how this could been the perfect opportunity to add in some light naval engagements through the use of riverboats or landing crafts.  Another example would be the lack of an in-game map editor which wouldn't be nearly as sophisticated as the essence editor itself however it just gives that extra option to encourage any newcomers to hop into this game.

On towards the technical aspects, it's generally a mixed bag or inconsistent under most avenues of this title.  Visually it's nothing impressive, more of a slight upgrade to Company Of Heroes 2 however there is the odd, inadequate thing that pops through like the effects, the textures and how ""cartoony"" it looks nowadays.  It only gets worse as the heavily discussed topic here is the audio which, yes, is pretty weak, especially for stuff like artillery that fails to have that intense impact it once had in our ears.  Also happens to be quite buggy at times as well which this game has plenty of.  To name a few, there are a fantastic, funny, fair amount of physics bugs revolving around vehicles in particular, as evident in an hilarious early mission cutscene sequence on the Italian Campaign.  Speaking of the campaign, out of nowhere, I had what appeared to be an interesting paradrop unit that spawned in the middle of ocean called ""missing entity name"" which eventually suffered from attrition, unsurprisingly.  By the way, is it me or does there appear to be a trend nowadays with who can make the worst user interface?  It's a joke!  Granted, it could be worse but that's no excuse with how awful the layout is as well as the fact that its so awkward with what information it'll give you - you'll find yourself being received tons to barely any information whatsoever.  Thankfully there have been patches since release that have gone over what I've just said only that's an action we would contemplate, not congratulate.

The big question, that I've delayed long enough now, is that does the freshly introduced turn based Italian Campaign be this shining jewel in the middle of this desert that I've written so far?  No, unfortunately not at all.  A damn shame to say given that you can tell that Relic really wanted this to be a heavy hitter towards this particular entry in series so far.   Above that, it's a great concept with a couple of really fun mechanics in place like the addicting way battalions level up.  Unfortunately, the majority of it is just a boring, early access feeling mode that, to my surprise as a fan of total war themes, is hurting the game more than it's actually helping it.  To confess, I haven't finished the main Campaign so there maybe a decent number of things I'm unaware of however I have indeed completed the traditionally familiar North African selection.  While it may have its problems, its by miles more fun to take part in seen as that gives us the historical events that transpired as well as it's entertaining mission structure for each scenario.  Sure, you get plenty of those sections in Italy's depiction but, as mentioned, a whole chunk of the time I felt I was playing skirmish matches that have repetitively, basic, objectives for ""variation"".  This gets especially worse when your up against an increasing number of enemy battalions of which you can auto-resolve, weaken them with whatever you have at your disposal however, you will end up confronting them on recurring maps.  If anything, this has lead me to believe that they should of focused further on the war stories as well as manifesting it to be the biggest world war 2 sandbox to date.  Allowing us enthusiasts to muck around with all the distinct cool gimmicks for our pleasure and have the turn based part delayed brought later.",1679703343,1680032053,False,97,0,0.794869899749755859,5,True,False,False

It is a long awaited game from a very specific subset of players (world war 2 tactics) of an already dying genre (Real time strategy) from a niche developer (Relic). Whilst most of the reviews towards this game leans in the negative as of this writing, I can say that Company of Heroes 3, from the core, gathers the best aspects of both CoH1 and 2. 

Whilst it's single player is mediocre or lacklustre, multiplayer is where it truly shines. There is an absolute feeling of spectacle seeing massive battles between in infantry and tanks in 4v4 (where I think COH games are best played) punctuated with artillery bombardments and airstrikes. Despite the negative reviews out there saying that the game is too buggy (it isn't after playing 200 hours) or having cartoonish animations; these affect the overall experience little to none.

The game looks great, is well optimized and tons of fun in multiplayer with friends. The downside is that the game is complex and has a higher than average learning curve. There are also some balance issues with the factions (patches are already underway) and only a small number of 3v3 and 4v4 skirmish maps are available. 

For veterans of CoH, the fundamentals of the game remain solid and the graphical overhaul brings the series upto current generation standards while remaining familiar to fans of the older games. The overworld campaign is a good idea and adds some freshness to the otherwise linear missions, however, it is not without its fair share of problems. The commander perk system is back to the way it was in CoH 1, and many other aspects seem to take the best parts from the 1st and 2nd games. The optimization is very good, I get higher FPS on this game at 4K high than I did with CoH 2 on the same hardware. Now, the problems, the unit textures and maps lack the authentic war-weary look, sound has been downgraded, graphics have not improved by as much as they should have from 2006, there is a significant lack of polish, voice acting feels too modern for WW2, mod support is at best only at CoH2 levels, the story and art styles in the campaigns 

The game is expensive. Also, if CoH2 is anything to go by, there is a strong possibility that relic will introduce paywalled content that should have been available for free, considering that this is game is charging AAA prices while lacking AAA quality and polish. It is worth a buy, but wait for a sale before you pick it up.

Update: First patch drops after a month, lo and behold, paywalled skins enter the store like clockwork. No new maps, balancing isn't complete, campaign bugs remain, the absolutely trash looking menus remain, no replays, no option to view map post-game, bugged post game results, all these issues were a lower priority than the need to add microtransactions to an already overpriced game.  Relic even had the gall to claim that they wanted a balance between paid-only and grindable content, and yet the store has exactly one item that is purchaseable with free currency amongst 15+ items for premium currency. CoH remains a game very close to my heart, but I cannot endorse the way Relic is treating fans.

well there are some things that are kinda strange to me. everyone has the same profile picture and call sign, there is no way to change it. every (of the 4) factions have 3 doctrins but there is no way to unlock new ones. the shop is closed. but there is a screen to equip doctrins so i guess you will be able to unlock/ purchase new ones in the future? maybe? no informations yet. for a full release for 60 bucks it feels like a let down.

pioneers wont build your base anymore. you click on the building and choose where to place it and it will be build automatically. problem is, the space in you base is so limited, that, if you dont know where to place your buildings, you may not be able to place all of them! happend to me and i had no access to my late game units and there is no way to delete buildings. so yeah .... why?

but yeah i like it, its more of the same, no real innovation but also no downgrade. 

so if you cant decide if you should pay 60 bucks for this or keep playing coh2, i would say keep playing coh2 . there is way more content and coh3 has nothing that make it worth paying 60 bucks. except you want to play the campaign but as i said earlier, havent touched it yet.

i cant recommend it now but will change my rating IF the game changes as well. i am a really big fan of coh and it makes me sad. i waited 10 years for this and after AoE 4 i thought that relic knows what they are doing. maybe its sega pushing the release or maybe they thought it was okay to release it like this. but it isnt.

so the game released an ingame store for cosmetics and weekly challanges to gain ingame currency. NICE! oh wait what is that? not all cosmetics can be unlocked with the same currency? what are war bonds? oooooh real money currency. so most skins cant be unlocked by playing.... 

that was the most important thing the game needed right now? a way to milk your customers further? after they spent full price on an early access game? i mean yeah you say it is full release but i bet you will tell me how much the game will improve through MTX!

I was about ready to forgive everything, in the belief, or vain hope, we might get a perspective shift to the Allies and tell the half of Rommel's story where the meth addicted war criminal is ousted from Africa by the allied forces. But no, the finale of the Africa Campaign spends most of its dialogue regurgitating Nazi propaganda, treating the first battle of El Alamein as the great Nazi victory that ended the war in North Africa when, in fact, it was the last victory before a devastating collapse under Allied counter attacks. The entirety of the Allies victory is left as a 30 second foot note in an epilogue, leaving the campaign's finale to paint a false narrative of a Nazi victory in North Africa, despite the North Africa campaign being a catastrophic loss for them. The entire thing is so embarrassingly lopsided that it reads as somebody's personal denazification fan fiction trying to absolve Rommel of his direct involvement in nazi war crimes and paint him as an unbeatable ubermensch lumbered by the over bearing insight of Berlin.",1680023616,1680023616,False,8,0,0.567126691341400146,0,True,False,False

The game itself feels unfinished, or at least unpolished, and whilst a huge fan of the series, feels like the worst of the three thus far. Whilst there at many improvements to the formula, there feels as many back steps.

It feels a wasted opportunity to the faction list that both opposition forces are again Germany with different colour palettes, when Italy was a big contributor to the Axis (and for those that say Italy had no tanks, the majority of the ""British"" vehicles in skirmish are American; so why not give them German tanks?)

The multiplayer unbalanced, fast, and if you play a slow start build you will lose or get carried. The Gas spawns can screw you and they dont give much so its a lot of inf spam and light viks. Also you can stop all air support from a 4v4 with 3 AA's either trucks or emplacements, so never go Air support. 

The Americans are slow, [strike]squishy[/strike] and don't pack a punch. [strike]If your fighting German para's your screwed.[/strike] Don't ever spawn bazookas, or the EAZY 8. They cost too much and even the stug can reverse faster than the bazookas run speed. bazookas have slow reaload and low AT, they cant even take on most light vehicles. 
Buff bazookas, buff hellcat damage, buff wizbang and eazy 8,

(edit after updates) they buffed them but not as they should have, more hp and wizbang range, they are still 4th out of 4 but they are a bit better, I think instead of making the hell cat shoot faster make them hit harder and punch though armor better. Bazookas un less they get a speed or range buff will only be for new players or for people who think they can punish early game light viks which they wont, Most light viks can get hit 4+ times by bazzokas and reverse back,  if the enemy doesn't it might die due to incompetence or whatever mg on it will kill the bazzokas, a 50/50 flip, They are better and i think a few more buffs till balanced. 

Germans are bad unless you are para troopers.
They are a slow build team in a fast rts, not including para. Most viks are good ive even seen games won by the basic motorcycle. Units are squishy but deal more damage then the Americans and Brits.
[strike]-The Para are an inf spam or a flack impalement spam. flack impalement have high HP high Inf and light viks dam and can be spawned at the start. Since most allies are slow build up types they are basically GODS. The fallschirmjäger are worse than the fallschirm pironers. And [/strike] you get the pironers at the start. Spam them with grande launcher you can roll even HMG's. Nerf the pironers, and flack impalements. Buff fallschirmjäger instead. 

(Edit after updates) Fall-Jagers are better now but still not as good as the pironers, give them one more squad memeber and make the airdrop reinforce a building not an add on, German armor is still week, even a tiger can get rolled by light tank spam, 3-5 LT mean while ive seen two tigers go against a church hill all he did was revers back untill one of his teammates helped him. Buff german armor, armor rating.

Desert Fox (Germans other team)
Fast start so god tier. Best tanks, Best inf, [strike] Best light viks[/strike] , less air support but more arty which is a good thing. For the INF doctrine they get a high HP, high damage (with flamers), engineering unit. He attack, he kills buildings, and he heals the tanks. GOD TIER. do not nerf this team buff everyone else to this level.
(edit after updates) they have lowered the flame damage and now I think they are the most balanced faction 

British
[strike] mix bag.[/strike]  (Edit) After update they went from meh to Over powered 
[strike] It has slow doctrines and fast.[/strike]  Its the best for the allies because it can counter the Germans.
The tanks are tanky, the inf can be spam with AT rifles which do more damage then bazookas. Light damage infs, strong arty, [strike] but never pick the para troopers, too squishy.  Skip light viks unless you can refund them but its the most balanced.[/strike] 

(edit after updates) they buffed them and they Nerf others to make Brits too strong. heavy morters have a reload and reaction speed of csgo pros. I will kill the mg protecting them and as i push to them get hit 3-5 times will on the move, so unless i blob or viks push I wont be able to counter them, The boys AT rifle which is what brits main inf can use are so strong it can one shot an Abrams, And its so cheap that they are spammed and unless you go hard anti inf the German tigers will get blob down. Med trucks can heal while in combat so a mg team being morted and sniped the truck will out heal all damage meaning invincible mg unless you push with vicks but you cant. The tanks are too tanky. 
how to fix, Buff german armor - armor rating, buff German  tanks hp, make the boys at rifle cost more but you can keep the same damage if you buff hp of German viks, make heavy morters take a longer time in between shots, and med tucks cant heal in combat. 

So in all its early access, wait for discount, and balance changes will make or break this game. Also the skin shop. It hasent been enabled but I think it might be a little messy if they haven't enabled it YET. 

5.5/10 but in the modern standards for video games 7.2/10 not bad and a bit good.

I read that a lot of reviews were negative and that the game was unfinished along with many other complaints made by the community. I bought the game either way because relic did such a good job with CoH2 that I figured they would put serious effort into making CoH3 just as great. A lot of complaints made are valid so I suggest reading some of the negatives for perspective. The game needs a lot more work and a lot more content such as units, command abilities, maps, etc. That right there is basically the game itself and its missing a lot. However I was able to overlook that since I still could find enjoyment in what is currently there. The HUGE problem here is that the developers are adding in cosmetic items and as relic says ""only some"" can be earned for free. This means they are focusing on making paid cosmetics for an unfinished game, effectively turning this game into a cash cow. To me it seems like they are trying to sucker people like me into buying the game while piggybacking off of the previous installment's reputation. Then they do paid cosmetics on an unfinished game immediately after they received a bunch of backlash and negative feedback. Whoever is making these decisions is going to kill the game and lose their community. I would love to get a refund for this because of all of these horrible choices they keep making, however I already exceeded the 2 week and 2 hrs refund policy.

I have been playing COH since 2010, and right now is a really good time to get in on the franchise. I would buy it before the meta gets too entrenched. What's really fun right now is you can be creative with builds and it's not too punishing.

There are some people who are complaining a lot right now, but it's mostly salty veteran players that are upset that the playstyle they've had for a decade doesn't workt he same anymore. But you will notice something about the bad reviews, these dudes have 60+ hours in game already on this. So they've been playing nonstop, yet they give a bad review. It's just competitive whiners. Almost every single bad review has a ton of hours played. 

Multiplayer is where its at. This game will suck you in, it has a way of drawing your complete attention. You won't be checking your phone. It takes about 2 minutes for me to get a game, games last 15-40 minutes. It's 1v1 through 4v4. 

Single player is worth doing once too. It's the best single player campaign yet in the series. They created a total war type campaign map that you move your companies around and then you command the battles on similar maps to what you play in the multiplayer. You upgrade your companies and stuff, kinda RPGish. 

If you're on the fence, get the game now while people are still learning the meta and you'll have more fun. Start with single player for a session, then do some skirmishes where you increase the difficulty.

Hilariously, one faction is HEAVILY reliant on light vehicles - another has mainline infantry that is able to be equipped 2 mins into a game with a hard counter to light vehicles - meaning if you encounter this faction you are solely relying on them to throw the game or else it's gg. 

People leave every other game so you just end up playing with AI (no point because the AI is so terrible a 5 year old could beat it) so team games are either a complete face roll, or you get destroyed or have to leave yourself to save time. No cosmetics, no real way of tracking ranking properly. No replay or video replay, no battle groups and some of the ones that do exist are basically useless. Queue times going up for different factions in different game modes, as it's become pointless to play against someone skilled in certain game modes dependent on faction or else you just get rolled. Some factions also have access to a REALLY skilled feature called a loiter whereby if you press a button you can delete any tank in half the map. There is also another ability where you press and your units reinforce by paradrop for free for 1 min - at no cost to you, and literally cannot die. Really bad game design.

Campaign is not really narrative driven, animations and bugs all over the place and the weird total war-esque map has all of the bad points and none of the good, very little replay ability and can be completed in a few hours. Lack of cinematic set pieces, lots of content that never get's used again and just suffers from really weird pacing. The NA campaign is also very strange.

Maybe if they put some effort in then it will be good in a year or two, i played too long or else i would probably refund as is.

- The AI is either stupidly OP or stupidly stupid
- Too many minor bugs (and some major) for it to be released - especially at this price point
- The focus on historical details has been lost. Late war vehicles appearing in mid war campaigns, etc,
- Gameplay-wise, it's a retread of COH2, just not as good. Minor improvements (auto-vaulting obstacles etc.) are nice, but too few to justify the cost.
- Voice work is not as good, and sound quality is atrocious

No changes since beta.THERE ARE ONLY TWO 4v4 MAPS. Not everyone plays 4v4, but this should tell you how empty and unfinished this game is.Bugs and broken mechanics. First skirmish match, my assault grenadier is in range to grenade. When I use the ability my squad leaves cover, and some models even vault the wall into the enemy I am trying to grenade.So many core features completely missing (for example, can't see which player units belong to), so many obvious issues that show they ignored all feedback and did no work since beta.For example, team colors.You can be given the team color red and fight a player with orange.You can be red fighting blue, but friendly territory still turns blue and enemy territory turns red.You and your allies can be red, orange, purple, with all enemies blue, green, yellow.In my opinion, the game feels worse than predecessors. Sound is muted, graphics are higher quality but don't actually look better. Tanks are weirdly sluggish and die immediately (plane strafe is unchanged from beta) while infantry can last 20-30s outnumbered at close-medium range.Vehicle pathing is as bad or worse, the same problems from 10 years ago are still here. We all know coh2 had a terrible launch and only became good years later. This release is better in some ways, but the game is such a massive step back and missing so many basic QOL features that I don't know if it will ever compare to coh1 and 2.**THE GOOD**-Most launch factions in the series-Gameplay has potential (in the end it's still coh), might be good someday.-Runs smoothly for a 2023 AAA game.-Italians, I guess?-Day 1 hotfix that includes balance changes. This brings its own issues, but is a hopeful sign that devs are working to address issues.**TLDR**Unfinished. Missing many core features, especially multiplayer and QOL related. Reuses many unit icons from 10 year old coh2. Some gameplay elements have gotten worse from coh2, or don't work correctly when the 10 and 15 year old predecessors did them well.Buy on sale when they have finished it in 3-5 years.EDIT: Postgame stats screen is completely broken.

In short, the mechanics are far better suited to MP than SP (also you don't have to put up with the incessant politicisation of history in MP, which is a bonus).  There are a few balance issues that everyone is aware of (airborne of both factions is OP), but overall its an enjoyable experience - just don't expect that same level of depth in the SP modes.The North African Campaign is a joke.  It consists of incredibly easy missions with fail conditions my mother wouldn't have trouble avoiding stitched together with a completely disconnected story about Arabic Libyan natives somehow being sympathetic to the plight of the vanishingly small population of Jews living in Benghazi.  Once again, we are reminded that WW2 is a Jewish suffering simulator, regardless of where the conflict is happening.  The mechanics are underwhelming and the game often boils down to massing tanks and rolling over the British troops.  Skirmish is better, but the mechanics are horribly under-baked compared to CoH 2.  Relic has fallen into the trap of producing a sequel to a highly-polished game that is nowhere near the same standard as its predecessor.  I hope it gets better, because at the moment it is thinly-veiled historical revisionism wrapped in a veneer of underwhelming RTS mechanics.

African Campaign story was really fun, wish it was longer. Italians not a faction even though your fighting in Italy? its not like all Italian units gave up and the fact that they arent their own faction during the African Campaign is lame. But seriously?

This game at best is at a level of early access, but really is at a state open-beta. I think most people who have good reviews have their nostalgia blinders on, and are ignoring a lot of issues with the game. Overall a lot of the issues are minor, this game is playable; HOWEVER, all of the issues add up to a hot mess of a game. We've waited over 10 years, and its sad the game has been released at this state.[list][/list]I HAVE ONLY PLAYED MULTIPLAYER[list][/list] PROS:- 4 playable factions - Reassigning hotkeys - No bugsplats/crashes - Faster loading screens compared to COH2  - Auto-reinforce at base[list][/list]Overall gameplay is similar to COH2 & COH1. They have implemented most of the mechanics from COH2, including vaulting, reversing vehicles, etc. This is the first COH game that has been released with more than two factions. I haven't experienced any bugsplats or crashes when playing, and overall load-in times are greater than COH2.[list][/list] CONS:[list][/list]- UI, UI, UI, UI- Artwork- Audio - Lack of Commanders - Graphics/Visuals are comparable to COH2- No in-game leaderboard/ranking[list][/list]UI:[list][/list]The interface is absolutely atrocious, from the starting menu to icons. The starting menu is a homage to COH1, yet somehow looks way worse. The menu/settings/font are a far cry from any game released in the last decade.[list][/list]In-game is just as bad. While in-game you cannot view the name of teammates by clicking on their base or units. Even if you have unique-colors it still doesn't show any player names. To access the playerlist and see what doctrines are picked by teammates, you have to pull up the menu which covers the entire screen. Compared to COH2, where you can pull up the player list in the upper left corner. Icons like the repair icon on vehicles is minuscule. There is no build icon at all. Mousing over engineer builds has nothing. Hotkeys are reassignable but don't translate well with COH2 hotkeys. Commander choices/abilities in-game are on the far right of the screen; you tend to even forget about them  or even notice they are there. These issues may be minuscule, but a decent UI is very important in RTS games. [list][/list]Artwork:[list][/list]Abysmal. COH2 had great artwork from all of the commander icons and doctrine selection icons. COH3 doctrine/commander icons are trash. Look at COH1 doctrine selection screen. It pulls up a well-made menu with artwork and you can easily discern abilities. COH3 doctrine selection menu and icons are bland and small. Even the faceplates are terrible: one of the faceplates looks like a 2000's game artwork. This has no reflection of the gameplay, but if I only cared about gameplay, I'd go play CS-GO.Audio:[list][/list]Has no life to it, doesn't really wow you.[list][/list]Doctrines/Commanders:[list][/list]More doctrines and commanders would be great, but this game did just release with 4 playable factions. So this isn't really a knock on the game, but something to consider.[list][/list]Graphics/Visuals:[list][/list] This game was released about a decade later after COH2, and really doesn't improve much. This also just might be a bias because I'm already disliking many of the other issues of game. However, compared to COH2 a lot of explosions, gunfire, and effects are completely lackluster. Infantry or tanks taking damage doesn't have that great of an impact.[list][/list]Summary[list][/list]COH3 is a horrid successor to COH2. It barely improves on much other than different factions. The gameplay mechanics are similar but COH3 just has worse UI. This really just amounts to a Italian/Afrika corp DLC. I can't really shit on the developers. This seems like a cash-grab from Sega/Relic executives releasing this game way too early. If any triple-A game released a game at this state, people would be in uproar (I.E No Man's Sky). Yet, the COH community has an intense love for this game, because it ends up being the only game we play. Probably why there's so many mixed opinions.I expect in a year or so this game will definitely be much improved, but for now I'm pissed I bought this game for $60.[list][/list]TDLR; COH3 is just a bad COH2 DLC where you can RP as the Afrika Corps and Erwin Rommel.",1679601919,1679645938,False,14,0,0.59095388650894165,3,True,False,False

If you're still reading- I have good things to say about the game as well. It's a fun game and I am really enjoying the gameplay. It's a familiar return to COH1 style gameplay and it's always been my preferred out of the last two games. The units and animations are amazing, and some of the effects are really sick.

However.... there is a severe lack in content. It feels like playing the same 2 maps over in multiplayer. No ranked automatch, no game setup options for automatch, audio bugs, insanely taxing and unoptimized ultra textures, unpolished UI... and not to mention the imbalance in factions' units.

To preface, I have not been a CoH multiplayer for a while and therefore I am writing this as someone who only really plays the campaign or an odd skirmish. 

I love the Company of Heroes franchise, and indeed Company of Heroes 3 does capture that feeling of fighting tooth and nail for every inch of ground. I have no doubt that CoH3 will be a great game and in many aspects it is for me; however, currently I would recommend holding off on buying this for a bit. 

As is often expected of modern games being released, there are some significant stability issues, unfortunately for me this has meant 4 crashes in the 10 hours played so far, everytime the crash has been in the middle of a mission. Breaking your own immersion by needing to save regularly is not on.

This games falls somewhere between vertical slice and vapor ware. Why Relic didn't just punt the launch until the end of the year and put more work into it is beyond me. 

I hope Relic finally closes their doors after this one. No Microsoft with an AoE4 contract to keep the lights on. It is time for Relic to pass into history. It is better to end as the vaunted hero or lore than live long enough to become the worthless waste of oxygen that Relic has become.

With Allies, the stars must align, and you can really only win against an enemy that has made serious mistakes or is significantly worse than you.

Both allied factions are designed with the intention of early domination switching to defence in late game. That window in reality is non existent, they seem to add too much german doctrines that goes against that idea that makes germany both dominating the early game and late game, german paratrooper and elite infantry spam & african corp sharpshooter dotrine i.e. With those the games turned out to be a one-sided slaughter where allies are using significantly weaker units (for example British MG) that is only slightly cheaper and can be built 1 minute ealier before their german counterparts. Similarly, many ally infantry are built for close range engagement, high fire rate low accuracy. Sounds like a ok premise until you figure 1. the travel time that gets you close to the enemy makes you a free target dummy with the debuff for even lower accuracy when moving. 2. THE ENEMY CAN MOVE, decent german players will just move back while you are closing in during a 1 on 1, both of you can fire while moving and the germans has higher accuracy so go figure who'll win. 3. Even if you think the previous points are skill based which is true to certain extent, this one is just clear evidence RELIC did not think through their own game mechaniques: because your units have high damage close range while lower accuracy in general, german troops can always get away using the retreat button and it's VERY rare that you can kill a unit while playing against a experienced german player. Comparatively because the germans have higher accuracy, they can kill more units while they are running away. This is especially obvious when you use British Engineers or basic infantry against sharpshooters or german combat engineers. 
Conclusion? A lot of game mechanics are inherent and probably not going to be changed judging by relics efficiency at giving patches. A quick fix might just be making the units perform the same on both sides, the allies would still have the advantage of being able to build MGs early and that on it's own is not even such a big thing so I don't think giving MGs equal ability for example is op in any way. There are still so many things I haven't covered for example the fucking artillery and german infantry blob that really has no counter if played by a german player. At the game's current state, you can only beat unexperienced german players while objectively, the axis is way easier to play. Thus it's not a good game design even if you argue with skill the allies can also be competitve. 
Just lastly as a addon, most of my comments are based on multiplayer games. Although it might apply to 1v1s and singleplayer, I'm not qualified to comment since I don't have any experience. From my experience with the multiplayer, the single player campaign is more like other relic games (AoE), it's not really immersive and is ultimately built with the intent of multiplayer so do buy with causion if you are aiming for that experience. Some people justify the shitty game design by saying it's for the sake of 1v1 matches and sure, I can see why some things might be significantly better under a 1v1 setting but it is not an excuse of why other people's experience should be sacraficed just for that. If a game's 1v1 or competitve play has different balancing due to advanced tricks, that's the fault of game design and if you must choose one, choose a mode where everyone can enjoy!

Unit movement still buggy, campaign a bit fluffy, I always look forward to the campaigns. The idea was good, but just had such big shoes to step into.

Sold at AAA prices, as usual I've been let down. Buy at half price if you want, opinions seem divided, I'm hoping for a review change after some major patches. The community is doing its best to keep the multiplayer alive with mods, but this should have been at launch.

The game is just rushed, underfunded, and bad. 

COMPLETE Misses on all critical development points except performance. 

Multiplayer Faction design and Gameplay is simply very bad, and easily the  worst of all 3 coh games. 

Multiplayer is an absolute, pure abomination. Pure meta abuse, gameplay bugs and visual bugs GALORE, unintended behaviors such as buggy shift commands, HORRIFIC pathing thats somehow worse than COH2, costing you unit preservation, RNG induced shot misses and game changing moments. 

Unrewarding or just outright puzzling and confusing side techs(needing a sidegrade to get a simple AT Gun as DAK? Having to choose between getting an AT gun or getting a faster tank as USF? Side teching for a fucking BISHOP? Why??)

Novelty units that are simply impossible or idiotic to use in a practical multiplayer setting(such as the recovery truck from DAK, the mobile artillery Wasp or whatever tf its called for UKF, or the AT halftrack for USF, Panther, Stummel, Anti tank 221 from wehr,  88 emplacement from wehr, which is EXTREMELY buggy, just a few examples) 

worthless or simply clunky units and abilities ABUNDANT,

which forces meta commander play(such as Ridiculous strafes from all factions that are strong and absurd enough to win you 50/50 games, with zero skill input. Why play a weaker commander and struggle in those even games or lose because your opponent went meta?)  

Play just a bit and youll realize all 4 factions have one core gimmicky strat that will either
 A win them games just by how overtuned they are ; or 
B be involved and cause massive frustration in 90% or more of your games

USF - Airborne commander. pathfinder into quad. Add a sniper for good measure. 
UKF - Section spam with AT rifles into humber 
DAK - Engineers into 8 rad into pizza tank M13 spam. 
Wehr - Fallschrim pios and sniper into T4. add a sniper or the overtuned AA gun team for good measure.

Have fun trying to beat any of these strats if you arent running a meta strat of your own. 

It all becomes incredibly stale incredibly fast, and even if you do find ways to beat the cheese? 

Theres no endgame for being the best cheeseball. You just win and or ruin the game, by spamming the same strat over again like some sort of psychopath, again for no gain since:

The game doesnt have an esports scene. Relic/sega DO NOT support competitive play.
You arent rewarded for being a 'meta' player. Theres no reason to tough it out, other than mental insanity. Theres no ranked rewards. You dont get a unique title or perk. Theres no status that you get. You dont get special skins or anything. And if you do, the game didnt launch with any of this.

 The *unranked* leaderboards are buried and not present in the game(again because, it was rushed) 

The high level veteran players come off to regular players as cheesy spammers in unranked automatch, further ruining the ecosystem of the game that cant decide if its casual or competitive. Why would you continue queueing as a new player to COH if all youre gonna play is the same strategy on the same limited map pool for no reward??? What the hell for??

You will never find any creativity, or any variance or deviation; because it is NOT rewarded. Whats rewarded is practicing the meta of the month due to the consistent malpractice that the balance team puts out year after year, patch after patch in COH. Its like they dont even test, or listen to the top players that do hang around. Or hear out the casual players, to make units easier to use. Theres no modes that are more casual for newer players. Theres no special matchmaker or mode for new players only.

The game doesnt cater to either audience.... Its just frustration. The people that actually play COH....(the numbers drop and the q times get longer by the day) They are simply frustrated.

Single player is very meh and feels like a cheesy mobile game more than a traditional COH campaign. Play COH1s campaign and then play COH3's. Youll want to vomit. 

The modding community will carry the comp - stomp/single player content. But not for a long time will you start to se everyone


and since COH really is just an extremely confusing, daunting, unfun experience for lower level/newer players, especially since the matchmaking is bad; it leaves no satisfied audience for competitive or casual players. It leaves a frustrated, confused, audience that dwindles year by year.

coh1 and 2 are both much better in every way, are cheaper, and genuinely a better use of your time; and unless this game gets a crazy life saving patch; COH's future as a franchise is non existent and you absoulutely should not buy this game.",1679466013,1679466013,False,9,0,0.603443324565887451,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
- Campaign ""member-berries"" - the return of Joe Conti and John MacKay from CoH1, with the correct chronological ranks - Conti as a Corporal, MacKay as a Lieutenant -
- Inclusion of historically elite units otherwise neglected by video game franchises, namely Royal Gurkha Rifles (a slightly anachronistic modern nomenclature), 1SSF, and the Italian Bersaglieri
- Excellent building physics, a large improvement from the previous two games 
- Infantry units and vehicles seem to move fluidly, in a slightly more ""arcade"" style, but with a semblance of realism - this seems to help with the overall movement. 
- Manoeuvring vehicles in urban settings seems to be significantly easier than previous instalments, and the AI route mapping seems to be much more intelligent. As a result, the trailer tease of infantry/tanks moving in synch as they would IRL, seems to work out. 
- Overall, a much faster pace everything, from unit production, to combat, to capture points. Not exactly my cup of tea, but I can see some serious competitive matches happening as a result of this change. 
- Historical campaign maps are a neat addition, giving the player a lot more control as to which units engage which, and providing options to reinforce armies - something the punishing Ardennes Offensive campaign gave players a hard time with. The real time decisions you have to make on the campaign map, having consequences during your battles is a nice RPG-esque touch, something that any grand strategy enthusiast can definitely get behind. 
- The ""Soldier Story"" letters are a nice touch during the campaign

Cons (oh boy where do I start):
Campaign Issues: 
- Despite including Conti and MacKay, the British characters from CoH (Cutting and Blackmore) are notably absent 
- Pronounced historical absences in terms of unit variety and factions - complete absence of distinctive Canadians who played a large role in the Italy Campaign (with except to the 1SSF which was a joint US-Canada Unit), 
- Weird anachronistic caricatures of General Patton and Field Marshall Montgomery in the form of the obviously renamed ""Buckram"" and ""Norton"" - and yet, Erwin Rommel is named without reservation. What gives? Was Relic only able to get the rights from Rommel's estate to use his likeness in their video game? Whenever they appear on screen, it just feels extremely weird. Hearing two VA's go back and forth as clear representations of Monty and Patton in their legendary squabbles is great, but to have 'em call each other ""Buckram"" and ""Norton"" really takes you out of it, 
- Another anachronistic caricature of an Italian resistance leader in the form of Valentina whats-her-face, despite the relatively small role women actually played in the leadership of the Italian resistance compared to professional soldiers like Enrico Martini - kind of a middle finger to the men who fought in the Italian resistance.
- On the note of the ""Soldier Stories"" - why the heck is there a random black guy in really anachronistic kit as an apparent member a British or American commando unit shown? He isn't an in game unit (as far as I know), he isn't the author of the letters, and he has absolutely no relevance to their content. Yes,  Black Africans served in the Second World War - particularly in the East African and Pacific theatres - that's not my point. A random black guy in Italy (?) during every battle loading screen seems out of place. 
- Another note on the Soldier Stories, neat inclusion etc. - but would it have killed to art team to actually hand write the letters? Seeing the same generic slightly cursive font seems to have been a lazy oversight. Compare that to the little painting and letter details from CoH1/2 campaign stories, it is a bit disappointing.
- Despite the unique addition of a historically accurate campaign map, the UI feels extremely cluttered and janky, making it difficult to move units properly or effectively utilise all possible air/naval assets. It seems to also flicker and glitch every now and again, especially after a load screen. 

Gameplay:
- The graphics are a bit of a downgrade compared to CoH2 - a bit too much bloom and bluster overall, giving it an arcade feel. Perhaps that was intentional, given the move towards a faster paced game, but it kind of detracts from the grittiness of the Second World War, so brilliantly portrayed in previous CoH titles. 
- The tactical pause button is completely useless. Given the FASTER pace of the game, it's inclusion was completely unnecessary. I've used it a grand total of 3 times, each time being more of a nuisance than the last. Given how low the vanilla game pop caps are, I don't see it ever being useful outside of the context of an extreme pop cap or unit size mod. 
- Vehicle wreck and destruction physics are disappointing to say the least. I'm pretty sure burnt out steel husks of Tiger Is don't disintegrate like pieces of jello when a little jeep runs into them. The beta demo and early game play footage looked a lot cleaner and ""explosive"" when it came to this. Vehicle destruction just seems underwhelming, compared to CoH1 and CoH2. 
-  Flamethrowers - way too OP. All my matches seem to have devolved into schizophrenic flamethrower deals. Beautiful eye candy to see a bunch of dudes run around light things up, but a complete restriction on potential play styles and historically inaccurate as all heck. 
- No Canadians, Italian Army (Social Republic/Partisans/Kingdom etc.), no ANZACS, no South Africans, no British Indian Army (lumped in with the British faction, when the Indian divisions acted largely independently) - I'm pretty butthurt about the lack of factions overall. It wouldn't have blown the bank for Sega to prep a few simple skins, given that a lot of the VA work already done could have easily crossed over to different factions. Given that they've got a currently greyed out microtransaction store already in the works, I suspect these will likely show up behind paywalls as superficial skins as a best case scenario. If I'm to be more realistic, I think we won't see them at all, and there will be decals to deck out your Panzer IV with goofy gay pride flags and Fortnite stickers. Please prove me wrong Relic. 

Overall, severely lacking in polish for a triple A launch, extremely lacking in content, and an overall cluttered campaign. After participating as a Beta tester, I can safely say that I am somewhat disappointed at such a lack lustre ""final product"". I am into CoH for the history as much as I am for the outstanding RTS gameplay that the games have offered in the past - they've failed on both counts with this game. I would absolutely love to change my review as I continue to play this game, but given the direction Relic went - I think they've set themselves up from failure.

21 March 2023 Update: As for standard game, Mods have picked up the slack as far as some of the cut content from the main game. The Italy campaign being as drawn out as it has been clearly had some love behind it, but still the whole game feels like a chore. The skirmish battles in the campaign are extremely repetitive (battles on identical scenarios/maps), the movement on the campaign map itself is janky, air power is more or less useless, and the Italian resistance faction is a constant source of annoyance given how little they contribute. Perhaps that last bit is intended to be historically accurate.

I love COH and have been playing it since the first game was released back in 2006. This game mixes the best elements of COH2 and COH1 together with tons of quality of life improvements. Outside of small details, bugs, and balancing issues, the game is great. I play 90% of my time with friends doing co-op skirmish versus AI and the other 10% is PVP skirmishes. I don't really care for single player campaigns and so I may not ever play the campaign, just so you know where I'm coming from.

The graphics look nearly indistinguishable to me from COH2 outside of some of the effects and the color scheme which looks like they went with a more colorful theme. It doesn't bother me though.

The sound has improved since launch, and to my ears, outside of volume differences of certain sounds and a few weapon systems not sounding too well, it has been great. I spent almost 16 years in the US Army and have had multiple deployments to combat as an Infantryman (11B), so to me I prefer these sounds over the theatrical explosions and gunfire from the first two games. With that said, I can see how the changes from the second game to this one can cause issues with some players who got used to the way the last game had it's audio implemented.

I love how they took the factions from the COH2 and the command system from COH1 and merged them together. I never really cared for COH2's commander system. You usually only had a handful of commanders for each faction that were worthwhile and you were made to stick with them because the rest of the commanders just didn't make sense to use. In this game, they need to balance things out and that will only be able to happen after enough players play the game because with enough people playing the game, some of them will inevitably find strategies, tactics, and exploits that the developers and even beta testers will not be able to find on their own. There is a lot of depth to all 4 vanilla factions, and I expect that more will come our way later, just like the previous two games.

My biggest complaint right now are the bugs. It isn't anything I didn't expect. I have never seen a game get released that has played perfectly, and I've been playing PC games since the early 90's. Expectation management is the key to happiness. If you buy a newly released game, expect bugs. If you aren't cool with that, wait. I've already seen many of these bugs get ironed out in the past few weeks, but there are a lot more that need to be worked out. The most annoying for me is where AI players in skirmish will call in off-map support like artillery or air strikes and the planes and shells will hone in on your units no matter where you move them. When I use the same ability, if the enemy move their troops in time, my attack will hit where I called it in and I will miss the intended target. It is ridiculous to have a group of 4 infantry squads retreating at a full sprint all the way across the map and back to my base and all the while they are getting hit over and over with heat seeking artillery shells, and it even hits me in my main base which is supposed to be off limits to off-map support that deals damage.

The game is solid at the core and will be polished in time, but like COH2 and COH1, it will be time before it gets to the high standard we all appreciate from the previous titles.",1679444552,1679444552,True,1,2,0,0,True,False,False

Here is one example. The team colors option is such a simple thing. either all friends yellow and all enemies red or have everyone have a unique color. The unique color is helpful to see if multiple players are attacking one side. However this switches you to color yellow, and enemy and allies colors aren't well coordinated, so it actually makes it so much more confusing. This is such a simple fix and would have been something noticed if they did even a little playtesting, but its still there, and still unfixed.

Another one is the lack of a surrender button, which allowed players to concede defeat, there's a spot for it in the UI, but its not there. Why? Is it that complicated?

Tanks:
Tanks in this game, might be the single most infuriating thing you are gonna experience in this game. Pathing is horrible going for traviling on the road just for shifting position, IN BATTLE! They will try to hit your enemy through civillian cars and such, which would be fine, if they werent made of god damn concrete and can take multiple shots.

Machineguns
don't pin shizzle.

Grenades:
Sometimes they throw a grenade, sometimes they don't. It really feels like a lottery at this point. 

Building:
Building your base on the tiniest plot of land, moving your buildings around to find a spot to build. I am sure you can place your buildings in a way, so you will not be able to build everything.

Retreat:
Retreating units can and will often get stuck in buildings.

UI:
Just ugly, chaotic and well NOT made.

It lacks in content, and I can't justify why I spent $90 on DLC that isn't customizable to begin with. There's nothing to contrast it with. There are no additional skins, commanders, or name plates. Just default and DLC, and I'm unsure I can switch from the DLC to default name plates or icons. I haven't tried the campaign myself yet, but I have seen the Total War-like style. It doesn't appeal to me. If I wanted to play Total War, I wouldn't load up COH3. 

The multiplayer lacks in content, rewards, and challenge. While I have not experienced lags or delays, it just feels empty and repetitive. Each faction has its strengths and weaknesses, but the commanders currently present are boring. USA has airborne and you'd be silly to choose another commander simply because airborne is polished, has the best units, and can play offensively and defensively. Wehrmacht are a hit or miss. Their basic infantry can't be counted on to hold their own and require combined arms tactics to effectively repel enemy assaults. DAK (which, should have been a separate Italian faction) suffers from the same issue as Wehrmacht, which players have resorted to spamming Italian infantry to try and counter the allies. The allies spam basic infantry units with supporting elements or special forces, and you can almost see Miley Cyrus on top of a wrecking ball following the blobs that the allies use to win. 

Overall, the game can get competitive and it has its moments. The pace of multiplayer battles is a nice adjustment, and players who understand that combined arms is vital to their success are a joy to play with and against. I have a feeling that Relic will balance the game, provide the content that is lacking, and, eventually, make a game worth $60 or $90.

Also, the big Italian map where you control your different companies had quite the annoying bug where a company can get stuck on a battle ship and are unable to be deployed so they just take up pop and are useless. The Afrika Korp is all unique missions and was very fun to go through, no complaints on that.

Multiplayer is quite fun (when people aren't jerks) but its a bit bare right now due to the amount of maps, especially 4v4 as it only has 2 maps. The 4 factions are also kind of bare as well. There are only 3 different command point trees per faction but with the way the faction load outs are setup more are definitely coming (just like in CoH2).

As the base game just focus's on the conflicts around Italy and Africa; so its just Germans, Brits, and Americans, but WW2 had many participants in other parts of the world that would be great DLC such as Russia, Japan, France and perhaps a dedicated Italian faction to name some big ones.

People have problems with the UI but to be honest i don't see what's wrong with it.

Just in the course of one game session, I had a mission where the Devil's Brigade needed to save a trapped unit, and as soon as I entered the map all my guys exploded and the sergeant was like ""TOO LATE THEY ALL DIED"", but on reload it worked OK.

Next mission, an objective appeared after I had already done the action (repair a German vehicle) and then immediately failed, then when leaving the building in front of it my vet 3 sniper stuck into a wall and could not be retreated, and then my recovery vehicle decided the best way from A to B is via the enemy's concentrated AT fire on a main road leading to C, with a long slow turn in front of them to be destroyed like a HEDP rotisserie.

I Alt+F4'ed the game - I'm not a great player even though I've got about 600 hours in the series, but this is basically the game breaking versus the AI being practically brain dead, leaving a huge gulf between needed difficulty and my desire to just close out some of these badly designed and un-fun missions.

I know the community is awash in similar complaints and crashes, and even for the 2023 standard of games needing a day one patch and some hotfixes, I've bee playing for nearly a month and many parts of this game are flat-out broken.

On top of that, a lot of new mechanics have been added, in particular the Italian campaign introduces a ton of new actions, units, upgrades, and counters - but the game will hold your hand on the obvious ""click to make a guy move"" basics, while being absolutely mute on why I care which general is loyal or which upgrades to my companies make them combat effective.

The UI doesn't help, in particular company upgrades have no way to revert points - or even undo an errant click in the muddy and unintuitive interface, meaning that when I tried to select an upgrade to read it's description I was locked into it, with no recourse except save scumming.

Objectives make no sense, vehicles pathfind worse than ever in the series, missions are either a boring slog to capture the same points over and over, with the occasional grueling bloodbath thrown in with conflicting objectives and no real weight to any of the hundreds of decisions needed to get through the campaign.

The campaign was the primary draw of this title for me, I love SP/Coop and the general idea is solid. I bet in a year or so, either Relic or some modders will make it a really compelling way to tell a long story across a campaign without a fixed set of missions played in order as traditional campaigns have been. But in practice, it has been a chore, and even as much as I love playing the game even at its worst, the times when it's good and I'm not cursing the designers are so fleeting that the whole experience is just not fun or engaging yet.

If COH3 was just ""COH2, coat of paint, and a new strategic map"" it would have been a lot more palatable than the current state of the game, and we all know Relic is capable of making an absolute banger of an RTS.

Completely new to the franchise.  I did not play 1 or 2 versions of this game.  I like the game from a single player standpoint.  Haven't played much online yet.

When playing the Italian campaign its kind of fun to be the guy in charge and making the calls.  You can reasonable go anywhere or do anything.  But it is very repetitive quickly.  I am a dummy who just enjoys the action, sounds, and thrills.

The African campaign seems to be no choice you just go from mission to cut scene.

I have a lot of dislikes but i still recommend the game and am looking forward to trying out multi play with friends.

Dislikes include - relatively terrible voice acting for the Germans.  Wondering why there is a real life general for some factions but fictional generals for others?  Lack of smoothness with dive bombing planes.  Sounds of people overriding the sounds of dropped ordnance.  EG: (The pilot saying ""time to get the hell out of here"" after dropping ordinance actually is louder than the bomb exploding when hitting the target.) A lot of sounds are kind of weak the machine guns for all factions are not very pronounced compared to a rifle.  

Overall i'd give it a solid ""C"" which is high praise from a guy who hasn't been able to find a game he actually likes since 2018.

The campaign strategy map has many features to be explored and used, such as special abilities for airborne units. I finished entire campaign at highest difficulty and I am sure I will be back for another walk-through.
The North Africa campaign is less interesting as a whole, but the missions are quite decent. It is very nice to see Afrika Korps units and desert allied units.
The multiplayer gameplay is balanced much better in my opinion, than CoH2. In the first days there were some balancing issues, but they were addresed extremely quickly.

I gleefully pre-ordered CoH3 for $80. How could it be bad? CoH and CoH2 were basically masterpieces (tho CoH2 had some issues at launch). And Relic in general; remember Homeworld? Homeworld 2? Dawn of War 1 and 2??? This is definitely a studio that produces masterpiece games.

Frankly I'm stunned. I can't believe how they massacred this. I'm confused and saddened at how bad this game is. It looks like an iPhone game (genuinely, I think CoH2, a 10 year old game, looks better), and the cinematic and bombastic sound design is gone. There are larger problems, like lack of replay, and numerous bugs... but they even got the small things wrong. Why are enemies showing up as friendly colors? Why do light vehicles have heavy tank icons? Why oh WHY is the voice-over guy harassing me about what I should do with my resources?

The campaign, which in previous CoH games have been stellar, is pretty boring. The campaign map gimmick just feels like a poor imitation of a Total War game. And the characters feel like cartoons, instead of human beings trapped in history's deadliest war.

Armored units feel a little watered down and some feel like they're made of paper mache when the shells start flying and infantry with bazookas are extremely deadly. May need some balance updates on that soon.

Pathfinding, balance, no roadmap, no testing on balancing patches, patches that barely function as promised, maphacks as usual on the chinese side. 

Poor unit animations. Poor unit voicelines (1-2 voicelines per unit repeated all the time). Poor unit pathfinding, to the point where i lose vehicles because they just do circles on their own. Tanks and AT shooting into the ground like its a missing competition. High elo as axis and allies, 2v2 and 3v3's. Hundred hours into the game so i'm not just mad cause bad. But really the game is just terrible, and right now barely playable. 

Campaign is a disgrace to any single player games. 

It really feels like lelic ran out of money and just decided to push it for monetary income. All of the positive reviews have sub 10 hours so they really don't get to the meat of the game. Trust me on the first bite nostalgia hits and you think there might be a game under all of the unpolished and untested layers but trust me. There is no game here and there won't be for awhile. Cheese is rampant, Commanders are horribly unbalanced, Allies lacks any mid to late game artillery on par with axis. Matches turn into blob fests and Sim city simulator. Who can blob the most, who can build the most bunkers and emplacements. Extremely questionable balance choices across the board. Certain factions feel hardly fleshed out, as if the game was only ready to ship with 2 at most and the others are just tacked on. 

This title is 100% a console port crossed over for pc. All of the games features are made to be easier to play with a controller, auto reinforce, auto build in your base, firefights taking forever in the early to mid game. Micro is undervalued in this title. All the fights are basically RNG especially when armor is involved, who will shoot into the ground less? Same with AT guns. Mostly useless. 

Horrible horrible ""game"". I even get mad thinking of all the things to put into this review and i'm sad i wasted 120 hours trying to dig into this ""game"" 

I should also mention the forum mods for steam will nuke you into the sun if you have any slight disagreement or spat about the games current condition. Threads are locked for the slightest and smallest rule violation if it paints this ""game"" in a bad light. They pass out bans and perma bans like it's free candy. 

I really tried to like this game but i can't. I also can't reccomend it to anyone, at least not for a year, when everyone has already left this pile of dog crap for something else more finished and not a ripoff. It will take a lot of updates for this game to be even remotely 1.0. I have a high tolerance for bad games but this one really tested my limits on an emotional and physical level. Losing matches to bugs, pathfinding, or cheese with no counters. 

Save yourself some sanity, please for the love of GOD ignore the good ""reviews"" the weekend warriors who play 2 hours and get fooled into thinking there is any semblance of a game here. 

2/10 - Do not buy this game, do not recommend it to anyone, and for the love of god don't even buy it on sale. I wouldn't even play this for free if i had the chance, they should pay ME for testing this pile of dog water. No words can describe how unbearable this game is at any elo, at any difficulty. 

STAY AWAY.

Pros:
1. Its COH, having played COH1 & 2, all the C&C games and Starcraft/Warcraft RTS of course I'm going to play it.
2. Some of the Campaign maps seem realistic on the Italian Campaign and have villages, hilly terrain, etc.
3. I like some of the new units that I don't recall being in previous COH games.
4. It is fun, I already played this game way more than I thought I would since it released.
5. Tactical Pause is great when sometimes you need a breather to think about things and come up with a strategy or assign engineers to setup defenses. 
6. It has its exciting moments, like in the Italian campaign sometimes I ran into units I didn't expect like Brummbar or Panthers that were hull down.

Cons:
1.  I have a 2070 RTX which does ok, but seems to struggle more with COH3 than the other games.  So I only have most of my settings medium and don't feel like I'm getting the full graphics experience.
2.  Additional point on graphics - on the Italian campaign main map view, the GPU gets around 70-80% and the fans spin up, I don't have this issue with Civ 6 for instance.  Seems like something is not optimal.
3.  There are little annoying bugs, they don't break the game, but seems like some could get fixed.  For instance I have experienced when you faction  picks up an enemy's weapon - their voices change to the other teams!  Like Afrikacorps picking up Vickers or 2 pounder AT gun, they will get UK accents.
4.  Italian campaign seems like its needs to adjustment - there is never enough Pop-Cap on the main map to have more than a few planes/ships with your companies and building defenses takes Pop-Cap so I only managed to build one defense on the map.  Axis team though seems to have a bunch of recon planes they are flying around.
5.  AI in the campaign is sometimes buggy, on one map for instance it kept attacking me on the left side of the map and I just setup some defenses and units and wiping them out and the AI never took a run at my base or right flank.
6.  Path logic for vehicles has some bugs - I started laughing a few times when I sent Greyhounds to a place on the map and set their facing and they get there and drive around in a circle a couple times before facing the right direction I told them too. LOL

3-19-2023 update
I finished both the DAK and Italian campaigns.  I still keep my thumbs up for the game being fun in playing, but the Italian campaign was a bit of a let down on the cutscenes and the story, its essentially the 2 generals and the Partisans leader popping up and either agreeing or arguing.  Some of the missions have characters, but its just ""pop-ups"" of the portrait and them talking.  There were some other screens popping up with stuff to read like letters, but none of the good content I remember from COH1 or COH2 that had a story and real characters.  After finishing the last mission in the Italian campaign I was very underwhelmed by the cartoonist movie cutscenes.  All I could think was after all these years since COH2 waiting on COH 3 and all the time I spent playing the Italian campaign, this is all I get?  This is my reward for completing a bunch of missions and skirmishes and 60 bucks for the game??  Some leaders bickering and falling in love with each other and a cartoon at the end?  What a letdown.

My other huge complaint is after finally upgrading my companies enough to call in the good stuff, like the Churchhill Black Prince or Easy 8, I barely got to use them.  Pop cap restrictions are also ridiculous on some missions and units.  So for a Sherman Easy 8 and rifleman call in takes 20 and then you are on a mission and only 50 or 75 Pop cap and then by the time you have enough command points to call one of the good units in, there's no pop-cap room left unless you ""sacrifice"" you existing units.  What happened to the ability to recall and take units from the field?  I'm pretty sure the COH2 Soviet mission let you do this.  Another major grip, what happened to reinforce?  So team weapon is down to 1 or 2 units, why can't I take a rifileman group and reinforce them?  Instead I have to get a Medical truck and drive it over there.",1678211301,1679246584,True,2,0,0.493561506271362305,0,True,False,False

Everything Company of Heroes 3 is trying to do has been done before and better. Every aspect of this game is a downgrade from COH2, and it's downright embarrassing. The sound assets, the story, the cartoonishly bright graphics, the single-player campaign with its still images and voice-overs, as opposed to the fully animated cinematics seen in COH1 and 2, the terrible AI, the bad animations, even the main menu looks like utter garbage. This is the kind of stuff you see in an indie game, not a fully priced AAA experience. This game positively reeks of corner-cutting and budgetary constraints.

That said, I still cannot fathom why the sound assets had to be changed at all. An MP40 did not sound any different in 1940 than it does today, and neither did any of the tanks, airplanes, or explosions. If there was a single thing that should have ironically been copy & pasted from COH2, it's the sound effects. Heck, even most of the animations and unit models could have been easily transferred from the previous game, which would have saved a lot of precious development time that could have been spent making sure the game didn't suck. After all, the game is using the same engine (albeit slightly upgraded), as well as being developed and published by the same companies. The Pokemon series has been getting away with far more egregious shit for decades now, and no one seems to complain about it either, so why not Company of Heroes? At least here, it makes some actual sense.

I could go on for another twenty paragraphs complaining about the inane decisions in this game, but I honestly think that Relic isn't doing too well financially and this is their last-ditch effort to stay afloat. The massive commercial failure of Dawn of War 3 and the COVID pandemic probably hit Relic's coffers pretty badly, and this is the best they could do, given the circumstances. And while I'm certainly not unsympathetic, releasing a barely functional game and charging a full price for it is simply unacceptable. Doubly so when your publisher is already gearing up for some micro-transaction mayhem in the near future.

Anyone desperate for more RTS goodness should probably wait a bit longer until they fix this sad excuse for a game launch. Possibly another year or two, if I'm perfectly honest, and even then there's no guarantee that anything would eventually be fixed. The disastrous launch of Dawn of War 3 and its swift abandonment due to poor sales suggests that SEGA isn't above giving COH3 the same treatment should it fail to deliver.",1679224310,1679227092,False,5,0,0.547014415264129639,0,True,False,False

Gameplay design genuinely seems fun but the QoL and UI design in very obviously built with console in mind.

Couple the UI issues with bright and popping colours, it feel garish and geared towards living room play. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for a RTS that has been released on the largest PC distribution platform that exists, I can't recommend it as it currently is.

No in game spectate system.

The campaign probably grinds my gears the most. The Italian campaign had so much potential and someone they dropped the ball big time here. It's unpolished and often times buggy. I've had to restart the campaign twice just to be able to progress through to the end.

The experience is held back by the lack of polish. 
For example I had several situtations where tanks drove right through each other. 
Or heavy weapon troops getting stuck forever behind my HQ when entering the map.
That was really disappointing.

The strategic campaign map feels unfinished and unpolished although I must admit it shows some ambition.
The core mechanics of the Italy campaign are never explained and introduced properly and then it just ends very suddenly. Like they just ran out of time.
I wish they had focused on this campaign instead of forcing me to play a Nazi General like Rommel. That's a really really weird choice in 2023.

Here's an idea:
Instead of cutting the game in two different game modes for the Italy campaign and the africa campaign make it one big dynamic RTS map. 
This is an RTS game. Go all in.

Graphics are terrible sometimes even laughable when the civilians wave at you with their clunky animations. I admit it made me chuckle. It made me question my settings several times but after reading through half of reddit it seems to be the best you can get out of this game in 2023. Really disappointing. It makes me wonder if my grandma could make some extra money doing animations for AA video games.

Here's an idea:
Save the money for those disconnected cutscenes and invest it into polish and innovation. 
If you want to make movies or shows start a movie studio or a netflix show.
Focus on what's important.

Overall performance and polish are just terrible and disappointing for a studio like Relic.
There are small and big glitches and bugs frequently which will hopefully be patched over the coming years. 

PS: 
Please stop it with WW2 games and give us Warhammer.
You can build fantastic sci-fi or fantasy worlds in here that don't exist anywhere else why oh why would you just mirror what already happend. 
I can watch what happened in WW2 on the history channel.

I do agree with the reviews that say that the campaign feels unfinished. So much of me wants to throw negativity at this out of principle...is this what the industry has come to? Releasing half finished games and then slowly improving over several ""small"" patches? But...on the other hand, I enjoy playing it. This is classic COH formula...with improved graphics and some new gameplay mechanics, and fun and interesting units to command and improve on. The depth of strategy...as with the previous COH games, is deeply customizable here. They brought back base building, too! Whoever's idea that was in COH2 should brutally scolded. I enjoy playing it...period, which makes it a good game to me. How good, though?

To start, when I say it feels unfinished, I mean that I want more. I think we need new maps to play on. I think (and I hate to say it) we need the store open with customizable skins, decals, and we need that added depth of personalization that we used to have with our units in COH2. The strategy and core mechanics are there...we now need variety.

I do play the Italian campaign. This is primarily because I like the storyboard mode format and really like the unit improvement and veterancy mechanics there. But...the Italian peninsula feels rough, unfinished. The AI practically useless and flailing...or overbearing. The bunkers and artillery you can place...mostly not very placeable and not very useful, either. It's not quite the Ardennes Assault I was hoping it to be...but I play it for these reasons. 

So...while I'm a little disappointed, I'd also admit my expectations were a little high...and the core reasons for playing a game; ""being entertained, being visually wowed,"" are there for me. It feels 90%+ done to me. So I couldn't not recommend this, knowing that it will someday be improved upon greatly, and invested in deeply.

However, compared to AoE4, CoH3 has a more decent launch and game breaking bugs were not as prevalent. (Remember the rocket powered Mongol TC? I do. Remember the mangonel/bombard spam? I do) It took them a year to fix AoE4 so I won't be surprised if they take a year or even less for this one.

I think we can sum up all the complaints here as: I'm having fun but I could have more fun if only it was more polished. Understandable, especially since not all are well aware of the crunch in game development and how hard it is to make games nowadays compared to before. I wish ""gamers"" could be more empathic, try to be more understanding and curb their sky high expectations. We don't want an another Blizzard or Riot games in the industry. Some people just can't appreciate the ambition of launching a CoH game with four distinct factions plus two different kinds of campaigns. It'll be a surprise if there's no teething issues because of the large amount of content that you can get to play from day 1!

Anyways enough about social commentary, if it's about the game, I'm only playing team games and co-op vs AI and so far I haven't encountered any bugs. Performance wise, I think this game runs better than CoH2. 

When it comes to faction design, I think it's the best in the series. Brits are no longer the ""spam encampments"" turtly faction of CoH2, they're now well rounded faction but lack specialized units like the sniper and has the least amount of non brigade elite units. 'Murica, as of writing, is pathfinder spam plus overbuffed sniper into AA truck and then spam Shermans. High firepower and mobility but the tech choices is a bit confusing to a beginner. Wehrmacht has a weak standard infantry but you can refund them for more specialized ones when you tech up. They have lots of elite and specialized units and there is an upgrade that immediately gives them veterancy level 1. I haven't played much of Deutches Afrikakorps to give a decent review so there's more to look forward for me.

The brigade system allows you to decide how you want to play your faction. Whether to focus on aerial call downs and paratroopers, elite troops, or even a Tiger tank which adds more to each faction's replayability and strategic flexibility. I'm glad that it's like CoH1's system where you can choose which upgrade/ability to choose from a tree instead of CoH2's.

I haven't touched the campaigns that much. I've tried the Italian campaign demo way back and I think the concept is interesting. It's like Total War where you move units in a map and then a real time battle happens when you attack an enemy/capture some cities. From reviews there are complaints about the AI. Fortunately, Relic is addressing the issue and have released a new patch. Might be time to try it again. There's also the North African campaign which has a traditional linear campaign. So yeah, two campaigns in one game.

Anyways, I'm glad I wasn't dissuaded by the Steam reviews because so far, I'm really enjoying it. I've played the first two games but mostly in single player. As a formerly single player only player I'll admit that IGN's review was a bit disheartening because of their criticisms with the campaign AI. However, because of the QoL changes (like auto reinforce and heal, auto placement of buildings with a double click) and interesting faction design I'm finally diving into multiplayer and learning new builds for this revolutionary RTS.",1679078340,1679093203,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

I didn't play much of the campaign for Italy either, hence why this only covers multiplayer. 

Balance - From what I've played, which includes all four factions and their various battlegroups, the game seems balanced on its surface for the most part, with no egregiously bad examples. I want to clarify that while many people bemoan balance, I have learned that balance is dependent on game knowledge; For an example, In AOE4, nobody thought much about Delhi, until they found the sacred site rush strategy. Springalds were fine; until someone spammed them and started a whole season regarding them. I can see the devs at Relic  are actively balancing Coh3 in accordance with the communities game knowledge, with the nerf to emplacements and the nerf to the greyhound, and subsequent buffs to under used infantry, which is nice. I think as players explore more combinations and strategies, more nerfs and buffs will naturally come. 

Gameplay - The game feels nice. I don't mind the UI, and I find it clear to identify where my attention needs to be in most situations though 1V1 would be a bit more chaotic and I would like to be able to Zoom out more. I would say the best part is that high APM isn't a necessity to be good or contributing to your team. You do have to be responsive to events, such as mortars or grenades, but it's nowhere near as high as Starcraft 2 or even AOE4. 

Graphics - Graphics are fine. They aren't stunning, even on high, but they are passable. I think people tend to forget this is an 8 player RTS that is intended to be played on the Xbox one S. I definitely feel like some of the graphical and zoom choices are a result of this. 

Overall, I'd say it's good for what it is, a baseline entry, but I am concerned with monetization moving forward. I would compare it to something like Halo Wars with less content, and it's certainly not something that is going to absolutely blow your mind, but it's also not something that isn't without some charm and fun moments. If you can get it on sale, I would recommend it if you enjoy RTS that are a bit messy, but don't have too high of a skill-floor to enjoy.",1679073699,1679073699,True,2,1,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

-----------------------------------------
My Background.
-----------------------------------------
Huge fan of RTS games, played every block buster title there was.(Starcraft/Warcraft, Red Alert/Tiberian sun, Homeworld, Supreme Commander, Age of Empires etc... ) so i know a thing or two regarding RTS genres. In this review i will not touch graphics / music, since my main requirement is solid core.
-----------------------------------------
COH3 Singleplayer
-----------------------------------------
Note:  I Bought COH3 only for MP, so take this section with grain of salt

I enjoy a well crafted, Single Player expirience in an RTS game like Homeworld or Star Craft Wings of Liberty, this game ain't one of those, in this game single player contains, a ""campaign"" and ""operations"".

Campaign is similar to something like Total war, meaning you have world map, which you move your units about and end turn, this is where similarities end. its mediocre at best. it has potential, and that's it.

Operations is set of missions, one after another one, akin to old school campaign styles(Like in COH2).
Story and Writing is horrible and forgettable it's clear that it was not a primary thought for developers, which i personally don't mind. I used it as tutorial to learn factions.

if you are buying this game for Single Player only, my advice is to avoid it, or at least wait for a huge discount,

-----------------------------------------
COH3 Multiplayer
-----------------------------------------
Regarding Multiplayer i am conflicted i don't know if i should give it positive or negative, since it has lot of potential, my main gripes with this title is:
- Horrible UI
- Awful Pathfinding 
- Bad Base Building
- No Replay Feature on Launch

UI in Main menu, match screen and ingame is horrible, it looks cheep and something like it was created in a week, Whoever Designed and Approved this UI, should be gifted with User Experience book, for birthday.

Pathfinding is horible, commands that are simple should be easy to execute(captain obvious strikes), for instance i want to garrison HMG and point it a certain direction, i need to issue several orders just to rotate, which is a no-no in a competitive game where every second matters.
When i order vehicle to reverse(which is order to go backward and not expose flanks) it starts dancing around, several times it rotated exposing weak points and behaving as if i ordered regular move.

Vehicles move around unmaned machine guns and cannons, cant run them over,
also there was attack option in COH2 to target with main gun and destroy unmanned emplacements to deny them, now there is only attack move, i have no idea how to deny emplacements after i have killed off units, besides stealing them.

Regarding base building i personally think it devolved, in COH2 there was a main building, where you upgrade it to receive new units or get weapons of the rack, now u build it, like in COH 1, which would be ok, if i don't have to fiddle for a minute with placement, in few matches i could not place last building, because i was slamming previous ones down anywhere there was a space so i don't waste time. hence indirectly blocking myself.

No Replay's on launch, but mechanics for future skins is implemented...
To be honest they did announce how to boot up replays outside of the game, but it's kinda a hassle, i want it implemented in main menu, for 60$ price tag, this is no indy studio.

-----------------------------------------
Conclusion
-----------------------------------------
I personally believe they intentionally dumbed-down this game, so it can be ported on other platforms, hence gimping core of the game, all above issues that i have gripe with can be fixed, but i doubt they will do it, if the game dosen't do well they will abandon it like DOW3.

PS: If game is on huge discount, and you have money to burn, buy it, you will have some fun, it not worth 60$ price tag that it asks for.",1678134128,1679054991,False,5,0,0.547188460826873779,0,True,False,False

Maybe come back in another 3-6 months for multiplayer.

It's fun but with plenty of big bugs even crashes on the campaign map.

Example of bugs:
Pathfinding: 

- Units get stuck completely
- Only one character of a unit is present on the battlefield and can move, the rest remain stuck
- You issue a retreat and the unit first runs towards the enemy for 2-3 seconds before deciding to run to your base
- You issue the order to enter a building, door is in front of the unit, but the unit goes around the building where there's no door and sits there taking fire from the enemy doing nothing

Firing
- Armor will sometimes just try and shoot at a rock or wall because there is a line of sight but still the actual shooting thinks there is none (and no that's not a miss)

I'm having some fun. I hope it will get there. I can't recommend it in its current state for full price. It's not finished. After last update we are being asked opt-in for marketing telemetry on ads....why? If I start seeing in-game ads after paying full price maaaan.

tl;dr - core gameplay is still good but bugs, [strike] limited content [/strike] EDIT italian campaign is long (38 hours for me) tho tbh a lot of its content is repetitive AI skirmishes on the same few maps, strange UI behavior, not great campaign, [strike] why did the last update ask us to opt-in for marketing feedback on ads? [/strike] I opted out, but I haven't seen an ad either. I think there's an in-game store so maybe that's where this is. Ok.

Full disclosure - I suck at COH. I bought COH2 after all the content was released probably on sale and loved it, but I am not good. I abused the keyboard pause button. This is supposedly what the new tactical pause feature was going to cater to. The people like me that enjoy the tactical RTS nature of the game but can't keep up. It's flawed. [strike] On the one hand it is nice to see at least the first guess at pathfinding the AI picks, and review to know where each unit is headed. [/strike] EDIT: sometimes this tactical pause pathing is an outright lie. You couldn't see this with the old keyboard pause, although you could queue order you couldn't check the queue. I have two big problems with tactical pause. 1 - the queue and ""TACTICAL PAUSE"" text take up too much real estate directly in the middle of the screen and 2 - the UI for giving orders in tactical pause doesn't behave the same as real-time.
The latter causes a lot of confusion. For example, when you order vehicles to reverse, your cursor stays in command-reverse if you are in tactical pause, but not in real time, and it won't clear and select a new unit by clicking like it does in real time, it issues another reverse order. You have to right click to clear the reverse first, this is confusing. Ordering engineers to construct sandbags or walls also does this, but it is the same behavior as in real time, Except right clicking doesn't clear the command like it does in real time. The system feels like it tried to do too much with a simple thing. Just replicate the existing keyboard pause behavior, add a small queue tracker off to the side, and let the UI work exactly the same as it does in real time?

The North Africa campaign is ok, but short. It is told from the perspective of a local fighting with the British, but you are German fighting with Rommel, which is weird. Since the war in North Africa historically has a distinct ebb and flow, it would have been cool, and could have doubled the campaigns length, to play as the British as they gain the upper hand and push Rommel back. But instead it feels like 1/3, maybe 1/2 of the COH2 campaigns. EDIT: this campaign was decent though and the single player highlight

Bugs: I haven't seen many in the native battles themselves, except for some bad pathfinding and dumb AI. Not as dumb as some have said, my units have generally engaged the enemy appropriately. The enemy has been dumb. The grand strategy map for the Italian campaign, though, the new centerpeice, is very buggy. I currently have a company stuck in the ocean who can't do anything. This company was granted by a setpiece conversation with the two annoying generals constantly grabbing at your attention. Engineer constructs like sandbags don't form a continuous line, even though they appear continuous. And lots of buildings like your own production buildings can be shot through, even though the UI correctly identifies that it breaks LOS. The kinds of things that indicate the game just isn't quite finished.

[strike] I'm going to have to step back to an early save in the Italian campaign which is aggravating. If I get another major bug on the campaign map I'm going to put this game down until they finish it. I'm not too far, but at this point the ""grand strategy"" part feels annoyingly handholdy and constantly puts things in front of me without letting me go more than a turn. [/strike] EDIT: I do respect the Total War vibe they went for here, really going the logical steps beyond the Battle of the Bulge content in COH2, but I don't think they got it, and carried over too much COH into the grand strategy. For one, instead of a blank canvas, its a constant stream of [strike] two [/strike] three npcs yelling at you to do things their way or forcing you to make arbitrary decisions at that instant and that instant only, like in missions. For another, its hard to use much of the tools available because the population cap applies to everything, even emplacements. So a single enemy town might have 6 or 8 emplacements, and I built 5 the entire campaign. AI skirmishes also become very repetitive with like 5 maps, which they try to break up by varying the formula, but it still becomes an activity to avoid. There is very little grand strategy to manage beyond moving companies and bombarding areas. And the rules are not well explained despite a lot of early tutorials HINT the pattern is heal/repair, move or move attack, then march to move again. Later, use douglas' with airdrop to gain more movement. the germans rarely counterattack except to throw themselves at your companies, so this pattern maximizes your companies. The missions themselves in the italian campaign are good.

It also seems, from my experience and what I've seen elsewhere, that this is where a lot of the bugs are. EDIT; the italian campaign is definitely where the majority of bugs are

I bought it understanding the downsides because I really enjoy CoH and I still wanted the third game because of some of the few improvements within it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Check back in a year or two, maybe they will have fixed the game by then. Maybe you can get it on sale then too.

The first few hours was addicting as I played through the German campaign first and enjoyed a variety of interesting Italian and German troops. Then I did the Allied campaign and enjoyed the unit diversity again with the Gurkhas, American paratroopers, and the Devil's Brigade. The tactical pause feature was probably my favorite part of this game, just because it made offensive pushes in single player so much more fun and less hectic. The tactical pause let me plan my offensive so as not to waste time and to give me more mental space to focus on the individual problems my troops encounter as they move forward. Sadly, that's where most of my praise ends.

I can tell there was a lack of effort on this game. The gameplay here reminded me of the GTA 6 leaks we encountered in September, where there were so many placeholders from GTA 5. Similarly here, they've reused many of the CoH2 ability emblems, and it is not only pathetic, but also insulting to anybody with even a basic knowledge of WW2. I mean when I utilize a ability with a emblem that has a picture of a Russian officer on my American tank crew, it completely takes me out of the experience. It might seem minor, but after playing CoH2 it just feels lazy for them to not even put in the effort to make a new set of icons to reflect the nations participating in this new theater of war. Especially after they put in the effort to make this vibrant, cartoony new environment. It's like Relic can't trust themselves or their playerbase to be mature and accept the horrifying realities of war, so instead they dumbed it down and made it ridiculously colorful, making it less impactful as a whole. I get it's Italy, one of the most beautiful places on Earth imo. With amazing weather and terrain, you can't make it as dark as CoH2. But I mean between the lack of impact from the audio/voice acting and the flashy lighting and color palette, it feels totally disconnected from the real historical event it is portraying. It's like playing a mobile game, where the developers have lost all time and place and twisted reality into something unreal.

Hours into the game I couldn't bring myself to care about the soldiers I commanded in either campaign. In the German campaign we basically play as the historically bad guys. And the game decides instead to reflect on the experiences of Benghazi Jewish people, an interesting and thought provoking perspective no doubt, but it's hard for that to connect when I'm not even playing as the Allies in that campaign. The main characters really only exist in cutscenes, the only connection between the gameplay and story is that every battle is prefaced and ended with the main characters talking about how much worse it was going to get. Then the end of the campaign gives a basic description of what followed the final battle, as the tides turned against the Germans.. Frankly, it would have been cooler to me if we had the option to play either as the Allies or the Axis in that campaign and as a result get two different perspectives, giving extra incentive to play the campaign twice. For the German perspective, it would have been good to see the war through the eyes of a German foot soldier or officer, who perhaps could give insight to how the Germans saw a resurgence of success during the Africa campaign and how it all came to an end, between new Allied strategies to even how poor hygiene caused mass sickness within the Afrika Corp. Meanwhile, we could play with the Allies with the wide variety of units they would have had at their disposal, including indigenous soldiers, playing a defensive war that focuses on protecting key assets and objectives in order for the Allies to not lose too much.

Meanwhile in Italy, we actually do play as the people whose stories we are following to some extent. I mean you can't control the main characters but all cutscenes and dialogue are from Allied forces as we make choices on our fight towards Rome. Supposedly, this is a dynamic campaign, but the lack of any dynamic forces and serious consequences and rewards make this the biggest drawback of the game. The enemy army doesn't usually make spirited attempts to take back territory and the decisions you make almost don't matter at all. I mean you get loyalty from your commanders just for breathing sometimes. I had no difficulty securing the loyalty of all three generals by mid game, just by accident. To be fair I was on an easier difficulty so perhaps that played into it, but even still, most actions I took in the game felt like they had no real impact. When I did get some sort of interesting new objective to gain a buff, the instructions weren't clear. Like when one of my commanders suggested I retire a company to the rear of my map near one of my ports to get some ice cream and rest. I was all for it but they didn't give me very clear instructions and there was no objective in the top left. It was as if the objective didn't exist at all. I moved a destroyer away from a certain port and I immediately get a dialogue from my company saying that they ""just missed the boat"" and that ice cream would have to wait until Rome. I had a couple of objectives like that throughout the campaign that weren't outlined or listed in any way so I would sometimes just have to assume they existed. It was annoying because, even though I'm sure some hard core players might say I'm being lazy and should acquire the skill to track all those objectives, I like having a list of things to do highlighted in my UI so I can keep it all in front of me as I make decisions. Otherwise, attrition and company damage were meaningless 9/10 because I could just spam heals and repairs without any drawback besides resource drain. It only became a problem for me mid game when my forces began to get spread out a lot and I was not getting as many supplies as I needed. Again, maybe I should just replay the campaign on harder difficulty. But I am confident in saying that even if I played on harder difficulty, the campaign as it is right now could never match something like the pre-Rome 2 Total War title campaign maps in scale or complexity.

The battles meanwhile, outside of the reused assets and poor audio, are excellent. Exciting and engaging battle after battle during the German campaign. The Italian campaign is good too but sadly the interesting battles are separated by boring skirmishes. I can tell they at least tried to add some variety to the objectives in those skirmishes but honestly, you should probably play it on a harder difficulty if you want the most intense combat you can get out of the skirmishes. But thankfully at least battles like at Anzio and Monte Cassino, it feels like you get a chance to fight formidable foes and change history. If you know anything about the bombings at Monte Cassino, you'll know what a tragedy it was and how it contributed to the massive impact on the artistic world by WW2. Having your commanders discuss the consequences of Allied command decisions and how you can prevent a national treasure from being destroyed makes you feel like you're coming across one of the few meaningful and interesting decisions in the campaign.

Basically, if you still enjoy the CoH2 battle style and don't mind the glitches and lackluster aspects of audio and art in the game, and you can get past the somewhat boring campaign, you'll probably be ok with it if you bought it on sale instead of full price. But if you're buying it for the campaign, save your money and come back in a couple years when hopefully things change.",1679020464,1679020464,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

My takes on the new version and if you should buy it at the full prince.

Crashes and Bugs have been few for me.  I purchased March 10th.

The campaign is interesting and engaging.  If I set the skill level higher it is somewhat difficult to win.

The matches against AI are good, if anything I cannot seem to change the AI level.  Not sure, set to hard, seems somewhat easy to win with the current AI at hard.  

The matches against other players was good experience, and much more engaging than playing vs the AI, harder for sure.

So, at this point I am all in with then new version and have seen two patches in the last week.  Minimal crashing for me.  I have a newer system with a standard built in Graphic card, nothing special.

The game has a lot more development needed and a lot more control and customization needed.  I will give that time.  I would say we are at a good starting point at March 2023, hope to see a lot more development. 

I have trouble selecting units and controlling the map scrolling, that can be troublesome in battle.  Trying to get better scrolling of the map and unit selection, it is difficult at this point.

Been playing COH since the beginning. It's gotten progressively worse. Should probably call this release a ""Steam Early Access"" game. 

I gave it a chance and beat both campaigns. Haven't tried online yet, but I can't imagine from the other reviews and comments it's any less buggy or complete than the campaign.

If you LOVE COH go ahead and buy this, but expect a bunch of bugs and some ""hmmm..."" moments. If you're new to the franchise, buy COH 1 (seriously, it's the best one) and wait for them to finish making this game.

---EDITED---

Okay, I gave it some more thought. I love the franchise. COH3 is about 85-90% complete (playable, but obviously not AAA quality). I'll probably replay the Italian campaign, keeping in mind a few bugs that have strategic and tactical implications.

I doubt I'll ever replay the Africa campaign. It's too short and the backstory doesn't really fit with playing as the Germans. Maybe if you were leading a British or Indian company, but otherwise you just feel kind of guilty.

Haven't played multi-player yet, but there are enough minor bugs that all of the YouTubers have noted, that I'll probably wait a bit. Troops getting stuck exiting a building, the unit pathing, the tactical map, etc... I guess the norm these days is to rush a product for sales and then fix a bunch of bugs after launch. Probably save a bunch of money on the QA department when there is none. Have the customer pay to be your quality control...

I hope the powers that be don't take these ratings as a sign that people don't love COH and try to kill off the franchise. Take the time to do things right next time, don't rush your developers. You'll get more profits when everyone talks about how great the game is, not when you scoop-up a few quick dollars from the die-hard fans that have been with you since 2006.

I bought the game in pre-sale, because it has thousands of hours in Coh2. I've played both the Alpha version and the Beta. But the final product is way off for me. The amount of buggies that the game contains is completely unbelievable. 

I played the African campaign first, which was really weak. I played it on the highest difficulty, and it was all about destroying what was on the map. It took time, but was it a challenge? It wasn't exactly fun either. 

Then I played the Italian campaign. I played 57 turns before the game always crashed at Piggatire Maggiore airport. If I try to conquer it. The game crashes. I try to work around it, but two turns later the game tells me that the Germans are moving their planes north and will use Piggatire Maggiore specifically, and the game crashes again. So far Relic hasn't fixed it, so I can't continue the campaign.

What's really bad about CoH3 is the unit control. The units often don't execute the commands I give them at all. I sometimes have to press Retreat three times before a unit decides to retreat. Even the lag that is there is absolutely unbelievable. The enemy throws a grenade, I see it, and I click a little bit next to the unit to move. But nothing happens. It's only when the grenade explodes that the unit moves. 

And the tank and vehicle controls are probably even worse than the infantry. The system Relic has chosen is simply tragic. 

I'm very sorry I can't give a better rating. But this is really unplayable for the user.

Singleplayer:
The campaign map is fine, however what I've noticed very quickly is that the AI is stupid and does not pose any challenge. It also often makes irrational decisions. It could be due to the fact that I selected normal difficulty, but the game, unfortunately, does not have the option to change the difficulty after a campaign has already been started. Another inconvenience in the singleplayer campaign is a very low population cap, which artificially prolonges the gameplay because the Player can have only a few units to use on the campaign map until some key cities are captured.

Multiplayer:
Multiplayer is where the CoH franchise really shines (obviously), and this game is no exception. The matches are now a little bit quicker. I've only played 1v1s so far and I really enjoyed the battles. It is a breath of fresh air in the package that we know and love. The factions, gameplay wise, are a mix of all 5 factions from CoH2, meaning that something that you could associate with a faction from CoH2 can now be within another, but not necessarily. The major downside for me is a lack of ranked mode in-game as of right now, however leaderboards can be checked on CoH official site. To be fair, the game definitely needs some kind of progression in multiplayer or at least something to fight for. The battlegroups system instead of commanders is a very nice change which allows choosing tactics more dynamically depending on what the current situation requires. Keep in mind though that for now all factions have only 3 battlegroups, which hopefully will be expanded in the future.

Overall, despite the fact that the game very much needs some tweaks, it is still a very pleasant game, especially in multiplayer. If you enjoyed CoH2 (or 1) there is a high chance that this game will also be to your liking, however an open mind is needed. The game has some bugs, sure, but in time they should be fixed or at least reduced and the game will get polished and new content added. Remember what the premiere of CoH2 looked like and how the game was polished.
If you are a bored CoH2 Player, CoH3 will be a great refreshment. If you want a fully polished game with a lot of multiplayer content, wait for some patches and then give the game a try.

Yes, there are some improvements and new features in comparison to the first two games (four factions, auto-reinforce, towing, soldiers can ride on tanks), but there are not many of them.

In fact the game is in many aspects way worse than it's two predecessors:
-the sound is just really bad, some explosions sound like they are from Empire Earth
-the music is a joke (the soundtrack consists of just ONE track)
-the graphics are basically the same like COH 2 (which is 10 years old) and are actually lacking many details and small animations in comparison to COH 1 & 2 (e.g. the reloading animation of MGs)
-the UI is clunky and pretty bland

I could overlook all these problems, if the game would provide a fun and well balanced experience in multiplayer, but sadly the exact opposite is true. Since the release of the game the multiplayer is in a really bad shape. There is always one cheesy, overpowered strategy. They tried to fix this with some patches, but they even made it worse and the next broken strategy evolves. And all these broken strategies resolve around spamming just one unit most of the time. The game has a very rich unit roster for every faction, which is very nice, but in multiplayer you actually can't use 80% of the available units, because you can only win with the broken units. Therefore the multiplayer is just extremely boring, either you are cheesing the opponent or they are cheesing you.
On top of that Relic made basic changes to make games shorter and faster. This is probably up to personal preference, but I did love and prefer the longer and very close games of COH 2. In COH 3 a lot of games are basically decided after 5-10 min and there are very rarely comebacks, because the games snowball very hard after the early game.

In general I have the feeling that Relic didn't put a lot of love and passion into the game, hence the lackluster presentation (especially the details) or music. They are also apparently incapable of balancing the game, because as an experienced COH player you recognize a lot of the basic balancing problems pretty fast, but they were not able to in years of development and playtesting. Therefore I don't trust Relic anymore to fix the multiplayer experience in the foreseeable future.

But if you're fine with paying 60€ for two singleplayer campaigns against pretty stupid AI (like in every RTS game), go for it. The game can still be a lot of fun, because the basic game design of a COH game is always very fun, but in my opinion this third iteration of the franchise is just a regression in comparison to the first two games.",1678986155,1678986155,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However this is no different from any game in reality. It's fun, its the same COH experience at its core and people who have played a few hours or less and leaving bad reviews are just part of this annoying trend to hate for clout. It's sad to see. 

The game will get better, as they all do. There are no changes or problems so severe that would signal major problems going forward (BF2042 I'm looking at you).

As someone with quite a bit of experience in the Company of Heroes franchise I am hugely disappointed in the release state of CoH 3. The lack of features is completely baffling. There is no in-game leaderboard, there are very few maps, the ranking system doesn't appear to be active yet, there are no replays, there is no spectator mode. The balance is poor and whilst it is being adjusted rapidly it is also being changed significantly each time and this kind of heavy-handed, drastic changing is very concerning. There are several issues in the gameplay which were issues in the original Company of Heroes and the design team should have been aware of and not made the same errors again. 

The gameplay does feel a lot more like the original Company of Heroes rather than CoH2, which is very much my preference and I think the gameplay is actually quite enjoyable. However, it is the same gameplay that I enjoyed in the first CoH and that was released almost 20 years ago. 

Company of Heroes 3 doesn't add anything. It takes things away. I would not recommend anyone spend money on this game.",1678919455,1678919455,False,4,0,0.530583202838897705,0,True,False,False

Tried to ship, but only farted...[/b]

This feels like a Close Combat mod of COH 2. [b]10 years[/b] to arrive at this... with a delay? I was pissed about the DoW III bellyflop... this is a bit ridiculous. I was a huge fan of COH 1 & 2 (even through the micro-transaction storm) and DoW 1 & 2.

I paid [b]$80[/b] for this (even $60 seems way too steep for current state, god-forbid when the store opens up)....

[h1]Camera view[/h1] - Get to feel like a B-17 ballgunner 10 feet off the ground. No options to change the claustrophobia.

[h1]UI[/h1] - Responds like a radio a tank drove over, clunky and buggy AF. Have to smack it repeatedly with a wrench to get it to respond in and out of combat (want to just select a unit aside from ctrl groups... click, nope, click, maybe, click, yep). Alt-Tab seems to get it stuck in windowed mode, good luck getting it out of it once it starts even with resetting and applying in interface or ALT-Enter, etc..

[h1]Campaign[/h1] - Triggers are clearly failing at times in maps blocking the entire UI (can't select anything only issue barrage commands or click on menu to exit). Have to start over, lost an hour. I am dreading discover of big game-stoppers like putting on crusty socks.

Also, come to a point to make a decision on the reward and choose increase population cap by 10, no change... no additions. Now on turn 35 with the same resources from near start and cannot add units to the campaign map due to pop cap to spearhead on other fronts. Kind of insulting.

[h1]Units[/h1] - AI is hit and miss. Can be be great, then make odd decisions in other times and some clear pathing issues on main maps. Hit detection or values seem to be off for some units, like they are throwing cans of beans at each other until one finally gets a concussion.

[h1]Base[/h1] - No basic controls on placement as you'd expect, like copying everyone's ideas accept the good ones. Becomes a sh*tty version of Tetris. Tight spaces, cannot rotate the buildings before you place them to maximize space. I guess it is more like the military that expected, what goes together cannot ship together. 

[h1]Steam Cloud[/h1] - Really, [b]no[/b] Steam cloud for your game saves in singleplayer? It is currently only doing configs and logs. I just installed it on my gaming laptop and found it does not backup the game save files to the cloud like COH 2 does. Wanted to test the difference between systems.

[h1]Game Saves[/h1] - Can Load your save from the main menu, so missing basics again. It loads the last Autosave when you Continue. If they patch it, you are screwed. It will crash loading that prior Save. So you will lose that time. [b]Never thought I'd dread patches...[/b]

[h1]Thoughts[/h1]
I am currently only reviewing slugging through the Italian Campaign and skirmish mode, I am dreading multiplay and co-op at this point. This is heart-wrenching for me as a fan of the series, but I cannot recommend it in its current state for its current price. Don't get me wrong, there is a diamond hidden among all the 'sh*t through a goose', but it ain't there yet. I will adjust my rating and feedback if it improves, but don't pay full price for this. You barely get through the slow AI campaign turns in a few hours, there is no way to hit the return threshold time and see all the issues. [b]This is an Early Access level release out the gate.[/b]

I think this may be the nail in the coffin for me on purchasing any more of Relic's games. Lack of transparency, apology or updates on roadmap other than marketing plans and Twitch streams for more revenue is salt on the wound. There is a long road ahead if they can pull it out of its current ditch, doubtful given the current trajectory. It is interesting to see the reviews get padded, wondering if they are buying them. Go read the forums on all platforms and their own. Go read the reviews. It's all there.

[b]Pro:[/b]
Optics
- The graphics are totally okay, the tanks, the units, the landscape, effects all look pretty good. A lot of effort has been put into this. I would not find fault with this in any way. 

Gameplay
- The factions have been given a new spin, new mechanics and lots of variety. I liked this a lot and plays totally different than how the predecessor did in a positive way. 

Singleplayer
- I was pleasantly surprised to see two campaigns from two different perspectives. The Allied invasion of Italy as a turn-based strategy game with multiple single scenarios, like you know from the Allied campaign from Company of Heroes 2, only even better. As well as an ongoing level campaign from the perspective of the Germans in North Africa, which was just as great to play.  

[b]Con:[/b]
Multiplayer
- The multiplayer is in contrast very very weak. 
- Poor balancing between the Wehrmacht and the Allies. How can it be that the Allies were made beginner friendly on purpose and the Wehrmacht on the other hand are hard to play. Wouldn't it have made sense in each alliance to make one faction easy and one hard???? The Allies are totally overloaded, while the Wehrmacht feels totally defenseless.

Singleplayer

You are welcome to check how many hours I sunk into the previous title, Company of Heroes 2. World War 2 RTS's are always focused on the grand battle, but this series has cemented itself as my favorite due to it's squad-based tactics and unique personalities of every individual unit. I can't put my excitement into words when I learned this title would be taking place in the Italian theater. Much of modern World War 2 history about this segment of the war is forgotten to time and brushed over by the Allied reclamation of France and the Soviet's push to liberate Eastern Europe.

Italians, Polish, New Zealanders, Australians, Slovakian, Yugoslavian, Japanese, Nepalese, Indian, French, British, and Americans participated in the most culturally diverse yet horrific battlefields every crafted by the human hand. It is refreshing to  see a company represent these cultures [i](I know more nationalities are to come)[/i], and attempt to bring to light these stories in a fun RTS style. However, we see another AAA title crushed by the hammer of 'Pump out an unfinished product and fix it as we go along'. I want to recommend this game to others. I want to play this game with groups who I've grown with in Company of Heroes 2. I want this game to succeed. This is why I left a positive recommendation, but I will go over things I believe need changed, added, or removed for longevity.

Before I write down my critiques I want to state that I do play all modes of the game [i](1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4)[/i]. This review is primarily focusing on the multiplayer portion of the game. Most of the community surrounding this game indulges the multiplayer first and foremost, therefore I believe it should be of upmost importance. Balancing between team modes and 1v1's are radically different, and either side of the community has their own grievances.

[h1]THIS IS ALL PERSONAL OPINION[/h1]

[b]Changes/Bugs:[/b]
- Surrender Button, where is it? This is a crucial part of the game. It saves random teammates from dropping and helps keep players in the flow of gameplay.

- Voice Chat, I cannot believe this hasn't been implemented yet. Much of the community won't agree with this, but this would help solo players communicate with their team far easier than spending micromanagement time typing up responses in the chat system.

- Blobbing has returned as a viable strategy in team games for both Axis and Allies. By the time you can get counters [i](Good luck if you're playing the Americans lmao)[/i] you would have to tech up and unlock enough command points to get your off-map strikes. Machine Gun nerfs are fair, but free smoke grenades/bombs/mortars for the many units hard counter this. I don't have a solution for blobbing, but I have faith that the developers can find a work around.

- Unique Colors are a mess. Let me my allies be a blue color pallet and the enemy team be a red color pallet. Simple fix.

- Games feel too quick. Instead of 3 seconds for the VP tick move it to 2.5 rather than the 2 seconds the current build has. I didn't enjoy the long games in Company of Heroes 2 to where my hand goes numb, but a 15 minute skirmish is [i]cringe bruh[/i]



[b]To Add:[/b]
- Progression system. The matches themselves are entertaining, but I would like to work up to something or be rewarded for my time.

- Leaderboard. I know there are ones for 1v1, but it would be something to look while I'm waiting for my next match to occur. I really don't understand how this wasn't applied at launch.

- Correct voicelines for the nationalities. Gurkha Rifles are Nepali. I don't understand how this slipped through to give them Indian voicelines. More voicelines would be beneficial for the units. I feel maybe 1 or 2 more would satisfy the community and myself included. I feel I am hearing the same 2 lines over and over, but I cannot dismiss how funny the Wehrmacht Pioneers are.

- Defensive Buffs against infantry for 17-Pounder and Flak 36. Hull down features were present in Company of Heroes 2, I don't understand why they can't be implemented in this game. If you're pushed back from a defensive posture, good luck getting a truck up to move your gun. It's frustrating.

- Bulletins for units. Company of Heroes 2 allowed you to customize your army roster further by attaching bulletins which improved the performance of whatever unit they applied too. This was fantastic. It allowed you to have a truly unique build or improve a doctrine you were pre-planning to play as. It also fed into a progression system and gave players bulletin rewards for playing matches.

- Stronger presence of the tactical alert prompts. I appreciate how they added an attack, defend, and move here prompt, but they barely show on teammate's PoV. Why? I would rather an annoying teammate spam it than not being able to see it when a teammate is genuinely trying to alert me of a flanking force.



[b]To Remove:[/b]
- No cost for smoke. Adding a 10-15 munitions cost to use smoke would allow for a more tactical approach for players. Balance is confusing when looking at munition costs between all factions. Adding a muni-cost to an essential part of a skirmish would help mitigate the spam of off-map barrages.

-Reused unit icon assets. This is so LAZY!!! I cannot believe I'm looking at the same icons I saw in the American/OKW release in [b]2014[/b]. I know the developers are better than this, and this pains me to no end. 




[h1] There are more issues with the game, but these are some personal grievances I have at this current time. [/h1]

I will not be changing, refining, or removing this review as time goes on and more mechanics are added, removed, or tweaked. This review is meant to be a reminder as to how AAA studios are getting away with [strike]murder[/strike] pushing out poorly optimized titles and 'Fixing it overtime'. I love Company of Heroes 3, and in my time playing I have had a blast on my own, with randoms, and with friends.

Is the game perfect? No. Is the game in ""Full release state"" Also no. Is so many negative reviews deserved? Definitely no.

The game have some annoying bugs, there are some missings assets, and some overall rough edges, but when I am reading all those negative reviews, i am starting to think if those players played the same game as i did. 

Gameplay
 In this time, there is only few RTS games, with such depth and competitive potential. No matter if you are wanna be pro player, want to play competitive and climb the community ladder, or just casual player, enjoying two campaigns or just casual matches with friends. You will have a lot of fun in both cases. Gameplay is sometimes criticized by CoH2 veterans, for being ""slower"" and more spongey. But honestly? As someone who loved CoH1 and didn´t really enjoyed CoH2 for being too fast and TOO MUCH competitive, i feel CoH3 to be in perfect spot between arcadish CoH1 and not forgiving CoH2. There is still a lot of space for improving, and overcoming your opponent thanks to your skill, but if you make mistake, forget babysit your units for 5 seconds, they still have chance of surviving, and your game isn´t lost because one lost vehicle. Compared to similar games in the genre, Iron Harvest for example, Company of Heroes 3 is in my eyes best game gameplaywise.

Graphics, Audio and visuals 
 The game looks really good, if someone is telling you, that CoH2 or even CoH1 looked better, they didn´t played the game for looong time. Game si colourfull, fire, explosions and other effects looks great, and whole stylization looks decent. Yeah, CoH3 isn´t the most visually stunning game there is, But this is RTS strategy, There is no need for stunning grapthics with RTX. For it´s genre there is not much games that would look much better. Weapons and vehicles sounds better and more realistic, and even tho there definitlly are war games that sounds better, if you aren´t total WWII nerd, you will have no problem with it. Only complain i have with Audio in CoH3 are voicelines and music. they aren´t bad, but I must agree here with some dissapointed players, that CoH1 had both music and voicelines better. 

State of Game 
 A lot of people are complaing about the state of the game. Here, i must agree that whole game feels unpolished. some assets are missing (pictures of units) sometime unit model starts asserting dominance with T-pose (this still happens in CoH1 and CoH2 tho) and sometimes vehicle pathfinding is so broken, that your tank do a full circle before starts going in straight line. Yeah. that is annoying, and you will lost more then few tanks because of it. But devs are working on fixing it, balancing the units, communicating with community, and i believe, all will get better really soon. When CoH2 was released, the backslash was even bigger then now. And look at this now. at least 2/3 of not recommending reviews, are saying how much CoH2 is better, and how it always was such a gem. No. It. Was. Not. CoH3 will be polished, bugs will be fixed, and CoH3 will surpass its precedecors even more then already did. So is the game in ""Full release state""? No. In my opinion, they really should release only ""Early access"", or take at least 4-5 months more to finish the game, But it is still really good game, and there were now awesome games released in much worse states before... (looking at you CP) 

Final thoughts 
If you made it this far, and are you still wandering, if to buy, not buy, or wait some time before buying. In my opinion you should buy right away. Yeah the game needs some polishing, but it is still one of the best games in it´s genre, and if you want future for good RTS games, it is needed to support the devs, even thought they might done something better. Game is great, Multiplayer is fun, Singleplayer will take few hours to finish, and looking back at CoH2, in matter of weeks or few months the game will be perfect. By buying it now, you will support the devs, and game will be polished sooner. If you are scared by all those negative reviews, just read them once again. 2/3 of them are just rants from CoH2 players, who don´t remember the state of CoH2 when released. 1/3 complains are maybe partially valid, but as i said before, Nothing is so bad that it should earn such hate.

It feels so unfinished

It has good features like towable weapons but a lack of artillery similar to coh2
One similar artillery is the italian artillery for afrikakorps and it fires 3 shots misses and even if miraculously it hits, it does no damage whatsoever
A pistol aimed to the sky is better indirect fire

Pathfinding is so bad its unbearable

Everything is very expensive so it feels very slow paced until the game is at its halfway point.

Infantry units seem unbalanced and fights slow paced

German infantry both afrikakorps and wehrmacht lack anti tank weapons like in coh2

Pings are worthless they last .5seconds and are totally invisible in the map

Lack of any sort of progression system feels very unrewarding

Post game stats are terrible compared to coh2

Game zoom feels way too unpleasantly close like talking to someone with your foreheads pressed together.

Ui is terrible, team distinct colors are confusing.

Game animations are very buggy and audio fucks up 50% of the time.

I loved coh2 but this feels like it killed that game and crawled inside its corpse and is now pretending to be the same

Many of the pathing issues that have been in the game since COH are still here in COH3. But for me, it just comes back to the uninteresting, small combat. WWII should feel big. The battles should have impact, but they don't. Instead, you slowly move a line through repetitive skirmishes with flavor objectives. However, unless the enemy base is literally off map, you can ignore the objectives and bum rush the AI--you could win even faster if your units could figure out how to travel around the map. It's just not fun. Sure it looks kind of like a COH game...but it just doesn't have the same feel. 

Also, there is nothing more narratively weird than listening to a story about the human toll of war on the local civilian population in cut scenes and then getting thrust into missions as Rommel who is near giddy with excitement throughout the entire battle. Just a very strange way to frame and present that.

Gameplay,
There are a ton of issues, from cosmetic problems like the wrong assets being used for vehicle icons, to the fact that message boxes cover critical gameplay information. During the campaign Conti's messages cover your fuel income for instance. There are also more substantial issues. On some maps when calling in the 4.2 mortar as the Royal Indian Artillery the mortar will get stuck behind one of the base building and not be able to advance. The pathfinding is also much worse than in previous CoH titles, and I frequently have vehicles when given a move order illogically spining to present their rear to the enemy, even when using the reverse command.

Base building.
the buildings are large, the base zone small, and the inability to rotate the buildings prior to locking them in a position after getting the yellow border means that precious time is wasted placing building in a game where the layout of your base isn't really that important.

Factions.
I know there are 4 and that's a lot for release, but the lack of representation in Commonwealth forces is frankly offensive. It is great to see the Indian forces, but the relegation for instance of Canadians to needing help, and then for one mission granting you one unique infantry section, given their critical role in the real historical campaign, constituting roughly 1/4-1.3 of commonwealth losses, is deeply offensive. I don't think the Australians, Canadians etc should be factions, but at least deployable companies. Also the Indian regiment really needs more unique units. Would it really have been so hard to make the rifle sections, engineers, etc a little unique.

Voice acting
Why for the love of Pete do we not get British introductions when playing as British companies, and leave the American Corpral Conti for the American units. Is there no one kicking around the office with a UK/Commonealth accent who could have chipped in. Also I get it, the foot guards love to say ""CHAPS."" It kinda gets tedious after a while. Please add a few more phrases to the units. 

I love the CoH games, and I was really excited for this one. There is a lot to love in this title, and all of them. I will likely put a lot of hours into this one as I have with previous titles, but still I feel really let down at the moment.

4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple, filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I'm not totally sold on the art direction, but that's been a criticism I've had since COH2; the first game had a pitch perfect aesthetic that neither of its sequels have quite managed to match by doing their own thing. It is also missing a replay feature in multiplayer. That might be a dealbreaker for some, and it is worth mentioning even if it does not affect my feelings about the game. The post-match stats screen can also be a little bit wonky, but I expect that behavior will be ironed out.

It is not finished. There's still a good amount of bugs. There are some stupid UI decisions. There some stupid gameplay decisions. The campaigns are mediocre to bad. The multiplayer needs balance (although to be honest what pvp game doesn't have balance issues especially so soon after launch). There's not even a replay system. You have to use this weird workaround in combination with steamworkshop mod. However, despite all of this I am still having fun and enjoying the game.

The positives:
- I've not had a single crash in my 110+ hrs of playing. This is kind of surprising since this does seem like a finished game.
- The multiplayer is pretty fun. There's balance issues but well I have 110+ hours and most of that is multiplayer, so it's still enjoyable.
- The game seems to have good mod support. We aren't even a month into the game and people already made mods fixing stuff and made new maps for multiplayer to mess around in.
- The core game itself is fun and fine. It isn't like the Dawn of War III situation where they had their head up their ass thinking players would love to eat the shit they shat out like them.

The negatives:
This is not a finished game. I'm not going to list all of them out as there's too many right now and you can find other negative reviews listing all of them out. This feels like someone submitted the rough draft of their essay without even bothering to check for spelling mistakes. I don't know why they just didn't delay it further. I blame the dumb corporate rushing the dev team who undoubtedly knew the game isn't ready but had no choice to push it out. This is like the cyberpunk2077 release situation except it isn't as bad, but we aren't gonna get something like ""Edgerunners"" that will revive this game's public opinion once they (hopefully) iron out the kinks. I don't know what idiot thinks rushing out an unfinished product would make much money. People are going to see your unfinished product, then lost interest and not buy it. The only reason I bought the game despite seeing all the negative reviews is purely because I was bored and there really wasn't any other games on my radar besides this one right now. I can definitely see that this could have been released as a good game, a finished game. I don't think they were that far away from finish it judging by what we have right now. I just don't understand why they just didn't finish the game first.

I cant give this game a thumbs up. I play almost exclusively with a 4 player friend group, if all of us arent on then maybe 2v2 or 3v3 and thats the issue. 10 years and we got 2 4v4 maps. This is a $60 game and the dev's know we play with friends. Why on earth would there only be all of like 8 maps in total? We have to rely purely on player base mods to deliver a ""AAA"" video game at a $60 price point. Thats unacceptable to me. 
But not only that you have graphics that make are clunky. You have to wonder what was going through their heads when they released this other than seeing $$$$$ in their eyes.

I would also give the depiction of weaknesses on the vehicles as a plus. probably the thing I don't like the most is the graphic representation of the game. grenades look the same, tanks are very ugly and incorrectly depicted, explosions and fires are terribly little part of the game. too often it is assumed that a soldier rotates in place after death. your units will have a terrible problem in the narrow streets. simply the routing of your units is set incorrectly .my overall impression of the game is as if it was only the initial version of this game. I don't think it can be considered the final version. if you are a Coh fan, you will definitely have mixed feelings about this piece. for me it is a completely different game than we are used to.

Not fun as it stands currently.

Horrible ai pathfinding

Bad player specific colors

Unbalanced and op units

Lacks many features like a progression system of any kind

The game feels really slow and after a bit it seems like the pace skyrockets for no reason at all

Only 3 doctrines per faction

Horribly zoomed in where you feel like you are looking at a painting with your face stuck to it

Bad ui that does not explain anything that is happening

Sometimes you cannot capture points because there is a red no symbol on it that looks like a 5 year old drew on it and nobody seems to be able to explain why it's there or how to actually capture that point

Ai loves spamming aircraft nonstop but when i have them i seem to never be able to afford to use it

As it stands i would not recommend this game.
I wanted company of heroes 3 and not what feels like company of heroes 1.8

Currently this game is worse than coh2 in most aspects

Please can we stop releasing games that are nowhere near finished?

2/10 currently but with actual proper fixes and balance adjustments it could be 8/10.

-I've encountered very few bugs while playing the game
-Graphically COH3 is good, a bit better than COH2. I'm not looking for a 4K ray tracing experience in COH regardless so it doesn't matter to me.
-The sound design is good, not sure why people think its bad. There is an option to increase the audio fidelity in the settings as well.
-The UI reminds me of COH2, I don't really have many issues with it but it would be nice to be able to zoom out further with the camera
-As for the singleplayer content, Italian campaign is neat but at normal difficulties you pretty much just walk over the German army, I think it could use a few balance changes is all but the idea of the campaign map itself is very refreshing! African Campaign is more your traditional COH linear campaign but I think I will always prefer the COH2 soviet campaign.
-There is a decent amount of maps in the base game for skirmishes and multiplayer so there is some variety.
-Music reminds me of some of the Dunkirk Movie tracks. They are tense and add a lot to the atmosphere of battle.

Overall I think COH3 is more positive than negative, I enjoy the game and I believe given more time it will only get better. Only time will tell!

And unfortunately the overall experience is heavily dragged down by the obvious lack of attention that was paid to the products state at release (even 3 weeks after release). This game has bugs, crashed, glitches - units running in circles with one of the worst pathfindings i have ever seen. Units getting stuck behind buildings or walls, unable to jump over walls or even...not equiping the rifle you actually produced them for. 
I really hope they're going to address these issues, since the mechanic behind it all CAN provide some of the most intense RTS matches you have ever seen. Judging by the released state Relic should've postponed it even further.
I am really hoping this is not the end of the series, i am still a fan of it - but in the current state lessons need to be learned. RTS does not need another Cyberpunk release desaster.

Every automatch results in at least 1 person quitting as soon as the enemy wins a skirmish, meaning that you almost never make it to the late game units and abilities. There's still no punishment for AFK or quitting even though the problem has existed in the previous games in the franchise. The AI that replaces them is somehow worse than CoH2 

Also the AI is super easy, even on expert, so the Italian campaign is really boring. Interested to see what Relic have been doing with this game ever since they killed the DoW franchise. They've had years to make this game.

The graphics of the game have been lowered to a cartoonish style from the realism of CoH2. This has clearly been done for the mobile and console audience and it's horrible.

Overall I should've followed my own advice and not preorder (especially the LTD version which really didn't offer me much at all). I should've waited 6 months for some of these release features to actually be added to the game. No doubt the microtransactions need to be added first.

On the positive, combat feels improved. Height advantage adds an interesting dynamic although makes a comeback much harder to achieve. The variety in the generals is nice although far from balanced (some picks just aren't viable)",1678389651,1678798571,False,4,0,0,0,True,False,False

- On the Positive side of things, the combat is really great, classic CoH combat and makes for great game play.
- Set piece missions were interesting some with challenges

Negative:
- That campaign map - yuk - I can see what they were trying to do, but the map just became a pointless fill of skirmish battles - collecting fuel and ammo served no point - I think I built one plane the whole campaign and never used them again - you didnt need to. In the end it took away from what the game does best - good missions, good combat
- There are still a tonne of bugs - in one mission I had 3 tanks and one MG squad get stuck and not be able to move

- the levelling of the generals is boring, and the generals all talking to each other was annoying

Overall, if you liked the previous 2 CoH heroes games as I did, you will get something out of it, as the combat is still great. 
Story is poor, the map is poor and some new mechanics are not well implemented.

If new to CoH, I would recommend playing 1 or 2 first - which have much more linear experiences, better story and just as good combat.",1678793147,1678793147,True,1,0,0.503154575824737549,0,True,False,False

you know what it means in an intense battle

overall its an incomplete game, all the leader board BS with top players from coh3 are such troll, wtf

the mini map, is also very awkward to use too.

no comment on game mechanics/ strategy design, since i am not an old coh1 era player(top 300 1v1 coh2 player)

when i played a troll 3v3 (no way i can play it seriously) and saw all units have icons about 2/3 of size of entire tactical map, and they are all overlapping with each other on tac map, for some reasons, i cant even laugh anymore

i am now more certain, there might be different teams of development behind this project (out sourced even), and they just patched up as much as possible at final days of release.

-the german campaign is nice. its a typical campaign. play it however you want.
-the italy campaign is new and, as many have stated, is a new-ish style patterned after Total War. it does need some help to be replayable and fun long term though. there are way too many battles per turn and on harder difficulties this becomes so tedious. i cant imagine how long it takes to beat the game on expert/fearless.

-balance wise- yup typical relic with stat/campaign balance only. that being said, it feels better than the garbage that coh2 launch and balance was (LIKE ALOT BETTER. i know coh2 got better but its launch/balance/optimization was really bad at first and i cannot make any arguments for coh2 over coh3)

-there have been a few bugs I have seen or encountered but none of them should be the absolute rage inducing problems alot of people claim they are. frankly, the most bugged thing is ai. there were many times i had to deduce where a unit was hiding in the campaign because the mission ""paused"" at ""hold this point"" but yet i didnt see any enemies.

-i personally love they focused more on light/med/support vehicles vs the heavy meta everyone seems to love. there's nothing fun about skipping your entire tech to go for a heavy tank. which, fairly, is why balance is so important because you have to make the tech tree flow and be meaningful throughout the battle and be available at the proper times for each faction",1678772831,1678773126,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Several animation are strange (american Paras working the bolts of M1 Carbines?) and some of them seem somewhat subpar compared to CoH2. I also really hate the fact that some weapon are complety wrong (British builders with Grease Gun or Sappers with Sten... yes the Commonwealth forces in Italy only used the Thompson submachine gun because of existing stocks from North Africa and logistical compatibility with the US) but I guess they didn't have an historian at hand and even games like Steel Division 2, which put a lot of emphasis on the realism of their divisions got that wrong so I can understand the mistake. 

But appart from that, the game is great. The pace seems nice, the factions and units for a CoH at launch are numerous and varied. For my computer (a 2 years old gaming laptop) I didn't experience any bugs and the games run well and fast (even better than CoH2 for similar graphism). So yeah overall I think that the game still needs improvement (and that they will put the right weapons in the hands of the Commonwealth units), but it is really promising and quite decent for a day 1. Buy the game and play it and judging by what they did to CoH 2, we could have a true masterpiece of game in a year or two!

I only hope that they will produce either a specialised company or a skin for the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, this would make me real happy! ;)

I like the Tactical Pause because it lets me play a slower more strategic game. The upgrades, skill tree, and veterancy are useful and balanced. I just don't see the issues these other guys are talking about. I never heard the ""tin can"" audio, because I turned my settings up before I started playing.

The game mechanics are deep and complex, allowing for a lot of strategic depth and variety in gameplay. The graphics and sound are also top-notch, immersing you in the battlefield and making you feel like you're really in the midst of a war.

One thing that really stands out about this game is the attention to detail when it comes to the military units and structures. Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to use them strategically to gain the upper hand. The same goes for the different types of buildings and structures you can build, which all have their own unique uses and benefits.

Another thing that sets this game apart from others in the genre is the focus on resource management. You have to carefully balance your resource production and expenditure to make sure you can keep your army and economy running smoothly. This adds an extra layer of depth and challenge to the game, and makes it all the more satisfying when you come out on top.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the RTS genre. It's a big and influential title for good reason, and the third installment in the series does not disappoint. With deep mechanics, great graphics and sound, and a strong focus on resource management, it's a must-play for any strategy game enthusiast.",1678758140,1678758140,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's get some of the uncomfortable stuff out of the way first, with caveats:

Yes, the graphics and overall visual presentation have not evolved by leaps and bounds over the previous titles. I haven't done frame-by-frame animations analysis like some people have, but I am an avid screenshot photographer and as I look back over the screenshots I've taken, I find that I am a little underwhelmed by the set dressing of some of the maps, and some of the overall texture presentation and quality.

To me, the tanks and vehicles look great from a gameplay distance and that's what matters to me. The units are identifiable and most importantly have great abilities and game feel when using them. But a lot of the maps look more like a tabletop wargame's recreation of a place than an actual place, if that makes any sense.

At a distance, the towns and terrain look fine, but on many maps there is a bit of a sense of disconnectedness between the terrain and the buildings and terrain blockers and things that have been placed on it. Some maps are much better than others in this regard. But the best way that I can put it is that some of the maps look like a 3D terrain wargame board where people have placed model houses and other gameplay affecting pieces just so, rather than the maps giving a sense of actual place. I'm not sure if this is quite making sense, but I hope that I'm getting the point across...

I won't go much into sound quality or any of that, but it all seems serviceable to me, and I have no real complaints. I'm not a big audio guy and most of the rest of it is good enough that it doesn't detract from my gameplay experience.

It's the actual moment by moment gameplay that really shines to me. Unit abilities are less binary than they were in COH2, flame units feel powerful, unit abilities are varied and give you a sense of actually developing a strategy. It's all in a good state and likely to only get better with time.

The Battlegroups system is very well done. I love having the choice between multiple tech paths, each with different things to unlock. The faction customization systems in general are quite good, like USF tech veterancy ability choices.

It is **perhaps** not the best POSSIBLE game it could have been, but I think overall it is a very solid foundation on which to build and has launched in a much better state than COH2 did.

An absolute s##tshow of a game. For something they spent years ""developing"", it mind as well be in alpha.

Pros:
Has quality of life improvements over coh1 and coh2
Has some of the units coh1 has
Will probably have more modding tools than coh2

Cons:
The gameplay, as a whole.
Graphics (poor, somehow my 18 year old friend can draw better than their digital graphics team)
The sounds are god awful - For a game that is usually praised for its sound team, its so horrid in this game. Everything sounds like a peashooter, on top of the fact it sounds like it was recorded on an iphone. The sound team should be fired IMMEDIATELY.
Unbalanced - Somehow their ""balance"" updates make the game MORE UNBALANCED. You think they would've learned from the last TWO games, but somehow they're back at it again.

Jokes aside, this game is a complete failure on Relic's part. The audio is such poor quality it disappoints me. Their balancing for factions and units is god awful, and makes the game always feel one-sided (because it is). The game overall just doesn't feel satisfying or fun to play, in any capacity. They designed it like a crappy modern RTS game, sadly.

The game does have potential, maybe in about 1-3 years and cut the price by twenty bucks. As it currently stands, its in an unofficial beta. This game sucks. Company of Heroes 2 is infinitely better, so I would just go play that.

Edit: Proving my point about how they cannot effectively update or balance the game, their new Axis nerf essentially makes the game one-sided. 

Relic had the chance to learn from their mistakes in Age of Empires IV, but they clearly didn't. They don't care about their community, nor their buyers. I've lost faith in this company.",1678493534,1678733056,False,19,0,0.565460085868835449,0,True,False,False

Some don't seem to like the brighter graphics - presumably because they have confused WWII with Lord of the Rings and think the Wehrmacht blocked out the sun so that their orcish Panzergrenadiers could move during daylight? I dunno - where I'm from, what lots of people are calling ""oversaturated graphics"" I just call ""going outside""? :P

Seriously though - I'm pretty confident North Africa and Italy are not permanently overcast and raining ash - at least not since Pompeii. 

In short, while most of the criticisms seem to be based in a grain of truth (yes, the graphics are brighter), the conclusions drawn from these objections are fairly overblown at best and flat out incorrect at worst.

In the latter category, for instance, we have the bizarre suggestion that the game is not finished or in a worse state than earlier entries, despite the fact that it has shipped with double the playable factions of any earlier entry at release and the most ambitious single-player campaign of the series (even if the campaign is flawed - the one major criticism of games journalists who have otherwise praised the game).

At the time of writing, most critic reviews are very positive, and 2/3 people on steam recommend playing the game. This is also considering that of the remaining 1/3, a decent portion seem to have review bombed with barely enough time to play a single match. While this small but vocal group seems intent on sinking the ship, I'd seriously recommend giving this a go if you are on the fence. 

Highlights for me:
- smooth and satisfying to play - well optimised
- all the core game play features of the earlier entries, but expanded with cool new additions like rideable tanks and towable field guns
- greater relevance of infantry and light vehicles due to their abundance and role variety
- factions are less ""one trick ponies"", with the capacity to be played in a variety of fun and thematic ways 
- exciting possibilities for new battle groups

Examples of really fun thematic choices:
- North African German force consisting primarily of armoured infantry that get synergy bonuses when fighting next to vehicles,  even basic infantry can also repair (though less effectively than engineers), and can build halftracks right out of the gate. Focus on Panzer III as main battle tank makes for a very different German experience to what has come before.
- US forces with a universal upgrade to give all rifleman squads a BAR rifle and the ability to then individually upgrade each unit to a second BAR. Add in a veterancy upgrade that allows them to suppress and you get some great theme around the relative carefree expenditure of ammo that US forces were known for. Ability to focus on infantry, air force or armour through HQ choice in addition to commander/doctrine ""battle group"" choice allow for some great combined arms builds

Last but I believe the worst reason is that AI is terrible compared to CoH2. AI feels incomplete or different  when compered to CoH2. I cannot really put into words how it behaves but if you do have CoH2 go ahead and give it a go, you will see what I mean. Other than these issues, nice to see that there are some improvements in terms of physics.

I've been looking forward to COH3, especially the campaign mode - since Opposing Fronts was my favourite mode and I'm not much of a multiplayer. So this review is solely for the campaign which feels even less than a missed opportunity. I really wanted to enjoy playing this campaign, but the game is seriously lacking the depth it has evidently been set up and designed for. I really don't know what to think here, maybe Relic thinks we're 4 year olds and that they can get away with this. Or maybe this is all a huge, expensive Beta teaser and Relic will try to sell us the fixes later. 

Like Opposing Fronts, the campaign revolves around companies with distinctive OOBs and characteristics attacking objectives on a huge map of southern and central Italy. Encounters with defending forces prompt a skirmish battle which is more often than not underwhelming. I played on hard and the AI doesn't make any effort to use their substantial forces on the map to counterattack or occupy otherwise undefended objectives.  At the tactical level, the AI doesn't make a concentrated effort to attack and hold control points. This results in easy gains early on, and by middle game your companies are so powerful where your resource and equipment advantage makes them practically invincible, able to withstand several battles in a row without taking much damage. I don;t consider myself a seasoned player, and It still feels like a picnic where the enemy is always waiting for me to attack at full strength and gets pummelled every time. The maps are nice but that hardly matters when the AI is so dump where it all feels like a holiday in Italy.

What's even more disheartening, the various defence strongpoints on the campaign map seem to have virtually no effect. AA batteries attack your aircraft, and MG bunkers / artillery /AT /depot emplacements do some damage when your company appears in their field of view - but not enough to stop you moving past them and occupying a town literally without a fight and without having taken any substantial damage. You can occupy a city like Napoli without a fight, even if it's surrounded by 6 emplacements and two companies next to it they don;t seem to mind you, and you can leave them all behind and move on in the certainty they will do nothing to prevent yoy.   Enemy ships and planes don't really attempt to bomb you either. You can build similar emplacements too but given the state of the game they are completely unnecessary to win - let alone that any ships and artillery emplacements you bring to the west coast can support your company fighting in Foggia 140 km inland. It's a total joke.         
.
There's supposed to be some tactical limitations imposed by the availability of supply and support, but I never had any supply issues on the map or in battle. My companies always seem to fight full strength without handicaps, with a nearly unlimited choice of barrages and other perks, while the enemy never uses their own perks to gain an advantage. In each battle, I can quickly surround their base within the first few minutes and hold them there for the rest of the brief matches. 
.         
The resistance layer, which might have been a really interesting one, is literally non-existent and makes no difference. You can capture undefended towns in their vicinity or damage / loot enemy companies, but given the abundance of supply and stupidity of the AI, it never really becomes a strategic advantage, but rather a half baked distraction. The resistance is supposed to help you in battle too ie by giving you FOW vision, extra supplies or sabotage actions, but again the tactical layer is so easy and so many options are already abundantly available to you where it doesn't make any difference. You can surround the docile enemy within 5 minutes just with riflemen squads before any of that available support can become vital in any way.     
.
The cities can be battle damaged and repaired but there's no indication as to if this has any effect at all. Enemy ships, planes and emplacements could keep on attacking you on the map, but they never do other than the first time you encounter these. There are some (probably scripted) counterattacks in force but it's all laughable joke after a certain point even your weakest company can withstand a couple of Panzer divisions without too much of an issue, Maybe it's because of the ease with which you can one-hit-destroy Panzers with sachel charges as they're trying to shoot your infantrymen with their AP rounds, given their mgs seem to have no suppression or effect on your invincible troops.            

I have a lot more to say and could go on and on, but why should I make the full and extra effort to complete this critique more than Relic endeavoured to finalize this much anticipated title?

The single player stopped working entirely after two hours in the game. The enemy turn system broke with the AI taking infinite time to finish it's turn. I went back to the tutorial to to see if had more to teach how to play this game and there wasn't anything on the other game mechanics. I can't return the game so I tried the other game play modes to figure out how to play it there. I can play it there but in a loosing battle of trying to figure out how the game works. 
As soon as tank's and anti-infantry vehicles show up the game swings the momentum to a grinding loss. This is when players give up sense they can no longer rebuild a force to counter the steam rolling offensive taking all the resource points needed to build units. There's a retreat option but it's not fast enough to save units that could turn the tied of battle. One's a player's force is destroyed there's no rebuilding it in time to fight back. The units cost way too much and take too long to build. Players know they will loose so they leave the match leaving the hosted peer to peer connection on someone else's computer. 

I'm going to continue to play until I get something out of it just because this is what people are currently playing and I can't return it. I hope gamers can get a better sense of what is a good mechanically made game by experiencing how bad this game is. 

I've continue to play for sometime with no improvement. The units keep getting themselves wiped by hanging on map objects and themselves which causes them to bunch up or take too long to do a meaningful role before taking too much damage. One's an area of the map has defenses that can counter everything it becomes impossible to break through as the units take too long to perform. I'm seeing more players use anti-air guns that reach right over the players spawn. This has destroyed using airborne drops because there isn't a place to drop that will be safe from getting shot down from where the planes spawn to travel across the map. Going into the airborne tree is a trap for failure if they have anti-air set up close by. Anti-air units shouldn't be reaching beyond where it's setup. 

Single player is still not fixed and the multiplayer requires being the best to enjoy it. Sense, I'm not the best at playing these types of games I'm uninstalling this game. The devs have made a horrible experience for me and I tried to improve to make it better but instead was let down by more problems.

If you like multiplayer, I would recommend buying it. If you don't, I'd 100% wait for a steep sale. I haven't played much of the single player, especially the Italian campaign, and probably won't until they work on the AI.

The stuff I like:
- Graphics are good and play well on my aging 980Ti (except around dense buildings and with some of the VFX).
- It's mostly balanced, some tweaks here and there should get it where it needs to be.
- Multiplayer is fun and new while still being familiar to COH 2. I can't speak if it's close to COH 1 or not because I haven't played it.
- 20 something GB file size is appreciated.
- Music is good and the overall sound quality is good, from my non-audiophile ears.

The stuff I don't like:
(This list is going to be longer because it's just human nature to see the bad in things and some of these things are minor annoyances and not game breaking)
-The menu and some of the UI looks like a placeholder (feels like it didn't change much from alpha testing). It doesn't give you that premium feeling, like you just spent $60 for a AAA game (if that makes sense).
- The dynamic campaign also feels cheap and unfinished. I like where they were going but man, it didn't seem to change much from alpha testing. 
- I'll agree with IGN on the Northern Africa campaign when they said that the story is weird. They went for a story that was not told often of the African locals but then slammed you in the driver's seat of the Germans. I think it would have been better if they just focused on the German's perspective. 
- I've never liked the picture cutscenes either, I'd rather use they the in-game engine with animations to act out the scenes. They character models look a lot better than they did back in COH 2 so it wouldn't be too bad. 
- The menu art and those cutscenes do not look good at all. 
- Vehicle pathing can still be frustrating especially now that they are unable to go through other vehicles. Better for realism, I guess?
- AI is suicidal at times and sometimes gets stuck in loops which makes a player leaving even worse.

The N.Africa campaign was cringey as all hell.  Terribly written.  North Africa is the most significant military campaign in my country's history (New Zealand).  There were significant British, Indian, and South African troops present, not to mention those of the Axis forces.  It felt really weird then that they centred the story around the handful of Jewish people living there.

The Italy campaign suffers from the same terrible writing, but at least they capture the friction between the US and UK generals.  However, NZ played a significant role at Monte Cassino (indeed, it was an NZ general that made the call to bomb the monastery, but again, no mention.

Load times in the campaign are a joke. Upwards of a minute or two.  In 2023 on a M.2 that is insane and speaks to the inept coding.  The battles are fun, but become repetitive.  Quick AI skirmishes on the same map over and over.  The campaign is also insanely easy.

Finally, the straw that broke the camel's back was the campaign ending.  I was moving my pieces on the board, ready for the final assault on Rome.  I did a random mission thinking it was just another mission.  Nope.  Final mission.  Poor cutscene.  Game over.  Terrible.

While CoH has not gone the route they did with the first CoH (base building etc), it continues to build on the modern population cap, quick deployment unit creation. The DNA for CoH3 is not really any different from CoH2. Better graphics, commanders are now unique trees with different options per tree. The blueprint for the game's future is there.

Downside? The game is going to constantly have ebb and flows in terms of balancing due to measuring every little re-work and faction they introduce/tweek. Thats for any RTS style game, and even then, balance tends to be a over the course of the games life kind of gig. 

While we are now seeing more mods being added, the true joy of CoH3 are starting to be experienced. Pop cap removals, custom maps (lot of re-masters). Co-Op/PvP is still the lifeblood of this game and this continues that pathway. When the progression and skins start to come out, I am sure you will see much more positive reception towards this, as people will now have a purpose to play again.

I do recommend the game, and in time, this will age probably well. CoH2 aged extremely well. This game is just an improvement of CoH3, not some sort of re-invention.

Additions of things like side armour and the different terrain of Italy/Africa have allowed for much better tank balance than has previously existed in the series. Artillery, machineguns and anti-tank weaponry are all designed with their role in mind and though some things like the Panzerschreck are a little overtuned the balance team hasn't shown any sign that they won't fix it when more data comes in on winrates and build orders.

If you're familiar with the CoH series and loved the cat and mouse maneuvering around the enemy to get the upper hand then there's plenty for you here. If you enjoyed the more drawn out slugfests of heavy tanks slamming in to each other you might want to dig a little deeper before deciding to jump in.

If you're unfamiliar with CoH it's hard to sell you on the game without video and I recommend youtubing around channels like Tightrope Gaming to find some good grounding. There is little focus on ""active"" resource generation or base building - the primary focus is on unit movement/positioning and army composition. Resources are provided in a trickle by capturing flags, and bases are only 4 or 5 buildings so if those are your joys from RTS maybe give it a pass. Combat is determined by positioning including use of cover, garrisoning structures, firing from elevation, hiding units behind blind corners etc. and if that's what you're looking for - that's what you'll find here.

There's a very good dynamic campaign for the conquest of Italy, a small ""story"" for the DAK ending at El Alamein, and of course PvP and PvE multiplayer. The game is well put together, certainly the smoothest launch for a Company of Heroes game and with time it's only going to get better so if you're sitting on the fence and thinking ""maybe, maybe not"" - check back next year.

I am currently stuck in the italian Campaign and it freezes on loading.  Even gone back to an earlier save and once you get to the end of that turn it freezes regardless of whether you played out the same scenario or a different one.

I remember playing the earlier games and cursing the AI for how well it would flank and keep you hopping.  Sure, it wasn't perfect but it's sure better than the completely BRAIN DEAD AI that CoH3 has.

Once I got a Company with sufficient upgrades I mopped the floor with every scenario that was  presented.  Control the 3 points?  How about Not even lose a point, holding all flags and territories.

The Italian campaign was pretty enjoyable, with a decent cast, a fun story and some interesting features that made your strategic decisions just as important as your tactical choices.  The big problem there is those bugs I mentioned.  The biggest one being the fact that it takes 20-40 minutes to load into the campaign map.  Skirmishes and missions load up fine, but after their first big patch, it royally screwed up the campaign map.  If it worked, I'd recommend it as a fun title at least for the single player, but quite frankly, if you're going to spend more time staring at a loading screen than actually playing the game, save yourself 60 bucks and stare at your wallpaper for half an hour.

A basic example: Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK) is the new faction and based around light vehicles. DAK is used as one of the main selling points and introduce a new style of gameplay. When using both vehicles and infantry together, DAK infantry get a bonus. This bonus has been highlighted in trailers and in game. What does the bonus do? Is it an increase in damage, accuracy, or fire rate? Good question, no where in the game does it say. This basic ability the whole faction revolves around is never explained. The player is left building units based on their description and icons (both of which are incorrect at times), and then used in game to get bonuses that are never explained. When that doesn't work out and the player loses, there's no in game replays to try and figure out what went wrong. Not very approachable.

The gameplay itself feels dated. Unit movements aren't crisp. Vehicles are especially clunky, managing to spend whole minutes executing 3-point turns while navigating rubble on the ground. These 'quirks' are what make CoH's squad based gameplay unique and the refusal to modernize these systems could be a good thing, if there was any hope of modernizing the rest of the package.

I am sure I am preaching to the choir here but...
The original Company of Heroes is an S-Tier game especially with the expansions. Unfortunately it appears that this newest release is marginally worse than 2. It's not that the game is bad it is just basically exactly the same as 2 with less content in the game. It appears that the game was was released with the intention to finish the game at a later date. 

If you are interested in buying the game because they have added upon 1 or 2 don't buy it yet and wait to see if the reviews and or content improve in the future. I don't like two as much as 1 but I there is a personal bias there; you don't get anything from this game that you don't get from the other 2. Either 1 or 2 play better and look the same as 3. 

Similar to Rome Total War 2 I am waiting to see if the game improves dramatically after release.

1) Graphics - the unit models are generally better than CoH2, however given the colour palette and the relative lack of smoke I can understand where some of the complaints are coming from. Personally, I think it looks good, but your opinion may differ. The smoke and particle effects are worse, though, I hope that they update this. The animations (for example machine gun reloading) are often less detailed - I don't know why this is but frankly, unless you zoom right in on the MG, you would not notice.

2) Bugs - there are some bugs. I've not encountered many but there have been a few (most notably a campaign mission I couldn't finish because the skirmish wouldn't end after the timer). These will obviously be addressed with future updates.

3) Sound - weapons and explosions have more of a crack than a boom when compared with CoH2. I like the audio, but artillery can feel a little lacklustre. 

4) Gamplay - personally, I think this is much better than the CoH2 heavy tank fest. It's far more focused around infantry and light vehicles. The Italy campaign is an interesting addition but I have found the AI in the campaign to be laughably weak (even on very hard), which is a shame, I really hope this is updated. The missions are easy even when your forces have been depleted by the enormously irritating pillboxes and AT guns littered around Italy in the campaign layer. I am not certain what the cause of this is but I suspect it may be that the AI isn't actually trying to counter your objectives - e.g., with the surround the enemy base missions (which I do not like), the very hard AI just seem to float around capping random points. It's like they're coded to behave as they would in a normal skirmish. Consequently, the missions are more of a chore than anything else. The AI also seems weak in Skirmish mode, though it less noticable. For example, a friend and I easily beat 2 Expert AI this afternoon whereas on CoH2 we would probably not have been able to. I don't know why this is, perhaps it's because of the general lack of German medium and heavy tanks (we play Allies).

5) Content - I do not know what the people complaining about this have been smoking. CoH2 has much more content, yes, but it has also been out for a decade. At launch it had 2 factions (CoH3 has 4), and 1 campaign (CoH3 has 2). If you are expecting a game that has more content that CoH2, which came out in 2013 and has been updated ever since, you are mad. I would like to see some more commanders and factions, but I suspect they will arrive in due course (behind a paywall, naturally).

TLDR: It's a solid game and will only keep improving with time and updates. If you like CoH and have the cash, go for it. If you're on the fence, don't. Simple. Overall, I think it's an improvement on CoH2.",1678540023,1678549509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like many other COH fans I was excited for this game to be released. I still am and am happy I picked it up on launch day. But man, I cannot believe how ""unfinished"" the game feels for a game that costs $60. 

 The Desert Campaign feels wooden and like a random assortment of campaign tutorials. The cut scenes and inter-mission narrative -- regarding the effect the Libyan campaign had on the Jewish population --  has nothing to do with the campaign missions themselves, with many inter-mission scenes looking like they were kept in the storyboard art format due to necessity and not due to a style decision. The dialogue feels like a bot wrote it. 

The best praise I have for this game is the Italian campaign. It is innovative yet stays true to the COH style. I have really enjoyed playing it. There are many features and tactical decisions to be made in this campaign. Well done, Relic. This campaign is obviously the gem of the game.  

The multiplayer feels most ""unfinished"" of all. Common sense features of multiplayer -- like the inability to see teammates names associated with their units, and the lack of a wide variety of maps on which to play -- are illustrative of how rushed this release feels. Which is most surprising of all considering Relic delayed release of this game from November 2022 to February 2023. 

There are positive aspects. I enjoy the destructabiilty of the environment; cool ""shockwave"" effects of artillery; the not-overwhelming UI; and the simplicity of the achievements (which was certainly not the case with COH 2). These are just a few positive aspects that ultimately still makes this game fun to play despite its major and unexcusable drawbacks.

All that said, I am heartened that Relic appears to be diligently patching this game and whole-heartedly embracing fans criticism for what it is meant to be -- constructive. Eventually, I believe this game will rise to the level of COH 2, but I think it will take a while.

what they lacked in UI looks and maps they made up for with board game style operation map - i thought it was cool taking teritory and leveling up my squads - unlocking extra units .
I liked the Afrika operations too , ,there was plenty of good voice acting and scenarios. 
if you look carrefully you will ntice the building destruction is a bit of a step up, the picture quality is sharper but it feels a bit cartoon sometimes. COH2 had me feeling dirty and gritty , cold and misrable. just the way i like it",1678495760,1678495760,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I mean come on guys just think about any other product you buy being this bad, you'd go back to the store. Since appearently there's next to 0 consumer protection buying (digital copies of) games a bad review is all i can do here. Let me explain my issue:
I've put 40h in now on a €1000 major brand PC a little under 2 years old, no matter the specs any major release should run at least okay on that since the majority playing is not a streamer with a 4k pc. I can play all my AAA games on Ultra settings, not this one. The graphics look terrible, i'm not talking about the style of art i'm saying it looks like a 2000's game on my pc. Textures are vague (can't distinguise , screen is laggy (stutters when moving) low is the only option (setting is locked). Game crashed 16 (!) times in loading screens, gameplay, multiplayer setup, campaign, it crashes everywhere actually. Imagine your new tv crashing 16 times in just 2 days... That's not normal.
The longer you play the campaign the buggier the game gets, loading times for the campaign map increase with each turn, capturing towns stalls the game for a minute or 2 before catching up with animations, i haven't seen nonsense like this in years. Rest of the in game features that are lacking, control options etc. are described perfectly in the reviews below so no need to cover.
Don't get me wrong, the concept is a lot of fun and honestly i just really want to play, but i litterally can't anymore since my saves won't load without crashing (it's the second time this happens actually, i've reinstalled the entire game 3 times now and deleted old saves once before).
Releasing games in a state like this should be outlawed, just like other industries can't sell products that don't live up to standards.",1678495557,1678495557,False,6,0,0.528512001037597656,0,True,False,False

Also, the focus is too much on quick access to units, rather than varied, specialized units. The side menu is mostly dedicated to speeding up your access to units, rather than added abilities or other interesting aspects that might give variety to the game. (like it did in the old version). 

I played and finished the North Africa campaign and it was enjoyable, but no more than the various mods available in the old version. (That I already own). The side story which is laid over the top featuring a north-African Jewish woman seemed almost completely unconnected from the game play. While it scores big points for inclusion it left me feeling like it was forced. The Italian units are different, but not uniquely valuable in any particular way. As a consequence I find those units almost useless, taking up space that could be utilized by units which had more capabilities.

The problem and its a big one. The visuals, the art, the graphics. Something. Is absolutely awful. This is the worst looking game I can remember playing since the N64 Armorines game. PS1 cutscenes should not make this games cutscenes look amateur. 

These visuals would hardly have been accepted in 2010 much less 2023. We all out here buying $500+ gpu's and Relics producing games on a macbook.

Edit: 30hrs into this and I'm probably done. It's not good even once you get past the visuals. The game is dumbed down to fit the masses and fails to be a Company of Heroes game. Its an Infantry spam game with very little strategy involved passed the meta gameplay. The cover system no longer works, squads can march through mg fire, artillery no longer has the impact it used to, tanks don't function like tanks (range, speed, damage, armor: its all wrong) and overall its not a complete game.

A lot of time is spent trying to figure out what is going on rather than playing. Even a win feels unsatisfactory. For the number of delays/extensions to release date, one would expect much more from this game. 

1. Victory / Win Screen comes on too sudden there is no emotion associated with the end of a skirmish like in COH2
2. Vehicles seem to fire at whatever is close to them, despite clearly selecting a specific enemy
3. Stuka Zu Fuss is now a panzerwerfer? the fire area is weird
4. Easily get lost during game to know which unit is which, especially vehicles
5. Dropped weapons. You can't tell what the weapon is without clicking it and thus wasting time/getting distracted. The dotted circle is quite pointless when you can't tell whats in it... 
6. 3x Different Pings and none of them are clearly visible on the map itself, mini-map BARELY visible and worst of all nor are they adequately audible. Stick with one and make it right...
7. Feels slow, way slow
8. Infantry can actually win vs light vehicles....without anti-tank weapons...
9. Grenades are SLOW to throw and detonate, easily predictable
10. The side mini-map could be bigger to better show the units and the zoomed in minimap feels small as well.
11. Menu UI feels cheap
12. Sometimes it just skips Match Stats screen and takes you to the Lobby instead
13. Driving feels clumsy and unnatural and vehicles seem to get stuck on every little turn
14. A tiny green radio-button next to a command to show if it is active or not (e.g. hold fire) is very difficult to notice. Just cross that tab out with a red line when inactive and remove that line when active.
15. Abilities (e.g. Stuka strafes) are quite OP and timing is way too fast to notice/counter
16. Screen hits are messed up. Say i want to crew an abandoned vehicle but I don't have enough units in the squad. The hint given on screen is (paraphrasing) Required: Damaged. This was on a fully repaired but de-crewed vehicle.
17. Unit kills, you can only know how many kills/what kills by hovering over the XP bar....why not just show a number in a top corner on unit picture? 

+ ParaBlob to Win 🤦‍♂️

Which the devs have been very active with the community and player feedback making multiple balance updates post launch and continues to be very active with the community. I'd say in its current form the multiplayer is great fun, just understand there will be growing pains via balance updates as the devs find the sweet spot for the factions.

The unspoken things about this game: It is a vague prequel to COH1. you play as Sgt. Conti, the narrator from COH1 (known as Corporal Conti in COH3), all though he isn't shown at all here nor does he even make a appearance on screen like in COH1. ((I dont even know if this game's based off his true story or not here and how much is fabricated)).

Secondly, the American campaign is told through a risk-style world map of the allied invasion of italy, 
(I personally Like it, as it's style somewhat reminds me of """"RUSE: The Art of Deception"""")) but if you don't like that and are/were expecting a linear traditional mission select like COH1, COH2 and """"somewhat"""" of the German campaign for COH3. then don't bother here. because the German Campaign (or """"story"""") is horrendous (I'll get to that later on in detail) and the allied campaign has none of that.

The Good (and somewhat).

The Dynamic Campaign map is a interesting concept ((allbeit a bit held back in practice)).

some interesting, not very well known units of the war were added. 

I liked the destruction physics.

there's *some* strategy involved.

the gameplay loop is decent.

Now for The somewhat bad. (There's quite alot, some could be considered minor nitpicks to valid complaints but it's up to you).

Graphics will never be good as the depicted trailers, (im on max but yet everything looked so blurry).

Missing animations on a few actions. (No barbed wire cutting animations, the mine clearing one is rather quite lazy. you pick up one mine and the other three just kinda pop-out of existence).

Arbitrary unit caps on PC ((I've always personally hated them here but made even worse for the campaign map and especially it still being a thing in the year of Anno Domini: 2023)). 

The story suffers from fragmentation a bit, I find.

The Depiction of the partisans is not really accurate. In game: they are depicted as average everyday joe's fighting for freedom. in real life, however: the Italian partisans were ((mostly)) diehard communist extremists, also missing the Mafia involvement which played quite the role in the invasion of italy (and also Sicily).   

Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, the very north of italy (Milan to Venice) and also a decent chunk of sicily a fair bit here; were skipped. ((The game starts at the very first battle of Sicily then skips right to the landing in Naples where you truly start until the occupation of Rome which is the game's end mission)).

Edit, coming to my attention here which didnt cross my mind when writing this review: Why is General George S. Patton and Bernard Montgomery named """"Buckram"""" and """"Norton"""" here? What gives? Rights? If this *Again* is directly based of a true solider's story (that being Sgt.Conti's story), you would think that you would have their names included in it. This is especially jarring since you refer to Montgomery *by name* later on in the German Campaign.  

The Bad: 

*Thee* German Campaign...........

Words cannot describe How unfathomably god awful it is and how much I vehemently detest it. I'm glad that I didn't loaded it up first. because if I did, I would've refunded the game within an hour and a review in the next.

Where to possibly start from........Think i'll start from """"the story"""" as some have may have pointed out ((I'm not going to lie to you here, this is going to get really heated as it will be equally controversial)).

""""The story"""" is not even about the German's side, it's told from their enemies......A benghazian (to quote and unquote Kotaku here, specifically: """"Gobbo"""") who fought for the British army and that of his ""Gobbo"" family's struggle but perhaps most importantly here at that, even more so than it not being simply the Germans story here (Which this is perhaps a bigger point that also goes against the entire series aswell here): ITS A FUCKING FAKE STORY, THAT'S NOT EVEN REAL NOR IS IT EVEN BASED UPON ANYTHING!

You could've told one of the Italians or German Soldiers' perspective's from the north african theatre or hell even Rommels own indepth perspective (*that* would've been interesting as it would be unique) but no.........what did you do?

'''MUH BERBER GOBBO OPPRESSION AND REAL AFRIKANG CAMPS/ROMMEL WAR CRIM'S AND ROMMEL WUZ DUM-DUM WITHOUT BRITBONG INTEL""""

if you think that i'm being ""disingenuous, fallacious or even slanderous"" here when I say that, No. this is the accurate summary of the ""German's Campaign"" from the narrative perspective.


Now then Compare this story to that of COH1's German Campaign(s) that it had ((either play them yourself or watch them on YT)).............
I don't think I need to say more here.

The best aspects of CoH1 and 2 have been merged together into a streamlined experience.
More time can be spent managing the battle now, as the menial upkeep work has been cut out in favour of automated systems (Which you can turn off if you prefer the old way). The tactics and units at your disposal are wide and varied.

Gone is the super bad doctrine system from CoH2 where only a few of them were considered meta, and the rest were completely useless. 
They brought back the command point system from CoH1. You start the battle with three battlegroups to choose from. As the battle progresses and you see what your opponent is doing, you can lock in a battlegroup that will lend itself to how the match is unfolding. Each battlegroup has its own little tech tree you can progress though, unlocking passive buffs, units, or abilities. As the match progresses, your units earn you command points based on how they do in battle. You can use these command points to then unlock things in the tech tree. Making these choices will lock others out, so choose wisely.

The dynamic campaign in total war style (simplified) has so far been lots of fun to play through as well.

The Bad:
- Low skirmish/mp map count. More maps are needed, and soon.
- Main menu UI has some strange design choices.
- Units sometimes don't respond, or there is input lag. I've also had instances where I'm sure I've selected a 
   certain unit, only for that selection not to register and I'll have given a move command to what I think is the 
   last unit I had selected. Seems to happen semi-regularly, and its annoying losing a vetted unit because they 
   didn't move when you thought you'd told them to.
- There are some balancing issues, which are being ironed out, so not too worried there.

Old Review:

At first, I didn't like it at all.

🔴 The Germans don't speak German.

🔴 The sound is shallow.

🔴 There are many, many bugs.

🔴 The FOV is weird.

🔴 The multiplayer UI is buggy - like literally everything in the end screen is wrong, diagrams, factions from players, scores...

But after a few hours, I really enjoyed it. Maybe from a gameplay perspective, it's the best in its series.

Things I like about the game:

✔️ The graphics are perfect. Some say it looks worse than 2, but in my opinion, it has the perfect graphic style for an RTS.

✔️ The general gameplay feels satisfying. Tanks can actually kill infantry now.

✔️ There are already four factions in the game without DLC.

✔️ I like the new building and upgrade system.

✔️ The Battlegroup systems (previously called Doctrine) are well-balanced. Every group plays differently, and no one is overpowered or useless.

✔️ The details in the game are gorgeous. Whether it's the troops barricading inside a house and breaking the windows open to shoot better outside, or the ability to zoom now inside houses and see the furniture and your troops inside, or the field medics running around the battlefield to tend to the wounded, or the terrified retreating soldiers running out of the map... the list goes on.

✔️ You can now see where the tanks have weak points and the exact armor score.

✔️ You can see the exact HP of your Battlegroups now.

Is it radically different/better than COH2?  Not really.  I was honestly expecting more from the campaign mode, particularly the Italian campaign which was teased as being very Total War-ish.  And it is, sort of.  You have an overly map, and you run around with various units fighting your German counterparts as you try to liberate Italy.  There's also a bare bones naval system at play as well which can be used to transport or spawn units, or bombard towns/emplacements from the town.

Honestly, this could have been one of the cooler parts of the game, but it's kind of a let down having come from an actual Total War campaign.  First off, like the naval system, a lot of the larger campaign features feel not very well thought out and tacked on feeling.  That means you're basically playing a off brand Total War: World War II in this mode and it's pretty underwhelming.

As to the actual combat, if you liked COH2, it's pretty much more of the same.  If you liked it, you'll like this game, if you didn't, you won't.

Graphics are obviously upgraded, and they've rearranged some of the subfactions (Wehrmacht and Afrika Korps instead of OKW and Wehrmacht, etc).  Since it's set in Italy and North Africa you're also completely lacking Russians, so really you're getting less than you did in COH, absent future DLCs.

Bottom line: COH fans will enjoy it.  If you didn't like the previous games, skip.

Additional thoughts:  I've now finished the North Africa campaign.  It was actually really good; mostly narrated throughout a fighter on the Allies side but played from the perspective of the Afrika Korps.  My main complaint both here and with the Italy campaign is it doesn't allow you to change history.  I.e., no matter how well you perform, you still lose in the end because that's what history says.  Yeah, I get it, they're historical events, but so are countless other 4x and grand strategy games set all throughout history, and they let you control your own destiny.

Multiplayer is, so far, less exciting than COH2.  There's no player level or unlocks (Unless this comes exclusively through competitive, which I haven't played).  Comp stomps are still fun, but I dunno, all around the game feels a little hollowed out.  Pretty graphics, but shallower than I anticipated.

They seem to just not like it because it isn't COH 2. Well get over it. This is COH 3. It feels like they are bringing the series back to it's roots with the original COH. This is a solid entry into the COH franchise

Infantry last longer in the fight than in COH 2. This is a plus in my opinion. Infantry were so easily wiped out in COH 2. The gameplay is definitely more balanced to allow more units to shine on the battlefield. There are more tactical choices like allowing your bazooka infantry to use their bazookas on static targets like a wall. This is one example of more tactial options that make this game a step up above COH 2.

The addition of the strategic map for the campaign is an upgrade for the COH franchise. Though the load times get more atrocious as the campaign proceeds, and I have the game installed on an M.2 SSD. Even worse than any Total War game. There is no excuse for that in my opinion. The mission variety could be better for the smaller skirmishes. And the population cap should be higher to allow more strategic flexibility.

What really sets Company of Heroes 3's multiplayer apart is the tactical game play. This is a game where you have to think on your feet, adapt to your opponent's tactics, and make quick decisions that can make or break your chances of victory. The longer time to kill in CoH3 allows for a much more cerebral feel to the strategy involved over it's predecessors. It's intense, it's challenging, and it's incredibly rewarding when you finally emerge victorious.

Mechanics and AI are broken, where you give an order and units and they get stuck and take minutes just to move to a location because the units can't decide whether to go over the bridge or around it.

Also, the retreat action is the most broken mechanic in the game, you can surround/pin an enemy unity down, but you can just retrat and somehow it gives you a boost in defense where the unit takes even less damage than if it was on heavy cover.

I am so disappointed.

All of my review relates to the Italian Campaign Single Player mode, which is the only mode I have tried so far....

1. This game is almost unplayable there are so many bugs. It freezes between missions sometimes or hangs for 10 minutes.  Other times you command a unit to attach on the campaign map, and it uses it's movement points but does nothing...End of game statistics screens contain useless and clearly erroneous information (e.g. you complete all objectives but the end of game screen provides almost no information you can interrogate about your performance, and the little data that is shown is just garbage such as ""0 objectives completed"" - when you clearly completed them all or Unit efficiency ""867%"" whatever that means. Other times you are given campaign objectives which are clearly impossible to complete based on the current map situation, and therefore worthless in terms of storytelling or gameplay experience.

2. Units get stuck in the sea on the campaign map, and can't be deleted or moved, but consume resources so essentially force you to restart the game .

3. Graphics bugs sometimes mean the main campaign map screen loses all colour and goes into a weird high contrast mode.

4. Information on units (how much damage they do etc is so poor, like it's a game designed for young children or casual console gamers.

5. AI in the games is more like AS (artificial stupidity) - nothing like as good as COH2 and enemy units just blunder straight into danger repeatedly without trying to attack with an appropriate unit combination or flank (nothing like a SC2 experience for example)

6. Generally, the whole game seems like a worse version of COH2, with a campaign map wrapper around it and lots of marketing spiel and artwork surrounding the actual game to try and offset how buggy and underwhelming the actual game is. 

In Summary - DON'T BUY THIS GAME until they have actually finished developing it. Which is clearly not yet :-(

I still really want to love this game (otherwise I would have asked for a refund - it's like buying a car which occasionally breaks down and for which some of the electronics simply fails to work reliably - without a speedometer), and will plough on trying to play it regardless, but how full of bugs and unfinished it is... :-(

I bought the game mainly for the multiplayer with friends. Right now it´s a very frustrating experience.

They need to punish blobs by having a debuff when too many units stand too close. Like 20% more dmg and 20% more surpression. 

I fear the nerds will gatekeep Coh 3 multiplayer when you easily can abuse the game to find cheesy strats to win. Like DAK Guastatori squad using attack ground when hiding in smoke. I think there are easy fixes that will counter blopping and force players to actually use the terrain and cover. Im just getting ran at by OP inf blobs like Coh 2. I´m offcourse not delusional thinking the balance would and will be perfect, but the point i´m trying to make is, i´m really not having fun playing against these nerds just blooping.

A lot of the campaign map decisions don't feel relevant or impactful in the slightest, even when the game rewards you for doing something right it feels pretty unrewarding or insignificant. 

Gameplay wise, you immediately feel the fatigue from playing the same maps almost immediately. Your first 5-10 fights have a massive amount of map overlap, and that doesn't go away over the next 100 battles you get into.  For RTS fans that like to min max or get creative with build orders, there's not a lot for you here, and on the combat side a lot of it predictable with a low skill ceiling this time around, mistakes are a lot more forgiving this time around with units dealing damage pretty slow/sustained rather than the burst we saw in COH2. Not a bad thing but it does change up the dynamic when you're out playing someone in multiplayer.

Best thing about the game oddly enough was the hand written letters during the loading screens, outside of unit design, its the only thing remotely creative or well executed in the entire game. Somehow the background characters get more focus and likability than the voice actors or the main plot.

The game is closer to company of heroes 1 (for the better) and each faction feels unique with varied abilities and doctrines that further allow you to specialize your Company. The  doctrines are interesting and there are major differences between say the British Artillery Company vs The Land and Sea Group. The call in abilities are more fun than in prior games.. However, as usual relic failed to properly play test multiplayer.

Multiplayer is currently completely screwed at least at a competitive level. The Axis Forces have emplacements like Flak Weapons (Flak 88 and Flak 20 mm)  that autoheal anytime you put infantry in them. These emplacements are also immune to things like mortars and all tier one weapons. This means that in many cases you literally cant fight your opponent if they choose to exploit these glitches/units. There are a ton of other balancing issues but this one is glaring one that should have been spotted instantly in any play-test.

Sound in the game is relatively awful and sounds muffled.

Tons of glitches in the campaign/single player that theyre trying to hotfix.

Not enough multiplayer maps

Cant do battle replays (which was a feature in all the prior games)

I think if they keep fixing the issues in the game it will be a better product than CoH2 and even match CoH1. Ienjoy the game when you dont have to deal with glitches. However, releasing an unbalanced game, when multiplayer is the core of the gameplay, and particularly something that would have been easily spotted during playtesting by a major developer for me is not excusable. Release an unfinished product at full price, get a shitty review.

2) the game itself seems to run just fine for me, no bugs or glitches to speak of. However, the menus, specifically the after-match screen, don't seem to almost ever have the right numbers/calculations.

WWII Aesthetic 
Units are fun to explore
Custom Maps
Co-oP Skirmishes

Frustrating Aspects:
Horrendously delayed unit response times
Intentionally stupid behavior by your units - ""such as not returning fire or turning to return fire""
Enemy AI units literally immediately react to your grenades, call-ins, and abilities rendering them useless or nearly so.
The enemy AI prioritizes off screen engagements & your movement command queues/checkpoints in order to capitalize on its own ineptitude.  Prepare to have your defensive units destroyed with no warning by off screen threats in many cases.  Expect the fresh squad of riflemen to be ambushed on their walk down to your outpost.

The Unforgivable:
Virtually all of the ""difficulty"" this game serves up is a result of how slow and inept your units are at following the commands they are given.  To make this matter worse you are forced to micromanage your units to such a small degree that it feels unrealistic.  Some things just seem broken, like the AI dancing units back and forth between a machine gun nest that just can't seem to get pointed in the right direction.

The majority of my complaint so far is around quality of life and stability. The game does have crashes during combat when you try to make repetitive movements/adjustments too fast. I was also able to cause a crash by completing an objective before I was suppose to do it, and the game immediately died as soon as the game told me to complete it. 

QoL:
- Camera is too zoomed up. People are saying ""its just like COH1/COH2"" these people are full of sh*t. I've played both COH1/COH2 for years. This game is way more zoomed in, limiting your situational awareness. 
- Even though the camera is closer, you still can't zoom into the level you could in older games, where you could literally get right over the shoulder of a unit, but now you can't do that. 
- The edge scrolling or key scrolling is too jumpy. Its not a smooth transition at all and you have to drop it down to 25% to make it tolerable and even then its still jumpy with edge scrolling and this translates over to the overworld map but there it makes navigating incredibly slow.
- Though the game boasts that its ""better graphics"" cut scenes switch between slightly moving still images, to super blurry moving character scenes where you can't actually see the fine detail on purpose, the cinematic scenes are a joke for a game in 2023. Which wouldn't really be an issue for this genre of game if they didn't try to market it that way. That said, with the exception of vegetation which looks weird, the overall graphics do appear to be improved. But its not ""amazing"" like some reviews might lead you to believe.
- Units garrisoning buildings will sometimes just teleport inside rather than using doors, or their pathing will screw up and instead of going through the door they are standing right in front of they will walk all the way around the building into enemy fire instead. 
- The UI is too clunky and takes up too much screen space. It would be nice if you could adjust this in the settings. 
- Overall the settings menu is very limited in gameplay customization options that you'd expect to be any almost any game these days.

- Vehicle AI doesn't really seem to care whats in their way to the enemy and will seemingly almost deliberately gun down your own troops. 
- Units that get to close to one another seem to have trouble with pathing in general or executing commands. For example, if you want to wirecut with some engineers but there are some riflemen nearby, the engineers won't conduct the command. Or if the engineers are already next to the wires, you might have to move them away and then issue the command, or move the other squads away. 


Ultimately, the game does feel enjoyable, but I'm honestly sick of game companies releasing products in unfinished states, and selling them at full price to squeeze funding out of consumers so they can fix things later. This practice is more and more frequent and its outright scummy. There use to be a time when games launched in a working and complete state. Sure bugs would still come up, but the overall product felt finished. This doesn't feel like that at all.


UPDATE: (SPOILER)

I beat the game. The ending is not really that satisfying, you don't get to do the final fight for rome. And you can accidentally trigger the final mission without knowing its the final mission, and miss out on continuing other skirmishes or map movements. Which sucks because it means I could've just made a straight line for the target and ignored all the other side stuff to ""win"" and thats not how war is fought. Campaign outright sucks. Its nice to have some new COH content, but this isn't $60 quality, this is $20-30 quality.

- AI pathing can be awful, I booted up some AI matches to get a feel for all the units and theory craft build orders but sometimes the AI would just bunch up on their end of the map and never attempt to counter play regardless of difficulty.
- The Allied campaign is one thing I thought was cool, definitely an improvement from the US campaign from Ardennes Assault but I still find myself avoiding it because it's so janky; The voiced leader respect/dialog system is just garbage, every time they start talking I just want to skip it (you can't, it sounds like garbage and it just wastes your time).
- They definitely wanted the game detailed but it's like they stopped halfway, model movement is good but then you call in an airstrike and it's just this slowly moving cartoon-like generic bomb that goes straight down; like some Civ IV/4X map overview animation they stole from the Allied campaign over-map but downsized it. Considering the detail in the previous games, that is just stupid.
- Tanks/arty can now hit objects in the way, which is very cool, I love it. However, tanks will now sometimes just completely miss and shoot the ground 30m in front of the target.

Less important notes
- other than the FOV, the in-game UI is whatever
- Model coloring is bad, I'm sure they'll fix this eventually with new skins in the loadout page.
- Because of the weird color palette, every map just looks bad.
- Menu UI is poor.
- Because of the ""dynamic"" models, after a match, a tank sometimes is just completely charred black
- The German campaign was a cheesy afterthought to justify the 2nd Axis faction.

All in all, people will say COH2 was bumpy at the start, but this game is the same amount of bumpy while being worse in basically every other aspect and like I said, gameplay is about the same but everything else just makes its worse than COH2.
I hope they fix it but as is it is now, I'd pay $20 at most.

If you enjoyed the other CoH games, you'll enjoy this one.

Probably not going to cover new ground if you've read any other reviews, but CoH 3 has fun tactical combat (the bread and butter of the game). The single player campaign map is pretty wonky like a super pared down version of Total War campaign maps. Difficulty-wise the first 15 hours or so of the campaign hasn't really presented a challenge in Expert (I believe the hardest setting unless you can unlock a harder one). Enemy AI in the campaign map is really passive, but it's a lot better than I remember in skirmishes, where enemies take cover effectively.

I'm just a little bummed by the single player missions since they seem to last about 10-15 minutes each (some secondary objectives are difficult to complete simply by virtue of completing the main objectives too quickly). I think there are maybe 4-6 random skirmish maps that you will quickly play again, and again, and again.

In that sense, the campaign is at the same time more ambitious than the previous games, but it is also less memorable (so far). A lot of the campaign mechanics are completely optional, and things like aircraft and ships seem like their benefits are negligible.

If this review seems kind of negative, I'd like to switch back to the actual RTS gameplay, which is still my favorite in the genre. There's nothing as satisfying as maneuvering a handful of Sherman tanks around some Panzers in a crowded city and landing shots to the side and rear.

I anticipate the multiplayer being a lot of fun, but I tend to knock out the single player stuff first before jumping into online play, so I can't speak to that. However, I have thousands of hours in the original CoH (most of it before picking up the Steam version years after I started playing), and this seems like it will be comparable experience.",1678268243,1678268243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

**เกมนี้ ต้องการ SSD ในการลงเกม  ไม่งั้นจะโหลดฉากนานมาก  ในโหมด Campagne
**ตอนนี้เกมมีปัญหาเรื่อง bug ใน mission นิดหน่อย และใน Campagne italy ช่วงท้าย จะโหลดฉากนานมาก
**โหมดเล่นคนเดียว หรือ Campange จะใช้เวลาเล่นจบในช่วงเวลา  30-40 ชม
**ด่าน Afirica  เป็น mission เส้นตรง  italy เป็น Turn - Base 

จุดเด่นใน COH3 ที่แตกต่างจากที่ผ่านมา

1.ในโหมดเนื่อง ตัวเกมหยิบไอเดียจาก ซีรีย์ Total war มาผสม เกม RTS  ในรูปแบบ COH     , ทำให้เกมนี้โหมดผู้เล่นคนเดียว
จะเป็น Turn - Base และเวลาต่อสู้จะตัดเข้าสู่ฉาก RTS    หลังจากที่เล่นจบเลยทำให้เกิดความขาดหวัง  ว่าอนาคต
 COH ในภาคต่อไป จะยายรูปแบบเกมเพลย์แบบนี้ ให้จริงจังขึ้น  และ map ขยายเป็นทั่วยุโรปไปเลย  อาจทำให้ซีรีย์อยู่กับ
เราไป อีก 10-20 ปี 55

2.เกมเพลย์ในโหมด Turn - Base  ผู้เล่นต้องเลิอกควบคุม  กองทัพบก กองทัพเรือ(support)  กองทัพอากาศ (support) 
  โดยใช้ค่า upkeep ร่วมกัน   เวลาบุกโจมตีภาคพื้นดิน ตัวเกมจะให้ใช้กองทัพ **ทหารราบ รถถัง ปืนใหญ่  พลร่ม** เป็นหมากในการโจมตีและยึดดินแดน  ส่วน ทัพเรือ กับอากาศจะเสริมโจมตีในรูปแบบ support       กองทัพ **ทหารราบ รถถัง ปืนใหญ่  พลร่ม** สามารถพัฒนาให้เก่งขึ้นจากแต้ม exp จากสู้รบและเควส (มี exp ,level)   ยิ่งได้แต้มอัพสกิลเยอะ ก็สามารถ พัฒนา
ยูนิตหน่วยนั้น ให้เก่งขึ้นหรือมีตัวเลือก  support มากขึ้น  (ปลด lock ยูนิตและสกิล)    ในส่วนการพัฒนาเมือง
เราสามารถ พัฒนา สนามบิน ท่าเรือ  เมืองหลัก  ให้เป็นศูนย์บรรชาการ    เพื่อช่วยเลือกในด้านส่งเสบียง หรือโจมตีระยะไกล

3.ในส่วน Skirmish   ตัว core game play  หลักยังเหมือนเดิม   แต่จะเลือกแค่ 2 ฝ่าย  ฝ่ายละ 2 หน่วย เหมือนภาค 1
  
 ความแตกต่าง ที่อัพเกรดมาจากภาค ที่แล้วในรูปแบบการเล่น Skimish 
  -ระบบ Heal Auto ,ระบบเรียกทหาร Auto ,สร้านฐาน auto  โดยไม่ต้องใช้ทหารช่างมากสร้าง
  -ระบบ CQC  บุกเข้าไปเคลียร์อาคาร แล้วยึดอาคารที่มียูนิตฝั่งตรงข้ามอยู่
  -ระบบ Rank ยูนิตใหม่ อัพได้ 2 สาย
  -ระบบ Map ใหม่ทั้งหมด  
  -ระบบ  รถถัง สามารถ บรรทุกหน่วยทหารติดไปด้วยหลังรถ 
  -ระบบ คำนวนเกราะรถถังใหม่   อัพเกรดรูทเส้นทางยูนิตใหม่

4.ในส่วนกราฟิค  อันนี้แล้วแต่คนชอบเลย  ส่วนตัวผมคิดว่า ดีเทลยูนิตเพิ่มขึ้น   ดูง่ายขึ้น   

สรุป  สำหรับใครเป็นแฟน COH ก็ไม่น่าพลาดเกมนี้หรอกมั้ง ถึงแม้มองผ่าน เหมือนไม่ต่างจากภาค 2  แต่ที่แน่ ระบบ Campagne 
ต่างจากภาค 1-2 แน่นอน   

ข้อเสีย
1.ยังมี bug เล็กน้อยในโหมดเล่นคนเดียว
2.อยากได้ Campagne Map ใหญ่กว่านี้ หรือ เปิดแนวรบด้านอื่น 55 (ในด่านแอฟริกาน่าจะทำเป็น turn - base)
3.มีปัญเรื่องกราฟิค แสงเงาแปลกๆ บางฮาก

  - elevation advantage
  - auto vaulting over fences
  - auto reinforce button at HQ
  - towing of weapons (tho really poor pathing and setup time. better just to actually move the ATG regularly)

Game's missing features:
  - changing mouse edge panning speed
  - ability to veto a map
  - many hotkeys and settings are in the interface but do not work
  - legacy/classic hotkeys (currently no way to go back to classic hotkeys in coh2, so all that hardwiring people had learned for coh previously is gone and for the worse)
  - in game replay system
  - in game rank system
  - in game spectate system
  - post-game statistics with any sort of accuracy (cant keep track of how many squads you built)
  - surrender button (there is still a hole near the minimap where it supposed to be)
  - crushing infantry with vehicles
  - ability to zoom out
  - camera locations


Features that have been changed from previous titles:
 - tac map (worse in every way)
 - red cover removed (replaced with elevation advantage)
 - infantry engagements are slower and less lethal. 
 - unique colors are confusing and you can end up being red
 - cannot distinguish who controls a unit by simply clicking on the unit because all the information is missing on the bottom hud.  everything is hidden and requires you to scroll over them to see how many kills for example.
 - vet system is there but seems less impactful than previous games
 - shift+number feature in coh2 does not exist
 - control clicking feature in coh2 does not exist
 - you can accidentally select retreating infantry and be unable to issue command
 - selected tanks and infantry have different command priority than previous title, thus requiring many more actions to do the same task.
 - unit focus fire while moving and auto attack priority is different
 - all weapon team AI have been significantly nerfed to where you have to baby sit them to make sure they are doing what you want them to, and even then they still will resetup in the exact same place to target something already in their arc.  
 - arc of weapon teams are a lot less detailed and there are less dots showing where the end of a weapon's arc is.  
 - engine damage from at grenade and satchels require a lot more damage 
 - you cannot repair your hq
 - units that you expect to have abilities, or win at certain distances because of their weapons are all different and you have to relearn what wins where
 
Additional things that I believe are weak:
 - the sound in general is worse than poor, weapons do not sound like you would expect them too and many sound like they have some awful echo to them
 - the announcer cannot be turned off and is really annoying to me. he will constantly tell you to do things that you may not necessarily want to do at that moment.  they make you sound like you are losing stuff when you arent. 
 - the squads all sound really annoying like they are constantly shouting the exact same line over and over in your ears ( with the announcer telling you to spend your CP it becomes really annoying)
 - shift clicking barely even works
 - pathing is horrible in this game
 - breaching is a pathetic feature, and once you initiate it you cannot stop.  towing does this too.
 - allowing the players to see what the enemy's commander is by clicking a button
 - skill plane 1 clicking is back in a big way, and its even bugged to where it doesnt disappear sometimes

Is this going to be like Dawn of War 3? Abandoned, forgotten, and forever broken?

Some of the few examples:
*Some icons are just deep fried coh2 icons
*Path finding still an issue? 
- I try to position my tank by turning them to face a direction and instead they circle around to face a direction.
- Infantry some how get stuck on a pebble and jet propel onwards
*AI is... something. At least they are semi competent on the hardest difficulty.
*The two German factions are un-creative and a missed opportunity for a better Italian faction with German lend lease items/equipment/vehicles instead it is the other way around
- Overall the factions are alright
* On release only 3 commanders per faction?
* 3-4 maps per player gamemode
* Balancing is fun. Some infantry are made out of paper mache while some light vehicles have depleted uranium armour.

As a cliche it pains me to say it I loved the first and second game, and this one has introduced some major QoL improvements but for full price on launch it is disappointing.

It doesn't have as much bass or punch as the previous games, but it still sounds okay.  Having four factions at launch with a decent number of units helps the game stay fresh.

I haven't ran into any game breaking bugs.  Only the occasional graphical glitch where textures on certain buildings flash.

I wish the camera had a higher zoom level.  Having a larger view of the battlefield would greatly reduce the amount of screen panning required.  It would also be nice to have the default key bindings use WASD for camera movement (without holding alt).

But that's true of literally every RTS I've ever played on release. Tough to get things exactly right until people have a chance to get into the systems and feed you some data.

Also, the Italy campaign is just *chef's kiss*. I love the Total War-style open map and the overarching strategic context it provides to each battle. It's a great break from endless skirmish battles.

The factions?  All rehashed versions from previous games.

The campaigns?  No real depth or character.  The German campaign in North Africa is interesting and more akin to the older CoH campaigns, but lacks any real character.  Missions are interesting and can be fun, but the campaign is too short to be memorable.  The Allied campaign in Italy is a colossal disappointment.  Aside from a few key missions that really stand out, you'll find yourself running through the same 3 or 4 maps repeatedly, coming from different angles.  The overall ""strategic appeal"" from the grand strategy map is completely missing.  I found myself simply bombarding towns and rolling down streets completely unimpeded since emplacements and opposing forces can't really stop you and taking damage does nothing to hinder the tactical battles.  Opposing armies never attempt to recapture territory, so any incentive to defend your territory is moot.  The whole experience was underwhelming and felt like more of a chore.

Gameplay?  Incredibly fun, no complaints... it's just the same game I bought 9 years ago in CoH2.  There is little to no difference from the abilities, units, factions, etc..  I get the idea of ""don't fix what isn't broken"", but if only one or two new mechanics were added, then why not simply make this an expansion?  

The multiplayer/skirmish modes?  There are maybe 10 unique maps, all of which are wide open-sprawling maps with some buildings strewn about.  There isn't enough variety to make them unique, so once again, it feels like an underwhelming experience that gets stale after a few games.  There are only two game modes, King of the Hill and Deathmatch (if you will).  Again, lackluster options.

It feels like Relic is relying heavily on the community to make up for the lack of content through mod teams and it's absurd.   To release a game with such little content (unless 75% of their budget went to the Italy campaign) just feels like a slap in the face.  Why didn't we get a dedicated Italian faction?  What about the Italian resistance which was glossed over?  Seems like there were plenty of missed opportunities, but I see DLC in the future which I won't have any part of.",1678231846,1678231846,False,2,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

Company of Heroes 3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

As many people know by now, I am a very big fan of strategy games, especially if they are set during World War II. So I must say that I was really excited to give Company of Heroes 3 a go. I personally enjoy games that provide the consumer with extensive campaigns, which this game does. It also provides us with multiplayer modes, players vs players and Coop, which is great for people who enjoy playing against other people, but in my case I was attracted just because of the campaigns. But after 30-odd hours of play, I am truly sitting on the fence.

Company of Heroes 3 is a strategy game with turn-based and Real-time tactics elements developed by Relic Entertainment and published by SEGA on the 24th of February 2023 on the Steam platform. 

My strategy was to totally ignore the suggestion from the American and British Generals and the leader of the Italian Partisans, which got me nowhere on my first attempt. You see, I was really curious to find out if acquiring trust or loyalty (in the game) from these three individuals would actually give me an edge in both tactical phases of the games. In retrospect, it didn’t really give me much at all! My Second campaign was the most fun until the first hotfix patch hit. At that stage, I had around 20 hours of gameplay under my belt and had not encountered major issues. Then I started to have issues with several crashes on the desktop. The game just starts to get slower after every turn. Then, today’s patch came out and literally shut down my system. After verifying the system file and making sure I had the latest Nvidia driver for my 3080 TI video card, Intel i9-9900k with 64 gig DDR4, the game is now unplayable as it just keeps hanging, which is such a shame. My understanding about patching is that it should make a game better rather than unplayable. A bit of food for thought for both the developer and publisher.

But until then, I must say that I really enjoyed playing the game. Both tactical phases are really good. The theatre war map is beautifully laid out and the details are spectacular. I really liked the volcano near Naples, for example. In this phase, you’ll be able to move your units to strategic locations. The map will have depots of fuel and ammunition, airfields and seaports. And as you would expect, the goal is to make sure you keep your company’s supplies as fluid as possible. Depending on the supplies, materiel (planes, boats) and companies, you’ll be able to send a bomber to a specific target, order an artillery barrage from ships or drop paratroopers behind enemy lines. Or simply send a plane on a reconnaissance mission. In regard to the units, all of them have a certain number of movement points to move them around the map. You can purchase additional units (tank, infantry, plane or ship) as long as you have enough manpower and you increase the manpower by capturing new towns and seaports. 

The second phase is the Real-time tactical aspect of the game. As you move around the War theatre map, you’ll encounter enemy companies on the road, seaport, towns, airfields and depots. If an enemy company is a location, it will trigger a combat phase when you attack it. They are a couple of types of victory goals. One is to capture a few major strategic points within the map and bleed the enemy ticket to zero (depending on the strength of the opposition, of course). To give you an idea, if both armies are at full strength, the count will start at 300 for both sides. The second type of victory is where you have to capture and occupy the area within the map and encircle the enemy base. You also have second objectives in most of your battles and if you complete them, you’ll receive an extra skill point for your trouble. I really like this feature and at the end of each of your successful fights, your unit will receive skills points which you can use to add new abilities. Purchase new pool units for your next encounter or utilise them for an upgrade for your real-time battles and support or for your campaign upgrade. 

In regards to the balance of the units during battles, I thought it was quite fair and it didn’t bother me much at all, but I guess it is pretty much a personal preference after all. The ability to pause the game during battle is good as you can redirect unit fires wherever you want, and I find It quite useful while using my support bombing runs and strafing as well as an artillery barrage. Anything on the map can be destroyed, which I like.  However, I have the vague impression that a lot of the weapon’s sound effects are the same. The voice acting is good but there are not many different voices. What was actually funny is at one point, one of my British units had a slight southern German accent, Ja! 

I am being stern here because it has been quite a while since a game shut down my system as this game did. I know the issues will be fixed but it doesn’t look good for both Relic Entertainment or SEGA. The game has huge replayability in both campaigns and multiplayer modes and yes, it is worth playing. But the people who gave the green light for these dreadful patches should be court-martialled by the U.S., British and German armies! I strongly recommend waiting for six months and picking up the game for $30 (Australian dollars). I will still recommend the game, but it won’t be a flash score!

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 

+	Great graphics
+	Two campaigns and multiplayer modes
+	Three different factions (armies)
+	Good combination of turn-based and real-time tactics
+	Fun and easy to play when it works
+	Achievements and trading cards

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 

-	Multiple crashes to desktop and system shutdown
-	Dreadful patches caused me headaches after 20 hours of bliss.

Company of Heroes 3 is actually really fun; detailed with great replayability when it works! Unfortunately, dreadful hotfix patches totally destroyed my experience.

This RTS incorporates systems from both previous entries as well as many new features to make gameplay smoother. At time of writing it's less than a month old so there are some minor bugs but they're being fixed rapidly.

There are two campaigns, a North African and Italian campaign. The NA campaign is linear, scenario based, and focused on the Afrika Corps. I found it rather enjoyable to play out, felt like an old school RTS campaign to me. The Italian campaign has a Total War, scaled way down & simplified, feel to me. You control allied companies moving up the boot towards Rome, using support units such as bombers, fighters, and warships to support your effort. It has some clarity issue when it comes to objectives, but overall I found it to be enjoyable and a good way to learn the Allies factions inside and out.

Online skirmish and the like is far more stable than previous versions which is a pleasant surprise. All the factions feel fairly balanced to me, though I'm sure you can find one group or another who would disagree. The main gripe I have thus far with the game is sparse official maps and companies.

My current opinion of the game in this state is that I am dissapointed. The overall games feels unfinished, and fragile. Had hoped for better grafic, and a new feel to the gameplay to make it feel tigher than COH2. 
Like the movement of tanks. The little hair I have left is getting even thinner when I try to back away my tank, only for it to turn its back around and explode.

Campain
The overall concept for the campain is good, but not as refined as other games like total war series. 
It feels unfinished, and hasty. 
I like the idea that I coordinate different battlegroup, and mix abilitys on my units. Even tho I can not use the combo in many of the battles.
The campain starts fresh, but in the end gets so reperative... When you have played for some hours you get some scenarios/missons are unique. But too many are too simular, so you end up to just skip them with auto resolve.

Is it only me that feels like I play a beta version of COH 2?? Only with ""other"" factions? Would have loved to have a complete pure Italian faction. French? Japan? Turkish? Hope this will come as DLC in the future.
Hopyfully the game will improve over time with more factions, patches, content and workshop content.

I have never enjoyed CoH multiplayer, and will probably never play a single game of CoH without a liberal use of tactical pause, so take that in to consideration when reading this: 

The campaign feels very free-form in more of a ""Mount and Blade"" type way. I really can't describe it better than that. You should probably start a campaign and learn the basics, and then start over a few turns in if you actually want to have an immersive strategy experience where you actually understand how things work. The game doesn't really tell you what actions are available to you, and you flounder a bit before learning the strategy part. By then, you probably have conquered half the map anyway - and that feels a bit lacklustre. (So you should also probably start at a higher difficulty)

You can play many hours just doing skirmishes that tend to be quite repetitive. The campaign ""missions"" are of course more interesting than skirmishes, but they feel a bit incoherent if you, like me, want to do ""everything"" before moving on to the next item at hand.  The difficulty level on default does seem to be a bit low compared to earlier CoH-games, so if you have enjoyed single-player COH earlier, you might want to increase the difficulty level. The game does lack a bit of polish, and could stand a few more rounds of playtesting before release. 

All in all: If you enjoy some lightweight WW2 strategy with a solid fun tactical time-sink. This is def. for you.",1678209463,1678209463,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Unit movement and some other similar details are worse then COH2, and gets annoying to a COH veteran.
Balance is completly fkd up,  And air abilities are way overtuned,   you can't even move units away from it,  because they'´ll target the viencles 100 miles away from originial placement,  having air defenses does nothing aswell.

Both American & German Doctrines with Air abilities are just horrible to face,  just last game I moved 4 infantry and 2 viencles away from the zone 1st second, but still all 4 infantry and 2 viencles got obliterated,  how to come back from that?

Graphics isnt really noticble better then COH2 either,  cool with a new front getting light (afrika),  but thats about it,   the italy campaign seems promising but too bad there wasn't as much effort put into the afrika one.

Positives: This is not a game where the developers were slapping together the bare minimum in terms of gameplay. There are two campaigns of different formats and there is a LOT of content for a single player experience.  The actual gameplay captures the COH experience pretty well as well.  If you enjoyed the first two, you'll slide in fairly easily to the flow of this one. It also includes a nice quality of life option with a pausing button so you can give several orders at once to position your squads. It's a great way of allowing new players to think in terms of cover and positioning.  In terms of design and thinking about how the game would play, I have genuine praise for the developers. I feel like there was a large part of the staff that were genuinely interested in experimenting and evolving the formula and I respect that.

Negatives: The release state for this game is a joke.  The sheer volume of bugs I have encountered is infuriating.  Half the time, squads ignore orders to build fortifications. Telling a unit to use their special abilities MAY have them do what you asked. It may cause the unit to bug out and freeze.  Moving infantry always comes with a slight risk of a single member being caught on terrain and bugging the entire squad.  Armies on the campaign map have either failed to spawn or spawned in the ocean, being frozen and unusable. Armies near a bridge when it is destroyed have become bugged and frozen.  Enemy units that are out of supply and are supposed to die simply... never do.  This list goes on and on and on.

This is classic 'Early Release' bullshit. No Early Release game I have ever played has ever been 'released' as a finished game, and yet I still keep falling for it. And this is absolutely not a finished game. I respect that no game is bug free. I can be forgiving of some, especially at release, but this is embarrassing. This is the kind of release state that a developer should have their reputation damaged over.  I am not touching any game made by this developer again until months after release when it MAY actually be done or functional and I have checked for any warnings in reviews.

The campaign, while interesting and fun in many ways, is also not very good at explaining it's mechanics, especially the loyalty mechanics. I'm also not certain if it is ALSO bugged as I regularly saw loyalties drop for no stated reason, and no notification in the UI.  And this is while following the rules I had to look up online.

I'm an old fan of COH. I have friends I will play this with that will make it fun.  But this game is not worth the price tag and continuing to reward releasing absolutely broken games after a long period of 'Early Access' needs to stop.",1678204999,1678204999,False,1,1,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

It needs significant ""polishing"" especially when it comes to skirmish sets ups, SOUNDTRACK, menu, graphic options, etc..  So ... is it worth $60?  I am on the fence, and here is why:  no game series  I have ever played has given me the hundreds of hours of enjoyment I have gotten from CoH.  The only thing that even comes close is AoEII.  So, the developers earning some serious cash for all of the pleasure they have given me is totally worth it.  They have earned my dollar - by a long shot - far more than I have ever paid.  So, I don't resent giving them $60 for a not finished game.  I hope and pray it will be updated and finished through patches.  On the other hand, if I give them my $60 now, there is no financial motivation to finish the game (which I am sure I will eventually love, once finished).  In fact, to the contrary, decision makers will be motivated to move the developers on to the next money making project as quickly as possible.  Overall, I decided they have earned my trust and it is worth the $60 ... please don't let me down!
On a side note, a few features I am compelled to comment on a few features:
1. Thank you SO much for including tactical pause in single player.  I WILL NOT buy a strategy game that does not include this feature for single player modes (sorry AoE - you are OUT until you fix this).  Also, thank you for moving it to space bar instead of the ""pause"" key - a key that is quickly disappearing on modern keyboards.
2.  I can't decide if I love or hate the queuing of command orders (new feature).  On one hand it is great for sending pathing/flanking orders, very efficient and cool.  On the other hand, it makes reacting to unexpected conditions (discovering enemy units in your path) very troublesome.  Imagine you are sending some infantry on a flanking run, and the discover an unprotected AT gun.  You see it, and click on the AT gun to have them attack it.  Instead of canceling the previous order, they continue their flanking path, and THEN return to attack the AT gun; assuming it is still there (and it won't be).  Maybe there is an option to turn off this feature, if so, I have not found it.  I hope that future patches include the option to turn it off.

The game also has a new campaign mode, which allows players to follow the story of the war in the Mediterranean and North Africa.

While the game has more game modes than its predecessor, the overall experience is still lacking. The game's matchmaking system is slow, and it can take a long time to find a match. There is no chat within a lobby and you can only send messages whilst in-game.

While the game has campaign modes, there is little reason to play through them again once you have completed them. The game does have a map editor, so players can create their own custom maps and possibly custom campaigns in the future.

The game's AI is not particularly challenging and they tend to stack, which can make playing against the computer relatively easy once you learn how they play.

The camera level is very close to the ground with no response from devs after many complaints in the beta and more complaints post-release. The graphics are much more vibrant and 'cartoony' than previous games, but I personally don't find this an issue as it's more of an arcade-RTS than something like Men of War Assault Squad 2.

Company of Heroes 3 has some improvements over its predecessor, it ultimately falls short in a few key areas. The game's updated sound is impressive, and the new campaign mode is a welcome addition. However, the multiplayer mode is still lacking, and the game's replay value is limited. Overall, I would give Company of Heroes 3 a negative review. While it is an enjoyable game, it does not live up to the high standards set by the previous games in the series.

Despite all this the core gameplay is still addicting and satisfying, adding minor quality of life and very little overall innovation to the proven formula after ~15 years. The adjustments in CoH3 seem to make it faster paced (but not nearly StarCraft level of speed), and focus on a more diverse army composition, which can be very compelling to build and control.

It is missing many of basic features like replays, profile/statistics tracking (for yourself or any of the stats in game), and ranked matchmaking. There is no chat in lobbies, the game instantly kicks you to a broken score screen the moment the game ends (the numbers literally don't add up). 

The graphics are only a marginal upgrade from the decade old prequel, the animations are passable (when not clearly bugged), and the zoom level is claustrophobic. Relic seems addicted to turning their games into a near third person shooter despite overwhelming feedback otherwise. Or they locked zoom to that level because of performance issues with more on the screen, is my suspicion.

Many of the sounds are weirdly balanced, like someone listening to Saving Private Ryan on bluetooth speakers in the other room. For some reason many of the sounds and explosions lack the ""oomph"" you'd expect, there seems to be some sort of weird filter on them.

So, Relic has once again released a less than half baked beta test of a game with the implied promise that they will continue improving over time. (read: adding basic features that are standard in most free to play games, like replays or chat or ranked matchmaking)

I have thousands and thousands of hours in CoH 1 (more recently with the awesome Blitzkreig mod) and hundreds of hours on CoH 2 and I think this is a fantastic addition to franchise.

The Italy campaign is great (I haven't played the other campaign yet), the skirmish and units available are brilliant.

I'm 45 and die hard CoH player (not multiplayer because people are idiots) since the first one was released and I wholeheartedly recommend this game if you liked either of the first two or want to play probably the best WW2 RTS games out there.

I'm usually the first person to read the negative reviews before deciding on a game and I've recently got Reddit for my phone and holy s*(! what a mistake I've made by basing my game purchases based off steam reviews. The whinging on Reddit has really opened my eyes to the tiny things that people will give a negative review about.

A vocal minority who pretty much can't be pleased (devs being damned if they do, damned if they don't type scenario) are trashing this game over small annoyances that are constantly being fixed and updated.

The game is not yet polished, but the updates and fixes are coming frequently.   This is good.   

The Italian campaign was better than the boring CoH2 strategy map.  So far the North Africa campaign plays much like the CoH1 single player games.  So it is good to see they are putting some effort into Single Player.  Or as I would call it - the Tutorial. 

What I am liking most is the new engine.  Smashing through more of the buildings on the battlefield is enjoyable. I think there will be a lot to like as map and mod designers get used to the new system.

Which is how it should be. People just don't seem to understand that COH1 and COH2 have been out for 10+ years now, they love to compare it to the END product after 10 years but fail to see where those games started.

Just like those games, this game will be great. People are now complaining about Allies being to strong are the typical players that only played germans because they were to strong, now they got nerfed and don't like the game anymore for that reason.

Meanwhile the only big thing in the patch notes is increased manpower needed for the germans. US forces got a few buffs for infantry because they were simply put, bad. With the game being played more over time, the developers receive more feedback and can balance the game fairly.

Never crashed for me with a decent PC.

Conclusion

Is the game worth the €60,- ? No, not at this time, 

Are the Graphics bad? They're fine, I like to spend my time trying to win instead of looking at trees.

Sound Quality? During the First pre-alpha. The sound was amazing and felt like you were on the battlefield, the next playtest this was no longer the case, they changed something and yes there is definitely room for improvement

1.) No replay function. COH1 and COH2 had this simple feature at launch. For some reason, this basic feature is absent from the game and no ETA when it will arrive.

2.) Game's team colors are a mess. Before in COH2, the colors were self explanatory where bluish colors are your allies and redish colors are your enemies. In COH3, team colors are all over the place. Now the team colors are just random colors and it's difficult to tell who your allies are in game.

3.) If you click on a unit, you can't even check whose units they are. Just a complete blank to who they belong to. This feature was a basic feature in previous COHs.

4.) No progression system and store. In COH2 you had an unlock system where you can potentially unlock more skins and items by playing the game. In COH3, this is completely absent with no ETA as well.

However, the gameplay is still fantastic but I can't recommend COH3 right now with all these missing basic features. Maybe give it a few months to a year and check back if they polish this game",1678170051,1678173498,False,8,0,0.513809502124786377,0,True,False,False

 In a basic level, everything feels more simple and friendly for new comers which, is not bad if it was your first game or a new franchise, but for a CoH enjoyer it can hit really hard on your perspective on the game. The resources are limited, the voice lines feel less intense compared to previous ones, the cover mechanics got simplify to the point you can't choose if you want to vault or not, the tanks explode in the same way all of them and in the battleground just look ""meh"", is really hard to difference the teams and not even mention how buggy everything is and IA behave

 There is a lot of things on this game that got added, but there are so many others that got removed and need a lot of work on top of it to make it more enjoyable. It also need a lot of more time to fix all the mistakes that it came with since they already have 5 to 6 hotfix on basic things that didn't supposed to be a problem for the 3rd installment
 This exact same thing happen to the second one where it was a buggy mess, but at least the mechanics and looking of it was a little more enjoyable, but that is something it won't be changed in here since all the textures feel less busy and more cartoony to call it in a way

 Is hard to pic a side, because is not a horrible experience, but definitely having ""more factions to choose"" is just a bad excuse a lot of people are using to justify the bad lunch of the game. This is not their first game, even worst, is not the first RTS type of game. Having 4 factions from lunch should be normal having in mind they also got released in previous games or mods already made them
 The game is a meh. Play the second one if you want a good one or the first if you want an amazing campaign, but guess what, they never fixed all the bugs the second one had, so that's why I can't even imagine if they are ever going to fix this one entirely",1678168547,1678168547,False,6,1,0.525162339210510254,0,True,False,False

My thing is editing or creating bottleneck / chokepoint maps with slight unfair advantage: with 2 of 3 victory points on my side of a chokepoint so as to force an enemy AI into continuous attempts at pushing through.

It's twice as infuriating when it happens to a beloved and long running series such as CoH. I've been a fan since the very release of CoH 1, absolutely loved that game and wasn't even mad when everyone else was losing their minds when CoH 2 released ""half-baked"". Compare it to this janky mess at release and it ran like a dream. Well, let's kick this off.

[b] New mechanics and game modes [/b]

Tactical pause is a new addition to the game, and may even be a useful feature one day, when it starts making sense. You can pause the game and queue up orders to execute them in sequence. This sounds great in theory, but is incredibly frustrating and counter-intuitive in practice. Example: my vehicle runs into AT fire, I pause the game to give it a reverse order and then click to exit. Suddenly, I have given my unit 3-4 reverse orders, and my unit starts waltzing around, so I have to enter pause again to fix the mess. Example 2: infantry is in a mid-range skirmish with other infantry. I pause and give out an order to throw a grenade and exit. It doesn't happen. Why? Because in the parallel world of queued orders, my infantry have an automatically added attack order and will only throw grenades after the attack order is executed, i.e. when the other unit IS DEAD. And if that wasn't enough, sometimes the orders given, especially ability-related just never happen. You just have to try again until they do. TLDR, you will much more likely lose time fixing up the mess that happens in tactical pause than have a proper order sequence executed for better coordination.

The new dynamic campaign is the only feature I can say I liked in its entirety. It feels like a natural evolution of CoH 2's theaters and the Ardennes Assault campaign. It feels good to command your armies on a strategic level as well as have them fight out skirmishes in real time, running around a grand map of Italy clearing towns and capturing ports and airfields. This campaign is much more complex and in-depth than its predecessors, there's upgrades, skill progression for each army, fortifications, even ships, aircraft and fleets. Good stuff. Dare I say, unexpectedly good.

Battlegroups. Oh man, this may be the one feature that pissed me off the most as a long time CoH player. CoH 1 had doctrines, CoH 2 had commanders and CoH 3 has battlegroups. These are ability/effect/unit call-in trees of which every faction has 3. You pick one and roll with it for the rest of the game. The idea of these is supposed to be that the abilities supplement each other and give the faction a new, specific way to play it, and this worked rather well in previous games. A basic example of how it used to work: US forces had airborne, armor and infantry companies. Infantry was focused on defense, so it gave you new and strengthened emplacements, machine gun upgrades and artillery. ALL the abilities within a specific tree were aimed towards a certain way of play. Conversely, the CoH 3 battlegroups feel mostly random, just some abilities and units sprinkled in for flavor. It's like there is no room for any creativity and innovative use of abilities. Armored groups have some lazy passives and late game special variety tanks, airborne groups have two varieties of infantry to call in and some aircraft strafing runs or rocket strikes. And... that's it. You might wonder which faction am I talking about, to which I say- all of them. They are so samey and uninspired, and to add insult to injury, they recycled not only the abilities from previous games, they even used the exact same old icons for both old and new abilities in the majority of cases.

Maps. There are few of them. Counting on the community to fix this is a di... ahem, ungentlemanly move. One might think your game was unfinished.

[b] The bad, the worse and the UI [/b]

Upon starting the game, immediately after the intro teaser, your will be ushered into the main menu of the game, and with it, the nightmare that is Company of Heroes 3 User Interface. This is your number one red flag that this game is in an obviously unfinished state and that there can not be a shadow of a doubt that this was immediately apparent to the devs, publishers, testers, QA and quite literally anyone who ever laid eyes on this game. From the main menu forward you will constantly be reminded of this fact as your eyes wander through a quagmire of broken tooltips, menus and buttons which look like someone simply pasted text in a unicolor textbox in Paint, unit veterancy markers which literally read [Tier Description], buttons which don't work, abilities which don't trigger, menus which overlap with one another, more placeholder images which obviously had some purpose in mind which was never implemented at all, button toggling which works 90% of 60% of the time... and believe you me that I could go on with this.

[b] The sound design [/b]

Another feature firmly botched within this game is the sound design, which is quite atrocious. Again, it's hard not to compare it to previous games, which created a certain darker and more serious atmosphere through music, ambience and unit quotes. In CoH 3 many weapons make this weird ""pop"" noise when firing, artillery strikes are either strangely muted or make this strange, shrill noise instead of a booming impact they rightly had in previous games. Units scream over one another or over their own voices, and the voice acting, which was stellar in CoH 1 and at least decent in CoH 2 is now significantly worse with units, instead of sounding realistic, sound comical at the best of times. The worst offenders are the Tiger and the Stuart.

[b] Factions [/b]

4 of them! Yay. Play all of them just once and it becomes immediately apparent that Afrikakorps is the only fully developed one while others are clones and on-the-fly mashups of their respective factions from the earlier titles. 
AK is basically Panzer Lehr/OKW but with a new flavor sans the mobile bases and with Italian units thrown in for variety since making Italy a stand alone faction took too much effort. They're fun to play and catastrophically unbalanced compared to other factions since they have strong early, mid and late game, powerful but cheap call-ins and amazing mobility. A newcomer to CoH could overpower an Expert AI without much trouble.
Wehrmacht is, well, Wehrmacht. This is the faction that changed the least since CoH 1. Concrete base buildings from CoH 1 are back, bunkers are back, and they are all around pretty strong, upholding the age-old CoH staple that the Axis must be stronger and easier to play than Allies.
The Brits are mostly the same, with the twist that they aren't as defense and artillery-oriented as they used to be. Forward posts and emplacements are mostly gone with a few exceptions, and they are much more mobile now, presumably to act as a counter to the AK, at which they obviously fail spectacularly. The new Crusader tanks are great. 
That leaves us with the US forces, which have a long time record of being my least favorite faction, and CoH 3 firmly solidifies my opinion. They are even more infantry-focused than before and their most powerful armor, the Sherman and M18 Hellcat are simply laughable late game as a jolly band of grenadiers will merrily chuck two anti tank grenades and move on to stomp out the hapless infantry, and may god help them if they ever engage an enemy mid-tier tank. They have the best variety of units and somehow the vast majority of times their meta is a rifleman spam.  I had a good laugh when I saw that Relic advertised them as ""Aggressive, Adaptable, Overwhelming"".

[b] TL;DR [/b]

I have no doubt that CoH 3 will be a great game one day, but it is decidedly not one on this day- 11 days after I paid the full price of a complete and polished AAA game, which I never would have done if not for my love of CoH and what it used to represent.

The unfortunate reality is that Company of Heroes 3 is not in a finished state. It's a large, ambitious game -- four starting factions, two campaigns, including a vast ""dynamic"" Italian campaign in an entirely new style for Relic, battlegroups that bring international allies to the core factions, and overall more abilities, units, effects and interactions than any launch product in series history. 

The cost of that ambition is a launch with unfinished assets, bugs, balance issues, and design flaws. 

I recommend the game because you can pick it up and have fun today. Since launch I've been playing the campaigns, skirmish, and multiplayer, and having a blast. This is an intricate, nail-biting strategy game that can turn on a dime. It can be a laugh riot in a group or a brain-burning duel in 1v1.

First of all i didnt try yet multiplayer at all pased all SP stuff.

1.Good stuff
- I liked the totalwar style map campagin for Allies.
-unit progresion unlocks skils etc. but could be more fleshed out
-customm missions at towns
2. So so stuff
-campagin fellt medicore at best.
-You fell console port
3. Bad stuff
-Didnt use and taken advatage of totalwar style campagin at all
( mostly useless defense points  and airfields that do nothing and just clober map could be much more deadly
and usefull.
enemy units not much agressive due to poor ai on map didnt felt threthend.)
-last mission is a joke should feel epic but it didnt.
-to short.
-few bugs
-terible UI
-silly unit cap on misions and campagin
-fells like a cheap console port  and not gritty old CoH games 
-overal poor design with only few good points that wasent developed for its full potential 
-feels rushed

The Music, Audio, Faction design, Faction icons and things as simple as color coordination for team battles are terrible and unfinished. Many of the game icons are simply reused assets from COH 2 or 1, some of which are super low res in game because they've just been ported in. The faction design is abysmal, the icons are super low effort, being able to be created in 5 minutes with little to no photoshop skills. The main menu is super ugly, so is the map previewer for the steam workshop. For a full $60 game I am very disappointed in how low effort most of the game is. The voice lines during combat are so limited you can hear everything a unit has to say in 1 match. I would've liked to see an Italian faction with the Afrika Corps instead of mixing them both into 1 faction which is weird and doesn't make sense. Idk if its the lighting or not but it looks really washed out and can be difficult to tell where your units are. There are balancing issues, not as severe as the older games at launch but are still present. The sound effects are a joke, instead of a tank cannon firing, it sounds like a grenade. Machine guns are pitiful at both suppressing anything and sound design. Where are the audio engineers on this project? Coh 1 mods have better audio and they were made 8+ years ago. You can't change anything about your profile because the MM ui isn't done yet. They already have a store tab for some reason, it doesn't even work. This game is in an Alpha state and I can't recommend it at this point.

You have a team of about 200 people whose only job for the last 5 years was to recreate Company of Heroes 1. Really? Is this the product of 200 people?

How in the world did you manage to have such a lackluster release? You have no leaderboard, no ranked matchmaking at launch, the balance is all whack (Gustari, flak deployments), you have a terrible campaign (where you couldn't even use historical names like Patton), and less than 20 maps (COH launched with 30+). No post-game chat, no replays, tanks don't follow commands fluidly, tanks don't run over infantry, and your UI is objectively (not subjectively) terrible design all around (e.g., resource counters not next to the minimap???). Did anyone there bother playing or taking notes from the first game?

None of the balance changes were implemented since the Alpha last year. Your team breakdowns are as followed according to the credits:

30+ Artists
38+ Designers
15+ Producers
39+ Programmers
15+ QA

Someone explain what exactly people were doing? Playing League all day in the office??? Fire all of your designers now and cut your production team in half.

I’m a longtime COH player. I got into the original game by playing a demo off a PC Gamer CD back in 2006 or 7. I mostly play 2v2 multiplayer with a friend. I played COH2 to the day before the COH3 release.

New Gameplay Elements I’m Enjoying:
[list]
[*]Gameplay and stability. The game feels snappy and responsive. The engine runs very smoothly compared to COH2. I haven’t had a single game breaking bug yet.

[*]Multiplayer pacing. The combat and Time to Kill has been slowed down, this draws firefights out to last a little longer, which in turn emphasizes tactical positioning and maneuvering. To me, this is what COH is all about: using the dynamic world as cover, reading the map, and utilizing unit abilities to outmaneuver your opponent. In COH2, the TTK was so short that it rewarded cheap gameplay (infantry blobs) that essentially negated the unique gameplay of COH and made it just like any other RTS.

[*]Light Vehicles: The longevity of light vehicles has been tweaked to give them staying power. The light vehicle phase now lasts from early game to late game which adds a lot of variety to multiplayer matches. 

[*]Battlegroup Trees: The commanders from COH2 are removed for choice driven branching upgrades that allow for a lot of player customizations during the match. You can actually switch tactics on the fly instead of being locked into the build you’ve chosen. Each faction has 3 Battlegroups with more apparently on the way.
[/list]


Overall this makes multiplayer matches very dynamic and exciting. The maps often change hands multiple times and it’s common for losing players to make a comeback using clever tactics.

Gone from COH2 are the tanks with paper thin armor, TTK that’s too fast to react to, and frustrating RNG mechanics. These are all welcome omissions in my opinion. I simply find COH3 more fun than COH2, even when I’m losing.

A few other things:
[list]
[*]I can’t comment on the single player campaign and AI. I don’t play single player. The game has only ever appealed to me as a multiplayer game. It does this brilliantly.

[*]The graphics look great to me. The debate about the graphics seems largely subjective and more about a new color palette than fidelity (colorful, sunny mediterranean theater vs cold, drab eastern front.)

[*]I think the sound is fine and seems like another subjective debate. The developers have chosen realistic combat sounds over the exaggerated explosion sounds of a Hollywood war movie. Whether you like this or not is going to be up to you.

[*]At the moment there are some absurdly overpowered units that make for some cheese tactics. Emplacements are near impossible to destroy. We’ll see many balance patches soon, just like we saw balance patches with the two previous games. An RTS this complex and nuanced isn’t going to nail it on the first go round.

[*]There are things that need to be fixed/added/improved: the camera should be able to zoom out a little more, the UI isn’t the most elegant, there isn’t a ranked ladder yet, and there is a placeholder for the store. These are issues I barely care about. I like playing the game.
[/list]

Company of Heroes 3 is mad fun. There are some features that are missing and some QOL improvements that will be fixed with time. I enjoy the improvements to the gameplay, four unique factions with many options to customize them, the change in pacing to combat, the new maps and setting, and the graphics. I’ve had more fun playing COH3 in the last week than I have had playing COH2 over the last 10 years. That’s saying something.",1678076448,1678076903,True,2,0,0.502170205116271973,0,True,False,False

The single player campaign and gameplay experience has been good. I give that a thumbs up and if you don't care about multiplayer then you would probably enjoy the game.
However...if you get it hoping for a great multiplayer experience (like I did), you will probably be disappointed. In the 20 or so matches I have played so far I have yet to experience anywhere near a close/balanced match.  Seems that one side/team usually dominates the other.  I feel like there are aspects in the game that would help or just be fun to use (like a variety of units and abilities) but there is hardly enough time or enough resources to use them all.  Or if you do have the resources it is probably because you are winning and the other team doesn't stand a chance.  Also it seems like they set things up to be able to customize skins and battlegroup abilities but there is nothing more there to currently choose from. Probably if you pay for future DLC? I remember reading an article about how they spent so much effort looking at real footage and going to locations in Italy so they can get the colors and contours of the maps just right. Maybe that's great for the singleplayer experience but they should have spent hardly any time on that nonsense and should have actually included content (more skins, banners, battlegroup abilities, ranked/unranked, faction imbalances addressed, etc.) that would have made the included multiplayer experience feel more worthy of the $60 spent on it.

I'll probably finish the single player campaign (eventually) but sadly I have already lost interest in the multiplayer experience.

I have played both Company of Heroes 1 and 2 for far too many years.  Sadly, I don't own 1 on steam, but I do own 2 and... If you saw my hours on CoH2;  You'll know:  I absolutely love this franchise.  

The latest installment is pretty good.  I only had a few crashes in my 7 and a half hours or so, so, I assume they'll be fixed, Right Relic & Sega?

Considering the last real games we got from Relic Entertainment was the shitshow Dawn of War III and the okayish Age of Empires IV, CoH3 is good.  This game was probably better than I was expecting tbh.  Especially the Italy campaign.  It reminds me a lot of Civilization, but with Real Time Tactics [sort of like Age of Wonders, but its not turn based like in the Age of Wonders franchise, so, essentially Age of Wonders but with real time tactics roflmao.  That's not even scratching the surface on the skirmish and the the plethora of mods to come.

I played the Multiplayer Beta Test so i'ma assume its more or less the same, I really don't need to talk about that here but whatever, already typed to this point:  I hate people and I suck at online games okay?  So, lets just move on.

Sound design is good:  You didn't really blow out my eardrums in the intro like nearly every other person so.. Thank you.

the guns go pew pew and the tanks go pow pow, what more do you expect?

It's really fun.  If you have played the Company of Heroes franchise and are looking for something fresh to the series?  This could be it.  Hell, you can FINALLY VAULT AUTOMATICALLY.  IT'S A GODSEND FOR FLANKING THANK YOU SO MUCH.  Also, YOU CAN RIDE THE TANKS.

Let me repeat.

You.

Can.

Ride.

TANKS!

Battles on area maps are set up in the traditional way and bring hardly anything new to the game concept. Voice actors appear to be okay on the Allied side, but the German comments are lacking and appear to be too theatrical. I had the option to download the German version voice acting for COH1 (from the German version) and it adds to the atmosphere. Being interested in history, both currently available campaigns (Afrikakorps as a linear campaign and Italy playing as Allies on a strategic level) try a little too hard to be politically correct, which really does not add to the game concept. Owners of the game will most likely understand the topics I am referring to.

On the positive side, the main change is being able to play on a strategic map (Italy - currently only as Allies) and decide on how to proceed. Events on the strategic map are scripted (which is somewhat understandable), but the payer can decide how to move forward. The game adds also the idea of naval and air support and logistics, which is refreshing. Towns and settlements provide support once captured with a variety of effects depending on classification as supply hub, resistance town, seaport, airfield, etc.
In the strategic game mode, improvements to units in the fields have been expanded and have a longer lasting effect. Some units have to be unlocked, experience can be boosted, or support capabilities can be added. This is done with experience points, which have to be gained by winning battles. The improvements are active for the rest of the strategic campaign.

Multiplayer events, are still limited to area map battles, so nothing new there. Although unlikely in my personal opinion to be included in a future version, I would be thrilled if the strategic concept would be expanded to multiplayer, whether co-op or against each other.
My feeling at this point is that new factions (Italians is an obvious one, but also additional Allies) will be introduced, together with new maps, equipment layouts, etc.

Overall, the game has been expanded in a good way, so is not a plain sequel with the same theme. Long term, there is room for improvement.",1678066132,1678066416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lets just start with the obvious, they released a beta game.
The fact that it doesn't have REPLAYS blows me away. You loose and you can't check what you did wrong.
Campaigns are very buggy.

The entire game is very unbalanced. It consists on the spamm and abuse of a few very overpowered units.
Very few maps. Playing vs CPU gets boring quick as CPU is pretty dumb and doesn't use units properly. You cant choose difficulty CO-OP vs CPU and it never starts as expert difficulty. At top difficulty CPU simply drives you crazy capping and moving out of the fog of war, but ultimately offers no challenge.
Multiplayer its always the same and it doesn't matter you win or loose, you just will be happy that it ended. Its not enjoyable at all.

It is a very fresh and new way of playing a campaign. The Italian campaign is a little difficult to understand at first but after about an hour of playing it, I mostly understood everything. The North African Campaign is a lot like older games' campaigns where it is a very linear story and you dont stray from it. 

Both campaigns have their flaws, but they are both outweighed by their pros. Personally, i liked the Italian Campaign more because it felt like there was more to do. Without spoilers, there is a lot (like over 40 im guessing) more chances of rts battles in skirmishes and missions combined. I will definitely be replaying this campaign again soon. 

As for multiplayer, I've never played multi in the previous partially because i bought the game years after release and I don't necessarily enjoy rts multiplayer modes in general. Singleplayer skirmishes are where i spent most of my time and everything runs moderately smooth. 

All in all, nothing is perfect, but that adds to the charm. A solid 8.5/10 for me (not including multi because, as i said, i dont play a lot of it).",1678048919,1678048919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

5) UI and menus are basic, but functional

1) unpolished sound design - inconsistent sound (some distant sounds seem louder than close battle sounds. Some higher caliber cannon or tank shots seem to be too quiet or sound weak).
2) some broken animations - heavy mg gunners hands don't align with the weapon when firing in extreme angles, no box change animations for hmgs, vaulting animations sometimes broken.
3) some explosion effects are lackluster (like mortar rounds exploding almost invisible on high graphic settings) which even might negatively effect gameplay.

I do not typically review games but the controversy of this release, my feelings about the RTS genre as a whole, and my desire for the community and developer to refine COH3 all combined push me to say a few things.

The Campaign is underwhelming, it was released with numerous glitches and poorly layered triggers that made it possible to completely stall the progression of the campaign at Salerno. The very first Campaign mission area had three separate ways for me to break the game, and require a complete restart of the campaign each time. I threw in the towel on enjoying the dynamic over-map system vs real time battles, because clearly it wasn't ready yet.

New patches have fixed some of the issues I experienced, which is why overall I feel I can recommend the game as an experience, but I refuse to recommend it without explaining that the state of the game today is frankly embarrassing.

The Automatch is released without any clear ranking system within the game, has no Map Pool Veto, creates a replay file but lacks any proper replay saving or analysis in game, and perhaps most egregious of all there is no live in-game observer mode.

Both Axis and Allies have powerful and nearly game-breaking abilities from my personal experience, in general though I feel that players of similar skill level are able to play out an intense, dogged, and absolutely lethal maneuvers. Tanks in general feel responsive and lighter vehicles feel appropriate nimble by comparison. Infantry has fewer ways to cripple a vehicle, but rifle fire is marginally effective against most light vehicles. Squads move through the terrain with more intelligence than in COH2. The command choices and point trees are a refreshing level of flexibility coming from COH2. The tech upgrades provide timings for attacks with new improvements to throw off prepared enemy defenses and counters, and I never had a game where I felt like I was incapable of producing a force that could provide some counter to even the toughest enemy composition.

There are numerous active abilities that are covered or removed from units after upgrades or veteran levels, which is a baffling and incredibly costly situation. Imagine not being able to deploy smoke launchers or use a special ability on a Panzer as DAK because you decide you also wanted vehicles who could cap. (The cap passive ability icon replaces active ability icons on several DAK units, I have found through painful trials.) 

Instances like the former show a game with potential to balance, refine, and polish each of the four factions into an even more enjoyable state. The fun of the game is let down by seeing the obvious points where lack of care or time led to a complete destruction of the quality control.

Despite all the issues I have encountered, over 20 hours of solo automatch games, I have had three epic hour long knock-down drag out games that I came out of feeling like I had just experience the real vision of the developers, despite the complete lack of polish the game suffers.

In conclusion, if you are the kind of person who can suffer the failures of others and see through to the quality RTS they've created underneath, buy this. If you aren't, wait for the community to fix everything ourselves, and buy the game for 5 dollars in three years when the developer abandon it entirely.

TRUE there is nothing revolutionary here at all put the core CoH gameplay loop is there and strong as ever with some super nice quality of life additions (particularly auto reinforce and valuting) making this I think the CoH titles I would recommend to those who have never played before. 

Those coming from 1000s of hours in CoH1&2 are 100% going to find things to complain about but IMO that's more due to time spent with those titles coupled with the time Relic has had to patch and balance them out.

Wait for a steep price drop if you are interested in this genre, otherwise avoid this game.

Pro: 
+Big and complex campaign, new factions, new theatres of war
+New combat mechanics, like towing, automatic reinforce, retreat to capture points
+New voice quips, some hilarious, some just hammy
+Map elevation is now affecting combat much more pronounced

Missed opportunities:
The strategic overlay has so much potential to become an interesting meta game, but in it's current form it barely functions. The narrative is just a pile of really awkward war clichés, the main characters are literally caricatures of tv tropes. I know the Russian campaign is controversial, but it was trying to show actual themes and events, and portray the mind-boggling brutality of that front. Here the presence and politics of Italy is reduced to a weird accent. The art style trying to replicate the loose skethcyness of the first game, but falls short.

Cons:
-The game is just clunky. You can never be sure your units actually start to perform the command you gave them. Any selection feels uncertain, there is just no weight to the UI. Units do not snap to cover, the just jump over fences back and forth.
-The dramatic overpowering soundfx of CoH fame is gone - most of it is just mechanic noise now, machineguns sound like typewriters, frantic combat is just a jumble of noise now instead of the very informative sound reports of serious shots, damage, suppressed infantry, etc. Given how much they just lifted from CoH2 there are many inexplicably missing vfx, for example cutting barbed wire is now an action performed in complete silence.
-Combat feels inconsequential: very hard to lose a unit and if you do, it barely registers as a loss, you can just make 10 other like it - the careful unit management and positioning of the older titles are gone - or you can still do it just makes no difference, it plays more like AoE
-The Ai is outright passive, it just makes a feeble attempt to capture a couple of territories before the ticker runs out, you won
-The UI... erf. My pet peeve is so many of the icons just recycled from the previous game to mean something else in this game, weapon models representing other weapons, russian unit icons reused as functions; it's just a mess. If you haven't seen the previous games, I guess it's fine, just a bit haphazard.

If that wasn't enough you also get:

-Two Campaigns. One Linear, one Total War-lite campaign.
-Four factions (skirmish and multiplayer).

More than CoH1 and CoH2 on both accounts. This game is in a much better state than when the other two games launched.

The Italian maps are quite something. The height diversity (yes, height actually matters now), the cities, and especially the foliage are just so much better than previous maps. You really have to have some rose tinted goggles on to believe the graphics are actually bad in this game. They aren't the end all/be all of graphics but the game doesn't deserve a roasting for it.

I would wholeheartedly recommend COH3, despite some bugs along with somewhat rough launch state, it still offers something for everyone, whether you are campaign enjoyer, or comp stomp enthusiast or pvp is your life, you'll most likely have an enjoyable time. Worth the full price and the time you'll most likely invest in it. However if you MUST have a bug free experience, or don't wish to spend full price for whatever reason, wait for sale. 

Long Boring Blah Blah Review
COH3 is the third entry to a franchise I have been playing and loving for 15 some years now, despite a somewhat rough launch state, I can forsee this game easily replacing COH1 as my favourite of the 3. But as of now it places just right behind it. 

SP Campaigns: 7.5/10
I have a beaten the Italian campaign, but it has been quite enjoyable with it's more open ended story. A big improvement over AA from COH2. 
- The letters of soldiers to and from home during loading screens is a very nice touch.
- Scripted battles are as fantastic as ever, while the skirmishes feel very samey quickly. 
- Enemy AI is a bit back and forth on its reactions to me in the campaign map, thou I am only playing it currently on Hard. 
- Enemy turns are boring to watch rather quickly. 
- Interested in seeing how they expand this portion of the game. (Updates, fixes, expansions, etc...)

The North African campaign, on the other hand was a let down for me.
- Really short, finished completely in just a few hours, it's saving grace is the battles themselves which are quite enjoyable.
- Story was bland and I was actively skipping the cut scenes after the first 2 missions, just couldn't get invested. 

COOP AI / Custom Battles: 10/10
After beating the campaigns this will be a huge chunk of your playtime. 
- Maps are absolutely fantastic, the map pool at launch may not be overly large but every map feels really well made and I've enjoyed playing on all of them.
- AI has received and upgrade and feel more challenging to play against.
- Fantastic way to learn to battle groups, tactics, without the stress of PVP. 
- Great way to chill with friends if you want to play more casually and just mess around.
- Mods! Mods! Mods! 

PVP: 10/10 
If messing around and fighting AI isn't your cup of tea. This is where your massive hour count will come from.
- Great maps as listed above.
- Balanced and Unbalanced as it should be.

Graphics: 7/10
While not breaking any boundaries or winning best looking game of the year. I believe the graphics are a good overall improvement over the prior games. 
- Assets overall looking a lot sharper and cleaner. (less blocky/chunky)
- Buildings break apart with satisfying energy.
- Unit and vehicle animations look more natural / smoother. 
- Colour palette befitting the Mediterranean and North Africa theatres rather nicely. 
- Vehicles getting ""battle scared"" over the course of the battle is fantastic. 
I would like to note thou that there are some rough spots currently. 
- Some animations can look a bit scuffed. 
- Vehicles sometimes micro bouncing / jittering on the ground. 
- Some textures appearing rather muddy and of low quality, even on high texture settings. 
(These last 3 I expect to be changed and improved over time, but still mentioning)

Performance: 9/10
Runs extremely well and smooth, no shader stutters (hooorah!), no FPS dropping off to shit when a large 4v4 battle is taking place. Really pleased with the games optimization.
- Took 1 point off because the graphics menu is a touch lacking, While most modern pc's prob won't need to do much tweaking, having more control over your settings would be nice, and for people with lower end machines, more options to tweak to hit their desired frame rate. 

Audio: 6.5/10
I am rather quite torn on the audio for COH3, some of it is fantastic, some of it's awful. As time goes on thou I can assume this will all get improved. 
- Unit dialogue is as mint as ever. Even changing pitch and volume pending on if they get into a building or vehicle.
- Buildings when on lower health have great sounding creaks and moans as they strain to stay up.
- Vehicle engine/gearing is well detailed although varying in volume. 
- Vehicles crushing gravel, dirt, etc... under itself feels very... crunchy! No complaints.
- Some explosions have an excellent impact and fullness, while other explosions sound muted and thin.
- Gun fire is all over the place, sometimes they have an excellent crack, rattle, bang, etc.... other times it sounds like they are afraid to make noise. 

Modding: 10/10
Do I really have to make any points aside from mentioning it's available for the game lol.  

Some odds and ends that don't quite fit anywhere else, and possibly answering a few questions perhaps. 
- Tactical Pause / WASD camera movements are nice additions, may not use em myself but glad to see more options for everyone. 
- No player account progression YET (not talking ranks, but overall levels (Private, Sergeant, Major, etc...) not a big deal, as I assume it's coming with the full start of seasons and such. 
- Achievements, wasn't expecting the insanity of 2, and while not achievement hunter personally, I felt the current 24 is way to low, it was nice to see milestone achievements pop up in COH2. Hopefully more will be added as the game ages on. 
- Can't see player names when you click on their units. 
- In both coop/pvp you don't always start besides your friends when matched up together, not a deal breaker for me, as me and my friends just strategize differently, but I know for some this is a huge deal breaker. 
- I actually really enjoy the plain and simple menu, liking the postcard effect it has. I really hated the bloated and laggy feeling of COH2s menu. 

Overall, COH3 is a 8/10 for me and I am excited for the future of the game going forward, and will probably log hundreds if not thousands of hours into this entry as well.",1677318175,1677994533,True,75,9,0.592695891857147217,0,True,False,False

Literally the same as part 2 and 1, just looks nice, has some 1942 vehicles and stuff - I appreciate WW2 so I'm probably being a bit nicer about it. New civilization style macro map, but leaves a lot to be desired. Where's the air force? Where's the air combat? Where's the naval combat?

The differences in vehicles has gotten worse, not better. It's less historical. Killing a Panther tank is easy - to make my point soundly:

There was no western tank, American or British, that could destroy a Panther tank. You can even find war footage of a Pershing heavy tank hitting a Panther on the side. It did not blow up. The people inside didn't die. They got out.

On the other side? The Sherman and Cromwell tanks were one hit kills. They were called Tommy cookers by the German soldiers.

Now I get it too, it's a game, it's gotta be something somewhat playable. Get that!

However, this is what? 15 years after the first one? And it has in NO WAY advanced. It's exactly the same. Just like those EA games, just like everything else, it's exactly the same. Just a new paintjob, some new little toys.

But, like I said, I do get it. Some folk like the RTS strategy games.

But is this game really worth 60 bucks? No.

You're kidding me, you're full of it developers and you know it. It's incomplete ontop of it, but I don't blame you for how the market is, do what you gotta do to survive. I don't blame about the bugs either, familiar bugs when the first 2 game out all that time ago(ie, shooting the tank in the front - 'rear hit').

But this is not a game that's worth 60 dollars. It's a 30 rehashed old school game, identical UI, identical interface, still can't zoom out, still a dumb unit cap(it's called WORLD war 2), it's still the same dumb stuff, but more watered down. Made more 'fair'. It's not supposed to be fair! The old games had differences(that I'm sure the silly complained about). A Bazooka is in NO WAY equal to a Panzershrek. But the Germans could not match the West's numbers.

The German armed forces were pound for pound vastly superior. It's not supposed to be fair. But go ahead, make your dumb game for dumb people.

It's not worth 60. Wait until it's 20. It's a new graphiced up version of the same old game. Some new content, sure, a campaign that's more player driven. Cool stuff. But leaves a lot to be desired.

Not worth 60. In no way next gen. Same old, same old. I got it cause a friend did, would play it again, especially when the shared resources coop type gameplay comes out(we're more sim guys, dcs, air combat, do this as a change).

Still not worth 60.",1677993516,1677993516,False,1,1,0.436507910490036011,0,True,False,False

- This doesn´t feel like a finished product. The sound levels are way off, mortar impacts cant be heard at all, and the same goes for the machine guns. 
- Lack of experience system. Why can´t I advance up in rank to earn points? 
- No ""in game shop"" ? The button ""Store"" is greyed out for me. Is that supposed to be launched later?
- Some units feel too weak. The armored units especially, maybe this is just something I gotta get used to.
- The voice acting isnt as good as in the second game, it just feels … off. 
- Lack of customization. I dont feel like I can do much to change the look and feel at the moment.

Relic, come on… you cant launch a game in this state and expect to be paid 60 euro.

UPDATE: I have put around 9 more hours into the game, and experienced 3 hotfixes. The audio issues seem fixed for me now, kinda... except too low volume on mortars etc. The gameplay is good, the matches are more challenging compared to coh2, and the AI seems to work decent for some really engaging battles. 

I still think the game is in like a early access stage and not polished enough. They should have waited for at least another month before releasing it. Maybe in a few months it will be playable, i hope. It has good potential, just a damn shame that it released like this.

The Italy campaign got stale far to quick, the missions were good but the random skirmish's you HAD to play were so boring and unwanted. the clunky Enemy turns where the game sits still while a stuka does a circle in the middle of your screen FOR 30 seconds.

The one thing that worried me the most was the optimization because COH2 had really bad optimization. But the optimization in this game is actually good! SO I'm happy with that. 

The Wehrmacht is my favorite faction, so far. They are easy to use and they remind me of the Wehrmacht from COH2. The Panzergrenadiers are bullet eating machines!

Americans are pretty hard to learn (my opinion). There are a lot of buildings, so learning a build order might take some time. 

The British are pretty easy to use, as well. They are less complicated than the Americans.

Multiplayer is fun and engaging, with all the factions seeming to have a good chance at winning.

However, there are certainly some concerns with the game that others have that I fully understand. The menus and friends list are clearly designed for consoles and the lack of a replay system is very disappointing.

Unlike for many others, I actually sit through and waited for the first hotfixes and played through both the Italy campaign and the Africa operations before posting a review, which ultimately influenced my opinion both ways.

The Africa operation is traditional CoH campaigning. The setting's perspective is juxtaposed by the point of view on the story being disconnected from the gameplay, where the Afrika Korps takes the stage under Rommel, who serves as playable antagonist here. The only shortcoming of Africa operation was, well, that it's little on the short side. As such the Africa operation and the skirmish and multiplayer gameplay are probably where the game's at its best, even if many multiplayer features like replays are still missing. At least there's some Workshop support in place.

The Italy campaign on the other hand starts slow, paces up a little bit, and then just self-destructs towards the end. As far as gameplay mechanics go, it's robust enough, if little too easy, but the presentation and polish you'd expect from a AAA budget game is nonexistent. It's safe to consider the Italy campaign something like early alpha. The visuals, animations, and general user experience are that bad, and the whole ""campaign map"" aspect is probably the worst of its kind I've seen. But ultimately the missions and dynamic skirmish battles were very fun. The actual gameplay is sound, it's the icing on top that's really rotten in comparison. Overall I don't think that is the way CoH is supposed to head to. The dynamic features like company choice and customization are great, just stick that to linear campaigns with robust missions and gameplay.

On the other, Relic just doesn't learn from their mistakes, it was the same with every other of their previous major products: CoH2, DOW3, AOE4 - the game just lacks polish.

Yeah, the sound quality really could use an overhaul, because it surely isn't as cinematic as the previous versions (explosions and gunfire have virtually no bass), but I'm not seeing THAT many negatives.

I don't have any gripes with the model graphics, they look roughly as good as, if not slightly better CoH2 on high (don't have the GPU for ultra), the UI while not necessarily being an improvement isn't as basic as everyone seems to think, I can circumvent the camera zoom issue with one of the tuning mods like Spearhead III, and the and AI feels roughly the same as before.

All in all, I mean it doesn't feel like it necessarily brings THAT much of a new experience (at least at the point of launch), but it's still an enjoyable CoH experience that manages to mix in a few new little neat aspects (the big ones being gun towing and high ground bonuses), at the expense of a few previous ones (Either I'm doing it wrong, or you can't deploy forward bases in buildings, not every faction gets building or air-deployed units, to name a few that bugged me the most)

I have almost 1000 hours of time into COH2 alone. I was very excited to buy COH3 when it came out. I was hoping for a few like upgrades to the graphics and taking advantage of modern hardware to get a smoother experiance. Being able to zoom out more, and a new set of factions with new and exciting special abilities to make it feel like its not just a update to COH2. 

Generall I got several things I wanted but not all. The graphics look a bit better, They have new factions and a interesting update to way the campain plays. 

Here is my issue, The game doesn't feel finished. I've had several instablility issues, lots of textures not loading properly / flickering oddly, stuff like that,  There aren't very many maps. Its crazy to me that almost every skirmish on the campain plays out on the same map, (really? they couldn't have done more than 1? especally when the games requires so many skirmishes.)  Lastly FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD PLEASE LET ME ZOOM OUT! Its cool to zome in and watch a soilder cock his gun and fire, but the standard zoom creates tunnel vision and I end up missing critical information at that distance. COH2 had a zoom mod that made the multiplayer perfect, but it only worked in multiplayer, Why limit the Zoom? 30-50% more zoom out would be great thanks.
I also lost my save after about 8 hr into the campain so theres that, Although I think thats more of a steam cloud sync issue. Uploading a new game file over my origional one. 

To be fair I believe that these issues will get ironed out, CoH2 was well supported and The guys are Relic seem to genuinely want to put out a good product. I bought the Premium editioin knowing that there is issue because I want to support them as a studio, but I can't reccomed this game in its current state to people how are fan boys like myself.",1677962521,1677962521,False,2,0,0.510258734226226807,0,True,False,False

Nostalgia is what comes to mind for CoH.

I'm confused. 

Is this a cash grab game...? a failure like CoH2.... Or will it live up to the potential of CoH1, I really hope it is the latter.

The basics of CoH are still here, and the game's multiplayer mode has improved in total. Relic is stepping in the right direction with the changes, but sadly the execution hasn't reached the same level to surpass CoH2's polish. This is good and bad. 

If you're okay with placeholder assets, a UX/UI experience that needs improvement, and early game balancing shenanigans, you will have fun in multiplayer. Adjusting from CoH2 was initially a shock, but now it's hardly a problem.

If you want a single-player experience, mods, comp-stop, or enjoy the game very casually, it's a roll of the dice if you'll like it. These are the areas where the core experience is lacking. The campaign has the potential to be like Total War, but it currently needs to be more impressive. Mods were super fun in CoH2, and there's no knowing how much modding potential this game has. Hosting lobbies is missing great features from the last game and expert bots are pretty easy for me.   

CoH3 doesn't feel complete, but it is fun. Since Relic was able to tweak the core of the game elegantly, it's a hope they'll be able to flesh out the rest of it in time.",1677955413,1677955783,True,0,0,0.490506350994110107,0,True,False,False

I've been playing COH games since day 1. This game has a bit of work to do, yes, but so do all games when they release, because what most gamers fail to realize apparently is that you can never predict what may or may not be working fully. I mean just look at the complete dumpster fire that is Call of Duty MW 2 or BF 2042. But as far as a COH game is concerned, this is the best yet as far as features added, the ability to create multiple companies that you can reinforce and keep going way easier than the American campaign of COH 2. Upgrades and unlocking units is a different style than previously but I'd say better. The addition of Naval Ships to provide additional fire support, bombers , fighters and transport aircraft to para drop your companies right on enemy cities or locations or even just move them across the battlefield easier is a great addition. As with any game, small bugs will need fixing and improvements will come as the game moves along, but I've played the game all the way through and completed the campaign and played multiple matches of Coop and am very satisfied with pretty much all aspects. The AI enemies even on the easiest difficulty in a bot game are still a challenge. i had a 2 on one match against an AI with a friend on easy because he's not as seasoned with COH as I am and the AI almost overran our base before we pushed them back. So its definitely a challenge and lots of fun. One negative i will say is the lack of available maps for MP/coop play. and some of them are just the same maps for 4v4 as 3v3 or 2v2, just enlarged. Adding a few more maps to play would be perfect, there's plenty to work with in the Italian and North African Campaigns of WWII that you can make more maps to play.

Fun campaign, tight gameplay, lot's of WW2 history to gush over etc. It's interesting playing this as a relative noob to CoH, as I'm not seeing many of the issues series vets are talking about. The sound bugs, for example. I experienced half a second of sound cutting out in the tutorial, that's it. Units are responsive, and abilities always activate. 

I've seen a few issues with the AI. For example, sometimes enemy vehicles will occasionally approach you in reverse, exposing their vulnerable rear, and units will sometimes make questionable decisions, like running into the blast of a grenade. 

As a big Total War fan, the Italy campaign in a nice first attempt but with a few annoyances. Not having a map (that I can find) of Italy, for example. Head scratcher, that one. I've honestly enjoyed just rolling through Italy destroying enemy companies and liberating towns, and special missions like Anzio and Monte Cassino were really fun. I don't get all the hate this campaign gets tbh. The Afrika Korps campaign, while short, was a nice treat. Just a good old fashioned CoH campaign.

There's a lot of content on offer here. 4 factions, 2 campaigns. Compare that to the other 2 games at launch, and the complaints about lack of content are pretty funny to me.

Pros:

+Mod support. Like the first two games, having mods gives the game tremendous variety and lifespan. The crazy mods for Coh2 are what kept me coming back. Seeing that mods are already in the works for this game makes me excited to see what will come out. See how creative some modders would get with combining existing assets to make “new models” is great, but I would like to see more dev tools come out to allow them to replace effects and models entirely. Could be a great step for this game.

+The game loads quickly.

+Party system for multiplayer is nice. 

+Environment / Vehicle destruction. Seeing the map go from a lovely town to a grey charred out warzone gives a nice sense of match progression. Seeing a brand-new vehicle become a max vet, battle-scared blacked death machine is cool. 

+ Line of Sight. Not having tanks or AT guns snipe through tons of obstacles or walls is great. Make sure you have cleared firing lines and allow you to better protect vehicles. 

+ The Ai is more adaptive, making use of more mines or other traps, reacting to grenades, retreating units faster or slower depending on your unit makeup.  

+Auto-vault.

+Auto-Reinforce that can be on/off.

+Weapon Firing cones on mini map.

+Base Buildings can be auto placed, or manual placed, and built from HQ directly, freeing up engineer squads.

+Unit Health and Vehicle Armor Values.

+Vehicles are cover for infantry.

+Command trees with a few options allow for a little more customization of a tree to preference. 

Neutral Opinion:

*All factions having base buildings as opposed to some having buildings and some having mobile bases that can set up around the map is interesting. Being able to set up far into a map gave great advantages if you were able to keep it alive. I imagine its more balanced having everyone require base buildings, and rely more on support vehicles like medic half-tracks and Forward supply stations for sustained pushes or defenses.  


Cons:

- Unique Team colors not assigned like-colors to the same team (Can be on a team with Blue, Yellow, Red and Purple, against a team with Light Blue, Green, Orange and Pink) Make colors like COH2 (Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, and Green vs Red, Orange, Pink, and Purple)

-Not being able to see the player’s name that owns a unit.

-Camera zoom is too close. (There is already a mod for it)

-UI not being Scalable, would help with camera zoom issue.

-Unit ranges seem too close, except for a few, like AT.

-No Maximum firing arc dotted lines for weapons, only the Solid Cone lines and the Center Dotted line. 

-Not being able to remap every command. (Retreat and Reverse are both R. In COH2 Reverse was U and Retreat was T. Being able to quickly drag select a group, hit T to immediately retreat all units, and U to reverse all vehicles is useful. Reverse overrides Retreat if you have both infantry and vehicles, so avoiding support call outs can be more difficult if you don’t group your units 0-9.)

-Sound Effects need to be overhauled. The sound effects in this game are not as good as the effects from COH1 or COH2. They may be of higher fidelity, but the depth and variety are severely reduced. Infantry weapons are louder than most other support or vehicle weapons. Mortars sound like they only shoot smoke shells. The Sniper and other long range units are pretty loud.

Overall Experience:

It could have had a much worse launch, but an average launch in today's market means ""Come back when we had enough time to have massive play-testing and patches."" I have a lot of good things to say about this game, and some bad things. I am not recommending this game for full price. This game feels like COH 1 with a major graphics overhaul and some COH2 mechanics, a positive step in optimization and graphics, but with some stagnation in regards for what COH2 did game play-wise. Between the Dev updates and the mods, I will keep an eye on it and update this review when needed. Perhaps given a couple of months to a couple of years this game will warrant full price.

-Somewhat better graphics
-A campaign (I didn't say it was good)
-Better balanced factions (which is easy when they are roughly cookie cutter versions of one another).
-More specialization of units
-Better infantry movement
-A few fun gimmicks, like loading infantry on the back of tanks, trucks, and dragging AT.

The cons:
-No zoom out
-Artillery is a joke, no running over infantry
-Factions lack much distinction from one another compared to previous games
-Minimal friendly fire breaks immersion, tactical sacrifice, or messing with friends

Out the gate we have four very diverse and unique factions, and they are filled to the brim with actual depth and choice. I'm 25 hours in right now and I'm still discovering new things about the US Forces alone.

The Battlegroups in CoH3 feel more reminiscent of the doctrines of CoH1 as opposed to the commanders of CoH2. The choices you make feel weighty and consequential. Choosing something will lock you out of another path, but the split-tree setup of the battlegroups means you always have two prize eggs to go after. The Battlegroups have personality and show that forethought went into them, unlike the CoH2 commanders, which often felt like piecemeal ideas and number tweaks stitched together to sell microtransactions.

Also like in CoH1, the game's pacing is even. Unlike CoH2, it's not just about late game heavy tank and artillery slogs. Intelligent and aggressive mid-game play matters. Fielding a light tank shock unit to force retreats and regain map control matters. Using barbed wire to cut off chokes, laying mines, and attacking cutoffs all matters. The resource and sector system is now back to how it was in CoH1, rewarding aggressive and risky plays to starve enemies of all the goodies they need to kill you.

In terms of presentation, the game looks good with all the settings maxed (keep in mind some of the most important settings CANNOT be tweaked during a match and must be tweaked in the main menu). Sure, it would benefit from raytracing, better ambient occlusion, and some tighter anti-aliasing. But all the unit models and cityscapes look excellent, high-rez and high-poly. Many of the uplift changes are subtle and lots of the complainers won't notice them. For example, if you tell an infantry squad to start moving one way and then abruptly make them shift to the opposite direction, you can see the soldiers' momentum and weight shift in their bodies. Every little piece of cover and every building can be destroyed in a totally bespoke fashion. It's all done with realtime physics whereas the previous games had scripted breakaway debris.

I have everything maxed out on a 3080ti, i9 10900k, 32GB RAM, Windows 11, and at the start of the match I'm getting 220ishFPS. Once more units hit the field this shifts to 160-120, and I don't know if I've ever seen the game drop under 110 or so. It's a very well-optimized release in terms of PC performance. This seems to have been a conscious decision, perhaps to orient CoH3 toward an e-sport footing, though it looks miles better than most bland, stripped-down e-sports offerings.

Admittedly, the sounds are on the whole are less bombastic than before, but they still sound excellent and realistic (I have heard it said that the first 2 games used more ""Hollywood"" sounds whereas the ones captured here are truer to the source).

Much to my surprise and delight, the voicelines of the factions HAVE PERSONALITY AGAIN. This was a huge part of CoH1's charm. You got to know the distinctive comments of the Pershing crew, the Riflemen, the Grenadiers, etc. They sounded like they were actually in a war and under stress when attacked. The Americans would make old-timey quips about how Jerry's gonna get it and Sherman crews would lament that ""this tin can's a death trap!"" IMMERSION. FUN. It was all there. The writers, voice actors, and sound engineers gave a damn.

That all went missing on a milk carton in CoH2. Maybe it was the stoic and cruel setting of the frosty Russian tundra that influenced this decision, or maybe THQ going defunct meant that the voice actors were paid with Sam's Club coupons, but the enthusiasm just was not there. It was a total phone-in, and I could not be happier that the CoH3 devs managed to rub the genie bottle one more time and recapture some of the magic that was lost for ten years.

Oh, and the online play has been smooth as butter, even though I (an American) am playing with UK teammates. Anyone who played CoH2 in the early days will remember how games would come to a screeching stutter-f*cking halt any time one player started lagging. The dreaded ""waiting for player..."" notification would appear as everyone's game froze and waited for the lagging player to resync. This no longer happens AT ALL. I've never once encountered any match latency. This is truly one of those games you can confidently play with friends in other countries without worry.

Is the game perfect? No. Still some bugs, still some stuff missing. Can't change player profile picture, replays are present but only with a command line workaround, some stats aren't showing up, there's no proper ranked automatch (even though ELO is accounted for under the hood), balance has some hiccups. But in the grand scheme of things, these are nitpicks. The devs focused on nailing the actual gameplay with the resources they had, and they achieved that.

I won't comment on the single player campaign as I really don't play single-player in RTS games except as a tutorial, and I already know how to play CoH. If you're hedging your bet on the single player campaigns, other reviewers will have more to offer you.

But what I can tell you is that if you value strategic depth, fun, immersion, and heart, this game's got it, naysayers be damned.

The new dynamic map feature is really enjoyable to explore and adds more variety to the gameplay.  Will update further once I explore more features and/or complete the Italian campaign.  Definite recommend so far; minus some minor hiccups. 

Edit:  I have completed both campaigns.  While the US/UK Italian campaign was pretty short (completed it within 4 days) I still very much enjoyed it.  There were some bugs like awkward unit movements and attempting to capture an airfield would crash the game.  Afrikakorps campaign was straight to the point with zero dynamic map interface.  Next I shall be pouring more hours into the skirmish and mp modes; alongside custom games with mods.  I hope Relic continues to squash more bugs and better optimize the game for pc as there were some hiccups with the framerate and odd audio bugs.  After everything has been said and done, COH3 is a fun little package as is and I hope the future of the title gets way more flushed out with dlcs and the modding scene!

The game has issues, but that is to be expected for a coh game at this point and it's defiantly in a better states than coh 1 or 2 at launch. 

If you are having fun playing coh1/2 rn I would wait for 3-6 months before buying this one or until it's ""fixed"" (mostly balancing issues imo). 

If you are new to coh entirely not a bad entirely point  because you can learn the game through the singleplayer which is much better this time round. 

If you are a returning COH 1 player or a considering getting back into coh after what happened with coh2 it's definitely fresh and fun just don't take it too seriously because the game isn't esport/competitive play ready yet.

If you are super into competitive play I would give the game some times to age like fine wine (much as coh2 did). 

If you are a casual rts/coh player there really no good reason to not get the game if you like the look of it. Despite the reviews the game is still a shit ton of fun.
