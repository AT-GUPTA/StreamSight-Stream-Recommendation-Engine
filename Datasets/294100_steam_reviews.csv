I played vanilla for the first 20 hours. And it was an o-kay game. However, I felt that there were many features lacking that I could not do with the game that is supposed to be IN THE GAME. So I was ready to uninstall it when I saw the reviews that this game is much better with mods.

So here I was dived deep into the workshop and found a lot of interesting ones. I sorted the mods according to the number of subscriptions and decided to install everything that looked good... which I ended up installing 233 mods in total. I even said to myself that if these hundreds of mods didn't work and gave me a crash error, I would immediately uninstall it. So when I restarted the game to boot up all the mods, it hung up and crashed because it took longer than normal, and I clicked on it accidentally. I gave it one last chance and decided to uninstall some mods, making it around 100-200 mods, realizing there were duplicate same-feature mods. And then wait patiently to load the game for a while, not even using my second monitor to browse.

The game and mod integrated successfully after a few minutes and was playable. It gave me more quality of gaming experience than the vanilla. This game is one of those game that I find starting a new game is alright.

I would rate vanilla 7/10, and modded 9/10. I haven't bought DLCs yet, maybe after I had more time to play the game.

With its blend of complex systems, emergent storytelling, and strategic depth, RimWorld offers an experience that is as challenging as it is rewarding.

At its core, RimWorld tasks players with managing a group of colonists stranded on a remote planet, each with their own unique skills, traits, and quirks. From constructing shelters and gathering resources to fending off hostile creatures and rival factions, every decision carries weight and consequences that ripple throughout the game world.

What truly sets RimWorld apart is its dynamic AI storyteller, which constantly throws curveballs at players in the form of random events, ranging from pirate raids and toxic fallout to sudden outbreaks of disease and power outages. This unpredictability keeps players on their toes, fostering a sense of tension and urgency that drives the gameplay forward.

The depth of RimWorld's simulation is staggering, with players tasked with managing everything from food and shelter to social relationships and mental health. The game's intricate systems interconnect in meaningful ways, creating a web of dependencies and interactions that require careful planning and foresight to navigate successfully.

Visually, RimWorld may not boast the most cutting-edge graphics, but its charming pixel art style is brimming with personality and charm. From the diverse biomes and landscapes to the quirky colonists and bizarre creatures that inhabit them, RimWorld's world feels alive and vibrant, drawing players in and immersing them in its richly detailed universe.

While RimWorld is not without its challenges, including a steep learning curve and occasional bouts of frustration due to its unforgiving nature, the sense of satisfaction that comes from overcoming obstacles and building a thriving colony is unparalleled. With its endless replayability and modding support, RimWorld offers countless hours of entertainment for players willing to brave its harsh and unforgiving world.

In conclusion, RimWorld is a masterpiece of simulation gaming, offering a rich and immersive experience that will keep players coming back for more time and time again. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the genre or a newcomer looking for a fresh challenge, RimWorld is an essential addition to any gamer's library, delivering endless hours of strategic depth, emergent storytelling, and nail-biting excitement.

If life on the rim of the galaxy has taught me anything, it's that cannibalism is a viable career path, and that's just the tip of the iceberg in the enchanting chaos that is Rimworld.

Picture this: crash-landed on a distant planet with a handful of colonists, each with their own unique set of issues. Rimworld is the ultimate exercise in playing celestial landlord to a bunch of hapless spacefarers. But beware, this game is not for the faint of heart or those with a soft spot for emotional stability. It's a rollercoaster of joy, despair, and an odd fondness for manhunting squirrels.

First things first, the learning curve is steeper than a mountain range on an alien world. You'll find yourself wondering if your colonists have a secret pact with Murphy's Law, as disasters seem to strike just when you've finally managed to erect a moderately decent shelter. But hey, that's what makes Rimworld strangely addictive.

The beauty of Rimworld lies in its unpredictability. One moment you're celebrating a successful harvest, and the next, a psychic ship crashes, unleashing a wave of mechanoid invaders. It's like the universe has a cruel sense of humor, and your colonists are the punchline. Yet, there's a strange joy in watching your survivors conquer adversity, be it a sudden raid or a particularly harsh winter.

The game's storyteller AI is the puppet master pulling the strings of your digital puppets, and it's got a penchant for drama. Cassandra Classic will keep you on your toes, mercilessly throwing curveballs at your fragile colony, while Randy Random is the true chaos agent, capable of delivering blissful prosperity or cataclysmic ruin at a moment's notice. Choose your storyteller wisely; your sanity may depend on it.

The depth of Rimworld extends beyond survival and resource management. The game's penchant for emergent storytelling is where it truly shines. Your colonists develop relationships, quirky traits, and tragic backstories that unfold as you play. From the alcoholic doctor who's also an excellent marksman to the nudist botanist who excels at social interactions, each character is a narrative waiting to unfold.

However, Rimworld isn't just about the serious business of surviving against the odds; it's about having fun with the absurdity of it all. Who knew that a colony's success could hinge on the culinary arts of your resident chef, who has a penchant for creating lavish meals out of simple ingredients and a dash of creativity? Rimworld does.

In conclusion, Rimworld is a masterpiece of chaos, an uncharted galaxy of storytelling, and a testament to the resilience of colonists who can bounce back from anything—be it a toxic fallout, a volcanic winter, or the untimely demise of their favorite pet warg. So, if you're up for a challenge and a healthy dose of dark humor, dive into Rimworld; just remember to bring some spare socks for your colonists—they'll need them.",1677208311,1708837828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Years later, long after RTS boom has ended, I've never found my dream game from early childhood. Sure, there were games which were more-or-less about the same concept, like Settlers or Civilization, but it wasn't what I dreamed of, just something that can be considered close enough. There was a Dwarf Fortress as well, but it seemed too awkward even for me. My dream was still unfulfilled.

...until two games came out in 2017 and 2018 - They are Billions and Rimworld, respectively. This review is about the second one, Rimworld.

Rimworld is survival-oriented base building management game. While They are Billions matched my initial dream expectations more, I consider Rimworld one of the best games I've ever played, due to the complexity of the simulation, polished and enjoyable gameplay and the fact that there is no run that looks the same, there is always something to improve or to do, and the game doesn't stop to amaze me.

I'm deeply shocked how much work and thought was put into Rimworld as a whole, it's clear as day that the devs put a lot of effort and love into this game. Personally I'd love to see only one single thing added - the actual campaign/scenarios that would put us into predefined positions and expect from us to meet certain goal, whether it'd be survival, establishing peaceful relations with some faction or anything else. However, everything in the base game is polished to perfection, and I'm very happy that I've found RimWorld, a game which fulfilled my children dreams of a complex base-building game.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece to every person that is interested in checking out how a perfect definition of base-building management looks like. I've barely finished a single playthrough during my 80 hours with this game, and I know that it isn't even everything that the game has to offer, let alone consider it finished. This is my current definition of how a good base-bulding game should look like, and I had a lot of fun from every single hour spent with this title, and a lot more to come.",1708677798,1708677798,True,11,0,0.663779914379119873,0,True,False,False

RimWorld is more than just a game; it's an experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. Set in a distant and unforgiving frontier, RimWorld challenges players to survive, thrive, and ultimately, create their own epic tales.

At its core, RimWorld is a colony simulation game where players manage a group of survivors stranded on a harsh, procedurally generated planet. From managing resources to defending against hostile forces, every decision shapes the destiny of your colony.

What sets RimWorld apart is its unparalleled storytelling capabilities. Each colonist comes with a unique set of traits, skills, and personal histories, leading to dynamic interactions and unexpected events. From tragic love affairs to heroic last stands, RimWorld weaves captivating narratives that keep players invested for hours on end.

The depth of RimWorld's gameplay is staggering. Whether it's researching advanced technologies, trading with passing caravans, or taming wild animals, there's always something new to discover. The game's modding community further extends its longevity, offering limitless possibilities for customization and creativity.

Visually, RimWorld adopts a simple yet charming art style that complements its complex gameplay mechanics. While the graphics may not rival blockbuster titles, RimWorld's focus on gameplay depth and narrative richness more than compensates for any visual shortcomings.

In summary, RimWorld is a triumph of game design—an immersive and endlessly replayable experience that invites players to write their own stories of triumph and tragedy on the outer rim of the galaxy. Whether you're a veteran strategist or a newcomer to the genre, RimWorld offers something truly special that shouldn't be missed.",1646214656,1708556119,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of bugs in the core system, faults with logic subroutines for pawns, pets, animals which haven't been fixed, and I suspect wont be.

Workarounds which cause their own problems, and workarounds for those too. Not to mention a culture of down voting any form of complaint or issue raising. I've found that the closed minded, sometimes cult-like community, along with the issues and faults in the core game, to be completely off putting. I think the game has the potential to be great, but with a community like this, and that it looks like no other updates are coming through, I cannot suggest buying this game.

Though this game is famous for the war crimes you can commit, I wouldn't call it a central part of the game. I think that anyone can have fun with this game but it might be a bit complicated for children.

[h1]PC Requirements[/h1]
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☑ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

Despite the simple graphics, the game can actually get quite demanding in later stages when there will be hundreds of characters on the map at a time. There are performance mods that can help.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☑ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

If you have never played a game like this before, I think it would be overwhelming at first. With that said, the fundamentals are not all that complex. There are a lot of tips and tricks that you'll have to pick up over time, making progression and improvement a rewarding experience.

[h1]Grind[/h1]
☑ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

You are only required to play as much as you want to.

[h1]Story[/h1]
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

While the game bills itself as a ""story generator"", I wouldn't say there is very much lore in a traditional sense.

[h1]Game Time[/h1]
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond

Because of its design and the near-limitless mods available, the game is inherently one to be replayed. No two playthroughs will be the same.

[h1]Price[/h1]
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If you have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

I personally waited for it to be on sale but in retrospect I can say that it is 100% worth the asking price.

[h1]Bugs[/h1]
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

There are occasional bugs, especially if you heavily mod your game, but they are tolerable.

I had a colonist once argue with the colony's animal tamer, and mid-argument the tamer commanded a wolf to tear off the leg of the colonist.

If you are okay with modding, THIS GAME IS AMAZING. But the price of the base game with such glaring oversights is not worth it.

- There is almost a solid base game here. However, there are WAY too many things that require mods.

Why can the colonists only carry one weapon? [sidearm mod]
Why do they haul things away that aren't needed? [haul? mod]
Why do most visitors just walk around despite the weather? [Hospitality mod - to a degree (it only applies to *some* types of visitors)]

And the one that prompted this negative review (the straw on the camel):

Why is Neutroamine *NOT CRAFTABLE*?!?! This one just doesn't make sense. Medicine is a near crucial part of the game. Medicine manufacturing is unlocked later in the research tree. However, neutroamine is necessary to make medicine. Yet *it is only available through trade*. WHY!?!? If traders have it *SOMEONE* has the skill to collect or create it! My colonists can do nearly everything else - but they can't create a key chemical for medicine.

Nothing should be locked behind trade except for logistical necessity (e.g, my base is in an area that simply does not have limestone - so I must trade for it...)

If the devs *were* still working on such basic QoL things, I could recommend this game knowing that these would be addressed - unfortunately, it seems like they are following the cash cow and focusing on DLCs (which are GREAT, but the silly simple issues still stay.).

I mean the way their colony died was pretty funny not gonna lie. But I'm so terrible at strategy games, which is why I rarely play this genre. But Rimworld made me give it a chance.
As you can see I have spent little over 2k hours on this game. Somehow I can't get enough Randy's bs x.x

Alright to the serious topic. Yes this game do not look very pretty, which is one of the reasons some people avoid the game.
Others avoid cause it is too hard of a game, and losing over and over again is not fun for everybody, which is totally fair.
Some people avoid it, cause it is too pricey. Sure you don't save alot on discounts, but there is a reason why this game has this pricetag. It is such an amazing game, and it has alot of replayability. This game has brought me a rollercoaster of emotions, and I have not regretted paying full price for it. I got my money's worth.

I have no clue where to start to be honest. So let me ask you: What do you want to do with your colony?
Raid every factions and wipe them all out before leaving the planet?
Or try and make friends with almost everybody before you head out to space?
Maybe you wanna settle down and make dinner and clothing out of these silly raiders that tries to wipe you out.
Parhaps you want to train every single deadly animal and create an army of wildlives. 
Oh maybe you wanna try to be the richest colony in the world. WARNING you may get alot of raiders, who is trying to kill and steal your goods. Wealth makes raids more tough.
No hmm how about being the local druglord, who sells alot of drugs to other factions.
Mayhaps you wanna do alot of serious warcrimes cough havesting cough.
Or maybe you always wanted to create an army of cyborgs, and destroy everything and everyone who dare to challenge you.
It could also be you wanna try and see how long you can survive in one run.
If you are looking for some sort of a challenge. You could try and do every single quest that pops up. I mean what could go wrong?
Another idea a cult that will sacrifice prisoners and animals to the greater will or god. Cough Cult of N'zoth cough.
I mean you can pretty much make a RP run if you like.
But yeah there is endless ideas what you could do with your colony so go crazy.

Now I do praise this game alot but it also has it flaws.
You can have a colonist waking into the fire, cause why take the time to walk around the fire am I right. Their pathing is not the smartest. You have to be on the lookout so they don't do dumb things.
Raiders can have some odd goals for themself. Like destroying animal sleeping spots. For some reason they really like destroying my pen, and let out all the animals. Sometimes they also want to kill the animals. I can't say for sure if this still happends since I more and less now avoid having animals.
Caravan system is not the greatest. I hate it from time to time. It's hard to explain what I hate about it, but all I can say it feels wonky.
The reputation system is also wonky. If a random predetor kills a faction's chicken or any other animal. They will blame you for it's death, and you get -rep for it. Kinda dumb if I have to be honest. I have been blamed alot.
Raiders, mechs and ant one shot is pretty annoying. You can have the best armor in the game. Yet you can still be one shotted by an arrow to the face. Like huh how is that even possible with the best gear in the game?
This is more and less my issues with the game. Dispire all that, I can still have the time of my life with this game.

Now to the storytellers.
Storytellers are those you creates the events, that is happing withing the game. It can be raids, mad animals, traders, pod crash and so on.
Cassandra is not a very nice storyteller. She is ruthless and merciless. She will strike when your colony do pretty good most of the time. In my experince, she has a happit of sending too many mechs. It can be rough so be well prepared.
Penelope was suppost to be the chill storyteller. She is not chill if your wealth is too high. She kinda goes like cassandra, and go all in to destory your colony. So remember to check you colony wealth, so you can prepare for her attacks.
Now to our favorite storyteller Randy Random. I have a feeling Randy is peoples go to story teller, because he do not care about the rules. He can make the game very interesting, since you never know when Randy demands BLOOD. Many colonies has fallen to O'mighty Randy and some colonies has escaped him.
At first I took Cassandra, but I got tired of the endless swarm of mechs, so I went with Randy Random. Randy can be unfair from time to time, but he brings the most crazy storytelling. It's a rollercoaster of fun and pain. As they say Randy gives and Randy takes.
But if you fear Randy's random demands of blood, you can give Penelope a try, since she should be the beginner friendly storyteller.

Now this game has a high learning curve. You will lose alot, but every story is not the same. Losing is part of the game. So don't be upset, but try to learn from your mistakes. Once you get the hang of it, I'm sure you can beat Randy and his rat army.
There is many things you have to look out for. Your colonies health, mental health, mood and their limbs. Yes your pawns might lose a limb or two.
Base layout is also pretty important. You don't want raiders to go inside from you front door, unless you have a plan. But yeah make sure you have some sort of a good defense, so you can gain the upper hand.
And for pete's sake DON'T attack the peaceful thrumbos, if you are not prepared. You will regret it, I'm telling you right now!

Getting bored of the vanilla game? Fear not Rimworld has a very awesome modding community. You wanna spice things up? I'm sure you can find just the right mods for that.
Wanna make the game little easier? There is some nice qol mods and some good turret mods, that will make sure the raiders pays with their blood for trying to invade you.
Or maybe you want more vanilla kind of things? Vanilla extended has you covered.
I'm sure you can find whatever mod that suits your fancy.
So a huge thank you to the modders in the rimworld community for you hard work to keep the mods up and running. Also thank you for creating these mods aswell.

Now to my little short story.
I had a raid coming and I managed to defeat them. Unfortunate I had a very heavy wounded guy, who was taken to the hospital as fast as possible. My doctor was supposed to tend to the wounded but.. Yeah my doctor was busy sleeping, so the guy bled out.
Few days later we held a funeral for the fallen. The moral guy spoke two words. Went on a mental break down ''Corpse obsseion'' Dug up the fallen pawn and slammed him on the table and left to her room. The rest of the colony found the funeral heartwarming.
So it was heartwarming to dig up a dead pawn and slam them on the table for the world to see? I'm not sure, how heartwarming that was but okay. #onlyinrimworld

I think I have covered more and less everything. I will let you explore the rest, if you decide to pick up the game.
Can I recommand this game?

Base-building is a rewarding puzzle, and the ability to shape your colony according to your vision is both satisfying and challenging. The modding community further enhances the game, offering a vast array of options to tailor the experience to your preferences.

The characters in RimWorld are more than just pawns; they're individuals with unique personalities, skills, and quirks. The emotional attachment that develops as you guide them through triumphs and tragedies is a testament to the game's immersive storytelling.

RimWorld is a game that keeps drawing you back in, thanks to its depth, replayability, and the sheer joy of watching your colony thrive against all odds.

As I'm writing this 3rd review...
Palworld, Enshrouded and other big new game are being massively played by other players.
And for me, Rimworld is soon to become my #1 highest playtime in my Game Library.
I have bought and played Palworld and Enshrouded, both have alot of potential,
tho... nothing comes close to the possibilities of unthinkable event more hilarious than the other. like finding your colonist banging an archo robot built only to destroy enemy colonies!
I couldnt believe my eyes, seeing how the colonist managed to [b]seduce[/b] it

[h3]=+ 20 March, 2023. - 2nd review +=[/h3]
Rimworld should be everyone's go-to game to relax in any life situation.
Normally I play on my custom built gaming PC which can run big games,
but since start of march 2023, I am unable to have my gaming PC with me
and in an attempt to get to enjoy playing some games (maybe, wasn't sure I'd be able)
I got myself a mini computer, quite small, runs windows 10, but not lots of games plays on it.
fortunately enough, i got a spacious external SSD.
I tried a few games. Project zomboid, doesn't work (sad) thought it would.
tried Zero Sievert. no luck.
Then I tried Rimworld. to my surprise, Rimworld plays very well on such a small low end PC.
I even got a few mods installed and it still plays well. ok, not the full set of mods i used to play with, but it plays well.
I cant be less grateful for the creator/devs who made this game play so well. 10/10
Now if you are a lover a colony building, survival game like me.
Rimworld is my #1 recommendation for you.
plays basically on anything you can call a computer ;D

[h3]=+ October 17 2022 - 1st review +=[/h3]
Have I really never given a review on Rimworld?
Wow!

You'd think with over 1k hours of gameplay, i'd have made one already.
Well I thought i did already xD
So here it goes.
I only a handful of game I have played this long or longer
and Rimworld is one of them.
If you are into survival games, micro-managing multiple pawns,
increasing waves of enemies (with time to relax, if you want),
building, crafting, socialization between pawns (social fights included)

Really recommend it, it's a super cool game to play, the community made lots of great mods.
A few different Multiplayer mods also exist, if you dont wanna play alone
since the game was made for singleplayer only, didnt keep players from creating multiplayer.

If you dont like the vanilla gameplay, MOD IT",1666049912,1708056911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the moment you crash-land onto your chosen RimWorld, you're sucked into a whirlwind of storytelling, survival, and unexpected twists.

What sets RimWorld apart is its unparalleled depth and replayability. Even without the DLCs, which I highly recommend as they add even more layers of complexity and enjoyment, the base game stands strong on its own. The sheer variety of scenarios, from building a thriving colony to weathering the harshest of environments, ensures that no two playthroughs are ever the same.

But what truly elevates RimWorld to greatness is its vibrant modding community. Thanks to the dedication and creativity of mod authors, there's a seemingly endless supply of content to explore. Whether you're looking for quality of life improvements, new challenges, or entirely new gameplay mechanics, the mods for RimWorld have you covered. And the best part? Even after sinking countless hours into the game, there's always a new mod or combination of mods to breathe fresh life into your RimWorld experience.

It has an amazing amount of content and a level of difficulty that not many games can match. The Ludeon Studios-made game is a masterpiece of spontaneous stories and strategic gameplay. Players are in charge of a colony of survivors on a faraway planet.

Realistic simulations of people and their connections are what ""RimWorld"" is all about. Each colonist has a unique past and set of personality traits that affect how they act and talk to other people. The game's health system is just as realistic, simulating accidents and diseases in a way that affects people in a variety of, often shocking, ways.

The setting of the game is also always changing. There are many problems that players have to deal with, such as bad weather and pirate attacks, which makes each game play different and uncertain. An important part of the game is the AI storyteller, which changes the difficulty and events based on the player's situation to keep things fair and interesting.

The ""RimWorld"" extra material (DLC) makes the game even better to play. ""Royalty,"" the first big DLC, adds a new group of royal titles, mental skills, and quests to the game, giving the story and tactics a new twist. The ""Ideology"" DLC gives players the tools to give their colony its own unique social and cultural identities. This gives the game a level of depth and flexibility that has never been seen before.

The active mod community in ""RimWorld"" is one of the things that makes it so interesting. The game has a lot of mod support, which lets players make the experience fit their needs. From making life better to completely changing the game, the changes in the workshop give the game new life and make sure it will be played again and again.

""RimWorld"" is more than just a game; it's a place where stories can be told, a place where methods can be tested, and a place where modeling complexity can be shown off. Fans of simulation games can't miss this game because it has detailed city management, a deep story, and strong mod support. ""RimWorld"" has a world that is always interesting and makes you want to come back, whether you're a planner, a writer, or a maker.",1707617705,1707617705,True,10,0,0.605566918849945068,0,True,False,False

Once the mechanics are understood and the game aspect no longer acts as a challenge on its own (which will take a bit as there Is a lot to learn) you can start making your own goals and scenarios using the building blocks given by the game, its excellent dlcs and the seemingly infinite supply of mods. 

If you're a dwarf fortress player, the first immediate ""drawback"" is the lack of Z depth, but after playing the game for a bit I stopped missing it, as the overworld aspect can act as a Z layer as well.

I've developed a general malaise, as has nearly everyone else of the human species on this planet, when something comes over my YT Music playlist.  A familar riff: Em, D, A, Em, C, A. A beautiful whistle accompanies the chords. And it drags you back, in one instant, not to the first time you hear this amazing track, but the first time you find out you've developed an emotional attachment to one of your pawns.  A tear starts to leak from your eye. Then another, as your other pawns, also crying, carry the fallen pawn to the graveyard, and hold a short service. Life had become so brutal since the crash onto this Rimworld. And your pawns which you've come to see as your children struggle every day to have a decent life. You see yourself in these pawns, how they are almost a reflection of you, and losing one feels like losing part of ones self.  And then Alastair Lindsey's Moving On plays.  I'm convinced there's a hidden ""emotional level"" variable in the game, because that song always cues not right as tragic or beautiful or emotional events happen, but about 30 seconds later when you're just starting to process just what has happened.

I tend to go through stints of playing it. I'll play it for a month or so, put it down, then remember it's there after a while and start a fresh colony. The randomness, DLC and dedicated modding community allow so much variety of game play, it's just insane. 

Perpetually satisfying, reliably frustrating, infinitely rewarding. The game inspires creativity in base construction, people management, work scheduling, resource extraction & management, production automation, item fabrication, weapon/inventory loadout, raiding (offence and defence), travelling & exploration, tech research, trading, disaster prep, religious doctrine, the list goes on and on. Create a prosperous utopia of free love, a zealous high tech cult that worships hard drugs, or even a nightmare of sadistic torture, slavery and depravity... 

You can modify the gameplay to suit your desires. You can even cheat as much as you like to test out the mechanics. Just remember that the fun really starts when you're fighting to survive, winning some, losing almost everything, then rising from the ashes and doing it again! It's not called a Story Generator for nothing!

Oh, and the game music by Alistair Lindsay will become a permanent part of your inner monologue (I also recommend downloading the P-Music mod from the Workshop - not to mention the insane amount of extra content and quality of life mods!).

I cannot recommend this game highly enough. It's the luciferium of gaming! My thanks goes out to Tynan and Ludeon Studios for enriching my life when I've really needed a break from the true unfolding nightmare that is the real world. <3",1707514950,1707515173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rimworld is an amazing colony simulator and story builder. There are a lot of solid mechanics, a ton of mods, and an overall satisfying gameplay loop. The glaring issue of this game is its Raiding system and its bad enough that I will often just not finish playthroughs simply because the raids come too often and become more of a nuisance than a fun mechanic, not to mention the main way to beat the game has 15 days of raiding from all factions including mechanoids before you win.

No matter what mods I bring, the raiding system remains to be a problem. Basically, you get raided based on the amount of wealth your colony has (wealth is determined by objects, buildings, number of colonists, and loot/items) and increased wealth can bring more raids and bigger raids over time. That mechanic is fine. What I don't like is that you can be raided by the same faction over and over and they never lose population or get weaker.. 

All colonies have the ability to send an infinite number of enemies as often as they feel like and it kind of ruins the game. It doesnt matter if you raid them and kill everybody, it doesnt matter if you wipe their colony off the map.. They will continue to come no matter what. It doesnt matter if you live on an island, in a sealed mountain, or miles away from any faction. They always come. And theres always more of them. And thats annoying to me. I don't want to have to play in ""builder"" difficulty and completely remove the challenges from the game just to enjoy it. Couple all this with the fact that none of these factions ever have anything worth taking from their own camps, they have no production or really any buildings.. and most times, they dont even have a large population.. yet they can send 40+ man raids to your faction weekly.. and its kind of bs.

Still, I'm not going to tell people not to buy this game, or that its bad in any way.. its just this one mechanic really gets under my skin and I just wish it wasn't like this just for the sake of difficulty.",1707372231,1707372270,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

39 hours already.

This has never happened before.

Help.

EDIT: So, 918 hours later, some thoughts.

First, the memes are true. RimWorld really will just screw you over sometimes. There is no positive feedback loop, and there is no god to help you. This is part of the experience. Additionally, this game will make you a monster if you let it. Like, ""running a colony of slavers that kidnap entire camps and harvest their organs before forcing the captives to either work or die"" is a colony that you can make and it's not even in the top three least-ethical colonies I've made; my current colony is a group of matriarchal slavers that live on a massive battleship in orbit and occasionally descend to kidnap entire colonies, forcibly give them bionic implants (Advanced Components and Steel aren't difficult to find in orbit, because Save Our Ship 2 is a wonderful mod) and then sell them for a ludicrous profit, recruiting any skilled women captured along the way.

Second: This is an enduring stance of mine, but mods make every game better. I run close to ninety, from tiny QOL tweaks like zooming in further to colossal overhaul mods like Save Our Ship 2, Combat Evolved, RJW (IYKYK, keep your mouth *shut*. There are much better reasons to shame me than RJW) and about half the Vanilla Expanded catalog.

This game has foreclosed my house and taken my kids. It's launched a raid on my IRL computer. I love it so much. I can't avoid it. I can't prevent it from making me stay up entirely too late. I missed classes because of RimWorld and I. Regret. Nothing.

RimWorld is to Arts Majors what Factorio is to Engineering Majors: crack.

Title: ""RimWorld: A Hilarious Journey of Survival""

Review:
If you're looking for a game that seamlessly blends strategic thinking, resource management, and unexpected laughter, look no further than RimWorld. This gem of a game has truly redefined the survival genre, offering a unique mix of challenges and hilarity that keeps players hooked for hours on end.

One of the standout features of RimWorld is its dynamic storytelling. The game generates unpredictable scenarios and events, ranging from the absurd to the heartwarming. From colonists going on wild escapades to unexpected encounters with eccentric characters, every playthrough unfolds like a riveting novel. The sheer unpredictability ensures that no two experiences are ever the same, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.

The game's quirky colonists add a whole new layer of enjoyment. Whether it's the eccentric scientist with a penchant for accidentally setting things on fire or the perpetually upbeat but slightly clueless farmer, each character comes with their own set of quirks and traits that contribute to the overall hilarity. It's like managing a group of unintentional comedians in a space survival setting.

The level of detail in RimWorld is truly commendable. The intricate base-building mechanics, coupled with the intricate needs and relationships of your colonists, create a complex web of interactions that is both challenging and immensely entertaining. The game doesn't shy away from presenting players with tough choices, but it does so with a humorous touch that keeps the experience light-hearted.

RimWorld's modding community also deserves a special mention. The wealth of user-created content adds even more layers of fun and creativity to the game. Whether you're adding new challenges, introducing bizarre events, or simply enhancing the visuals, the mods ensure that the game has endless replayability.

In summary, RimWorld is a masterclass in blending strategy and humor. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's precisely what makes it so enjoyable. So, buckle up for a rollercoaster ride of survival, laughter, and unexpected moments – RimWorld has it all. LMAO, and happy colonizing, bozo!

With how addictive I'm finding RimWorld to be, I would be surprised if I ever rack up hours in another game as quickly as I have with this one. A clear indicator that I'm thoroughly interested and am enjoying a game is if it creeps its way into my head when I'm not actively playing it. Sitting at my office desk planning my next play session, or driving somewhere and planning my next character's build, things like that. With the variety of play style that RimWorld offers, I currently find myself in the middle of a two week old run with another planned for right after, and another after that, and another, and so on and so forth.. 

My first couple of runs were short and sweet. I would shoot my fist into the air in elation as my doctor performed a clutch life saving surgery, I'd snicker to myself as I tricked the enemy AI to walk right though my cleverly placed wooden traps, and I would also sit quietly, stunned, as my colony was absolutely obliterated by enemies I thought couldn't possibly be killed and must have been some sort of glitch. Once my runs were lasting longer than one play session, I purchased the Royalty DLC. This added magical powers, which are a delight, and another faction to the game. A faction who quickly humbled me one particular run that lasted a mere few hours. I purchased the Ideology DLC with roughly 200 hours of playtime. This DLC improved my ability to ""theme"" my runs drastically, greatly improving the game's replay value; I've played as a cannibalistic tribe, an underground mole people, a colony of melee-only brawlers who were unhappy unless their eyes were removed.. the possibilities feel endless.

I remember, before purchasing the game, reading reviews of people with 1000+ hours of play time saying things like ""just finished the tutorial"" and thinking it was just an ironic inside joke, but now I know the truth.. I've seen it with mine own (bionic) eyes. After 420 hours I still haven't built half of the available buildings, haven't used a majority of the ideologions, and have only completed two of the four possible endings. Meanwhile, I still haven't used the Biotech DLC, which is often praised for having added the most content of the three. Then, on top of all of this, there is the [i]insane[/i] modding community, which just adds an astronomical amount of content and replay value.

I find myself having the most fun by treating this game like a roguelike and playing on commitment mode. There was a run I did fairly early on where I did play on reload anytime, and while I do feel like the lessons I was able to learn by reloading encounters were invaluable, I found that save scumming takes away my enjoyment of the game in the long term; my enjoyment (addiction) stemming from the game's unpredictability and persistent demand of problem solving. 

All in all, I'm truly excited to keep playing this game and working my way through its tutorial, and I don't see that feeling fading any time soon.",1707042432,1707045112,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ahem, sorry, what I meant to say is that this game is a spiritual successor to Dwarf Fortress, a game where you watch little brain-dead dwarves build, mine, and craft an ever growing empire. You try your best to keep everyone alive, but sometimes things happen. Disasters; raids; forgetting to clean the floor, causing your cat to walk through spilled beer and dying of alcohol poisoning by licking its paws. (RIP Sniffles, you were my baby).

Rimworld is the same in spirit: you watch your brain-dead pawns build, mine, craft, hunt, research, and farm with the ultimate goal of leaving the rimworld (roll credits) you are on. You need to monitor them almost constantly in the beginning, watching out for things like their mood, their health, and their work schedule. Forget to build a table so your pawns can eat like civilized folk? Well, the next thing you know, one of your pawns goes into a blinding rage, while the other dies of hypothermia from being stuck in the freezer during a food binge.

Babysitting pawns is not the only challenge you will face. The game has several ""story-tellers"". Basically settings for how random events generate. In the vanilla game, there are only [strike]3[/strike] 1 to choose from, Randy Random. He is the perfect embodiment of an uncaring god, giving and taking from you as he pleases. Just barely survived a manhunter pack with 80 yorkshire terriers? I'm sure you can deal with a strike force of 30 bandits armed to the teeth that is about to construct a mortar to shell you into submission. But I see you are struggling to tend to your wounded, so I will airdrop some drop pods filled with medicine, that should sort you out, right? The random events combined with managing your colonists makes for great emergent storytelling.

Once you are bored with the base game, you can delve into mods. There are thousands of mods, adding things from extra hairstyles, to complete overhauls of the theme. Tired of sci-fi? Try the Medieval Overhaul. Tired of boring old humans? Try the myriad of mods that add alien races. Want to be able to [strike] get intimate [/strike] hold hands with your elven waifu? Try [strike]Lover's[/strike]... Never mind.

Anyway, enough rambling. This game is definitely worth checking out if you're into colony management, emergent storytelling, and pain and suffering. I rate it 10/10",1707044164,1707044253,True,32,5,0.691857874393463135,0,True,False,False

However, I have never actually managed to have a decent game. How is this, you might ask? Why can I not manage to actually play this game if it is so good?

The answer, dear gamers, is the steam workshop.

Normally, when I play a heavily modded game, I download the mods and install them with either a mod manager or manually. I get the files, then I use the files. However, steam workshop does not function like that. Steam workshop controls the horizontal. Steam workshop controls the vertical. Steam workshop can remove mods from my game whenever it wants. And it does, without my consent, constantly. Creative differences between modders? Congrats all your saved games are now bricked. Mod pushes a bad update? Hahahaha start a new game loser.

I name all of my robots based on dieties in relation to thier generation number. Gen 1 was Norse Gods,  Gen 2 was Egyptian Gods, Gen 3 was Greek Gods, Gen 4 was Judeo-Christian deities. I made 2 Gen 4 robots.. One name Yaweh and another named Lucifer. I started allowing Gen 4 robots to build lesser generations to help with things. Lucifer creates his first Gen 3 Android. This new android he created has the ""Homosexual"" trait.. I think this is odd AF because how do make a robot have this trait? I shrug it off thinking it was a fluke of the game. Gay robots are fine. I have Lucifer create another android. He makes the very next one with the ""Homosexual"" trait. Lucifer was immediately taken off of creating new robots.  After being taken off of this duty , he opens an ancient threat on accident and the group inside wipes the entity of the base. Such a great and subtle display of evil from a robot not intended to be that way.

However, I think 50 hours is enough time to give a review on this game. For some people, this game might be a hit or miss when it comes to style, game play, and difficulty (which could go under game play, but I will leave that up to you). The thing that got me into the game was Youtube and the amount of chaos that you could cause with just a group of three people, and when you get those great stories and laughs that you can tell your friends, that just makes it pure gold. The replay ability as well is a HUGE factor when it comes to this game especially with mods (which is what I want to get into later).

I think that most of the Rimworld fan base can agree on that replay ability is a big part of what makes Rimworld, well Rimworld. I'll give an example: my first game of rimworld went as most of are's did, build a small shack and get killed by something. I had landed in a Jungle with my 3 survivors and opened an ancient danger (Like a dumbass knowing full well what it was) and you guessed it died to a horde of mechanoids. Then in another on of my early games,  there was a raid that had happened while most of my colony was out and one of my colonists (who had a shooting skill of 10 mind you) was using a bow and got knocked to the raider who had a wooden club and got kidnapped. once my caravan had arrived back at base, it was a waste land, mostly everything was burned but nothing was stolen. Later down the line I ended up getting a chance to rescue that person. Overall replay ability is very strong in this game and works out in the games favor unlike Minecraft or Ark.

Next, modding is another part of Rimworld that makes it so great. There are mods that can add more factions, big cannons, more story tellers, ect. This can add onto that replay ability that I talked about earlier. The more you add to the game can make it fun and an enjoyable experience. Also collections are a good place to look if you are looking for something specific. 

Overall, this game is a great experience so far and deserves its player base and fans. If you are on the edge of the diving board to buying this game, then I think you should take the plunge and try it for yourself. I still have a long way to go to be an expert, but this game is more about the stories that you create and the laughs you have, instead of tryharding the game, completing it, and never touching it again.

My entire colony was saved by a tortoise.

This won't be a review like the ones I normally do, going over the pros and cons. Rimworld's a story generator, so I thought I'd share my story. I bought rimworld around two weeks prior to writing this, and set up a small colony. The first animal my colonists tamed was a 212 year old tortoise, who I named ""Old Timer."" We set up a small farm, and once we found a female tortoise (who I named ""Henrietta Peach""), they had kids. And their kids had kids. Soon enough, I had too many tortoises than I knew what to do with, so i tried selling them, and the nearby colonists loved them. But things took a darker turn.

Around 5 days after buying rimworld, my IRL dog, of 15 years, passed. It was sad, but what hit extra hard was old timer's death only a few hours later. Both were blind, both had bad backs - it hurt, and I cried. I dug a big tomb in a mountain for old timer, and laid him to rest in it. But this is not where his story ends.

A few ingame hours later, I got a quest with a ressurection serum as a reward. In that moment, I knew what I had to do, as the end goal of my playthrough.

I couldn't save my dog from old age, but I sure as could save this turtle. Old timer was going to space.

After quickly gunning down some tribals and getting the serum, I needed a way to keep old timer from dying all over again while I aquired the supplies for the ship. Luckily, an ancient ruin was on my map, and after an intense fight with some killer robots, I safely placed him in a stasis chamber the robots were guarding.

Not much happened relating to him. Henrietta died of old age herself, and over the four or so years it took me to complete the ship, old timer's children numbered over 500. i made regular trips to the nearby towns to trade tortoises for the ship's supplies, like plasteel and uranium, and at long last, I placed old timer in the now-finished ship and turned the reactor on.

When you power on the escape reactor, rimworld basically becomes a sort of wave defense game, with a new posse of enemies coming every day for 15 days or so while the reactor charged. This wasn't a big deal - I had troops in power armor with miniguns, and we made it to the end of the 15 days without any deaths. Right as the reactor was at full power, and I told my colonists to enter the ship, things took a dramatic turn. A solar flare knocked out all my defences, leaving me without any kind of fire support. I hurredly got my colonists in the ship, but right as the last one was making his way across the fields to get to it...

Pirates airdropped into my base. I was screwed.

I was about to launch without him, when salvation came in a way I hadn't expected: A tortoise (number 493, to be precise) didn't take too kindly to someone coming out of the sky and attempting to shoot his keepers, and bit a pirate enforcer on the leg. This caused the pirate to hit him with his club, and after that the OTHER pirates started shooting the hundred or so turtles in the base, who promptly attacked back. And, in the ensuing chaos, my last colonist boarded the ship and we escaped.

Old timer, a blind, crippled, undead tortoise repaid me for saving his life - by birthing countless decendants to not only fund my escape, but who also protected me in my darkest hour of need. This game is a gift, and I cannot reccommend it enough. Even if you reload saves to keep the story going how you want, it's still a story worth telling.

RimWorld: Where Organ Trade Is Just Another Tuesday (And Tuesday Might Just Eat You)
5 out of 5 (stars, kidneys, and possibly your left arm...depends on the raid schedule)

RimWorld, folks, ain't your grandma's farm sim. Sure, you got your crops, your livestock (which may or may not be your former livestock), and your dreams of building a space utopia. But picture this utopia as a rickety shack constantly on fire, guarded by a pyromaniac squirrel with a shotgun and a crippling addiction to luciferium. That's RimWorld.

Think Castaway meets The Hunger Games, sprinkled with a dash of Mad Max and a whole lot of questionable decisions. You'll start with a ragtag bunch of crash survivors, each with their own baggage (literally, sometimes it's organs) and mental breakdowns waiting to happen. Your job? Keep them alive. This involves everything from fending off mechanoid centipedes with spoons to crafting hats from the skin of unfortunate raiders (hey, free tailoring practice!).

The learning curve is steeper than a mountain carved by angry space iguanas, but that's half the fun. Every mistake is a hilarious (or horrifying) story waiting to be told. My favorite colony went from peaceful rice farmers to cyborg ninja warriors after a particularly nasty raid left them with more bionics than limbs. We called them the ""Bionic Butchers,"" and their motto was ""Chop 'em up, sell 'em off, buy more luci for Sparky!"" (Sparky, by the way, was the aforementioned pyromaniac squirrel. He had good taste.)

The AI storyteller is a sadistic genius. Just when you think things are going well, BAM! Solar flare knocks out your power, your best cook has a mental break and sets the kibble stockpile on fire, and a pack of manhunting boars decide your colonists are the perfect afternoon snack. But that's the beauty of it. Every disaster is a chance to rebuild, to adapt, to tell your friends about the time your one-armed farmer single-handedly beat a bear to death with throwing rocks.

If you're looking for a relaxing game where everything goes according to plan, steer clear of RimWorld. But if you want a wild ride full of laughter, tears, and questionable moral choices, this is your jam. Just remember, in RimWorld, the only constant is change. And maybe hats. Lots of hats.

P.S. Don't trust the ducks. They're up to something.

P.P.S. Seriously, buy this game. Just don't blame me when your real-life relationships suffer because you're too busy trying to save Biff from another squirrel rampage.

It's all about embracing the chaos and having fun with the story the game creates for you. And hey, if your colony falls apart...well, just start a new one! There's a whole galaxy of organ-harvesting, hat-crafting, squirrel-dodging adventures waiting for you.

(Disclaimer: I take no responsibility for any real-life squirrel attacks or luciferium addictions that may occur as a result of playing RimWorld.)",1706379808,1706379808,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

1)  The sound is kind of rhythmical and nice. Letting the game run in the background while you do some work feels sort of comfy- almost as if the survivors are working even as you are. 

2)  The visuals are unsightly and jarringly ugly though, and ultimately led me to stop playing. Did attempt scouring for visual overhaul mods again and again, but as of 20240125, there is still nothing to remedy the eyesore yet.

Good game, but frankly overpriced. The game is fairly limited without the DLC, or a LOT of modding (most of which requires you to own the DLC to begin with.)  Multiplayer is a mod, Many basic things needs mods to function well. It's sort of... the Skyrim of base management sims. A good game that gets ""great"" with enough mods added in.

For $100 though, you'd expect to not have to install mods for even basic things like Co-Op play to exist. (And that fact that modders could do it but not the devs only adds to my sense of a lack of value per dollar here.)

8.5/10 at a $40 - $50 price point. 6.5/10 at the $100 price point.

If money is no object, buy it, it's a pretty fun game. If you have an entertainment budget like a lot of folks, maybe look elsewhere. I got 200 hours out of it, but that was really only due to the modding community. Hell if we are now reviewing games based on mod content, then Skyrim would be the greatest game of all time... and it's not. 

2 hours to the dollar is pretty typical for most of the games I own, if not a bit on the low side, which frankly is why I couldn't rate this higher. For the money.. it's fairly average.

One last note here, is MUCH of the gameplay revolves around, sitting, waiting, and watching AI do things. This tends to artificially inflate game time even running it on x3 speed. A 6 hour session might only involve 1-2 hours of actual ""gameplay."" Which personally I don't mind, BUT if you have limited play time, it might feel a bit slow paced. Most of the gameplay revolves around assigning schedules, work zones, meal planning, trading, making blueprints, and occasionally some combat where you'll take ""mostly"" direct control.. through liberal usage of pausing.",1599550299,1705906688,False,1,0,0,4,True,False,False

UI according to travelling and fighting outside your settlement isn't worth it and very tedious. Micromanagement overwhelms the game as AI is not very well programmed.

Update 2024 Jan. 22th 

Just played it through and this game was even getting worse going to late game where u just grind for days (yeah real life days) to get enough defensive for the absolute over stacked attacker waves coming in while u load ur space ship engine to leave the planet.

It seems all other factions on the planet have limitless ressources and tribe members. I killed with 12 settlers almost 200 attackers until they bugged in my base and I managed to escape with the space ship. But where is the challenge? I did face the attack cuz I was just tired of brainlees and boring grinding cuz nothing else in this game is challenging. 

As I said the beginning and survial aspect there is fun, the rest is just brainless grinding and really bad difficulty architecture with shallow management UI. The game does not feel finished at all.",1631487996,1705903164,False,1,0,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,False

Tattered clothing? Force your pawn to drop the item. Then you have to MANUALLY allow them to interact with it again and figure out how to dispose of said item.  (Or install a mod so they can repair it.)

Sent a pawn out hunting?  Well they regularly walk away before the animal is dead and it ends up bleeding out somewhere on the map.. and your pawns won't go get the corpse because it is NOT allowed since they didn't actively kill it.  So you either have to actively scan around the map for that dead animal and get it before the corpse rots and is useless  OR keep doing a Priority Hunt on the animal until the pawn fully kills and therefor will pick it up and haul it back to your base. .. and ONE ""Prioritize Hunting"" won't do it all the time either!  You'll have to sometimes do it THREE times until the animal is fully dead.

Which of course then annoys the pawn.

On top of that, expect to constantly be having to change the Work Priorities in the Work tab or nothing will get done. Or some injured pawn that had a 1 for something besides bedrest when wounded pawns end up becoming incapacitated and you have to rescue them.  (Manually of course!)  And there are other instances of this.   Like, ending up with rotting crops because the pawns decided cleaning was more important.

You probably won't want to even beat the game because it's so interesting to build your settlement, collect and farm hundreds of animals, recruit people, fight battles and deal with the challenges that come your way.

I actually did not like it at first. I gave it another chance and ended up playing it for thousands of hours over the years. My wife also likes to play on the easiest setting and make a peaceful colony. There are so many mods you will basically be playing a completely different type of game with enough mods, like a medieval overhaul or a spaceship outerspace adventure or warhammer 40k. However, there are so many mods and they can interfere with each other so you might sometimes spend hours trying find good mods and trying to get a hundred mods to work together. My last settlement was made with mods and I had a bunch of space goblins living in a cave in a valley, growing more of themselves in vats until they spilled out and started raiding nearby settlements.

I can't stress this enough: this game will hijack your life. Play for an hour? Good luck, you'll realize you should've gone to bed once your alarm goes off in the morning. I imagine looking at this game if I were family guy; a chill solution to gaming cravings after tucking in the kids. If that is you, do not make that mistake. You'll get Jumanjied without countdown and your kids will grow up with one less parent. Since my warning will go unheeded, here's some things to pass your time in the game:
 
+ Live under a mountain, brew beer and fight anyone trying to stop you. Get stressed by the intruders' corpses, which further motivates the brewing process 'cos hey drinking helps. Experience the circle of life. Contemplate existence.
 
+ Lose an eye. Lose your jaw. Lose an arm and a leg. Still be the deadest shot on the planet five years later, your injuries only making you stronger. Experience pure happiness: the feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome. Contemplate existence.
 
+ Wake up on a hostile planet after narrowly escaping a burning spaceship. Get waylaid by man-hunting monkeys because malaria prevented you from preparing defenses. Launch yourself back to space. Contemplate existence.
 
All of this and more -- and this before I have even tried any of the DLC, which I definitely will. After playing for a while and reading through what the DLC add to the game the investment is a no-brainer. This game is a masterpiece. An oasis in the desert I did not even know I'm in.

When I played prison architect it created some sort of itch for me. I had no idea what it was but I wanted, [i]something[/i].
Well then I discovered Rimworld and it had that it factor, it scratched that itch, the way the game looks, feels, plays, how it immerses you.

It reminds one of the ""one more turn"" phenomenom when playing Sid Meier's Civilization.

[b]It's absolutely amazing ant farm, deepest RPG out there, interctive story written by lunatics and you, some random bullshit full of furries and anime, or whatever else your imagination and modder's effort can bring to life.

That being said, for a new player it's advised to play the game unmodded until you explore the game and start getting picky about some specific elements; then go and get a mod that fixes your complain, yes there is such a mod, there always is.[/b]

Now how this works.
The game introduces you to it's world, implying depth; to your bunch of misfiits, nudging you to get familiar with them and care for them. Shows you a McGuffin or a few (with dlc's and mods) to chase. Grabs your interest. 
And from here just straight up attempts to murder you in most horrible of ways at all times. The rest is up to you, including whether to chase the McGuffin or go your own way. 
You've got tools, you do your best to keep your wonder team alive; then imagination kicks in, and that's what the ""Story generator"" from the title screen really is about. You make your own story, and Rimworld makes sure you always have something to work with.

 And it works wonderfully.

Want to get hit hard, but plenty of breathing room for recovering and relaxing? Phoebe Chillax. Want a truly random experience where the first encounter you face could wipe you out? Good old Randy Random is your chaotic best bud.

There's various difficulties and starting scenarios to choose from, both can be customized to fit your ideal game. And if there's not enough scenarios or you don't want to make your own, you can find some on the Steam Workshop along with a sizable modding community that's even managed to give this game multiplayer. Though it's still a blast to play alone and vanilla if that's what you prefer. Especially with the DLCs that spice things up and give you alternative ways to ""beat the game"" so to speak.

If you like colony survival games and you like the idea of getting raided by a massive group only for a pack of manhunting chickens to save the day, then having a rat self-tame and join your colony, go ahead and buy the game.

RimWorld is a ""story generator"" where you'll try and help direct the colonists to survival, events will more than likely disrupt your plans, and what you get from it is a very complex and deep set of systems that when events are strung together turn into an epic Sci-Fi story.

While I absolutely recommend the game, I admit that RimWorld is a strange game because RimWorld isn't a game you play to ""win"" instead it's a game that you play for the experience. 

The game may seem ""hard"" especially if you tend to be overly sensitive to loss, this is a game that has both tragedy and triumph in equal parts. 

The cool thing is RimWorld's systems will help prevent you from ever being completely wiped out and having no way to continue, but also won't give you such an easy time that there's no challenge anymore, by increasing or decreasing the difficulty and types of events you get, you'll always have something to do.

---- One RimWorld Story (Skip if not interested) ----

An example I had recently was I spent weeks planning and building, but there was turmoil in the camp. A couple of my colonists Jen and Quazar decided to get married, which upset one of the other colonists Helix as he had been perusing them. This made them very unhappy despite being in a fairly happy overall having a good quality of life. 

Winter struck and it became cold, a cold snap started killing off a lot of the outdoor crops, and food became limited, as the colonists rushed to take the remaining wheat and meat and creating pemmican to make sure none of it spoiled over the winter months. Pemmican is obviously not great to eat and such overall made everyone upset but none more so than Helix who at this point had been cooped up inside, freezing, hungry and still dealing with their feelings of being rebuffed by Jen.

Fed up Helix had a verbal disagreement with Quazar that led to a fist fight, and after beating up Quazar went to get medical attention for his bruises, from the doctor Nova. However as soon as they were patched up, Helix went had a mental break and began lighting EVERYTHING on fire. The whole base burned and the still injured Quazar, Jen and Nova weren't able to stop the spread fast enough to not have the fire destroy most of the supplies. Luckily after half the base burned down a morning spring shower rolled through and put out the rest saving at least some of the base. 

Both Helix and Quazar eventually died from their burns and other injuries getting infected and Jen and Nova had to slaughter all the animals for food. They shared a single bedroom for a few months, and struggled through spring to replant crops and traded all the weapons and materials they had left that survived to trade with wandering traders to help recover.

Eventually Jen and Nova were joined by a wanderer named Vega, they rebuilt the base, and Vega's higher intelligence let them quickly research tools for making greenhouses to help prevent a future cold-snap killing all the food. 

Jen eventually remarried, marrying Vega about a year later. Eventually they managed to build a ship and escape to build a better life, leaving Nova behind who's story continued.

--- End ---

The cause of the chaos and the later arrival of wandering traders and Vega in the story wasn't really random, it was RimWorld's safeties. With everything going smooth and a vast wealth of items and happy colonists, it started seeding some chaos in order to cause me to have to deal with some challenges, then after the chaos it saw a sudden drop in overall colony value and responding by giving some random events that helped like adding a new colonist that had valuable skills and sending wandering traders to be able to rebuild my base with essential supplies.

None of the above is explicitly told either, a lot of it was just me connecting the events into a coherent story. I noticed Helix was sad, checked the mood tab, saw he was sad because he had hit on Jen. Later Jen gets married, and then much later Helix throws a tantrum burning down the colony. I personally connected the dots but the tools were there for me to make that story on my own. 

The game also allows you to make starting scenarios that lets you change the supplies the characters start with, allowing you to roleplay a bunch of scenarios. Try making them stupid easy and have everyone start off rich and watch as their high standards of living cause drama as their wealth runs out, or make the game super hard and start off with no supplies at all and build up from there. The game is what you put into it. 

A comparison might be that the game is like Minecraft. Minecraft while the overall goal is to beat the Ender Dragon and ""win"" like you can win by creating a space ship and escaping in the crash-landed scenario, you can spend near infinite time building and upgrading and such before going and doing that. 

More than likely you won't ""win"" a scenario for a long time. In the 250+ hours I've played of this game I have created so many different colonies with different characters and scenarios, and I have only once actually eventually ""won"" the primary quest of building a space ship and leaving the planet. But winning isn't really the point as mentioned it's a ""story generator"" and if you can get past that, this game has a lot to offer. 

Overall, if you're interested in a sandbox survival game with deep mechanics, this is one of the best options out there.",1606405173,1705639433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ideology stuff is an enhancement of the story-generation, for the tale that the game tells. I am asking too much of the mods and of the ideology mechanics to get what I really want.

Sure, the game already bills itself as a 'storytelling simulator', but if you're looking at this like something like The Sims, it's INCREDIBLY different. Your colonists have free will, for better or for worse, and your first few colonies WILL fail. Rimworld pulls no punches, and will force you to learn the minutia, and if you're able to stick with it and learn what to do, you will be rewarded by harder and harder raids and events, forcing you to adapt to this unforgiving planet upon which you find yourself.

No two playthroughs are the same; Maybe the first one you have a colonist who's amazing at building but is also a psychopath who undergoes a mental break and kills the colony's pet, maybe hordes of bugs erupt from a nearby mountain face and you need to fight for your life, or maybe ~15 Llamas self-tame themselves and join your colony. These can and will happen, and it will be up to you to adapt and overcome when they do.

Once you've completed everything the base game offers, though, not only can you go through another playthrough that it in itself will be unique, but you have the choice of three DLCs that MASSIVELY change the gameplay; Royalty adds a social hierarchy, allowing you to create a kingdom of your own and promote your colonists through the ranks allowing you to call favors of other nearby neighboring colonies, Ideology institutes religion, allowing you to further edit how your colony interacts within it's own boundaries as well as with other people (You want a race of cannibalistic mole people who live in the mountains and worship a shotgun as their holy relic? Now you can do that!), and Biotech adds in new races with different resistances and buffs, gene splicing, and most interestingly, children who slowly grow and learn, eventually becoming full colonists themselves.

TL;DR, Rimworld isn't a game, it's a continued experience. If you're curious about the game, or just want to get started, I would advise just getting the base game and upgrading from there once you get the hang of it.",1705361374,1705361374,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You will find the world is brutally harsh in punishing mistakes, while continuously trying to beautify your region and develop your pawns' stories. So, the first half of whatever game you play will be a lot of fun. However, about halfway through your play, your success is immediately rewarded with raids upon raids of endless enemies whose only goal is to destroy everything you've created. No matter what difficulty you're on, you'll be forced to ""game"" the system by utilizing killboxes, choke points, and whatever other ways you can to minimize the fact you're pit against an unforgiving foe that has nearly unlimited resources. The DLC's make up some of this, by giving you some extra ways of gaining advantage, and they also provide with some new, interesting content. However, the clunky combat which is designed to become your main adversary (weird in a ""story-based"" game) combined with the single-thread computation (yeah, don't worry, you'll clock out that single. core after a couple of in-game seasons), makes the game's life somewhat short.

I've spent more hours than I care to admit building, managing, and sometimes inadvertently setting fire to my little space colonies. 

Customization is King
First off, the customization in this game is insane. Want a colony of peace-loving artists? Go for it. Prefer a band of cannibalistic pirates? Weird, but also, go for it! The game's like, ""You do you, chief."" I've had playthroughs that felt like a serene space version of ""The Sims,"" and others that were more ""Mad Max"" meets ""Lost in Space."" The AI storytellers keep things spicy - sometimes they're your best pal, other times, they're that friend who thinks it's funny to throw a bear into your birthday party.

But, About Those Stories...
Speaking of stories, they're a mixed bag. At first, it's all ""wow, cool, a pirate raid during a solar eclipse!"" But after a while, you might find yourself going, ""Another toxic fallout, Randy? Really?"" It's like the game sometimes tries too hard to impress you, and you just want to tell it to chill.

Cheese Factor
Now, let's talk cheese - and I'm not talking about the dairy product. There are ways to game the system here that can make things a bit too easy. Ever had a colonist survive solely on a diet of lavish meals and zero work? Yeah, it's possible and as hilarious as it sounds, it kinda breaks the vibe. It's like finding a cheat code that you can't unsee.

Final Verdict
All in all, ""RimWorld"" is a blast. It's a sandbox of epic proportions with more stories than my grandpa. Sure, it's got its quirks and can be cheesier than a pizza convention, but that's part of its charm. If you're into games that let you experiment and create your own wild tales of space survival (and don't mind occasionally yelling at your screen because of random events), then definitely give it a go.",1705329648,1705329648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game defines emergent gameplay and natural storytelling. It's demanding, harsh, and exciting. Plan for changing seasons. Plan for raiders. Plan for random events. Plan for your colonists to go nuts and destroy stuff or try to kill one another. Give it a proper go.

There is a great modding community. If you're getting into this I strongly advise looking at the various quality-of-life mods that are out there, so long as they don't interfere with difficulty.

To start with, Rimworld is a good game. Its main goal is to use its mechanics to create a memorable stories out of the colonies you spend hours playing on, and it does a very good job at that, I have countless stories of perseverance and heroism, as well as tragedy and despair. My personal favorite story is rather tragic, but extremely so to the point of being comedy:

I was doing a modded playthrough back before all the DLC when the only thing we had for adding more genetic variety in the colonists was Humanoid Alien Races, and I was doing a playthrough in the Jungle. I was still pretty new to the game so I didnt really know what I was doing or how to deal with certain things, such as a furred colonist named Sjord Bowman Lucas making her way to the colony. Bowman was not ready to deal with the heat of the jungle, and would rapidly develop heat stroke when outdoors, and I didnt know that I could make certain clothing items to increase heat tolerance, Bowman also had fantastic shooting stats, so they were our hunter and defender when food was low or we were raided, which was often cause I didnt know how to properly handle food. The result was that Bowman would pass out from heatstroke almost every other day, and because of how artwork goes, I kid you not, 3/4ths of all the artwork in the colony was about some time that Bowman collapsed from heatstroke. Everyone hated this woman, especially the medic who she tragically saw the most whenever they needed patching up after a raid or passed out from heatstroke. Bowman would eventually develop an infection in her leg that would need to be amputated to ensure her survival, the amputation was thankfully not botched by the medic, but what she did botch was the process for installing a prosthetic, where she fully destroyed the prosthetic. Making a new leg and successfully installing it with a different doctor this time I thought Bowman's suffering was over, but no, the Medic then got into a fight with Bowman where she destroyed the brand new prosthetic leg and Bowman's nose. The colony didnt last much longer because of a drop pod pirate raid that I was unprepared for, so I never got to continue Bowman's terrible, terrible life story. But that story is something I remember fondly for how utterly hopeless Bowman's situation was at all time, every time she got just a little bit of hope it was violently ripped away.

I had a colony that was in its middle stages all things considered. But a raid of about 4 people had come to try and kill my colony. The only two colonists that I had that were good fighters were Strip and Doc. Both of them being married to each other

Strip was my most versatile colonist since she had a psylink and an actual gun. She was pretty weak though and not that good at shooting

Doc tho, was a BEAST. A 11 in Melee and a 10 in Shooting respectfully. I also equipped him with a wooden Axe which was 29% and POOR QUALITY

So as Strip and Doc fight off the first two raiders, strip gets downed and Doc has to melee the other raider, and then the second group of 2 comes around and Doc has to drop Strip and 1 v 2 these raiders. 
They didnt stand a chance. 
He was parrying, Dodging, and critting like it was tuesday brunch.
So then a MAN HUNTER PACK OF RABBITS comes into the area and imediately tries to go for Doc and Strip. 
That was a bad idea. 
Doc was surrounded on all sides and STILL MADE THOSE RABBITS SORRY. HE WAS PARRYING RABBITS. PARRYING RABBITS. THAT MAN HAD A GOAL AND HE WASNT ABOUT TO LET RABBITS FINISH HIM OFF. 
After he killed the rabbits, he and his wife got back to base and healed up. HARDCORE. The things we do for love everybody",1705096290,1705096290,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The game has a vast amount of content, even in the base, and the DLC's only add to these intriguing worlds more. The game doesn't hold you by your hand, and it's definitely daunting to new players, but it is an addictive game I have fallen in love with. You don't play as one of the pawns that survive on the rim, you can't control every facet of what events can happen. You are almost like an onlooker, someone who experiences what happens in the story. The story generating aspect sets it apart, and puts it leagues ahead of other colony sims. From the ones that I've played, they almost seem to depend on the player to create the story, but in Rimworld, the game is the one making the story. You are just the one to see it, and interpret it. The game is magnificent, and is peak colony sim in my opinion, and is one of the most authentic and raw story generators that I've seen. The modding community is insane, adding so many things to the game if you have ever grown bored of the base or the three DLC's. This is a game you can sink hours, days, weeks, months, and even years into. Even if a colony of yours doesn't work out, you didn't lose the game. There is no 'losing Rimworld,' as one of the loading screen tips on console told me before I migrated to PC, that story just had a bad ending, and that's perfectly fine.",1705011053,1705011053,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Similar games to this :   Stranded Alien Dawn (rimworld but with better graphics)


What I liked :
- years of content,  a ton of features
- every playthrough can be different
- freedom to craft your colony as you see fit, doing some strange things like having a colony of cannibals, or bionic enhanced
- Good resource management, building game


What I did not like :
- the graphics    
- the lack of freedom to defend your base, due to the limited nature of the game.  No towers,  higher floors, etc
- the DLC's are overpriced stuff that should have been in base game, (like being able to pick your colonists beliefs, traits)

Case in point: I simply want visitors to stop wandering around inside my base. It should be a private, secure area. But they'll waltz into your dining room like they own the place. This should be part of the zones feature in the game, but that only applies to colonists and colony animals. You can try mods like Locks. But they can be buggy or have performance penalties or be fiddly.

This is one among MANY things that should be built into the base game, not left to the player to fumble with. This studio is too content to rely on unpaid, hobbyist modders to fix all the issues in the game.

Other issues include:

* Pawns dropping their weapons when they're downed, requiring a mod to fix the annoyance of having to find and equip their weapon again
* Pawns blocking doors with items leading to dangerous situations
* Pawns trapping themselves inside a building they've built
* No easy conduit deconstruction (""select similar"" needs a mod)
* Pawns going on extended bad mood breaks with no recourse to the player (again, need mods like Snap Out of It, etc.)
* I could go on for a long time...

It's The Sims mixed with the world from Firefly. It lets desperation and depravity have a seat at the table just as often as honor and success. A game I hated when I began playing it.  It felt absolutely cruel. I had no idea how much time and enjoyment I would get from it once it had a second chance to capture me. 

I really didn't understand this wasn't a classic game where you can win or lose. It's a neutral narrator guiding me through the story of my own successes and failures. Of how our own greed inevitably destroys all our favorite things. Maybe.

To keep things fresh, the mod community is on a whole other level.  This is likely my favorite game on steam this decade.

In a few ways I'm really thankful that the graphics for this are so low end. If even a small fraction of the shit that can happen in this game were rendered in any more detail than it is, it wouldn't be legal to buy practically anywhere on the planet.  Would probably also make folks a bit queasy.

I calculated that as long as we went and cut a few trees a day, we'd be just fine. 

Well, a ship full of radioactive Alphabeavers landed and they ate all of the trees and all of the wood in the storehouse. A blizzard started the next morning. We made it 2 days before we ran out of wood. I was the first to go trying to chop the few trees left on the edge of the map.

pros:
amazing and actually funny ingame generated lore
its a management game so its my kind of game
the mod community keeps the game fresh and new

cons:
it gets stale
the game is single threaded and very unoptimized for mods 
the 2 dlc's ""ideology and biotech"" didn't add anything new ""ill explain""
Massive time sink

explanation:
Don't get me wrong Rimworld is actually super fun but i wouldn't recommend it anymore, i did in the past. My issues with where the game is at, look at the ideology and biotech dlc's. ideology was amazing when it came out it was something new and not really on the workshop then came biotech which was essentially content already on the workshop. 

on top of it i realized that i can't enjoy the game without having more than 300 mobs changing the gameplay to be something that it wasn't like CE (Combat Extended). Even then when I have all those mods running it takes my computer a massive 5? 10? minutes to just boot the game up and the game is stored in an NVME ssd. I seriously built a separate computer just to run the game faster because its SINGLE threaded? like why? yeah there are mods that make the game multi-threaded but the compatibility is super limited

for those who are looking at my gameplay time and thinking ""4k. that's nuts"" you should also know that alot of this time in game was sorting mob load order back in 0.14 <1k hours; Before i used rimpy which made mod load order easier. 

over all if you do decide to get the game. sure. enjoy it have fun with it, but also remember that you're going to be spending ALOT of time with mods in the future and when you eventually do, going through compatibility and load order is gonna make you lose alot of time that shouldn't have been wasted.

The game is designed to where you give your people more general of tasks, getting into specifics sometimes, but what ends up happening instead is you have to micromanage the hell out of them, even resorting to trickery, to get them to do what you want and to avoid them doing incredibly boneheaded stuff.  It's infuriating.  And, because the AI is supposed to handle most of what your people do, you end up fighting with the AI to get things done.  Sometimes it will go so far as to completely ignoring direct orders.  I just can't with this game.  I've installed many mods to correct this, but the AI fights with them, too, so mods only correct issues sometimes.

One thing this game really has going for it is its low overhead.

Rimworld is a survival builder, with a lot of options and a lot of RNG elements.  A typical start has 3 colonists, with options to pick up more as the game goes on.   Most colonist behavior is either automated or semi-automated, where the player gives them jobs and the colonists complete jobs at their own pace. The core loop would be gather resources, use resources to maintain or upgrade your base and colonists, and then defend from an attack or complication.  Colonists can be decked out in a variety of ways (from clothing to stimulants to bionic limbs), have attributes, and can have negative attributes that can screw you over (suffer not the pyromaniac).  Colonists have activities they like, and activities that they won't do.  There is ENORMOUS variety in the power and utility of the colonists. 

Rimworld is ultimately about:
A: Keeping your colonists alive. You must keep your colonists healthy and safe.
B: Keeping your colonists happy. Unhappy colonists will act up in all sorts of dangerous ways. 

If you can do A and B, Rimworld is pretty straightforward. Rimworld, however, has lots of ways of making A and B hard. There are other layers to playing Rimworld optimally (i.e. labor, time management) that the player can opt to avoid for more casual play. There is a broad variety of difficulty options, notably with three 'storytellers' that dictate the frequency and nature of RNG events. 

The caravan system is a bit weak, and diseases can be very punishing to inexperienced players, but overall Rimworld is a must-have for PC gaming. There are handful of weird game mechanicss that the player has to learn to account for or tolerate (pathing, etc.), and while these can be very frustrating from time to time, they don't wreck the core experience.  Killboxes can seem a bit cheap and unrealistic, but in general they work very well. 

The mod community is active, established, and top-notch. Prepare Carefully is an easy suggestion. The game (at the time of this writing) has 3 expansions, one of which (Royalty) is a bit so-so but the other two are very good. Still, I wouldn't say any of them are 'necessary' to enjoy the base game. The base game feels well made and fleshed out, and the expansions 'expand' the game rather than 'complete' the game.

RimWorld has become a cornerstone in the world of colony management and survival games, offering an unparalleled experience that keeps me coming back for more. The blend of storytelling, resource management, and unexpected events creates a dynamic and immersive world.

Gameplay:
The depth of gameplay in RimWorld is astounding. From designing your base layout to managing diverse colonists with unique skills and personalities, every decision matters. The AI Storytellers add an extra layer of unpredictability, ensuring that no two playthroughs are ever the same. The challenge is real, but the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles is immensely rewarding.

Graphics and Atmosphere:
While RimWorld's graphics may not be cutting-edge, they contribute to its charm. The pixel art style is both nostalgic and effective, conveying the gritty atmosphere of survival on an alien world. The attention to detail, from the diverse environments to the weather effects, enhances the overall immersion.

Mods and Community Support:
One of RimWorld's greatest strengths is its modding community. The Steam Workshop is a treasure trove of additional content, ranging from quality-of-life improvements to total conversion mods. The active community and regular updates from the developers demonstrate a commitment to the game's longevity.

Warcrimes Element:
For those who enjoy pushing the boundaries, RimWorld even allows for the simulation of warcrimes in certain scenarios, adding a dark and morally challenging dimension to the gameplay. It's a testament to the game's flexibility and the freedom it provides to players to shape their own narratives.

Replayability:
RimWorld's replayability is practically limitless. The combination of procedural generation, random events, and modding support ensures that each playthrough offers a unique and engaging experience. Whether you're aiming for a peaceful colony or embracing chaos, RimWorld accommodates various playstyles.

Conclusion:
In summary, RimWorld is a masterclass in storytelling and colony management. Its depth, challenge, and modding community make it a must-play for fans of the genre. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate a rich and dynamic gaming experience will find RimWorld to be an absolute gem.

RimWorld stands as a perfect 10/10 in my gaming journey, securing its spot as my all-time favorite. Its unique charm prompts me to eagerly snatch up any DLC released, no questions asked. It's not just a game for me; it's an instant recommendation to all my friends, and witnessing them succumb to its addictive allure is a delight in itself.",1704357244,1704357244,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

If that endorsement wasn't enough, allow me to explain. This game is a colony sim that allows you to take your group in any direction you wish. If you want to be a clan of normal folk just trying to scrape by, that's both possible and engaging. Watching the little pawns struggle to get through the next year while dealing with their own emotional baggage is quite beautiful. You'll watch them struggle with depression, lust, sorrow, sickness, jealousy, addiction, the list goes on. 

You can also engage in morally reprehensible acts like slavery, organ harvesting, and more. You can set up automated murder machines that truly make you question your own humanity. With the DLC, child soldiers and slaves are added to the equation, which elevates the game into some truly messed up territory. 

You can choose to escape the planet your colonists crashed on, or you can stay and play the game for as long as you like. You can specialize in making high value goods and trading them, or you can raid surrounding colonies and steal from all around you. With the DLC, you could mold your group into trans-humanists, communists, supremacists, drug-chasers, the list goes on.

The title screen describes the game as a ""Story Generator"", and while it isn't exactly correct, I do feel like the game always provides an interesting story to reflect on no matter how long your colony lasts.

This game accomplished much of what made ""Dwarf Fortress"" so great, while also stripping away come of the unnecessarily complicated aspects and giving some much needed visual flair. While DF is great in its own right, there is no question that it wouldn't have made the jump to Steam without RimWorld. 

There are some unfortunate downsides, though, and they are important for anyone looking to get into this game. 

You'll notice that I've said ""With the DLC"" a few times in this review. I feel like the DLC is very crucial to having the best RimWorld experience possible. The unfortunate thing is that the DLC ALONE costs $65. This means that the ideal RimWorld experience will cost you around $100. That is simply too much. I would maybe undertsand if everything, DLC and base game included was $60, but no game should be that expensive. Royalty, in particular, is not worth $20. If you were to skip out on any DLC, skip out on Royalty, and buy Ideology and Biotech. I bought Royalty so that my character could wear a beret.

There are some very weird and specific issues with the game that are largely fixed by mods. For example, one of my characters had a baby that obviously needed food to eat, but the baby would only specifically eat baby food, and not nutrient paste, a cheap form of food with a paste texture. Babies should be able to eat this easily, yet there's no way to make that work beyond modding the game,

I still recommend this game to anyone interested in it, with the recommendation of slowly purchasing the DLC over time, as they exponentially increase the game's depth.",1704240846,1704240846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First game: Cassandra Casual.

I'm stuck with 2 drug addicts and a psychic child. Around day...5. A merchant came to down, and we bought the hallucinogen tea.  He was a crippling alcoholic and had been near a mental break, so I guess he decided to drink it all. And went on a 32 hour bender where he was unresponsive, skipping in the fields.

During the same time, we had out first pirate raid. And well, the other guy had both of the weapons, and he's off skipping in fields of rice.  Psycic boy, is smart, but has no useful defense abilities. Then comes the King Yayo. He had 2 addictions, but was doing fine, addicted to wake up, and something else (tea?). He was armed with a knife. Dude just takes the yayo, uses it and charges the guy with a knife, while child gets beaten to a pulp, guy high off his mind was beaten too. King Yayo was the only one able to move around. So he put his Doctor hat on.

He went and grabed the child, took him to a med bed, well he tried. He collapsed before he could get back, and both died from exhaustion.

Alcoholic trippy hippy, died 3 days later when he sobered up from another raid a few days later and no food.

It doesn't promote graphics or ease of use, but if you're willing to see past these factors, or if you much prefer the sort of thing this game has to offer, then you still probably shouldn't play it, because it will become an addiction akin to that drug on the street your uncle always warns you about but secretly stashes under his mattress.
  This game is best described as a storytelling simulator, both because it runs as a simulation of a small colonial life on a lawless world, and because the stories that can occur, not as a result of your choices, but in direct spite against them, or in the ones you forgot to make at all, can end up becoming the most memorable part of our experiences in this game. From the first playthrough and subsequent loss of your colony, to the tenth playthrough and subsequent loss of your colony, each session is likely to contain drama, trauma, traders, raiders, and many other rhyming events that I'm honestly too tired to go on about. It's these sessions, the pawns' reactions to their environment, the player's attempt to hold their hands (and I mean that, don't turn your back for a second!), and much more that creates this addicting loop, a concoction of watching a live - action film that you direct, a one-more-turn feeling every time you're about to put it down, and graphic texty details of all the horrible war crimes you can sit back and think, ""Wow, I really did that, didn't I?"" right before doing something similarly horrible and unforgivable.",1704105557,1704105557,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Currently, not playing it, I tend to go through stages where I obsess for a month on iron-man mode and then when it all goes to shit I stop. I will go back to it, just need time to heal from the loss. RIP.

It's very addictive, which is why I almost feel free between plays, but I will inevitably go back to it because one day I will make it to the end game. It's hard.

Please note I did not play the tutorial and had no idea how to play this game.

We crash land, and build a small seaside settlement.
The first issue arises, food. 
Fuck, how do I get food. Hunt animals, but I have a pacifist and two individuals who have no idea how to use their weapons. Fine they'll do.
For the next month we survive of monkeys, guinea pigs and sometimes alpacas.
Throughout this month, ""The Terrible Partners"" would actively raid our unlucky trio, incapacitating at least one individual every attack.
They survived, and a caravan arrived who informed us of items nearby, so I sent my best to go collect. He was attacked by two man-hunter squirrels and perished.
Then a heat-wave happened, I had no power or cooling, everyone is collapsing constantly. Heatstroke sets into everyone, then as my cook is out of action, someone needs to take the reigns.
She gave everyone food poisoning and eventually died of Heat-death.

But wait, it's my bad, I totally misunderstood, it's because this is not a game, it's a ""story generator."" (That means when it drops one of its many ""and now you have to start over from 0 and there's not a damn thing you can do about it"" events on your 50 hours savefile, you're supposed to answer with ""thank you Daddy, may I have another?"")
Spolier alert: it isn't a story generator. Crusader Kings is a story generator. This is a ""******* off with a cheese grinder"" simulator. Big difference. If you even try thinking about roleplaying in this, the game will make sure your colonists unlock the ""murder victim #229"" character background faster than you can click on that oh-so-useless power armor on the shelf.

I really enjoy Stellaris, Kenshi, and recently bought Farthest Frontier and this game Rimworld continued to be recommended to me. I finally bought it and gave it a try.

My three colonists, Penguin (a 70 year old man with some medical experience), Chef (a 78 year old gunman who can cook), and Penguin’s 30 year old daughter Lulu (who was a janitor and an addict of some drug that she drank as a tea.)  Luckily we started the game with a good supply of the tea she was addicted to.

The three got to work on a shelter. We built it off from some temple ruins and added additions from there. Eventually Chef made a few passes at Lulu and eventually, despite their age difference, Lulu agreed to marry Chef. I suppose when there’s only two men and ones your dad your options are limited. 

We eventually captured our first prisoner Braga. A 22 year old savage lady who agreed to join us after a long negotiation with Chef. Braga’s father attempted to attack us to no doubt save his daughter, but he (Mark) was thrown in Jail for his attempt.

It was around this time we ran out of tea for Lulu. She spent her days wandering around in a daze for days and days. Finally she had a nervous breakdown and went around insulting people. This made Braga angry and she beat the ever loving shit out of Lulu and put her in a hospital bed. That wasn’t enough for Braga though. She was so pissed off she walked into the prison and beat the hell out of her dad. He ended up losing a finger. 

Braga’s lover Flandell crash landed outside our walls (how romantic) and he agreed to join us almost instantly. Braga and Flandell ended up sharing a room and made love nearly every night. Lulu and Chef  had been married for a long time and had never done that. I worry about their marriage.

Eventually a few more colonists joined us. Most came down with a muscular parasite which nearly killed the settlement, but somehow we overcame. Penguin tamed a pet monkey, but it was eaten by a cobra the first day. We can’t seem to make enough food for everyone and we’re running low on medicine. The raids are also becoming more difficult. 

I’m only 60 hours in and I’m addicted to this game.

I force fed her psychite tea and smokeleaf, but once we ran out of smokeleaf, the breaks weren't able to be stopped. I made the decision to imprison her in the most secure prison cell my colony had until she stopped being sad about her husband. This was going well, until she developed an addiction to psychite tea (we were still force-feeding her the tea).
    I wasn't going to allow an addict into my colony, so I kept her in jail and deprived her of tea until she wasn't addicted anymore. Eventually, my colony was getting very low on food, so I decided to stop feeding the prisoners until we could get a reliable source of food. I ended up pushing her hunger too far and I realized she was going to die if I didn't feed her. As a colonist was delivering food to her, she died of malnutrition.

Rimworld has provided me with hundreds of hours of wild, wholesome fun (and panic, at times) with seemingly-endless customization, struggles, and success stories. The amount of mods available surely contributed; this game may have as much of an active modding community as Skyrim... And it's friggin' awesome! 
For a game with such simple graphics, I love it as much as any of my other favorites. Mods can introduce some... serious technical difficulties, especially in large quantities, but thankfully troubleshooting for this game is comparatively easy and modders make an effort to update or at least fork mods for every major new version of the game; all the while, it's easy to rollback and stick to a stable version if need be.

There are tons of ways to play: Just because I liked to play one save until I had built an indomitable city of thriving superfurries and superhumans and ethically perfected every aspect of their lives, doesn't mean you can't be the most evil or tyrannical overlord, or simply experiment with saves upon saves to get the most out of the glorious story generation that's available. 
The complexity and depth to each unique colonist made me forge quite a strong emotional connection to each and every one of them, almost like they became my children... Few games I've played foster such connections. My best way to describe my experience with this game is like watching a favorite long-running sitcom, but getting to choose the characters and themes.

I absolutely recommend this if you like building sims, strategic combat, modding, sitting back and watching interesting things happen, or just plain experimenting. In Rimworld, possibilities are basically endless.",1703668769,1703669304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I picked randy and the hardest difficulty, but he sent dangers very slowly, I got sure of myself, starting making a colony with a family of three and a pirate captured from a space pod. I go through hardships, a batch of poisoned food, injured from raids and have to bunker down while a manhunter squirrel pack roams around, as the prisoner starves nearly to death. Eventually i recuperate, and start to make real technological progress, when a warg crits my entire colony and a man in black is sent to save them, but two of my three colonists die so it's up to him to stabilize things.

Eventually after having buried my dead colonists he goes cukoo and digs up the corpse of a raider, going on a mental break while my remaining colonist is in critical condition and my prisoner (who has no idea what happened) gets hungrier and sees the MIB roaming around holding a skeleton. Mib recovers, i try to salvage whatever funnies I can get from this situation, and eventually the prisoner decides he doesn't want to become the MiB's next art piece or starve, and he begins to break out, and he really shouldn't have done that. The prisoner Griffin (ironically a fat white man but not neccesary for this story) breaks down the heavy slate gate I have set as his cell door, only to be met with the business end of a now sane Man in Black's revolver. 


Something changes within him, and he takes pity on the remaining colonist, who has now gained an infection with little hope of recovery. MiB takes her out back and finishes her with his revolver, before eventually the melancholy gets to him and he tries to take his wrath out on a megasloth, and dies.

The game has a great idea as a story simulator of sorts, which also has interesting takes on social and behavior. This is the core of the game and the main proposal of it, and that is where the good things about Rimworld ends. The way which the game handles its core options could not be worst, specially if you take in consideration the mods, which could be a core aspect of this game. Kinda made me remember Skyrim without mods: a bland, tasteless experience. Most of mods adds functions, options and tweaks that should have been integral part of the game from the beginning. Also Rimworld has the worse mod management system I have ever seen in any game in my life, and boy, I have played a lot. I'm also a mod developer myself, have done great mods which are published here in the workshop, but I would never, absolute never do any mod for Rimworld. Managing mods in Rimworld is the worst experience I ever had in my life, and made not recommend. Mods are optional and not part of the game, but without them, I don't feel like the game is worth the cost, you should really invest in something else. You just have to choose: either play a bland, tasteless game with lots of flaws, or pay a horrible experience price in mod management that will only last until Ludeon decides to update the game, which will ruin all your mods in your modlist, your game save and keep you away from the game several weeks or months waiting at the mercy of modders that most of times don't even care to update their works.

Caved and bought 2 DLC's after 950 hours of gameplay.

This pretty much sums up how much I like the game, and how much content you get through mods.
Still stand by the assessment of it being one of the top 10 games in the past 20 years.

-------
Old Review:
One of the top 10 games released in the past 20 years. 
Every time I come back to this game, there are heaps of new content i can add through mods. (In addition to the vanilla expansions). And I don't even have the DLC's.. and probably won't get them, unless there is a mod I desperately want that requires it.

If you like this kind of game, then buy it. If you're waiting for a sale, don't. It barely gets a discount when it's on sale anyway, and it's more than worth the full price.",1606156138,1703545421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We survived.
We fell in love.
We got married.
For a couple of seasons, everything was good.
Then we got raided.
They destroyed our home and took you away.
I thought you were gone.
I rebuilt.
I recruited more colonists.
I became our protector.
I stayed merciful. It’s what you would have wanted.
I recruited more prisoners, and pathed others up and sent them on their way after raids. Merciful. It’s what you would have wanted, my love.
I never gave up hope.
Several years after the raid that took you away, we received a garbled radio message asking for help. I knew it was you.
I told everyone that night that I was leaving in the morning. 
I had to rescue you.
I would go alone, I didn’t want to risk anyone else.
I awoke in the morning and put on my armor and grabbed my rifle.
I left my room and there was everyone else, ready to go rescue you.
We’re not letting you go alone, they said. Let’s go get your husband.
So we left.
We were prepared for the worst, and brought all our best weapons and plenty of food.
We arrived, and saw a small prisoner camp with three jailers.
They weren’t expecting us.
It was over quickly.
And then you were in my arms again.
We returned home.
Built a spaceship.
Defended it from raiders.
And returned to the stars.

[b]Royalty DLC:[/b] It's all about committing war crimes while you build up your royal lineage - sounds like the UK innit?

[b]Ideology DLC:[/b] Committing war crimes in a cult that thrives by brain washing people into your believes.

[b]Biotech DLC:[/b] Committing war crimes with the addition of children - you can also modify genetics and build mechanoids to commit war crimes more efficently!

I would recommend trying out the base version of [i]RimWorld[/i] first before buying any DLCs or adding mods, since it's probably best to learn how the game works before adding a bunch of stuff that makes the game more complex or that makes changes to how the game works.

> you can replace every limb of a colonist with wooden prosthetics
> you can create a drug empire
> you can then die to a raid from having too many drugs 
> die in Naked Brutality because your one and only colonist got unlucky contracted malaria and died when you had no medicine

Be good, be evil.  Help people or use them. Build a community or build a fortress.  Fight The Man, or be The Man.  Be a vampire and go on to raise little, itty bitty vampires of your own.  Free people, or enslave them.  Be a shaman and help others find the true path.  Be a capitalist or be a socialist.  Finally build that ranch you've been dreaming about, or that farm.  The possibilities are endless.

Keep a sharp eye out though, because while you might feel isolated, there are a surprising number of groups fighting for survival as well, and they will eventually turn their eyes on you.  Human, alien and robotic will all eventually come looking for a piece of what you have.

In my opinion, all three dlc's are must-haves, and add a lot of depth and so many more options to explain choices you make in the game.  Ideology adds a belief and religion system, allowing you to provide shared motivation for you colony, as well as conflict from within and without.  Royalty adds a political system, allowing you to rail against it, or join it, and bringing a really nice system of ""spell casting"" through augmented mental powers.  The system is very nicely balanced and integrated into the game giving you lots of new options on how you want to play and approach solving problems.  Biotech brings yet another set of options that are seamlessly integrated, controllable robots, and gene manipulation.  Create an army of robotic helpers, or super soldiers, or both.  The game is quite good even without the dlc's, so if you've never played a game like this, try it without the dlc's and if you find you like it and want more, grab all three.

The game-play encourages the use of pausing and analyzing your colony and its situation.  There are multiple speeds of time flow, allowing you to sprint to an event then pause and figure it out, or play at a slower speed and deal with things as they happen, like an RTS game.  There are levels and levels of detail and information to gather in-game, as well as a nice public wiki that is a go-to for learning the nuances and the workings of objects and mechanics.

There are a number of ways of tailoring the game to your mood.  You can turn down or off most negative events, or turn them way up.  You can randomize them, or have the events get tougher as you get better.

Graphically, although being 2D, top-down, it is beautiful.  Structures and items are futuristic, without being way out there.  They mix really well with a more primitive play, or a futuristic one.  As your colony expands, everything just integrates really well and is quite nice to spend hours staring at it.

If you like this style of game, the asking price for this game is an absolute steal.  You won't regret buying it.",1703285653,1703285653,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only bad parts about this game is the world itself doesn't feel like it's alive like your colony. Nothing really happens on the map unless you make it happen. Also, pawns can be frustratingly stupid sometimes and prioritize things very poorly. Some of that can be solved with mods, but for the most part you have to micro-manage some things WAY too much.

Other than those things, the game is an absolute 10/10. Mods boost it even higher than that honestly.

As for DLC, the only one I'd say is 100% worth it is Biotech. Biotech adds so much awesome content. The other two are REALLY dependent on how you want to play or how hard you want things to be.

Ideology is neat, and it adds some really good buildings like the Biosculpter Pod, but the ideology system just kinda makes the game more difficult without making it more fun. Unless you like managing 700 different religions in your colony, you're gonna have to imprison pawns and convert them and that can take a loooooong time. I alternate between having religons on or off on each playthrough because I don't really want to deal with it every time.

Royalty really doesn't add very much, the best thing about it is you get a new faction you can trade with that has a lot of great things to offer. Other than that, the royalty system doesn't really mean much and it doesn't add much else worthwhile imo.",1703259645,1703259645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

RimWorld stands as a shining example of indie game innovation, blending colony simulation, storytelling, and survival elements into a captivating and unpredictable narrative. Developed by Ludeon Studios, this sci-fi colony management game immerses players in the challenges and triumphs of shaping a thriving community on an alien world.

One of RimWorld's strengths lies in its emergent storytelling. Every playthrough is a unique narrative woven by the interactions and decisions of colonists. The game's AI storyteller dynamically adapts events to keep players on their toes, presenting challenges that range from natural disasters to interpersonal conflicts, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

The depth of RimWorld's mechanics is staggering. From crafting and resource management to base-building and diplomacy, the game offers a rich tapestry of interconnected systems that keep players engaged in the constant juggling act of survival. The diverse skill sets of individual colonists and the challenges they face contribute to the depth of gameplay, requiring thoughtful decision-making and strategic planning.

The modding community has played a significant role in RimWorld's longevity and versatility. The Steam Workshop is teeming with player-created content, offering everything from new factions and technologies to total conversion mods that transform the game into entirely new experiences. This commitment to modding has allowed RimWorld to evolve and expand far beyond its original scope.

RimWorld's aesthetic, while simplistic in its presentation, carries a charm that complements the game's depth. The top-down, 2D style allows players to focus on the intricacies of their colonies, and the soundtrack adds a subtle layer of atmosphere that enhances the overall experience.

The dedication of the development team to ongoing updates and improvements has solidified RimWorld's status as a modern classic in the simulation and management genre. The game's active community and the wealth of player-created content ensure that RimWorld remains a vibrant and dynamic experience for both new players and veterans alike.

In conclusion, RimWorld is a testament to the potential of indie game development, offering a compelling blend of simulation, storytelling, and strategy. Its depth, replayability, and the ever-expanding world of player-created content make it a must-play for anyone seeking a rich and immersive colony management experience.",1703216931,1703216931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have to share a bedroom with another person. Your friend with maxxed out Shooting Skill gets beaten to death by a bunny. A fence breaks and the donkey you spent multiple quadrums trying to tame wanders off the map. You mourn, you meditate on your mistakes, and you move on. Rimworld is a storytelling simulator, and what is a story without it's highs and lows. Eventually your colonists beat the blackouts, eventually they learn the magical mathematics of E G G, and eventually they find love and friendship in a hostile, unforgiving environment.

Then one day, during a very good patch of the emotional seesaw that is your life, you eat your Lavish Meal out on the job.

Without a table.

The madness sets in. Catatonia, rabid rages, depersonalizing right into a pack of manhunting poodles. All because you committed the ultimate sin of allowing your crumbs to return to the Earth instead of onto a slab of wood.

Humanity can find hope for the future in many places, but there are some moments where one stoops to a level so dark and dreary that there truly is no way to find your way out again. Damned be your friends, your thrumbo army, your 60x60 average-sized bedroom.

a small story that might get you to buy it. 

In one of my many colonies, the faction leaders wife got both kidneys shot out in a raid. her husband and the rest of the colony struggled to keep her alive with her heavy bleeds since she was the doctor. 
while the husband decided to use his second kidney to safe his wife from things like simple flus. with no competent doctor available we had to use the spare which actually successfully operated on both colonists. 

only for them to get the plague within like 2 minutes after and with my still very stoneage technology level there was no chance of saving them. two men who had a crush on the wife were completly destroyed by it and threw one tantrum after another and the last woman loved the husband and pretty much did the same.

No. It's actually designed *rather well,* but it has a plethora of shortcomings that none of the updates nor DLCs really address. Honestly, the artstyle, the toddler-piloting-an-adult AI of the raiders and how easy it is to exploit killboxes,  the utterly unimmersive combat system, the poorly optimized code and the characters feeling like pawns (literally, they're called that in-game and they feel exactly like non-living chess pieces, none of the traits do much to make them feel that alive) just takes away from the masterpiece this game could otherwise be.

However, this far into the review you may have guessed, ''but wait, this is a thumbs-up review... that means...''

Yes, Tynan Sylvester (bless his cranium) and his team figured out that making your game's code easily accessible to the modding community can do wonders. They learned from Todd, and did infinitely better with this piece of information than Howard ever has. All of the issues, flaws, shortcomings and gripes I mentioned... they're not only solved by the community's mods that you have EXTREMELY EASY ACCESS TO... but there's so many more mods out there that improve shit that I didn't even think could be improved, content that I didn't even imagine could be added to the game.

RimWorld is a good game as a base, but if not for the incredible community of modders (Jecrell, Fluffy, Rainbeau, and like thousands of others with sometimes dozens of mods each) it would remain as just that, a good game. However, with the modding community, RimWorld transcends the limitations of its initial flesh to become something much, much greater. It becomes one of the best games on steam in my opinion.

Rimworld may be a little hard to understand as a new player, but once you get the hang of it, the game gives you the ability to run a colony ANYWAY you want. You want a colony of high-tech pirates that terrorizes a planet, sacking any and all settlements? Yes, you can. Want a colony of tribal people fighting the elements and the killer robots that come after you? Sure. Want a colony of tribal pirates that terrorizes the planet and fights against killer robots-- you get the idea.

If there is a word that describes Rimworld is FREEDOM. You can set a colony however you heart desires. The devs have given the player freedom to set the game however the player wants to. Also, the devs have given the community the tools to run rampant with mods, which adds even more things to the list of what one could do in this game.

As a self-proclaimed perfectionist, I relished the multiple colony restarts, not out of frustration but to refine strategies and achieve optimal balance. Rimworld caters to meticulous players, encouraging experimentation and adaptation.

The modding community significantly enhances the experience, providing a variety of mods for tailored preferences. These additions extend the game's longevity, seamlessly integrating new challenges and features into the core experience.

RimWorld Novice: *Explains elaborate story about a colony, involving social drama between colonists, tons of little story details pulled from character info and random events, and catastrophic failure or tragedy resulting in the amazing loss of the colony, all with an attitude of shock, surprise, and amazement, with a huge dose of can't wait to to try again*
RimWorld Veteran: *In a nonchalant tone, with a hint of reminiscing* ""Ah yes, I think that happened to me once. That's just life on the Rim. Wait till you ______""

RimWorld is a game of survival, mangement, and most of all, story. There are many different ways to challenge yourself, and many ways to just sit back and lead your colony to perfection. Don't let the graphics/visual style hold you back. You have nothing to fear, the amount of content for the price tag is staggering. Especially once you mention the very active and supportive, mod & reddit community.

The lives of the colonists you forge, the events you plan or let happen, and the random events that come up, will tell you a different story with every colony you start.

This has become my favorite game of all time. At 32 years old with 20+ years of PC gaming under the belt, I don't say this lightly, or often.

Im going to be completely honest with you, I felt like Rimworld could have had the potential to rival Dwarf Fortress. And after 300 hours I feel I certainly enjoyed myself. But after playing more time with Dwarf Fortress and other games in a similar genre. I can only think to myself how much of a waste this game really is of potential. I want to start by saying I don't consider the 300 hours to be thanks to the developers of this game, but too the massive modding community that circulates the game. Those people are talented and can actually make something with heart like Save our Ship 2 and Vanilla Expanded.  In fact, Im going to say that of the 300 hours of playtime on this game, about 3 to 4 of those hours were spent with vanilla. The vanilla is incredibly [b]boring[/b], events are incredibly limited and you will see all of them in your first few colonies or so. And the DLC are ripped straight from the workshop, especially Biotech which is just a collection of mods. That is just scummy. Especially since the developer charges the equivalent of Paradox with the full game. Also the developer likes to keep increasing the price every time there is a micro-change in the price of freddos in his country. In short, Rimworld is a sadder, shitter version of Dwarf Fortress which is actually a great game I will probably buy the steam port soon. The Graphics are better than Dwarf Fortress though, so it gets an 8/10 IGN.",1681315405,1702475297,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

One feature is in combat if you try to run away to the game seems to limit your speed and give an advantage to the pursuer. So as a gunman you pretty much get beat down unless kill them or human upgrade for speed.
If I was matching the speed of the enemy before I start to run, why would I go half as fast now. This is odd to me.

Update.
Ideology and Biotech increase the amount of content in the game by an incredible amount and further enhance the feeling of no two colonies ever being the same.

""Objectively, there is no reason to bury your colonist in a sarcophagus. It has no mechanical advantage over a grave for the rest of your colonists, and it's a precious waste of time and marble at a time when you are desperate to rebuild. But to you, he is more than just a scrap of code in a video game. He is the researcher who cracked the secret of the battery just in time to save your stale meat from rotting before the long winter. He's the medic who stayed up all night without food without so much as a complaint, saving half the hamlet from bleeding out. He's the miner who recovered precious components from the ancient rock when the old generator broke down. And he died a hero, protecting his fiance and his friends, holding the line against pirate scum storming the barricades. And you will honour him. Because that's what this amazing game does to you.""

One day, a bandit decided to raid, all raids up until this point had been handled with ease... However my colony was pacifist, with one defender (Misha). Misha tried to defend but the raider was fast and got on top of her. after knocking her unconscious and beating the two nearby pacifist (Nelson and Morgan) nearly to death, they took misha prisoner and left.

 Misha's lover Nelson was heartbroken and beat. He was able to get up and make it to bed. While in bed a random survivor joined up in Misha's absence. about a minute later a angry worg attacked my husky Vlad. Vlad died very quickly. I sent Stin in to try to save vlad and shoot down the warg, but Stin was just a cook and his aim not so good. He then died to the warg... whom proceeded to then hunt down and kill Morgan as it was angry from being attacked.

Nelson lied in bed alone heartbroken and crippled... a heat wave set in and just as I though Nelson might make it, he was overcome by a heatstroke and collapsed to the floor. My colony left with no survivors.

Be aware that this game is, especially on higher difficulties, unplayable without mods to fix stuff like blocking doors, inefficient pathing, pathing through traps, work priorities, performance issues and many more

Theres not enough mods to fix all of those issues and the developer doesnt care to fix anything for years now. It will ruin the experience on high difficulties. On lower diffculites, played as a colony sim, it has less impact and should be okay

A lot of people will get intimidated by the mechanics or turned off by the graphics but you are doing your self a disservice

First of all, just like with Path of Exile, do not think you need to know EVERYTHING about the game before you start, there are people with 1k hours still learning, you will definitely fail your first colonies for stupid reason you can't possibly know and possibly experience frustration for not using ""exploits"" that most youtubers or guides use

My advice: If you enjoy watching people, watch Quil18, No Mods, No DLC playthrough for a while, its great

Use lower difficulties, adjust settings (especially research speed) Save and Load and use Dev mode to test stuff especially on colonies that have gone on a while

It's one thing to handle basic things on early game and another when you have 10+ colonists and crumble from the pressure

Focus on small projects and dont overplan and build

Use mods, quality of life or whatever, to enrich your experience, the game is 10 years old and very mod friendly

My personal suggestions? Everything ""Vanilla Expanded"" and everything QoL like Simple Utilities, and Allow Tool, Pick Up and Haul, Achtung and many others

But honestly, just play the game, experience the AI storytelling, add more storytellers, your experience will be very different everytime

Disable or reduce frequency of events that really frustrate you  (I feel like I get Solar Flares every week)

You dont have to do unethical things like organ farming or butchering humans, or exploits like killboxes especially on lower difficulties

in fact with great knowledge you dont even need those even on most difficult

Find your balance of using mods and exploits and building/making what you want

Never really played the game as designed and usually stuck to mods, however they pretty much become ingrained into your playthroughs.

The DLCs are pretty good with my preference going; Biotech > Royalty > Ideology.

The price of the games 3 DLCs (Biotech, Royalty and Ideology) collectively cost a whopping £51.97. It gets worse. Another DLC, called Name in Game Access, which costs AGAIN £12.79, gives you the right (subject to approval) to enter a name into the game so it shows up in all players' games. AND if you're not done tirelessly throwing your hard earned cash at Tynan Sylvester AND Ludeon Studios, you can also buy the RimWorld Soundtrack and the RimWorld Royalty Soundtrack together for £10.08, bringing the total cost to £103.51. Come on. This is absolutely ridiculous. This is becoming comparable with Train Simulator games/Sims games in terms of how much the consumer is actually spending.

What's worse is, the game is held up like a lifeless ventriloquist dummy by its modding community, the games ""intelligent and in-depth"" AI often perplex you with brainless decisions and the game also drowns you with its redundant system of micromanagement and endless menus/sub-menus. The game seems to taunt you by having its AI thoughtlessly dilly-dally into danger and failing to grasp the concept of survival. 

Instead of providing the player/consumer who has spent a trillion pounds on your game already with an enjoyable and balanced experience, the game instead tends to punish you by throwing relentless challenges at you that seem more like punishment than an in-game examination of skill. Oh, and if you criticise the game? the games ""thousand(s) hourers"" hound you like a pack of dogs, insisting that the game is perfect and that you're to blame, or you're too stupid to get it.

GAME.
EVER.

A review cant even slightly contain enough information of what this game actually is. I'll just describe a little bit :) I like to use some mods (like the prepare carefully, where you can easily decide what kind of people and gear you want to start with) and just start playing whenever I feel like. I keep coming back to rimworld.

In the game you make your own story, everything is possible, there is a tech tree that you can use. The game gives a goal you can decide you want to achieve, the goal is to develop the tech tree, gather resources and eventually build the starship and go back to space. If you'd rather run around naked with just a hat of human flesh on your head you can just do that.  

Building and maintaining a strong and defensible tribe is hard to achieve. It really is an easy to play and hard to master game. You can see how many hours i played this game, I still die with new tribes in under an hour when the odds are against me. You can starve, get killed, lose a foot, get a random disease, be tramped by animals, burn to death and a bunch of other things. Have fun!

EDIT: I wrote this at about 500 hours in game. As you can see I now have some hours more.

This game is by far the best game I've ever played. The diversity in stories, the mods, and the expansions make that I'm never bored. I never even finished the game like it was meant to. If I wanted to I'd probably fail because it's that hard. The save I'm currently playing is the first game I actually got to endgame without getting bored of the story and starting over, cheating or just dying. Every expansion brings it's own great addition to the game. And with your own personal taste in mods it's never ending fun!",1554645120,1701890139,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

Base building: Check
Colony manager: Check
Randy Freaking Random: Check
So many different experiences for every play through. Difficult at first to figure out all the mechanics, but once you do, buckle up. Watch some of the videos about people's different experiences. They are so random, funny, sad, adrenaline packed, and crazy. 
Example of one of my many play through: Sent my hunters out to save someone being chased after. They got out to them and fought off the raiders. Took a few injuries nothing major. Back at home a wild animal went rabid. Started making a beeline for my last colonist who was passive. Wouldn't touch a gun or knife. Is that the end of the colonist? Nope, just because they are a pacifist doesn't mean they won't flip that little switch. The one that controls the power to 6 machine gun turrets, and 2 large canons. The rabid squirrel didn't stand a chance. Overkill? Yes, very much. No kill like it. 
Example of another play through: Was attacked by raiders, fought them off but one of them survived passed out due to injuries. Brought them back to the base, and nursed them back to health. Then harvested 1 lung, 1 kidney, and replaced all their limbs with wood stumps. Sent them on their way. Touch evil, yes. However, one of my colonist could use that lung due to being a sickly child earlier in their life. Breath easy my friend and enjoy the new lung. Mr. Stumpy (as I called the raider who left us a bit slowly) never returned. Seems they took the warning to heart.",1701865390,1701865390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With different storytellers, for casual builders who want to enjoy building and a quiet game, up to players who love random gen, like the storyteller Randy Random. 
The character customization is really impressive, because you can give your colonist many different things like a backstory, traits, different looks. All of those options have influence on the skills of the colonist. Like, if your colonist was in its childhood a 'Hacker-prodigy' and in his adulthood a 'Logger' his intelligence skill would be pretty advanced and the colonist is good with plants, but because off it, other skills can be 'disabled', like cooking or do 'dumb labor' (hauling stuff, cleaning, etc.). 
If your colonist has the traits 'Hard worker' and 'Ugly' he will have a buff on all the work the colonist has to do and an extra buff if the colonist likes the works he or she does. But the colonist will see other people who are not hard workers as 'lazy'. And with the 'Ugly' trait the colonist will have a hard time finding love. You can start with a set of skills to begin with, but you can also start with no skill at all. It's all up to you. 
Once you made your squad (or trio, duo or you go (Han) solo) and you're in the game itself, you can choose on which tile to start your base and begin your story. 
Because your colonists have different skills, backstories and work preferences, they are entitled to do different 'work-types/job', like: Hauling, Construct, Cooking, grow plants and cut plants, caring for other colonist when they were downed in a fight and treat them with (proper) medicine. Once this is settled all colonists will do the work you that you set them to do. 
Giving jobs to people can go 2 different ways. You can set them on 'on' so they will do all the work you entitled them to do, but you can't configure on which job to do first and which second, etc. There's where the second option comes in. This option gives you the availability to set priorities to jobs. At first at can be a little bit overwhelming, but if you take your time to see what's on your screen you will get it in no time. All off this and it's not even 1% of what the game has to offer.

The music is amazing - awesome space western vibes both during the calm and combat. This is the only game I've ever seen where I love EVERY track, and it defies that ""sci-fi means beep-boop music"" trope wonderfully.

The replay value, options to alter the game in the scenario editor, the variety of epic mods, the ""toys"" available in this sandbox - It's really nice.


However (opinion alert), if not for wide variety of really awesome mods that either add a whole lot of content, offer quality of life tweaks, or are great performance boosters, I wouldn't recommend it.
The pricetag is quite crazy as it is, and to play without mods, DLC feel as the absolute must, and to play with them one would need to spend well over 60 USD.

The base game (without mods) to me feels like paying for the game's demo. Maybe call my imagination limited, but to me there's just not enough here to justify 30+ USD pricetag, (btw ~150 of my currency, which is more than 10% minimal wage).
Without the DLCs (at least Ideology and Biotech) mods are an absolute must, at least to me, and by putting pricetag this high it feels like creator is literally asking you to pay this much for game's engine + mod access. And correct me if I'm wrong, but mods, something made by the community, shouldn't be a part of the game's price.

I feel like 30$ would be reasonable for current ""base game"" +Ideology +Biotech, maybe 35-40$, while it's actually more than [b] twice [/b] that amount, more than a price of a triple A tittle (where AAA tittles a year or two post release tend to get massive discounts, like 50%. Often 60-75% off after 3 years+. And here, for Rimworld? Discounts are practically nonexistant, at least in my country. The highest discount I saw in 4 years period was 10%. Only this Christmas, for the first time I believe, there was first 20%, and it was for ""base game only"" - which actually had its base price increased over time.)

Feels this way to me, and to at least 4 other people that I know. Not to mention that I saw plenty of posts online with people saying that they feel the same way, consider Rimworld very expensive.

PS: And to those that say ""It's worth the money"" and ""It's not a problem"", tell me:
1. Do you use mods, or is ""100% vanilla"" perfectly fine to you? Because if you use any mods, that means you aren't quite happy with the product as it is, you would like more out of it, and that ""something more"" that you're getting with a couple mods isn't - or at least shouldn't - be a part of the price.
2. Did you bought it, or did your parents/relatives did? Because if it's the second, you can't say it's not expensive if its not you who paid for it, and If the first, how much are your earnings? I can guarantee, just because it may not a problem for [b]you[/b] specifically, that doesn't change the fact that many other people around the world have worse financial situation. And yes, it doesn't mean that every product should be ""made affordable for them"", but a single game, game that doesn't have a whole lot in terms of graphics, music, lore or campaign since it's a sandbox, shouldn't cost them a sizable chunk of their monthly income to play it.

I dove into Rimworld expecting to be the wise and benevolent overseer of a thriving space colony. Little did I know, my colonists had other plans – like deciding that fighting giant space sloths with wooden clubs was a stellar idea.

The game opens with a crash landing on an alien planet, and my initial thought was, ""Wow, this place looks great for a vacation!"" Little did I realize that the weather is as unpredictable as my colonists' life decisions. One moment, they're happily planting crops; the next, they're being chased by an enraged herd of space emus. Thanks, Randy Random, you chaotic deity of Rimworld.

Trying to manage my colonists is like herding cats – if the cats were armed with flamethrowers and a penchant for starting fires. No, seriously, who thought it was a good idea to give a pyromaniac a lighter on an alien world filled with highly flammable plant life?

Social interactions among colonists are like watching a soap opera set in space. There's more drama in the rec room than in the entire Star Wars saga. Colonist A insulted Colonist B, who then decided to insult Colonist C, creating a ripple effect of hurt feelings that culminated in a full-blown colony-wide brawl. Note to self: invest in more comfortable sofas.

And don't even get me started on the wildlife. I thought hunting was a straightforward task until I witnessed my crack shot colonist miss a giant space rabbit at point-blank range, only to hit a fuel storage tank behind it, resulting in a colossal explosion. I've never seen a rabbit laugh before, but I swear that one did.

Despite the chaos, Rimworld has a strange charm that keeps me coming back for more punishment. It's like a relationship with that one friend who constantly leads you into bizarre situations but somehow makes you laugh through the chaos. Rimworld, you magnificent disaster simulator, you've won my heart – and set it on fire a few times for good measure.",1701578357,1701578357,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Throughout my many years of playing games I can easily say there has been one main issue that has plagued my gaming experience more than anything. The ability to feel that a game has ""continuous value"" to be played. Basically what I mean is games that have either a constant future or had such a good past that there is enough content in the game. I will admit I am a different type of gamer to others and money tends not to be the issue, it's more of the investment. I tend to not touch a game if it lacks good replay value unless the story is absolutely incredible. So to some it up there it's replayability that I've always yearned for in games.

Games like Skyrim while not being directly supported still have a great modding team and there is already such great content in the game so it always feels like Skyrim never ends. Terraria is cool for me due to the many different class challenges I can do within the game, but even that will eventually hit a limit. Another major issue for myself is the Challenge that a game has. I've always loved the Dark Souls games due to feeling like I'm earning something within it and not being that fond of Minecraft simply due to it being ""too easy"" though I love sandbox games.

So why do I say all this? Well it's because RimWorld has filled that perfect niche for me. I truly feel like I can come up with near limitless playthroughs and challenges due to the many starting senerios, colony location, randomness of Randy, lucky with types of colonists etc. and not only this, with nearly each new expansion they release something that VASTLY increases potential playthroughs: Ideology lets you create your own custom belief system that allows your group to play a certain way such as a slave owning canablist, or a transhumanist that constantly adapts their pawn's bodies to make them perfect. The belief system in Ideology created so much beautiful replayability options but BioTech finalized on it and shot this from an outstanding game to a absolute masterpiece. The Xenogenes allow for you to create pawns with custom genetics either mid-run or create entire new races, further expanding on the different runs possible. Not only this the mechinator that can control mechs and turn the game into a complete simulated masterpiece where the mechs do everything is hecka satisfying. Also the mods for the game make this game a never ending cycle of content. That people can easily get tens of thousands of hours out of. Sure the base game costs some money and sure the expansions cost money, but if you at all like colony sim games this game just has to take the cake as the top best simulation sandbox game I've ever played and likely ever will play.

tl;dr - This game has the best replayability I've ever seen in a game while having outstanding gameplay and great mods. This is truly one of if not the best engineered game I've ever seen in my entire lifetime of being a gamer.",1678174745,1701541597,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The replayability of this game is insane, and you WILL sink many hours in this game, given that you're into sandbox, indie, modability, story telling, and the silliness of events in your colony.

Worth the buy for several reasons
1 - replayability, way more replayable than starfield
2 - modability, the modding community in this game is large and active. You can mod the game into something that feels like a different game altogether. Want a medieval playthrough? Go ahead! Want magic? Here you go! Want to enter a dystopian future world where the god emperor is living in undeath, where xenos are all out to get you and super space marines are the last line of defense? Theres probably a mod for that too!
3 - story driven, you make your own story, and no two play throughs are the same. Different biomes, different ideologies, different characters and stats, and all the wonky events ( from maddened squirells nobling you to death, to your colonist setting fire to mortar shells because he didnt eat on a table)
4 - depth. Dont let the look of this game fool you. This game is complex. The ammount of mods makes it even more complex. You need to manage a colony, provide food, shelter, entertainment and protection. Not to mention having children, gene modding, space magic (psycasting), cybernetics, and inter faction relationship.


All in all, the base price of this game is worth it. The to say that this game is enjoyable is an understatement.",1701491495,1701491495,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

I don't want to simply delete it, so I'm just going to change it to a recommendation and state that any issues I had with the game have now been resolved, making it a timeless classic. I genuinely appreciate the effort you put into this game.

--------------------------------

Rimworld is a fantastic game and has so much potential but because of an early design decision by the devs I cannot recommend this game. Rimworld is single threaded which means ultimately it has a hard cap on what it can do before it grinds to a halt.

You can easily get 30 hours out of a colony but the game will start slowing down immensly. Now if you keep everything small and hard cap yourself to 1-10 survivors and regularly optimize the game manually or have a mod that does it for you then this game would be fun.

I have a lot of respect for the devs especially Tynan. I understand that it would take a lot of work and would have to change rimworld at it's core which Tynan has said he is just not willing to commit to.

This thread pretty much sums it up: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=17357.0

To quote Vas: 

""How exactly do you come to this conclusion?  Lets say you have a 4 core machine at 3.6GHz like mine.

Single Core/Thread: Game starts to lag behind because you have a massive base, it's too much data for one core to handle.  Everything gets queued up to run in proper logical order of events.  Game slows down to handle that slowdown in processing queue.

MultiCore/Thread: Game is able to offload some work to different threads.  Thread 1 handles temperature changes.  Thread 2 handles pawn hauling jobs.  Thread 3 handles Pawn Cleaning jobs including snow and calculates whee they should go next each job.  Thread 4 handles pawn hunger and tiredness levels, beauty calculations and other such.  Thread 5 handles mental levels and thought defs.  Thread 6 handles power grid states.  Thread 7 handles random event calculations.  Thread 8 handles Animals and Plants on the map.  Game runs at normal/fast speeds because there is nothing waiting in line to be executed.

And don't give me that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about buying a single core 10GHz CPU in order to play games.  No.  Unacceptable.  This game is one of those that has too much data for a single core to process.""",1500879732,1701471134,True,0,0,0.564612090587615967,19,True,False,True

From creating your own species with unique traits to designing intricate spaceships and defining diplomatic policies, the game allows for an unparalleled degree of player agency. This flexibility extends to the narrative as well, as each playthrough unfolds differently based on your choices, encounters with other civilizations, and unforeseen galactic events.

The exploration aspect of Stellaris is a true delight. As you send science ships into the unknown, uncovering anomalies and encountering diverse alien civilizations, a sense of wonder and discovery permeates every moment. The procedurally generated galaxy ensures that no two games are the same, offering a fresh experience with each new campaign.

Diplomacy and warfare are intricate dance forms in Stellaris. The game provides a robust system for interacting with other empires, whether through alliances, trade agreements, or the less amicable path of war. The strategic depth of military conflicts, coupled with the evolving galactic landscape, keeps the gameplay engaging and challenging, even for seasoned strategy enthusiasts.

Stellaris benefits from an active modding community, contributing a plethora of user-generated content that extends the game's lifespan and adds even more layers to an already rich experience. Furthermore, Paradox's commitment to ongoing development and expansion packs demonstrates a dedication to refining and enhancing the game over time.

While the learning curve might be steep for newcomers to the grand strategy genre, Stellaris rewards investment with a galaxy full of possibilities. The game's visuals and sound design complement the epic scale of the narrative, creating a truly immersive experience.

In conclusion, Stellaris stands as a shining star in the grand strategy genre. Its blend of deep strategy, expansive exploration, and player-driven narratives make it a must-play for fans of space-based games. Whether you're negotiating alliances, conducting research, or engaging in interstellar warfare, Stellaris offers an ever-expanding universe of possibilities that continues to beckon me back for one more journey into the great unknown.",1701362863,1701362863,True,0,1,0.451127827167510986,1,True,False,False

While the visuals may not be groundbreaking, the building mechanics offer a creative outlet, enabling players to craft and manage colonies in the midst of a hostile environment.

As the late game unfolds, the challenges become increasingly intense, pushing strategic thinking and resource management to their limits. Each decision carries weight, and the outcomes can range from uproarious to heart-wrenching.

What sets this game apart is its commitment to unpredictability. The social lives of your colonists play out like a gripping drama, filled with unexpected twists and turns. Even after nearly 200 hours, the game continues to reveal new layers of depth, making it a perpetual learning experience that is consistently satisfying.

The premise of crash-landing on a harsh planet is executed flawlessly, creating a palpable struggle for survival where every resource is a lifeline. The game excels in evoking genuine feelings of desperation and triumph, a testament to its thoughtful design.

While the absence of the ability to build into the ground or create multi-story structures is a limitation, it doesn't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

In this game, you'll find a masterpiece of unpredictability, challenge, and depth. The building mechanics and evolving social dynamics of your colonists create a unique and endlessly entertaining experience. With a hostile planet to conquer and a constant need to adapt, this game is a journey that keeps you hooked for hundreds of hours.

UPDATE: Sometimes I take a break after a colony goes bad, and I install another colony simulator... I play... I have fun, then I click on my pawns and I realize ..I hate them. Their soulless , meaningless, shells of bad attitude. I want them to die..
 I come to the realization that I had a real connection with my pawns in Rimworld...
 Cooth Hogsweed McToad. He was the leader of my great mountain clan of Red Neck Cannibalistic Skin Harvesters. We survived many a qua-drum, fought horrible meat eating insects, we laughed and danced, ate our enemies, ate our friends...life was miraculous. The Slave labor quarry's were operating at peak performance deep within the mountains. The finest human skin was used to outfit all members of society. Skin top hats! We had advanced as far as any great cannibalistic nation could have hoped for, until the fateful day that Cooth Hogsweed McToad went on a raged filled alcoholic insulting spree. His timing couldn't have been worse, as part of the mountain collapsed crushing his mother in Law and 4 others. They died instantly...better then the fate that awaited my other 7,  an infestaion of bugs bigger then ever before appeared from underneath the party room where fresh human skin rugs had just been laid. McToad was still in a full rage , taking swigs from his bottle.....drunk and unable to draw his weapon..the bugs moved in. 
My pawn who had no legs who was in charge of research( i regrettably forget her name) she went down first. It was hard to watch her struggle to move one tile before having her head bitten off. Her head was gone..but the screams continued? McToad never lived to be sober. He died in a drunken state, insulting his legless friends. I was furious, but saddened for him. He was now a broken man being eaten by bugs...all because of a bottle of vodka that was left as a gift by a bulk goods trader.

The morale of this story is you will truly care about your pawns in this game.",1572494601,1701206932,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Ludeon deems it to be a ""Story Generator""; if any other dev made such a claim about their game I would dismiss them as an utter wanker, but here it is definitely appropriate. The mechanics are so well implemented and inspired, meaning no two games ever play the same, and the length and breadth of options, biomes, factions and so on will mean there is always something new and interesting to come across.

Its DLCs are genuine expansions, both of content and scope, that push the game in directions it hadn't travelled before. It is rare to find a dev selling DLCs that aren't just pay-for-patches or content that belongs in the base game - Ludeon does it right and I commend them (him?) for it.

Cons - Rimworld definitely has a higher difficulty for someone (like me) who isn't as good at sims.  Having a lower difficulty mode where you don't have to add extra resources, etc in a custom setup would greatly benefit the game.",1701133364,1701133364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While he was lying on the operating table and recovering from the surgery, a huge raid happened. The raiders built siege weapons and attacked us with rockets and mortars. I managed to fight them off, but one of my colonists died. It was the doctor’s spouse.

The doctor woke up with pain, grief, and anger. He dug up his spouse’s corpse and brought it to the main hall, where he laid it on a table. This made everyone else unhappy and stressed.

One of my colonists was a cannibal, and he was hungry and wounded from the raid. He saw the corpse on the table and decided to eat it. This triggered a mental breakdown in the doctor, who attacked the cannibal. They started a brawl that soon involved other colonists.

One of my colonists was a pyromaniac, and he was also stressed and angry. He grabbed a flamethrower and started to set everything on fire. The fire spread quickly and engulfed most of the base.

The doctor had an infection from the surgery, and he was bleeding and feverish. He was also the best doctor in the colony, so no one else could treat him properly. He died on the floor, surrounded by flames and blood.

By the time a mysterious stranger in a cloak came to help us (when everyone was downed and helpless), it was too late. Most of the base was burned down, and most of the colonists were dead or dying. The only survivor was the drug addict, who had taken all the drugs in the colony and wandered off to a meadow. He died there peacefully.

seriously though. really good game. lot of choices for basically anything. clothing, weapons, playstyle, ideology, Research. and if you can't find what you want in vanilla, chances are there's a mod for it.

The Game offers a completely customizable difficulty where you can change how dangerous or peaceful the world and its inhabitants are. You can change the possibility of faction raids, animal attacks, natural events (good or bad), the frequency of diseases and even how likely you colonist get food poisoning from badly prepared food. There are also premade difficulty's that are well balanced.

[u]After playing the game for some time in its original form you may want to make things more lively. For that you have two options; one is free and made by the community, the other is in the form of official DLCs.[/u]

The steam Workshop offers vast options of customizing and tailoring your experience to fit your play style. You can add new regions for the map, new factions, new plants, new weapons and armor, new clothes and even let you play as factions from star wars or Warhammer 40k. 
It is not unusual for Rimworld players to have a couple hundred mods in their mod list, although you should be careful as they could break the game.

The DLC made by Ludeon are great to create more Immersion and to tailor the game to your own play style.
[olist]
 [*]The First DLC ,Royalty, is more of a flavor and Role playing DLC as it adds a new faction with their own ranks and a new honor system. Aside from the faction it doesn't add to much and doesn't really impact the game to much. It is a nice addition but not a must have. [b]It is the oldest DLC and adds the least gameplay features[/b]
 [*]The Second DLC, Ideology, adds Religion to the game. It offers great customization options and many features to choose from which directly impact how you play the game. You can create cave dwellers that hate the light, love fungi and love taking slaves. You can also create peaceful hippies that would never hurt others, never pick up a gun and hold charity in high regard. With these you can make the game easier or harder but almost anything you want to do you can do. 
[b]This is the second oldest Dlc and addds a good bunch of gameplay features aimed at immersion.[/b]
 [*][b]The Third and most recent DLC, Biotech, adds by far the most to the game.[/b] It adds children, xenotypes and mechanoids. With the addition of children you can finally let your colonists start a family and raise your kids the way you want them to be. You can make them into well balanced adults that can do most things or you can train them for a specific task and make them your specialists.
Xenotypes are alien races that you can customize yourself to be whatever you want. They could be Dwarves, Elves or Orcs, or just slightly altered humans that are better at cooking than others. You can customize the looks, feelings and even what they are good or bad at.
Mechanoids are robots that are hostile to you in the base game, but with this DLC you can create and control these yourself. You can build robots that help you build stuff, take care of wounded, cook and even fight for you.

TLDR: This game is a true sandbox where you can customize every aspect of the game to fit your play style. I recommend this game and its DLC because it can give you hours of entertainment even before delving into the well balanced DLC and the vast modding scene. You may see this game referred to as a ""Warcrime Simulator"" and while its true that you can be evil and there are plenty of mods for that, you can also build a peaceful community that builds a farm and that helps people and is running a hospital to help people and makes the world a better place.
[spoiler]Although you will probably remove a few organs and sell them on the black market after the fifthiest raid came in and they killed your favorite animal or colonist. If they kill a colonists kid there are also mods that let you wipe their settlement of the map with righteous anger.[/spoiler]",1701080570,1701080570,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

At this point, I've had settlements that have lasted and have been successful, and I've had others that were downright awful. There's no telling what will be handed to you, both good and bad, or even when. 

I had one settlement that was thriving until one particular pawn I was building up died. After that, all hell broke loose. The food quality tanked. Because the food got substantially worse, everyone was getting sick. Because nearly half of the population was sick, they could barely maintain the farm. Even the doctor got sick and somehow got through it, only to be slaughtered by a raid that nobody was prepared for. Eventually, there were only two left, living in the ghost of what was formerly their thriving town. Food was scarce, research ceased, and eventually the two remaining souls were lost to the cold of winter. 

10/10, would recommend.

The game receives major updates from time to time and there's a second DLC, Ideology, releasing soon that looks like it will completely revolutionise the way the game is played. 

Now, the official content is good and all, but where the game really shines is its modding community. There's countless mods to choose from that might change your gameplay in a big (or small) way that adds some more challenge (like Combat Extended), or more things for a certain stage of the game or that adds extra factions (like the Vanilla Expanded series). Or, of course, QOL mods to add things that should be in the game but aren't (yet), or to improve on existing features in the base game. (And catgirl mods. So. Many. Catgirl mods.)

RimWorld: Where managing a colony is like herding cats—cats with a penchant for setting everything on fire.

It’s a game where your plans go up in smoke faster than your makeshift wooden structures.

Rimworld is a [strike] game, [/strike] [strike] experience, [/strike] [strike] colony builder, [/strike]. Rimworld is something different when it comes to gameplay. It can have this relaxed tone and setting behind it with a wonderful score to back its atmosphere. While at the same time providing a sense of tension at every battle. You are in control of colonists who have crash landed onto a, [i] you guessed it, [/i] Rimworld, a planet on the edge of inhabited space. There you are placed, with only a few necessities for survival and are tasked to keep your colonists alive while also finding a way off this rock. 
That's what you hope will happen at least.

After playing for the first time you will most likely lose a lot of people you might grow attached to. Every one of the colonists you are in control of each have their own attributes and backstories which they build on during the game. This can include relationships with other colonists, tribes and enemies. Losing several limbs while fighting. Dying of an infection then being frozen after death and, years later, being brought back from the dead, seeing that the colony of three which they had started with, was now a bustling town of 20.
All of these small stories build off one another, teaching the player how to succeed on the rim. You will learn the best ways to start off, what to focus on to survive and what traits you value for your colonists. Want somebody who loves the taste of human flesh and is fine with blood? You can have that! And sometimes it will be necessary to make a decision on which of your people will need to be sacrificed to keep everyone else alive.

That is the goal in the end. To stay alive, at all costs.

I love Rimworld, not just because it's a canvas where you can let all of the war-crimes you've ever wanted to commit, actually come to fruition, but because it's a journey you are brought on, one in which both the little things as well as the world changing ones all seem to make a difference.
If you liked games such as dwarf fortress, but couldn't get over the text-based nature of it and also love the futuristic genre. Then this game will be right up your alley!",1622524063,1701042290,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Allow me to share my insights, borne not just out of my appreciation for the game but also as a brief respite from my intense focus on preparing for an Economics test.

This game elicits profound emotions, inducing tears as you encounter challenges and tribulations. Brace yourself for inevitable setbacks and failures, and profound losses to little bits of pixels you've bonded to. Yet, it's in these moments that the true essence of the game unfolds. Every defeat serves as a valuable lesson, paving the way for eventual triumphs. Far from being a masochistic endeavor, the enjoyment lies in the journey, witnessing the culmination of hours of effort unravel before your eyes, only to rise from the ashes, wiser and more resilient.

The base game itself offers endless replayability, a testament to its engaging design. But the support of the modding community enhances both the utility and content of the game, elevating the gaming experience to new heights. Personally, it's challenging for me to imagine playing without some of them.

In conclusion, this game is more than a mere pastime; it's an experience. A testament to resilience, strategy, and the thrill of overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds.

Mixed with melancholy I only thought: ""I want to play more, with new people, a new challenge and new stories.""

Whether you want a casual colony builder or something more intense where the game constantly punishes you as you try to progress, all are possible.  You can create your own scenarios and stories with unique and interesting characters and colonists.

Even if you play only the base game, it's still ridiculously fun with interesting and funny moments along with odd circumstances.  There are definitely some morally gray areas or dilemmas you may face in terms of what you're willing to do or not do to make sure your colony survives and thrives.  All bring more fun to the game as a whole and allow you to play it as you wish.  Want to torture your colonist?  Up to you.  Want to keep they healthy and whole (replace those missing body parts and organs) no matter the cost?  Absolutely possible by capturing people and harvesting what you need or advancing your technology enough to create replacements.  I also recommend buying the DLCs if you enjoy the game, as they do expand your options to play as they integrate a lot of great updates to the game and various scenarios as well.

When I was doing Discovery Queue I originally made the choice to ignore this game and it DLC's. I was thinking  I would never like this kind of game nor buy it. This looks like strategy games which I don't like.

Then I wanted to play something new with my twinsister. She had this and I wanted to play something new. The price was quite high for the game which I have already put in ignore list but I was like heck it, you only live once. 

It didn't take much time me to buy the all DLC's and now, I have tested hundreds of mods and actively using 263 of those. Now I have more than 1000h played this game.

The most I enjoy in this game is the multiplayer mods when those work. The game itself is really morally corrupting and hard, you make choices what you didn't think you'll never even thought was possible. All for the perfectly imperfect colonist to survive in a hostile world created by AI. Their life is a struggle sometimes and it makes the game so fascinating. One wrong choice might end up making every colonist die. When you talk about this game and take it out of context you'll sound like dictator with bloodlust.

If this game would be fully multiplayer compatibility it would be perfect. The efforts to save your friends from 20 manhunting squirrels so their colonist may rebuild is so much fun.

I had roughly 300 hours in the game when I first reviewed it. I've on average put in the same 300 hours [i]each year[/i] over the past 5 years. I don't have a problem, I can stop whenever I want.

Original, 5 year-old review (still accurate):

I decided to wait for RimWorld to hit 1.0 before I reviewed it, and I'm glad I did. I got RimWorld years ago, and at the time I would not have recommended it, as it had very little content. However, Tynan and the rest of Ludeon have been working tirelessly on RimWorld for just over five years, and it has become a truly magnificent game. Well, I say game, but, as the title screen says, it's more of a ""story generator"".
What I mean by that is it has three different ""AI Storytellers"" with various differing ""personalities"". Cassandra Classic will slowly ramp up the difficulty as you accumulate wealth in your colony, and raids will get harder and harder, similar to your usual fiction book. Pheobe Chillax is more laid-back, giving you long stretches of time between raids, giving you ample time to prepare for each attack, while also increasing their intensity slowly. Randy Random is as his name suggests - as the game says: ""... what happens doesn't matter, it's all drama to him."". There is also a variety of difficulties, basically dictiating how cruel the storyteller is to your colony - from increasing frequency of attacks and other events, to reducing the frequency of new colonists joining you.

As for gameplay, it feels similar to other colony management games like Prison Arcitect (which the art style is heavily inspired by), Dwarf Fortress (which has obvious influence on gameplay), and Dungeon Keeper (to a lesser extent). every person ingame has simulated needs, traits, health, relationships, and moods. Got a person with a artery blockage? They have a higher chance to have heart attacks. have a jealous hard-working glutton? They'll want the best room in the colony, work faster, and get hungry quicker. in terms of game mechanics, there are more than I could ever explain in a simple review. (This one is already getting rediculously long!)

The game is by design very difficult, so if you can't take (lots of) losses while learning the game, you likely won't be playing for long. While the tutorial is well made, it leaves out several details new players would benifit from.

There is built-in modding and workshop support, and a huge modding community providing near infinite replayability to an already incredibly deep game.

Overall the game has come extremely far since I first got it, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it. The community on the Ludeon forums and RimWorld Discord are both very friendly for anyone new to the game, and can answer pretty much any question you have, and most are willing to start a few new games to test game mechanics they haven't thought to test before.

I'd watch a few episodes of someone's Let's Play on YouTube (I'd recommend [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP_Vs5WYfS2tZ1lqbqtTsWQ]Yeti[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe2l-3DmNBw5i6_AqpWSi6g]Thet[/url]) before buying, to make sure it's a right fit for you, but I'd recommend it to anyone to at least check out!",1542994712,1700974564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-- original review

I don't normally buy Early Access as I worry about the developer abandoning a project once they have the money. So I did a bit of reading before purchase and it is clear that this game is a labour of love. It is also in a very usable state right now compared to many otherwise ""complete"" games (I didn't experience any game breaking bugs at all). As I have just successfully ""completed"" the game, I felt it was worth reviewing.

The lore, backstory of your colonists, little blurbs against art, the story that unfolds as you shift from crisis to disaster to success (the games AI storyteller doesn't play nice!), it makes for a very enjoyable experience.

For those that have ever played Dwarf Fortress, this is ideal and you will immediately grasp the game. For those that haven't this is a management sim game with a twist.

I will say, despite my first couple of worlds going sour, losing them was actually a lot of fun due to the circumstances. In the first a single colonist went berserk, downed everyone and then collasped due to exhaustion and that was it! Truly losing this game can be fun.

First the award itself. This, game released years ago and to be quite honest - it was fine on release. A top down colony simulator with different ai that will ensure no game ever goes like the last. However, since then they have released 3 huge expansions you can get that changes the game in almost every aspect and adds several new features. Examples are religions, bio mechanical engineering, new factions, weapons, and even different species of humanoids you can have in your colony.

Remember, if the durability is below 51% you can safely toss it to expire outside or sell it! Colonists don't like using equipment below that percentage, forbid them from wearing it!

Let me tell you when I got my colonists to automatically hunt, butcher and cook it felt like when I first learned to program.  
Then I got into the stories.  My colonies would be drama filled soap-operas with personal intrigue and hardship every session.  A character would lose family to an overdose, freak out and shoot our wood-fire generator blowing everyone up.  That sort of thing.  I got about 100 hours in just enjoying the game before I got into the mods.  

This game goes from recommended to one of the best games ever with mods.  Genetics, religion, horror, anything you can dream of is in the workshop ready to fit into your narrative.  Ready to add that extra twist of the knife for your beloved characters.  Want a colony of furry fox people addicted to star wars drugs who fight borderlands bandits?  Got it.  Want a colony of cultists to Cthulhu who also have a daycare business on the side?  You can do that too.  The game truly has something for every fan of settlement management.  

The downsides are of course, loss of sleep, social life, and any aversion towards human rights violations.   

Take my f*cking money, Tynan.

This game, to me, has been a blast, base game is already enjoyable and fun as is, but modding and the subsequent dlcs have made this game outstanding. While it is not a game for everyone and I know I have played it in excess and I hope to get even more hours of the game. It is a game I can always come back to and pick right back up where I left off without issue. The hurdles and challenges this game can throw at you is outstanding and steep, even aggravating to the point you may wanna let out a groan of frustration or even cup your head in defeat but it makes those victories more outstanding. The storyteller, each in their own right, can just be as cutthroat and ruthless as the others, there is never a kind option and losing a colony WILL happen no matter how hard you try, but from those pits of despair coming rising out a golden throne of victory. 
Now as for the game, the base game is a great starter experience but can get stale, I understand with prices and things now a days that dlcs may be out of the question, but not to fear the modding community in this game is phenomenal! The only DLC I hard recommend is the Biotech, it adds so much to the game it is absolutely worth the price tag. Royalty is a solid 2nd, and if you like flavor or adding backstory to your colony Ideology is a 3rd. Especially if you plan on modding Biotech is a strong contender of needs for a lot of the more complex mods. Speaking of modding the best modders around are, Very much in my opinion, the Vanilla expanded guys, Oskar Potocki as well as Sarg Bjornson! Their mods add a lot to the base game that feels rather natural and have a lot of difficulty climbers as well as slice of life compliments that you will think ""Why wasn't that already in the game!"" They aren't the only mod makers out there and there a ton more to discover that I have yet to find! Also the graphics of this game are simple and pleasing to the eye so you can play this game for hours on end and suffer no eye strain whatsoever, as well as being a glorious time sink that you will lose track of time managing your colony that when you lean back you will be hungry and the sun will have set! Also as far I have seen and experienced this game is relatively on the low end of bugginess, only having encounter one base game bug that has crashed it out, otherwise any bugs tend to come from the modding end of things, which tends to happen.
Now for the dreaded bad end of it, this game is challenging to point it is unfair, I have spent a lot of time just trying to have a good run start only for it to be quickly be shut down just as fast as I started the game. Also as all games there are metas as to starts and what you should and shouldn't use, if you are like me ignore them they can ruin the experience and make things to easy or too strong at the start and skyrocket the difficulty curve unfairly. Lastly this game is not a longterm game in a run, it is hard to keep the game running smooth on a longterm game as well as the game itself starts to launch poorly the bigger your modlist gets, mine is currently up to a 5 minute launch which I typically have to relaunch it a 2nd time.
Overall I would say this game is an absolute 9/10, if they could fix atleast the launching issues? I would easily raise it to a 10/10 as that is the only thing that grinds my enjoyment of this game. Otherwise if you love strategy, the cruelty of life, having too little free time, or love seeing a colony grow prosper and then proceeding burn down in flames cause your best colonist decided to start lighting fires in your mountain base as everyone roasts like a thanksgiving turkey this game is for you!",1700876041,1700876041,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

    Their eyes normally look at me in a confused sense of wonder.  I have put my fair amount of time into this game all the way from version 16A to now with the new dlc.  I constantly find myself coming back to the game trying to get my city a little bit better, a little bit more efficient.  I've recently added more mods and that has been a game changer.  It fully flushes out the late game and keeps me wanting to get back into the world.

This game needs some work for the steam deck. I was anticipating clocking many more hours on the deck while on a work break or traveling but was disappointed at how poorly optimized the controls are. Despite being verify for steam deck, on boot, I was greeted to a dysfunctional official control scheme that didn't have fundamental actions like right click working correctly. I went in to map them myself but only ran into more issues. I could not for the life of me get the right click to work properly. 

I don't think the verified status accurately give users an idea of what to expect when playing a game on the deck. I've tried most of my ""great on deck"" games and can say I've had mixed results with most of them. FNAF is another game that is verified but doesn't work the way you'd expect it to. 

If you're looking to get a steam deck for Rimworld I'd either reconsider or commit to also purchasing the dock to allow for keyboard and mouse. I haven't played enough on steam deck to review performance but I imagine it struggle when you get to the mid/late game. 

RIMWORLD Review:

Truly as addictive as crack cocaine. Not in a good or bad way but this game WILL steal your life from you and lock away in a closet like my parents did to me when I was younger. I can and will sit for extended hours of time playing. It's like so little happens but also so much when you're just monitoring your colony. All of sudden your 800 chinchillas have Malaria, you're being raided by beaver people that want to kidnap and eat your newborns, you make the mistake of taking on Thrumbos too early, a pack of cargo pods lands in the middle of your base with that desperately needed glitterworld medicine. The amount of unique scenarios and outcomes keeps me engaged and interested in what will happen next as I try to get to space.

  Larian studios continues work on and support Rimworld. Pumping out substantial DLC, just like how I pump the money out of my bank account to buy them, that perfectly compliments the core as well as the other additional downloadable content. There is a unique synergy between the community and devs where the players create mods for QOL stuff while the devs focus mainly on DLC and big picture stuff. Maybe QOL shouldn't be completely on the community but steam workshop mods are essential for most Rimworld players (or Rimmers as I call them) and I recommend using them to enhance your play-through. 

Rimworld is one of those games that I believe everyone should try but there are some flaws. I think if the devs invested in creating an in-depth tutorial at the start of the game more people would stick around. Most people I talk to that have tried Rimworld will tell you how it is tough in the beginning because of how minimal the tutorial is. It needs improvement. And while I do think the community engagement and collaboration is great, taking some time out to add  QOL adjustments to the core game instead of relying on the free labor of enthusiasts would benefit everyone, might be a hot take but whatever. 

I have tons of fun playing Rimworld and sometimes I take extended breaks from the game. Rimworld is life so, naturally, there are seasons. I am aware of ignorance when talking about game development and all that stuff, it is harder and more complicated than I can probably imagine, but this is a non-technical consumer review and just my opinion. I still recommend Rimworld 100% probably the closest to perfect a game can get. Give it a try, commit to learning, and I bet you'll have a great time not leaving your house for 6 months.",1651819347,1700867068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure, you can win the game, at a high cost of course. The charm of the game is tactically managing resources and human talents. On paper, it would make sense to allocate more resources to unskilled pawns with greedy or jealous traits who you are promoting with higher titles while ordering mentally stable pawns working overtime. Under this logic, a useless pawn would spend most of its time meditating in an 80 square throne room with lavish meal in its inventory while a large population lives in a 2X2 square single bed room and only allowed simple meals and herbal medicine. Needless to say, the peasant pawns would be assigned to melee attack in the front line while the precious titled pawns are standing in the safe zone and trying to make history.
But what if, I wonder, Wiking’s happiness theory and Bregman’s human kindness theory could work in this hush “reality” (i.e., starve to survive in Randy)? Would a free, high quality healthcare system survive in this simulation game? How about democracy and a check-and-balances system? I decided to prioritize happiness (mood level) above technology progress and colony wealth as a social experiment. Yes, I know this is not a cutesy game like Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing. (I mean… have you checked the Ideology DLS?) But I was just curious what if I only assign 6 hours of working hours with 3 hours of recreation hours so that they can spend them in extremely impressive recreation room; allow everyone - including guest refugees - glitter medicine; rather promoting one pawn to the highest title but spreading honors equally among 3 pawns according to how popular they are among the colonists?
Sure, in the end, it’s a happy and well-defend colony. But guess what, it’s Randy; you can’t break even. You can survive many raids, man/woman hunting packs, and mech clusters, but colonists would still suffer from the inevitable curse of aging (“Birthday: bad back/ dementia”) and heartbreaks. Everyone is happy? Great! But you still can’t prevent love rejections, affairs, and divorces among the colonists. And yes, the Royal DLS added many new technologies to fix these problems, even a serum to revive a dead colonist. But at what cost? Sooner or later, something bigger - from external or internal factors- will rise. The only existing is pack up and leave this colony that you have spent hours to build.
Then why am I still playing it? Because I can’t get out of this Pandora’s box.edit

Pros:
1. If you have the right mindset, this game can be enjoyable for hundreds of hours
2. Very in-depth social system and an actual combat system
3. Friendly Modding Community
Cons:
1. Some people dislike the RNG of the game, because they could defeat a raid and get a disease on everyone of their colonists.
2. Some people don't want to commit hours and hours to complete one game entirely
3. After watching modded series, some people don't want to go through the ""hassle"" of buying royalty and installing all 1 million mods the person had

Rimworld is a good story and colony sim game. It's definitely for the more patient ones out there who like to go through the long grind and development to reach results which eventually mount to nothing. You know there are no achievements or anything you get at the end of it. It's like reading a book and all of the content you wanted wasn't in the last page but the book as a whole. There are moments of struggle and happiness for your little pawns and it's all interesting to watch play out.

Despite all that, there's some problems here. While the game does infact give you unique ways of going through the story, really there is only a few ways it can go. There's not as many actually diverging paths unless you download the two 20$ DLCs, each giving 1 more. Ideology is a bit more flexible though which is an improvement. The DLCs feel like they should be base game. A lot of the active players of this game didn't actually buy rimworld for the vanilla content but for the active modding community who keep the game alive and are ready to bring you more content than what Tynan Sylvester can provide. I could forgive this if the game wasn't as big but in recent times it's seen a surge of hundreds of thousands of buyers. Instead of spending 20 for Tynan, you could just get similar content from hard working and honestly heavyhearted modders for free (or you can just pay them instead to keep them going), modders who should be hired to work at Ludeon to help out bettering the game in terms of content and performance and given a paycheck. Would allow for expansion and a better game but maybe Tynan just doesn't want Ludeon to be like that. Maybe I'm being too greedy here but then is Tynan not for asking 20 for the rim of magic mod? Also the full game costs about 100$ to buy now for newcomers so there's that.

In conclusion: It's ok. Buy it, play it and gas your enemies with none other than the vanilla furniture expanded power module MOD.",1533820091,1700835009,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There's a lot of things that you can do to your colony. You create your own story, you can choose a scenario as Crashlanded, Tribal, or Merchant. And then you settle and manage your colony. There's lot of event going on, sometime you have raid which will scale with your wealth, sometime a trading caravan pass by, etc. If you love micromanagement, you can set schedule, task, specific assignment, or rules for clothing on your colony.

The music is great, you can enjoy playing while listening to it. The vibe it gives more like a country cowboy music, although not all the genre are country especially on main menu where it has ambient vibes music.

There are a lot of things you can do, and a great modding community, but the game has a sort of false depth. It's like they have provided us a lot of tools, and its fun to use them while you are still figuring out as you wonder the extent of possibilities. But soon as you figure out the mechanics, you realize that its actually very simple. And while understanding the mechanics and triggers are essential part of arcade games, it's counterintuitive for simulations. It makes it very difficult to maintain the suspension of disbelief and the game quickly loses its allure(at least for me). I understand that simple mechanics are part of this game's design philosophy and as a result the game holds very well mechanically. However, I feel that if you wanna create a simple game, keep it at a simple price. 

Some notes for players that are coming here after seeing hyped up videos from youtube:
* The notes on paintings are randomly generated, and while they do have your character's name the context rarely make sense unless you really force yourself to make sense of it.
* The pawns have relationships in the sense that they either really like or hate each other and begin fights when they have too much mood debuff. They don't actually 'talk' to each other. Just randomly generated logs (""talked about politics/dogs"") if they are in the vicinity.
* The pawns have traits like neurotic or pyro or beautiful. They affect either their skills or social standing. They don't have a personality as such. And traits are just a representation of what work they are good at (shooting, cooking), some of which they are better at learning.  
* You can do a Warcrime playthrough. But the only effect in game you will notice is that your pawns and other colonists will have a mood debuff. It just another Wednesday in the Wild West.
* And the other colonies are pretty much non-existent. They don't really interact with each other or have an influence on the world. They are just.. filler.

If the price was half of what it is, I'd highly recommend it. But this price seems to be for what the game appears to be and not what it actually is. If you have great imagination or need some inspiration for worldbuilding or not worried about the price, go for it. (Really, its good). Otherwise depending on what you are looking for, there might be other games that are better. Hell during sale you can get entire Fallout 4 for cheaper. Subnautica if you want exploration-survival, Frostpunk if you want colony, Surviving Mars if you love Tech Trees. 
I also need to add that, there is this growing popularity of a new metric of measurement where people see the 'hours of entertainment a game provides'. And honestly that's not a good metric. Spending 3 hrs playing Rimworld is not the same as spending 3 hrs watching Dune/Oppenheimer or swimming in a rented pool or watching TV. And on the same note 40 hours playing a beautiful linear story is worth much more than 100 spent in something like counter strike. People please stop encouraging this metric. I know we need to 'support the devs' but this is  not the way. There is a growing trend of newer indie games being priced like AA games.  When the best thing about indie games apart from their innovation was their reasonable cost.",1700809409,1700809409,False,81,1,0.707742989063262939,15,True,False,False

See your colony prosper from a tribal society that eventually develops interstellar space travel or see your bustling merchant empire crumple to the ground by an ill-timed ravaging horde of rabid ...chickens?!

At its core, Rimworld is about building and survival on a world in the outer rim, but it need not stop there, with an active modding community encouraged by the devs (some devs even being modders) the possibilities are near limit-less. From playing in a pre-industrial world, a fantasy world with elves and magic to interdimentional space travelers facing lovecraftian horrors.

This developer absolutely HATES the people who mod his game for free. He's never stated this, but his actions with the development of his game seem to differ...
I remember playing this game when it was still in early access, and being infinitely irritated every time a new update came out. Now why would I be mad about updates? Because for people who mod this game, and I'm one of the many who finds this game unplayable without mods, each update breaks every single mod you have installed, because the mods are rendered functionless until the author updates them to the current build. This acted like a sifter, each updates filtering out more and more flavor mods, because the author assumingly got frustrated and abandoned the mod.
When the 1.0 stable build came out, it was a golden age for modding.... Every mod was now perpetually valid as long as it didn't conflict with others you had running. Finally you could reliably run your favorite, personally flavored heavy-mod builds and invest untold hours into them knowing the game will finally have the depth that its potential allows. No more miles-wide ocean that only goes skin-deep (the problem that invariably plagues vanilla rimworld).... This was when I loved the game.
Then Tynan released the Royalty DLC.... This brought an end to the golden age of modding, ruined all my saves where I had invested countless hours into nurturing that stupid little colony through every hardship the game could throw at me. I was pissed enough to drop the game for the mean-time.
Years later I come back thinking it should now be on a stable build with biotech having been released months ago (how many more DLC's can Tynan really fart out? This isn't Paradox Interactive.... right?) Now a week later after getting a good mod list together and giving the game another go.... Ludeon releases ANOTHER piddly little update adding almost nothing to the game, and it breaks all of my saves and my entire mod list. Now it refuses to load my earlier saved mod-list, and keeps all of my 88 or so mods in a constant state of ""now downloading""...
I believe I've found the fix through a pinned discussion link, but after dropping $25 on that damned Biotech DLC, I have absolutely no desire to spend another 2-4 hours just trying to resurrect my saves when Ludeon will just break them all again a month or 2 from now when they release the next piddling update.
Ludeon/Tynan, you are ruining your games by actively discouraging the mod base... the only actual life and soul behind the game you created... This game won't be truly great until you get out of the way and stop breaking it every 1-2 months.

11/23 edit: Waited almost a year, and came back to the game. The mods were still in ""downloading"" limbo. I wiped my mod list. went back and picked out the ones i wanted to try again, and re-subscribed/downloaded them.... after starting up, surprise-surprise! all the newly downloaded mods are still exhibiting the downloading issue.... Been almost a year, another year Ludeon continued to sell game copies and release updates for, but fixing a known problem(one that the playerbase figured a workaround for) is still an apparent non-priority to the dev team.",1672206135,1700768238,False,10,1,0.507627546787261963,1,True,False,False

You can be responsible for the deaths of hundreds that died because of your mindless crusade to avenge something that can't be brought back....

You can harvest, torture, brainwash your prisoners, or simply sell them to slavery :D

All jokes aside, Rimworld is an extremely immersive game that can be addicting for some. The simple art style can get you hooked without a strain on your eyes, the chill soundtrack and completely random events like man-hunting yorkshire terriers, an aurora lighting the night sky, a stranger flying on your territory from an escape pod, an infamous event known as a ""Zzzzt"" exploding stuff it shouldn't have... They had to put a clock telling you the real world time in the in game UI. I love rimworld.

You establish a colony on a remote planet, which provides a sense of adventure and exploration. The game is driven by an intelligent AI storyteller, which ensures that no two playthroughs are the same, adding a layer of unpredictability and excitement.

What makes RimWorld truly fun is its deep mechanics. You can build structures, benches, weapons, and more, which gives a sense of accomplishment and progression. The game also has a complex social system, where your colonists interact with each other, forming relationships, rivalries, and even getting into fights. This adds a layer of depth and realism to the game, making your colonists feel more like real people than just game characters.

RimWorld is built on failure, where the unexpected is the norm, and every decision can lead to dramatic consequences. This creates a sense of tension and urgency, making every decision matter and every victory feel earned. The game’s difficulty can be adjusted to suit your playstyle, ensuring that it remains challenging and engaging no matter your skill level.

Overall, RimWorld offers a unique, engaging, and fun gaming experience that is a must-play for fans of strategy, simulation, or survival games. Its rich mechanics, dynamic storytelling, and deep social system make it a game that you can play for hours on end, always discovering something new and exciting.",1700753450,1700753450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You'll go through times where you'll get bored of it, surely, then come back for more. Your colony and map is randomly generated and it'll never be the same, since you can practically terraform with the amount of construction and farming you can do as you reach later into the game. If you have a good enough PC, you can practically build a sprawling city that consumes the entirety of the map - if you want to.

A good chunk of the community play it as a strategy game, but it's truly a sandbox where you'll get the most out of it by trying to tell a genuine story (in my opinion) through your colony: whether it's cannibal super-humans, or isolationist cattle ranchers.

I got it way back when, and it was only around $25 USD, but even at it's price today, I'd still get it - it's my most played game on Steam.

The base game is great but after 2,000+ hours in, I no longer play the same game. Mods have taken over. Endless replayability from endless mod load-outs.

As of now I am playing a high fantasy medieval run with mods. Its possible to modify the game to be steampunk, medieval, or you can amplify the default futuristic. The only thing I haven't seen done is primitive mod enhancements. Still waiting on my cavemen wars.  You can even mod the overall feel of combat with the mod combat extended which most proclaim makes the combat more like X-Com at its most brutal. 

This game is often considered hardcore in a traditional sense by players but you have the option for reloads when you start the game. If you choose hardcore, prepare yourself for failure. You're going to fail. Enjoy the experience of it and try to laugh. If thats not your thing, yo can play with saves, and you're going to need them!

Best strategy game I've seen in a while. My favorate part of the newest update, the Wanderlust update, would have to be the abillaty to look at the world in a Circler form/3d instead of a Flat form/2d, and the ability to now form Caravans to attack or trade with your Neighbors. The ways that you can build your Colony('s)/Base('s) is endless, weather you want to tunnle into Mountains like Dwarves or build a Village surounded by walls. Would recomend this to anyone who has a Creative spirit and or wants to make digital life suffer.

Yeah this game is still great. Even when it was still in alpha it was already a rough gem. Took years to polish it, but right now it's one of the best colony manager on the market. Also, more mods that you'll ever need in your lifetime.

I got addicted to this game over the years. But it's a good addiction!


Original review:One of the best game I played. More than a game, a space colony story driven simulation. You can do your best (or worst). You can be a good leader, an inhuman space pirate commander, or a shaman tree hugger. From bionics, to genetics, you can modify your colonist to the DNA level.

With thousands of mods, maps, scenarios, the possibilities are unlimited. Playable, replayable, forever.

This game can contain warcrimes and can reveal the worst in you.

I immediately thought of Rimworld for The “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award.

Don't ask. That's just the kind of game this is. 

Sticking to a set of morals is entirely up to the player. When you're out in the space-boonies, things...happen.

Building your own colony makes every game very different from the others. Its still being update by game developers by adding new dlcs and also new content to Vanilla game. Its has a ton of mods you can try to change your gameplay. It also owns an Multiplayer mod, which is not so stable, but still gives an amazing feeling to make your own colony and commit war crimes together with your friends. :)

It never has a real sale more then 20% off either despite the game being old at this point and its DLC is extremely overpriced for what they are.
The reality is this is a 5$ game and if it was priced that way I wouldn't be so hard on it.

Replayability is insane, modding community (and workshop too) is amazing, and it’s super lightweight. It’s one of like 3 games I can reliably play on my laptop when I’m out of town. It’s also full of insurmountable and irreversible bs that makes me want to stop playing, but it’s still so easy to come back to and start over.

The music is incredible, the DLC is amazing, and the amount of personalization (whether in or out of your control) is phenomenal. Each character in your “story” is someone to get attached to, you can become immersed in their day to day lives, feel excited when they find love, dread when they die, etc. 

I will say that the price does run a bit high even on sale, but given its reputation and the mileage I have gotten from it, it’s not really a complaint of mine. I do wish that the game had native multiplayer support, since it currently relies on mods for that.

1. Game-play:
1.1. General description: The game begins with the selection of an ideology (which may require a separate DLC), some pawns (for which genetic modifications may necessitate an additional DLC), and a map to inhabit. You'll be also presented with the option to edit the starting scenario and enable or disable some extra challenging features.
1.2. Map generation: This is a very pleasant experience. The game requires constant thinking of new and original strategies to establish the defences and the maps are always varied except for the enemies’ settlements. However, there is no special reward for annihilating the enemies apart from any potential map loot. I would also appreciate if the maps and roads had more significance. For instance, one could create the initial settlement in a remote location but the enemies would still manage to locate it.
1.3. Pawns: The resemblance between pawns and real life humans in decision making are uncanny and well-thought. I have played the game for 400 hours and it still manages to astonish me. Each pawn has its own personality. However, I would greatly appreciate an improvement in path finding. Occasionally, when I instruct a pawn to escape from a furious elephant, the pawn chooses to follow a zigzag path rather than a straight one, thus being killed by the aforementioned predatory animal.
1.4 Ideology: Instead of reviewing the DLC itself, I will express my opinion on how this DLC integrates with the game itself. Ideology provides some additional benefits such as making all your pawns “night-owls” but many of these traits are overridden by the game’s core mechanics. For instance, when choosing an ideology that makes your pawns prefer the night and darkness, they still opt to travel at daytime between settlements, which is very frustrating. Moreover, you are trying to create a story about “the only survivors of a great empire” and suddenly “aunt Mary with the same ideology as your pawns” enters the map and spoils everything you have envisioned about the significance of your ideology.
1.5 Genetics: Similar to the “ideology DLC”, I would have appreciated the opportunity to share my opinion on how this DLC interacts with the game; However, due to my limited playtime with it, I am not competent to comment on it.
1.6 Other minor issues or suggestions:
1.6.1 Electricity and power: I would welcome a quick method to dismantle only the power lines and not the entire base. Moreover, the short circuit event should be avoidable by research or improved power lines or at least have a valid explanation to occur.
1.6.2 More defensive options: The existing in-game official methods of protecting the base are inadequate. It is illogical that one can construct a spaceship but cannot equip a turret with a mini-gun.
1.6.3 Research: As an experienced gamer, I am dissatisfied with the impact of the “tribal faction” on the research speed.
1.6.4 Limit on the number of pawns: I would aspire to have an empire with a sizable army but I can only sustain a colony with 25 pawns before the game gets angry and throw everything it can to destroy me.
1.6.5 Multi-player: I would greatly desire an official mode to enable a co-op multiplayer. My brother and I occasionally play this game in mirrored (identical map and pawns and everything) to compare our progress. Therefore, if there was an official mode that allowed us to have factions on the same map and to interact or compete with each other, I would gladly purchase the full DLCs and game for him as well.

2. Story: The game features a generative story-telling with various patterns that one can select. However, this generative story-telling is unlike anything one has experienced in other games and it often surprises and entertains.

3. Graphics: I love the simplified and minimalistic look of this game.

4. Sound: I love the existing soundtrack, especially the track titled “Fealty”.

5. Value: The game is worth every penny for its endless entertainment and enjoyment. The developer clearly invested his love and passion into this game and merits what he is requesting for it. However, because the regional situation I am currently in, I cannot afford to purchase DLCs for my brother & I believe this is a regional economical situation that many of my friends are troubled with. I love this game and respect the developer too much hence I would not resort to any shortcuts to obtain a copy however I hope the developer can reduce the price a bit.

Mods are a core part of the game at this point, there are many things that mods add, which makes it, in my opinion, not worth it to play vanilla. But this is not a bad thing! Developers put a lot of work into making this game fully modable, and release updates and DLCs which expand modability even further. If you were looking for a sandbox where you can harvest the organs of your enemies or fight high-tech insect-like mechs with bows, then this is the game for you.

Some more defined metrics:

*Game play*: The game has an impressive and vast amount of characters to make, locations, scenarios, difficulties, objectives, etc. You can even create specific scenarios. The DLC adds even more content and expansions for a game that already has hundreds of hours of playability. Years of support and care by the dev!

*Running and Mods*: The game runs well, I haven't encountered any noticeable bugs throughout my play through so far. The mod support is amazing, from in depth things like psychology to war crime meme mods-the community has it all. 

*Tutorials and Guide*: The game is fairly easy for an entirely new players to pick up in a couple of hours with tool tips, a wiki, and a forum. There's also a baseline tutorial.

Overall, it's one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it.

You start a game with some number of colonists, and the goal is just to survive.  There are a number of ""win"" conditions, but my suggestion is to just ignore them, the real game is satisfying your hierarchy of needs.  Do your colonists have food and shelter from the elements?  Do they have barricades and guns for the approaching raiders and dangerous animals?  Are you going to play match-maker and set their work schedules to promote friendships and romance?  If you choose to role-play, you can even go so far as to project self-esteem and respectability on to your colonists, which brings us to Rimworld's selling point:  Rimworld is more of a story generator than a ""game.""  There are conditions you can meet to get the screen to fade to black and roll credits, but you don't play Rimworld to get to the end, you play the game to watch and influence your colonists' stories as they unfold.  I once had a colony that was starving; I hadn't grown enough crops and had already hunted all the animals on the map - all of the animals except for a small group of rhinos off in the corner.  So I took four colonists armed with bows and arrows and left the one pacifist colonist back at the base.  The hunting expedition went wrong almost immediately; my colonists opened fire on one of the rhinos and instead of fleeing, it got enraged and charged my colonists.  This also set off the two nearby rhinos, so I had three rhinos bearing down on four of my colonists who were pretty much just throwing sharp sticks at the beasts.  The rhinos dropped my first colonist pretty much immediately.  I had two colonists pelt the beasts while my fourth and last able-bodied colonist fell back to put some distance between them, but it was no use.  The two colonists went down almost as quickly as the first guy and the fourth colonist could not output enough damage or run fast enough to escape the animals.  In just a matter of in-game minutes, I had four colonists laying on the ground, gored by a trio of frothing mad rhinos who were now rampaging around and banging on the doors of my base while my fifth and final asthmatic, sickly, pacifist pawn cowered inside.

""Welp, that does it."" I said to myself, as I hit the button to speed up time in the game, so the rhinos would hurry up, break through the doors, and kill my final colonist (I wasn't going to send her outside to her death; I'm not a monster), but then, the banging stopped.  I looked at the unconscious rhino laying at the front door, bleeding out all over the welcome mat, then at the two other rhinos, who were now raging on the opposite side of the base, limping from injuries and blood loss.  I looked at my asthmatic colonist and then at her friends downed on the other side of the map, rapidly fading from this world.  It's funny how attached you can become to these little limbless potatoes, I thought to myself, as I held my breath, praying the other two rhinos wouldn't follow as I sent my last pawn to try and save her friends.

Everyone made it out alive.  Some may have been missing bits and pieces, but everyone was alive, and from that point on, I had a colony of rhino hunters.  I found better weaponry and used smarter tactics, but every rhino that wandered onto that map knew swift and unwavering justice.

And that's just one aspect of story that can naturally emerge from gameplay if you're willing to use a bit of imagination.  All-in-all, Rimworld is a simply fantastic and incredibly compelling game.",1669425471,1700631191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros:[/b] Sim like with decent management options to get one started. The best way to label the game is a story simulator, as you react to situations thrown at your colony over and over. Gameplay works akin to an RTS, but it is more sims than anything else, so don't go expecting like warcraft. The simple visuals prevent the potential gore filled events and scenarios from being too real, so you can get invested without feeling like it gets too much. 
[b]Cons:[/b] There will be times where nothing happens, which is part of life, but can be boring. It can be tempting to reload a save when your favorite colonist is wounded or dies, but don't do it, your overall colony's narrative will be better. You can often find yourself down hours out of no where despite nothing happening as well as you become invested in your digital people.
[b]Recommend to:[/b] Fans of sim games, slow paced management games, and those who enjoy watching systems work and fight each other in interesting ways.
Overall: You can make sofas out of human leather. lol.

Old Review: 

If you like simulators and story generators, then you'll love this one. It's one of the best.

Gameplay:
Traditional management styled gameplay. Tell units through priority systems what the should do. The more people you get on your colony, the more complex it gets. It's simple gameplay, but the stories that can get generated from it is what makes it. Doing well building your farm? Bam, suddenly a raid and your best farmer gets shot and loses and arm, and you get your scientist working to get mechanical limbs researched so you can get him working again. You basically create a new breathing world each time. Looks up comics and stories on rimworld to see how awesome these can get.

Graphics:
I like the drawn style, but I can see why others may not. It works for the game.

Overall, it's great for those who just want to chill and watch something grow. Don't expect gameplay to be the immersive aspect, but how it all comes together that does it.",1603215084,1700629379,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

Apart from the many heart-wrenching stories that could be told, there are also the funniest things you'd get the pleasure of witnessing. A tortoise taking down an entire colony? Check. Someone fleeing manhunting yorkshire terriers? Check. A person flipping out because they ate on the floor? All too common. Raiders wandering straight into an insect hive? We've got that too. Aside from that, RimWorld's prolific modding community allows almost anything to be possible. Want to be neolithic-only? Want to make stuff out of thin air? Want to zap your foes with magic? Want to satisfy humanity's... ahem... baser urges? There are mods for that! 

Aside from those, RimWorld has a ton of possibilities for your inner sadist; you can eat human meat, create hats out of human skin, inflict all manner of war-crimes upon your foes, harvest the organs of everyone and their mothers... it's so prevalent that some fans have created a checklist to break as many rules of the Geneva Convention as possible! Of course, there's still in-game punishment - people won't like it if they eat human meat without being cannibals, for example.

The DLCs add so much flavour to the game as well, tying in nicely with the many mods.

No matter your playstyle, whether you want to sing Kumbaya and release every raider you capture, or whether you'd rather make authoritarian leaders look like Boy Scouts, whether you like a challenge or to chill, the desert or the snow, a colony that's closely-knit or one where every pawn's family tree is a ladder, there's something for you.

Game play: Pace depends on the settings you choose. Game is easy to pick up with lots of nuance that makes each colony unique from every other colony. Good for hours of entertainment. The story of the game is what you make of it. 10/10

Controls and UI: Very easy to understand and pick up though with all the information on screen it can be a bit overwhelming at first. But the games built in help function (which you can turn on and off depending on what you want at any point in the game) really helps you when your first starting your first colony. The UI is very well organized and the controls are very simple and easy to use. 10/10

Overall this is one of the best games I've ever played. Its worth what ever price it is currently at the time your considering buying it. The modding community for this game is very active and extensive; the DLCs also add quite a bit to the games (thought the game is a 10/10 even without mods or the DLCs).

Sell everyone drugs and take all their money. Using said money build an archotech (bionic) super soldier. Feed said super soldier every drug enhancement available.

Rocker Friend enjoys the company and tries to replace his lost love, but ultimately still notices something missing.
His mental state deteriorates faster than we can keep up, no amount of sprucing up his room, nor does Replacement getting chummy is fixing it; but they both help a bit.
The next raid sees another friend lobotomise Replacement with a chain shotgun; he fires into the fray right as Replacement darts in to get a quick shivving on a raider named Lamp.
He dies instantly, and the death cripples Rocker Friend.
The stress is too much now and Rocker Friend has a minor mental break.
Rocker Friend traipses over to the graveyard and digs up Black Friend to console himself - and promptly eats him.
The fact Rocker Friend has seen not just a corpse, but the corpse of a good friend (twice), and feels terrible about becoming a newly recognised cannibal instantly destroys the remnants of his mind.
Rocker Friend enters into a major mental break and roams the halls, unnervingly quiet, until he dies of starvation.

Since they were only out in the open for about 3 days eating whatever they could find, the 3 went into a mental break and started setting fire to everything wooden on the map.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:01 AM]
I still used wood generators.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:01 AM]
So I locked up the whole family in a 4x5 block, reinforced metal walls, and left them there.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:02 AM]
Blocked the door for my colonists so they wouldn't feed anyone.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:02 AM]
Put a reversed air conditioner (cools on one side, heats on the other) - 45 degrees inside, constantly.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:03 AM]
When they started convulsing, I turned it off.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:03 AM]
They survived for about 15 days because some died before others, and there was no food.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:03 AM]
So they were forced to eat the bodies of their own family.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:03 AM]
I waited for 2 to remain.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:04 AM]
I brought them to a hexagon full of traps and gave them a rib taken from the decomposing bodies as a weapon.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:04 AM]
And said, ""Fight, the winner gets to live.""

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:04 AM]
I think it was the son and the mother.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:04 AM]
I waited for her to get close to the map's edge.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:04 AM]
And shot her in the knees.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:05 AM]
Dragged her back to the block along with the bodies of the whole family.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:05 AM]
And left her languishing there.

heavenspace, [6/2/2022 3:05 AM]
The end.

- Warhammer 40k guardsmen fighting off Illithid hordes
- Organ harvesting Tolkien dwarves

2 DLC and 600 more hours of playtime later, time to update that evaluation (original one left down there if you wanna read it too). Gonna focus on the 2 new dlcs. So much new stuff added that improves QoL as well as adding content. And oh boy, what content it is ! Royalty added a new faction with its share of quests, a new ending, psy powers, and so on. Ideology on the other hand brought the belief system, allowing a deeper and more immersive customisation to your colony and playstyle. Wanna play as nudist raiders ? dwarves under the mountain ? blind and scarred ? Tree lovers ? Cowboys in the far west ? You can do it all and much more ! Those 2 dlcs were not expected but they sure are worth it ! And while i'm writing this, most of my mods are already updated to 1.3 so i'm not even losing much from my usual modlist. (some mods even got merged into the main game as QoL updates)
In any case, i sure do recommend that game ! And now, excuse me while i go back in there turning my archotect fanatics tunnelers into true mechanized warriors searching for the old one's sanctuary !

vvv old evaluation down there vvv

Played it a bit, liked it.

More seriously, this game is good. 

Vanilla, you'll meet a good challenge between the RNG from the storytellers, your dreams and your own mistakes. You'll play, and lose. Try again, and lose again, maybe even faster who knows ? But you'll come back and give it another go. Before you notice it, it's been 6 hours spent in a row on 3 or 4 colonies. You'll lower the difficulty, or try another storyteller, maybe even check some youtube videos to learn and understand the basics (i would recommend Eviltrick's channel and his stream, really good fella that will answer your questions if you have any, as well as the chat). Then you'll try again, and maybe do a bit better. Maybe a lot better ! You'll feel good about it ! Then you'll get crushed by mechs or a pirate raid that drop right in the middle of your colony.
Before you know it, you've been playing this game for months. few hours over there, the whole day over here.
Maybe you'll even manage to get the hang of all the trading part of the game, deal well with your Ancient Danger ?

And when you finally feel like the game is good but you could use a bit more challenge....
let me welcome you...
to the mods.
Gameplay overhaul ? New Factions ? QoL mods ? 
You can have it all !
Big fan of Lovecraft ? Get the Call of Cthulhu mod pack ! with factions, items, craft, creatures, Lovecraft himself as a storyteller and more !
Believe me, if you liked the vanilla game, you'll like the modded version. Get yourself a mod that allows you to create and manage your own mod list and you'll be able to switch between them with a few clicks and enjoy multiple ways of seeing your colony burn in agony ! what ? survive and reach the end game ? yeah, that too. maybe.. probably..",1543253594,1700598643,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
