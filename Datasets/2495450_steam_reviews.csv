There was a Japanese village called AraAra, nine miles southwest of Kame House and forty northeast of Wicked City. It was a prosperous town, blessed with blue rivers, tall mountains, and peace.

But one year, the people of AraAra became very sad. Although Christmas was still coming this year - hard and fast and strong, and perhaps a little impatient - it was NOT, tragically, going to be a white Christmas. With a forlorn shake of his head, the Japanese Chief Minister of Meteorology predicted a high percent chance of a clear Christmas for AraAra. At best, he said, it might be sortof, like, yellowish. Everyone, from the fishers to the Menko players to the more Vigilant ""office"" workers, felt great melancholy settle over them.

But then, when all hope died and the hour of dryness was at hand, the people recalled a strange occurrence six months ago. Although it was possible they'd only imagined it, they seemed to remember it snowing for 21 days last summer! Snow covered the candy shop, exercise track, and mountain pass. The Ichinose residence had been especially snowed all over, come to think of it.  Could such a thing have really happened? The blue ones with frowns drawn on their faces, before they resumed scrolling through depressing headlines all night, said it was just an optimistic dream. The same way love was a chemical reaction in the brain, the soul didn't exist, and we would all die screaming any minute now.

Just as the people were about to appeal to the gods...Chad-Kun returned to Ara-Ara.

Chad, OVER-EIGHTEEN despite being four feet tall and still believing in Santa Claus, had arrived for another vacation with his aunt and cousins, and also his Uncle Uncle. 

And from the moment the door closed behind Chad? Well, the people say the slightest little flake drifted from the sky and settled onto the bathroom window.

But it was just a flake. If there was truly a causative connection between Chad's presence and snow, he had a lot more micromanaging to do this season. Experience points and minigames, shrine donations and ingredient gathering. Achievement unlocking, floor wiping, mood boosting. Chatting with Uncle so he would disappear. Chad may have been the god of protein incarnated into human form, but divinity was not God Mode. It meant only a higher sense of responsibility. While Yui, Rio, and Aunt Miyuki may have been in the holiday spirit from Night One, there were so many more outside the house in need of Christmas cheer.

Chad sighed. And undid his pants. With his blessings, it was going to be the whitest Christmas AraAra had ever seen, and the snow would stick for many months to come.",1705492142,1705659044,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

So there I was, scrolling through the Steam store when 'Winter Memories' caught my eye. 'Why not?' I thought, but plot twist – the game hit me with a 'Please play Summer Time Memories first' message. Talk about commitment! So, off I went on a gaming detour. Now, here's the scoop: I was expecting your typical H-game steaminess (spoiler alert: there's plenty), but hold onto your hats, folks, because there's an actual plot! I know, right? Between dodging love scenes like a pro, I found myself wrapped up in a story that's surprisingly good. It's like finding a hidden plot treasure in a sea of 'ahem' passionate moments. And guess what? There's even more to do in the game than just... well, you know. Now, I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for Dojin Otome's next masterpiece.

Just don't forget to get the nude patch, not gonna tell you where to get it as last time I got banned for posting the link. Good luck, I'm sure you'll find it.

At first I was kinda worried with the whole ""time passes as you move from room to room"", but that wasn't that big of a deal if you buy the upgrade that slows down time.
All of the minigames from summer memories are back including the menko one & the controls are just as janky. What makes these minigames superior to summer memories ones is that if you have played every minigame atleast once you unlock the ability to just skip them for free rewards. The menko one you can skip a lot easier by just spamming the attack/defence up items you can get from the lottery until your menko is so broken that the game just gives you the win as the minigame starts.

Also as I mentioned before, by completing ingame achievements you will unlock very powerful abilities. Hints to said achievements you can get from donating at the shrine. You can also get hints on what to do with certain characters route by buying charms from the shrine. Trust me, you will need these as the game really doesn't tell you what to do. Here's an example ""Objective: Find a way to help her"" and spoilers, the solution isn't anywhere near the girl your helping.

Sleep sex scenes have gotten a total overhaul with the main cast. Instead of them being cutscenes they become minigames where you gotta balance out characters awakeness & the mood. More mood, more memories. You can also have sleep sex with the side characters now if you have completed their route & have their ending available. The game uses the old cutscene model for these scenes, so it's not completely gone for those who enjoyed them.

The game also vastly increases the areas where you can have sex in & depending on how much you do it, it will create a noticeable mess for your uncle to find increasing his awareness. I recommend getting the ability that lets you clean the room if you're scared of getting a game over from leaving a room FULL of sticky white stains. It's kinda nuts how messy you can make these rooms & hallways.

At around midway point a festival arrives that's full of minigames. These minigames are all rly difficult, but they also all have unique skills as rewards for getting the highscores. If you don't feel like losing all of your money on these rigged games there is another way of getting these skills, the secret shop. The only hint I'm gonna give for this is that it's only available rly late at night. Also the items the secret shop sells aren't cheap, so keep that in mind.

The only things I didn't like about this game were the occasional visual glitch & a typo, but I can over look these when the game is so damn good.
Also found it kinda funny that in the intro the game states that all of the characters are +18, but you play as a character who isn't even in high school.",1705273303,1705273303,True,2,0,0.471516788005828857,0,True,False,False

So, when I stumbled upon this gem of a game, minigames and a captivating tale with beautiful ladies - I knew I had stumbled upon something special.

After the unforgettable summer memories you've made half a year ago, Yui, Rio, and Miyuki are back"" sets the stage for a continuation of a remarkable story, and from the very beginning, I was immediately drawn into this enchanting world. The change of seasons, depicted through the falling snow, adds a layer of beauty and serenity to the gameplay that truly immerses you.

One aspect that instantly caught my attention was the intricate and engaging storyline. The developers have masterfully crafted a narrative that seamlessly weaves together moments of adventure, romance, and mystery. The nostalgic feelings from the previous summer memories blended perfectly with the new page of the story, creating an emotionally rich experience that kept me invested from start to finish.

Speaking of the characters, Miyuki, the aunt and undoubtedly the best character, brings a breath of fresh air to the game. Her presence adds depth and complexity to the storyline, creating a compelling dynamic that allows players to forge a deeper connection with the characters. Miyuki's charms and her involvement in the plot showcase a well-developed and relatable character, making her a favorite among players.

The gameplay, bolstered by a variety of immersive minigames, offers a refreshing twist to the traditional hentai formula. Whether it's engaging in thrilling battles, solving challenging puzzles, or old lady's, there's never a dull moment. The addition of minigames not only adds variety but also allows for moments of respite, ensuring a well-rounded gaming experience.

The visuals and aesthetics of the game are nothing short of breathtaking. The art style captures the winter scenery flawlessly, evoking a sense of wonder and beauty with each frame. From the detailed character designs to the picturesque landscapes, every aspect of the game's visuals is a feast for the eyes.

I must also commend the developers for their attention to detail in ensuring a polished and bug-free experience. The game runs smoothly, providing a seamless journey through this enchanting winter world.",1704576414,1704966402,True,1,0,0.510638296604156494,0,True,False,False

The game is ""shorter"" than the previous, as winter break is only 18 days in comparison to Summer's 30 days. This time around, most of the heroines in town already know you - so you'll miss out on ALOT of context if you don't play the prequel. There's actual time mechanics, going by minutes and hours, as opposed to just time chunks. There's WAY more you can do like: Part-time Jobs, digging through people's closets, taking pictures of everything, cooking meals, training your body, hiking, etc. There are two new heroines, who are just as amazing as the other 8, and fit in extremely well in the story. The achievements you can unlock now give you special perks &  abilities to make the game a little easier to manage. The game feels WAY LESS grindy than its predecessor, and that's a huge improvement. There's even a mechanic that lets you rewind time by 10 days while keeping all your progress, via the shrine offering box. (So technically the game is 28 days). All of this combined gives you a far more complete and LONGER experience than the first game. 

I won't talk too much about the H-stuff, but many of the scenarios feel fresh and erotic. Many of these scenes build on the personality/moments the heroines had in the first game, so you might lose some sentimentality/context if you play this first. Make no mistake, the pixel art is pretty good at conveying the H-scenes, and on occasion there are even better CGs to complement them. There are some translation errors, as well as image-loading errors when gaining access to certain scenes. Be sure to SAVE VERY OFTEN. The game will be lost to a perpetual black screen - forcing you to exit the game manually. 

All in all, hope doujin-otome has it in him for a DLC. With the inclusion of the three H-statuses (lewd, service, perversion), it seems that there should be room for extra scenes for each of the heroines, just like the first one. Full price, this is worth - but even moreso on sales. Personally, I'd buy for 10-15$.",1704837133,1704837133,True,19,0,0.697709202766418457,0,True,False,False

Winter Memories follows the story of Summer Memories and the path of our hero ""Boku-kun"", who has returned this festive holiday to satiate his desires. With many scenes and plenty of heroines to conquer, this game is a solid one for the collection. 

I personally recommend getting the Patch from Kagura Games to allow access to all of the H-Content. This makes the game more enjoyable and adds plenty of collectables rather than you just playing the mini games.

Like the first game, your saves can carry over in a new game making it a little easier to conquer them. This allows you to play and collect at your own pace.",1704756186,1704756186,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You play as Boku (or any name you choose him to have), you are going to spend your winter with your thirsty aunt and her 2 daughters in the town that you also spent your summer in, besides the 3 main heroines there are 5 side heroines that you can also do l_wd things to, you will slowly make your character be able to do more things and unlock more positions/situations and things to do around the city (fishing, working as a waiter, taking pictures), you also have a time limit of 18 days, but it doesn't really matter because when you restart the game you will keep every stat and be able to just quickly go to a different ending
The story is wholesome, funny and you are guaranteed to like at least one of the heroines, you are never forced to do the deed with any of them so if you dislike someone you can just feel free to ignore them
The minor gameplay elements are fairly simple and easy to suceed on
The art is pretty decent if you like pixel art and don't mind anime proportions
This game is a direct sequel to Summer Memories, it has the same heroines but with improved mechanics, more things to do and a bit easier (in the first game it took me quite a while to get a comfortable amount of stamina but i could reach 1000 easily in the first 5 days), playing the first game is not really that needed, in fact with the amount of content that this game has over the first one i would recommend buying this one standalone
It is in several ways more of the same, but it is still enjoyable and improves on the previous entry enough that i would recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind the MC's... dubious age and the inc_stuous themes
It also runs in my I5-2450M notebook with no graphics card, stutters a lot but it didn't affect the gameplay

========

The game adds the following major improvements
- Anime PiP view (every position has a HQ animation for every character)
- Access every girl's room/apartment
- Cross-over events with friends/relatives
- Interactive Yokai mode for the main 3

This game is a massive expansion on the Summer Memories universe. The spirit of debauchery in this game comes from the Orgy mode and cross-over scenes, more than anything else. But the acts themselves are no more depraved than Summer Memories, in some ways, they are less so. 

My guess to why this is, is that having a HQ animation of the Summer Memories Yui bathroom scene could be traumatizing. Likewise, there is public bathroom scene in the main route of a side character, which is 5 times less depraved than what I've seen in hentai. Not a single girl thought to clean up another girls box from my splooge.

Despite having other male characters, with graphics... Mentai, Husband, Uncle... non of them ever join you in handing out discipline. There is even a drunk guy who walks in on you... but doesn't join in. Lots of missed opportunities that hopefully get remedied with a DLC.

Technically speaking, the game is still windowed only, which is crazy for a game of this scale. It doesn't work with SteamLink, it still crashes every 10 minutes on SteamDeck (recollection mode is more stable for some reason). I wish anime view was larger... and sharper, for some reason it's not as sharp as the hero graphics. There is a community patch for hero graphics on discord that helped ease the pain of the crashes tremendously. 

The English translation is good but inconsistent, it feels rushed. Lots of characters have events that need you to show up before noon or before the evening, but have their task list showing the wrong time. The speech bubbles and the shops also have graphics translated, leading to errors and breaking the feel. Like, why is there a Tatami room in a town that speaks English? Why is my Shinto temple shrine maiden moaning in roman characters.

Overall, it's great to see such a massive expansion. That said, I think Ikeda needs to watch more Hentai... I've watched over 2,000 H series, I expect him to be as, or more, cultured. I'm also exited about his exploration of other engines... (try Godot). This is has good ROI and I can't think of a larger hentai universe to explore.

Amazing game, keep it up!

Initial impressions
===

Welcome to a steamy winter wonderland where the snowflakes aren't the only things getting plowed. This game is so hot, it'll melt the snow right off your roof, and you'll be left with a steamy, incestuous mess. The boy in this game has more action than Santa's naughty list, and let me tell you, it's a wild sleigh ride! So get ready, and enjoy this twisted tale of family bonding. Just remember, in this game, it's not just the weather that's frosty!

This game has already been for sale for 6 months in it's domestic market, being polished by only the most cultured of Japanese individuals, to create what is unquestionably, an absolute banger.",1704500689,1704736226,True,12,9,0.584420859813690186,1,True,False,False

#1 - This is a true sequel. When it says you should play Summer Memories first, that's not just a marketing gimmick... characters will often refer back to events in the previous game, and without that background knowledge, it's definitely possible to get a bit lost on why someone would matter to Goku (or whatever you rename the MC to, though it's capped at a 4-letter-long name). Further, you basically start with the main love interests ready to do basically whatever, which is a bit odd for a game like this but makes sense when, again, it's treated as a sequel. So playing the previous game, Summer Memories, does help knowing what is up in the plot.

#2 - The mini-games can still be clunky. The math mini-game begs for the ability to just push a button on the keyboard that corresponds to the right answer, but nope, still have to use the mouse to stop a gauge when it's in the vague area of the answer you want. 

#3 - There are more mini-games, though. Which is a positive point, as there's fishing, dish washing, and math problems from the previous game, but also a waiting-tables mini-game a few more one-offs.

#4 - Time works completely differently in this, compared to the game before it. In Summer Memories, most things the player did took an action away from a stock of action points you got in each phase of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night). In Winter Memories, there are no action points, and instead there's a clock that loses minutes for each action taken. I actually prefer Winter Memories approach, as relatively mundane actions now cost 5-10 minutes (buying a drink from a vending machine, talking to someone, etc.), meaning that minor actions are proportionately less time consuming now. What I mean is: in Summer Memories, if you have 3 action points in a phase, you could do any 3 things, but some of the things might be very, very minor... in Winter Memories, you might only still do 3-4 major actions in a phase of the day, but you also can use the extra 5-10 minutes here or there to buy a drink/item without consuming an action that could have been used to play a mini-game.

#5 - The game world is a bit expanded in this. Where the nameless, faceless NPCs in Summer Memories largely spouted single-lines of text, here a few are shopkeepers (on the new Main Road district) or have a bit more meaningful dialogue. There's also more room to the house, which is interesting... this now has halls and a tea-house room, so the game space is larger in some ways, and it goes beyond the main house as there are now apartment buildings and a few other locations. That said, I think the school district is totally gone, so a few things were changes rather than additions.

#6 - Vigilance got a few tweaks. It's not just noise, now, as you have to also clean up a room afterwards if it's a common room Uncle could wander into. This is a tweak more than a real game mechanic change, though: in the beginning, you do not start with the Clean Up skill, so the first two or three days, you might have to really watch where you do stuff. But once you use points to get the Clean Up skill, it's just 10 stamina to clean a room, so the trade-off is minimal and the skill/mechanic becomes more of a nuisance as you have to remember to use it.


Overall, it's a pixel-art H-game that has minor improvements over its predecessor. On sale, I think it's worth a recommend, but like I wrote about Summer Memories, there are other NSFW games that do things better. BaD has far better plot and graphics for about the same price... and Koikatsu Party does the anime-style approach with better graphics and with character customization (though at a far higher price).

So, I recommend, and it's probably marginally better than Summer Memories, but it's not perfect.",1704650526,1704650526,True,2,0,0.551228940486907959,0,True,False,False

The best part is still it's stunning pixel art, complemented by enhanced character poses, sprites, and animations. This amazing attention to detail ensures that you immerse yourself in your own little ""White Christmas,"" brimming with visual splendor. Moreover, the expanded setting offers a wealth of activities, eliminating the previous installment's tedious money-grinding aspect.

Pros- 
Short King Protag - there's a slight hint of deviance in him but overall wholesome standards you can't expect your everyday Male Protagonist to have. 
Girls  - While I'm down bad for Suzuka (I'm a sucker for girls in glasses), All the romance options are valid and before you judge me, they're technically not my family haha. 
Minigames - Very simple and fun you forget this was made in RPG Maker. 

Cons - 
Grinding - Personally I like the pacing once you know what you're doing but for anyone going blind you will most likely abuse the New Game Plus to carry over to get the ultimate ending, but don't worry it is possible to get the ultimate ending in your first try with days to spare. You can sidestep this con if you seek walkthrough guides, or if you acknowledgeable with RPG maker, you can mess with the save editor online.
Uncle - Understandably the one obstacle to Alabama maxing your family in a single day but he does give you good tips if you avoid guides. 
Wordplay - A lot of the quest tips mention late-night (an unlockable time of day), but sometimes they mean evening hours, or dusk hours, probably an translation oversight but it is bad combing the map at Night when it was meant to be evening/dusk.

It feels like the first game with just a different skin. You're going through the same stuffs, NPCs, and mini-games (with an extra). It's like there's no actual efford to make this game a different one. They just follow the same path and made an exact copy of the first game just because it sold so well back then.

Story is almost the same. Just changing from building relationships to regaining the past relationships again.

In the first game I find time, money, and stamina management lowkey fun. I used to love going for a new game without activating NG+ bonuses to experience that kind of gameplay, by trying to achieve a 100% in one run. 

This second game isn't doing it for me. Stamina management is non-existence. Time management, also non-existence since you don't have many things to do throughout the day, and you can make it even easier by upgrading the perk. Money management is also non-existence since the level up bonus is too op in that regard.

This is the sequel to Summer Memories, which is probably the best selling Japenis indie hentai game. This game sold like 80k and Summer sold like 100k. You should pick up Summer Memories before playing this one, they are both great.

As for the sexy part. This game is better and more polished in many ways. The dev added a flat chest milf and a big bobba waifu. There are sexy interaction events between the girls, so you can have a threesome. But why stop at threesome, when you can have three big bobba babe at onece. Near the endgame you can call three girls of your choice to have fun in a hotel. So yes, you can f the flat chest mommy with her definitely legal aged daughter. Or just have a wholesome family outing with your Aunt and cousins, Alabama style.

The dev improved a lot on the pacing of the events and story with the girls. You do quest and bond with the girls spiritually and pepely. Help them solve their life problems and stuff. And not spoiling the game much, the new big bobba waifu’s event is great. You cuck the shit out of her husband. 

Overall, this is a must buy hentai game. Just don’t try what the Shota did to your real cousins or you could if you are trying to save the declining birth rate in your country. RIP in peace Abe-sama.

You will love Winter Memories. 

Difference and similarities in gameplay loops:
- We now have 18 days to complete the game instead of 30 days like in Summer Memories.
- BUT time passing is now in minutes, with NPCs changing what they do every 1 hour. There is also a passive that halves the time passed. So don't worry about the seemingly shorter time you're given compared to the original.
- Minigames are almost identical, with some more new ones. math drills, social studies, dishwashing, and fishing. you know it.
- it's SO easy now to get ""caught"" by Uncle, especially if you do ""things"" with the girls in spots where he would see(hallways, his room, living room, etc.) since it would leave a certain white ""stain"" on the floors(and walls).

Lastly, do note that this is a direct sequel that assumes you have 100% completed Summer Memories with the DLC.

YOU are going to GET IN there and DOMINATE some thirsty bitches!

You bet your ass I have the Vickers hardness of RHENIUM DIBORIDE

Moshi moshi my dudes.

It's me, ya boy, Saber. Once again writing a review of one of if not THE best pixel game in the market. Last time, you are smothered by many women of age, now you can get smothered by even more girls and then some! If you are not getting your winter memories, this game is definitely for you. The weekend is just beginning, and Mondays are still infinite hours away from us, my brothers.

However, let's talk about the patch first: https://kaguraserver.com/KaguraGames/EN/patch/Winter%20Memories/Winter%20Memories%20EN%20Patch%20v1.02.exe

That should do it. Now, let me spoil you about Winter Memories.

First off, you are once again playing as the saviour of the declining birth rate, yourself. Your mission is to go to a remote place in the Japanese countryside. Your mission is to make girls into women, and women into your playhouse partner. The circumstances might look easy, but your execution and process to get to your goals are winding and aplenty. The village is full of people to interact with, and most of them women of age and voluptuous bodies. If you want them to turn your way and get invited into their tea parties at late at night, you must be careful and do your best to beat the obstacles before you.

Fortunately for you, you are NOT maidenless. Because of your action from last summer, you have mastered the art of breathing in many forms. Unfortunately for you, because of celibacy and too much brainrot from subpar doujins, you cannot remember anything other than the mating press. And so, you have to use everything in your disposal to learn, adapt, train, and evolve into the ideal you from six months before. This is clearly a stealth PSA of getting fit, and I hope you unmaidenless brothers IRL are lifting some kilograms.

Speaking of lifting, have you any idea how much the MC will lift for these women? Plenty. So much so that you could make him a record holder of the Olympics before the game even ended, and once you do new game plus, you will be playing as the strongest 18 year old boy with the figure of someone that should be ten years younger but not really because he is clearly of consenting and marriageable age! Do not think too hard, because this is a deliberate setup for women to lower their guards against a predator that looks innocent but can dominate them in so little of a second that you'd be hardpressed not to blink in disbelief.

Now, compared to Summer, you can have a lot more things to do with a lot more results to see. You can, for example, play a children's game against the people in town and also the shadowy cult that wants to suck the joy out of that very same card game. I wish I was joking about this, but you will be required to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel in shadow games! But, of course, you will then have an apparent to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-downward dog sum bitches! Aside from that highlight, you can also get a job like a normal boy of marriageable age should! And always remember that tax evasion is an obligation, so make sure your boss does not see that you have been feeding the same person ramen noodles for the past twenty hours and keeping all the profit to yourself! The best change in the game has to be the, ahem, ability to ask a special lady into a night establishment, where you can dominate them and their significant others were none the wiser. Honestly, there are still more changes that I could describe, but you got the money and you got the game already, so go and bust a nut yourself!

So what will happen in the future?

Well, I suspect there will be another APPEND, because of a lot of things still missing or are potentially missing in the game. I don't want to spoil much, but some part of the game clearly was designed with multiple party in mind. However, you can only bring one participant. There is also the missing scenes of oyakodon even though there should be a capability to have the egg and the chicken in the same bowl. It just screamed DLC, and you know what? The game is such a masterpiece I will GLADLY shell out my money for it. 

This game series need to continue until we get Summer Memories 2, and then Winter Memories 2. Honestly, I'd buy this game until the day I die. By then we will probably have 28 girls to romance, 12093 events to do, 928390 million hours of content, and also an implant because I'm already 120 years old and still playing All Year Memories 5. The best game in the series before I overdose from viagra and finally leave to romance satan in hell! 

Oh right, about the game. I'd suggest going out and play Menko, before you spot your PE teacher and ask her to teach you how to powerlift and work out. It's awesome how I don't have to catch bugs, and every other minigames give you a lot of money to spend. Also, it's not impossible to do everything in one playthrough if you're neurodivergent enough to map everything and plan everything to the letter. I would advise to just do NG+ and get more playtime in this kino game.

Enjoy your Winter Memories.

This game is one of the best in the genre and the year has only just started.

I swear it on Steamboat Willie finally joining the public domain.
