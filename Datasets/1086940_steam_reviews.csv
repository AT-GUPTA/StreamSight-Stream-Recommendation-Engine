But the game has its issues.

1. Companions often trigger traps when you are not directly controlling each one in turn base mode when you encounter them. Its really frustrating.

2. Autosave is NOT auto save. Auto save in the last I dunno 10 years has been a feature that saves every so often with at least 3 saves from the past 20-30mins of play, This is true autosave. The game right now as it stands SUCKS with saving. I am so used to playing games with autosave features that work properly that constantly having to press F5 and having to remind myself IN GAME when the game is sooo GOD DAMN immersing is beyond frustrating. I am often losing 30-45 mins of game play because you are throw into some insane situations suddenly that wipe your party. I really don't understand why the devs have not or will not implement this feature. Its basic. U can add slider bars for penis size but you cant add a simple quality of life feature? That has been around for a long time?

3. Dialog miss click results in frustrating play. When you are interacting with game environments and there are a lot of things to click sometimes you miss click on a companion, and if you don't correct quickly often opens up into the dialog box. I am had this occur often and its jarring. Allow a option to key bind this to a shift modifier so that when I hold down shift and click a companion only then will it open a dialog box.",1708862712,1708862712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dislike: Sometimes combat can bug out and people wont make their move for some time and can cause a crash, Its super rare and if you kill them before a turn it wont happen. Some dialog is still silent but its getting patched out every time so less and less its likely to happen.

Like: The STORY. It is that simple the game just keeps throwing things at you time and time again. Some of them you can see coming if you read books and pay attention but i lost track how many times this story had me in my emotions. Also, the replay value is insane in this game. Every single time i play it i still find something new to see or a new option that opens more talking that i did not see before, and i have gone through act 1 at least 5 times. Not counting the other acts because i can only imagine the things i have missed in them. Lastly what ill say is that every character has their own quirks and ways of looking at everything you do it cant even be counted (though i am sure it has) the special interactions you will have if you take the time to just talk with everyone in party/camp.

last thing, what is this sorry excuse of a cc? they get all the social justice points for the pronouns and the option to have both boobs and penis, but the protag is silent, and the facial animations just cycle through 4 attempts of what could be perceived as an ""expression"" what use is it to have such a limited CC if your character doesnt even do anything that intense with its face? bethesda managed with the freeform CC, why cant larian? idk, maybe if the presets werent so fucking ugly i wouldnt be complaining, but its true. unless you're a twink half elf or somehow manage to find 1 good face for any other race, all the faces are ugly. whats even worse is that these faces are also on the random npcs you talk to throughout the game. which means that you'll most likely run into an npc who looks exactly like your character, completely destroying your sense of individuality. imagine if skyrim only let you use the faces of other npcs, youd be pretty disappointed, right?

Baldur's Gate 3 is a triumph in the world of role-playing games, offering a rich and immersive experience that is sure to captivate players.

The world is a beautifully crafted fantasy realm that feels alive and vibrant. From the bustling city streets to the eerie dungeons and lush forests, every corner of the world is filled with detail and intrigue. The lore of the world is deep and complex, drawing players in with its history, myths, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

In my opinion, the companions you find along the way are truly the heart of the game. Each character is expertly written and brought to life with engaging dialogue, nuanced personalities, and compelling backstories. Whether you're forming alliances, making difficult decisions, or engaging in heartfelt conversations, each and every one feel like real individuals with their own hopes, fears, and desires.

Visually, Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece. The game features stunning graphics that showcase detailed character models, lush landscapes, and dynamic lighting effects. Exploring the world is a visual delight, with every area exuding a unique atmosphere that draws players deeper into the game's world.

The soundtrack is equally impressive, with a sweeping orchestral score that sets the perfect tone for each moment of the game. From epic battles to quiet moments of reflection, the music enhances the overall experience and adds depth to the game's world and characters.

In conclusion, Baldur's Gate 3 is a standout RPG that excels in world-building, lore, character development, visuals, and soundtrack. It is a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming and a must-play for any fan of the genre.",1695997132,1708857860,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wasn't satisfied with the outcome, so loaded my previous save and did the same, passed Arcana check and... it worked. Great QA.

However, I was frustrated with all the inane dialogue choices that my partner was making in his play-through in the background that I wound up creating my character on his computer and playing for around 70 hours before eventually buying a new computer so that I could play my own copy. Some initial mistakes that I made:

- Died in tutorial after mucking about in acid and not noticing the changes in stats on the overwhelming number of displays on all corners of the screen 
- Did not level up my characters until my partner noticed the screen stats
- Attempted to cast Detect Thoughts, Talk to Animals during battle
- Bypassed key characters who were ""right there"" (according to my partner) because I couldn't read the environment and map
- Did not understand that italicised dialogue options were actions, triggering fights
- Tried to play catch with Scratch by throwing the ball at him, triggering a fight in camp
- Trusted Gale to show me magic
- Hated Astarion's unwarranted snark and disapprovals of my choices; kept him in my party anyway because locks
- Recast Call Lightning because I didn't know that it was a continuous spell ready in my side panel
- Did not understand the concept of video game time and felt genuinely rushed to complete (and loot) things before key events transpired

im not the biggest fan of DnD as i find it kinda boring, so i was hesitant to get this game when my friends suggested i give it a shot and run a campaign with them. i'm glad i did, as i had a good time exploring every nook and cranny of Faerun with them. finding new secrets and lore at places you least expect is also exciting. what i do like the most are the characters, as all of them are just so full of personality and charm (even the NPCs). we recruited every possible playable companions and completed their questlines, and the payoff for doing so is definitely rewarding.

final fight spoilers: [spoiler]the fight against the Netherbrain was honestly hype, seeing as all the other NPCs you've befriended come to assist you. reading their letters at the reunion party was honestly pretty sweet as well (funny with Harleep's).[/spoiler]


however, i find the story extremely lacking. the initial premise was great! the urgency to get the tadpole off our brains and trying to foil the Absolute's plans really hooked me in. however, there's just so much wasted potential in [spoiler]the entirety of Act 3[/spoiler]. the main villains' actions, [spoiler]mainly Gortash[/spoiler], are just kinda questionable. [spoiler]why did Gortash not only lay down his guard around us, but also expect us to not betray him when he offered to cooperate with us?[/spoiler]. i also don't really enjoy DnD style combat  where it's all just dice rolls and checks, but thats a me problem. there are also some bugs and glitches here and there, but those are easily fixable so its not a big deal.

overall, i still had a really fun time with the game, especially when playing the campaign with friends. i do feel like the game is way too overhyped though. it's definitely a good game with a lot of love and care put into it, but i do not think it is the ""genre defining"" or ""game of the generation"" people are claiming this to be.

Graphics and Atmosphere: The game's visuals are stunning, with beautifully rendered landscapes, meticulously detailed character models, and fluid animations that breathe life into every encounter. The atmospheric lighting and weather effects immerse you fully into the Forgotten Realms, making each exploration and battle a feast for the eyes.

Gameplay Mechanics: Baldur's Gate 3 strikes a perfect balance between tactical combat and narrative depth. The turn-based combat is challenging and rewarding, requiring thoughtful planning and strategy. The addition of environmental interactions and verticality adds a new layer of tactical depth that is genuinely engaging. Outside of combat, the game offers a wealth of exploration, dialogue options, and side quests that are as compelling as the main storyline.

Story and Characters: The narrative is where Baldur's Gate 3 truly shines. The story is intricate, filled with twists, turns, and moral dilemmas that test your resolve and shape the world around you. The characters are wonderfully written, each with their own backgrounds, motivations, and emotional depth. Building relationships with your party members feels meaningful, with dialogue options that genuinely impact the story's progression and outcomes.

Compared to its peers, it is not possible NOT to recommend it. There is really only one title it CAN be compared to; Larian's predecessor, Divinity 2: Original Sin. And so, compare them I will. 

I played the original Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2. They were revolutionary games for their time. To be honest, BG3 only improved on them (and Divinity 2: Original Sin) in two areas: overall graphics and voice-acting. These are AAA worthy, and among the best in the genre. I took for granted how everything looked after being wowed by the initial cut-scenes, but did admire it on many occasions. In particular, characters are rendered excellently. 

Combat remains enjoyable, though only a few areas had much challenge on default difficulty setting. On the plus side, I never felt grinding was needed to level up fully. Like D2: OS, maps have enough to explore without getting bogged down or getting lost. This may not be a good thing for those that like YUGE maps, or more open-ended exploration. Personally I feel the approach they used is best for the story-driven RPG. 

BG3 gave me over 100 hours and is certainly worth the coin, even at full price, which I paid as tribute to Larian for their masterful Divinity 2: Original Sin (I gave 10/10). Now we turn to my quibbles, of which there were none in Divinity 2. 

The story: I expected a masterpiece, like Divinity 2. The first two acts were good, but the main plot was rather stupid TBH. A giant brain flying around wearing a sort of crown? Really? That's the best they could come up with? The giant brain is co-controlled by three bosses you'll have to fight. The first in Act 2 was good, both in backstory and quests. The last two were contrived and (sorry Larian) boring. Yes, in Act 3--Baldur's Gate itself...what should have been the climax became mostly slog and boredom. Should I not have been yearning to play each night, well past my normal bedtime, like the best games bring out? 

Soooo, exploring the city, I soon notice a lot of the characters look and talk like oddly dressed 21st century Americans. Black, White, and other ethnic groups all have in common vapid small-talk. Some of the city guard are midgets, and while not as annoying as the ones in Cyberpunk 2077 that seem to be everywhere, we do have to suffer through the least likely Medieval fighting unit, a black female midget sagely investigating a murder. Remember the South Park episode when Cartman dreamed they were all replaced by more....diverse....actors? That is what Baldur's Gate has become. There is also lots of gay characters and you will be hit on by more than one, including a shirtless tentacled alien, even if by your choices its clear you are not gay. 

The gay elf vampire kind of grew on me, but his story-line is FAR from original and though we did eventually get a good boss fight out of it, his whole quest/plot seemed out of place. The githyanki main character was irritating, and I disliked her whole ugly reptilian race. 

Shadowheart...now here is a lovely elf with a dark backstory that was quite intriguing. Didn't hurt that she was very pretty. In fact, clearly the ability exists to make attractive characters in this game, yet the population is mostly unattractive. That IS real life, but this if fantasy! It would have been nice to see more beautiful characters. 

The odd colored people with goat-horns were okay, but were yet another refugee subplot. The fact that we've had 10,000,000 migrants cross our border in the past few years makes this particular plot (the city of BG is also full of refugees) unwelcome. 

Gods....this was an interesting addition to the game, and could have been more fully developed. 

Jumping? No....just no. 

Traps...gotta grind through them, borrrrrring. 

Feminine rage: thankfully mostly contained in the annoying githyanki character, at least without delving into such questions as ""Why are all the mindlfayers male?"" When you see a female NPC at the end savagely pitchfork one through the heart, the thought dawned that the mindflayers could be symbolic of an evil patriarchy corrupting society. Then again, there was an evil female Hag character, so I'm probably reading too much into that. 

Where does Larian go from here? I hope they keep Woke out, but suspect more will creep into their next title. 

Final score: 8/10. 9/10 compared to others in the genre, but 7/10 compared with Divinity 2: Original Sin.

Some of them might be fixable, like the mess that is inventory management, but most are stylistic choices, so there's nothing really to ""fix"".

I finished survivor in 23 hours and haven't played it since, it has no repeatability as there are no choices to make in the game. The only reason to keep playing after completing the game is to unlock and find cosmetics for your Cal Kestis. That's it. And i didn't do that because i absolutely hate doing stuff like that because it isn't fun. The story is okay, the fights are fun but that's all it is. It doesn't give you anything else apart from that. It's an incredibly large game too, 130gbs for no repeatability, no story choices, and cosmetics? 

BG3 is 140gbs, and in that game is something with almost infinite repeatability, exceptional depth and attention to detail and incredibly involving choices, dialogue, and characters.

While I havent played BG1, BG2 or Neverwinter Nights in like 15+ years, this game really hits the spot and feels just right. Took me a couple hours to really get comfortable with what you can do in the world as far as jumping over obstacles, shooting arrows at hanging baskets of fire, etc. You can think outside of the box when you encounter enemies - I took out an entire room secretly by staying in the shadows. 

Im sure if I went back and played the originals that there would be elements I like and dislike about both the new and the old, but overall, I would definitely recommend this game if you like this style of game play. 

Edit: Ive since started a second play through on Honor Mode. Went through my first game as a good aligned Barbarian and Im doing the second play through as an evil-neutral style Wizard with the dark urge. Even though I specifically sought out every single little thing and quest I could find, I somehow still missed some stuff on my first play through that Im discovering in the second. 

Playing as a different class and forcing myself to choose more of the evil dialogue options has really made the game feel completely different. Interactions with quite a few NPCs has resulted in a different direction for some quests and/or opened up quests that I never had before and canceled quests that I did.",1691468552,1708816698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is a masterpiece in storytelling, and role playing, but sadly it is just frustrating to play. I get the game mechanics follow DnD closely, but this is at the expense of a fun game. Each encounter feels like a slog, the constant long rests after every single fight, the save scumming and long load times, getting stuck in endless skip turns due to some obscure enemy spell and needing just the right counter spell, constantly missing attacks and spells when there is a 90% chance, and then if you do hit - the enemy health goes to 1 and they kill you next turn. There's also the quality of life improvements that are missing to help with the overwhelming need to customize each fight - why can't I quickly dismiss companions from the main map? Why can't I see my full inventory from the camp? Why are there so many variations of each type of armor and weapon - which makes choosing the best one like writing a research paper? 
If you fully understand the DnD mechanics, you will surely like this. Otherwise I only recommend picking this up if you use cheats. 
Lastly, to prove my enthusiasm for the game's quality, I recommend that if you pick it up to pay full price - Larian deserves it.",1708813219,1708813903,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I srsly can't play this game without a TV show in the background or playing Hearthstone on my phone during enemy turns... 

Also, almost all of the available companions are boring... ppl like this game for romance, but all I see is a group of thirsty teenagers following me around, and the wampire is just rapey. Look at Deadfire or the new Torment, even Divinity 2, an older game of the same studio as BG3 (!), has great companions with character and unique vibe each.

SF plot of alien invasion in a fantasy world is good (not as good as a mid book about the topic, but good for a game) and many sidequests are amazing, but go the evil route, this way u get to interact with all the cool characters, almost every good character is boring (in the Act 1 at least), but it's a sin of the franchise since BG1, so maybe they are just for different target audience... but I hate being evil, so it's an unpleasant dissonance for an RPG.

-PROS
--Easy to understand gameplay for both newbies and those familiar with D&D
--Compelling and intriguing character personalities and narratives
--The ability to play with or without friends (you need friends for D&D womp womp)
--Pretty good character creator
--LOTS of tiny things that warrant other playthroughs to check out
--Tons of silly dialogue options that randomly make me giggle
--The ability to forge your own path and make your own choices that actually affect the world and its denizens
--Beautifully crafted OST
--Tons of races, subraces, classes, and subclasses to make every character different
--Weirdly satisfying to break the game in tiny ways
--Spooky stuff galore
--BY FAR SOME OF THE COOLEST VILLAINS EVER.
--Pretty easy to get into character if youre with friends (my half-orc druid named horgunk the hungry who eats mind flayer tadpoles for fun is a prime example)
--Ice pick lobotomy (you get a cool eye from it)
--Bear sex

-CONS
--Movement pathfinding sometimes screws you over
--Sometimes attacks just don't select a target??
--Egirls obsessing over Astarion (vampire twink) and making the worst looking characters known to man
--Karmic dice is on by default, which isn't really true to the whole ""dice roll random"" thing
--Very large game, youll need some storage for this one
--Tieflings (tiefling racism is by far the funniest thing ive seen in this game especially with some vicious mockery lines against them)
--Baldur's Gate is the entirety of Act 3, leaving me and my friends booing throughout the first 2 acts (""whos baldur and where is his gate"")
--Any creature that has Unstoppable, Sanctuary, or go invisible
--Can't kill children, bad game design!!!
--Bear sex

I'm nearing the end of the game on two separate playthroughs. Very cool. 10/10 I recommend it.",1708811471,1708811471,True,1,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

Beat the game in Honour mode. Was trash. There is a bug where you will not get the rewards for beating it in Honour mode so basically you will waste your life in doing so. If you want the gold dice then just grab someone's save file, load it onto your system and then do the epilogue. Even then it will bug out so just keep doing it until the save file will enable it.

Game crashed due to the numerous bugs? Good luck, because the game more than likely changed your honour mode run into a ""Custom game"" so you're wasting your time finishing it. Just start a new one and waste more time.

Karmic dice is a trash system, turn it off before even starting a campaign. I have never seen so many 1 or 100 rolls ever. The accuracy that shows is false. You do not have 60% chance to hit. They are not showing the real hit chance which is literally retarded. You can have 95% chance to hit as a monk and still miss all 6 attacks.

Overall, decent game because of the story line in itself and you can spend hundreds of hours in it but full of bugs and false info. Bug fix patches only introduce new bugs. New shop UI introduced more bugs than fixes.

It stands in stark contrast to the usual formulaic ""AAA RPGs"", if you can even call them that. This game is the closest you can get to playing an actual pen & paper D&D campaign in videogame form.

If you're a fan of the older Baldur's Gate games, this game might put you off with its turn based combat, but I really think you should give it a chance. Combat is fun and challenging, and in the harder difficulties you'll need to use everything at your disposal to win.

The visuals in this are amazing, specially for a CRPG. These games often don't have a big budget because of their niche nature, and Baldur's Gate 3 is an anomaly in that regard. Every conversation is beautifully animated and motion captured. The textures, lighting, particle effects are all quite good.

All the companions are interesting and romanceable, regardless of who your character is, and they all have backstories, secrets, and personal sidequests that develop as the story goes.

The story is good but nothing too mindblowing (heh). I think it's enough to get you out into the world, and works well for the game. I think the game really shines while doing the sidequests though, solving personal problems for the characters or finding secret knowledge that probably shoud've remained sealed away.

All quests, be it the main story or side activities, have lots of ways they can play out, and this is the most refreshing part of this game. This is where the game gets very close to an actual D&D adventure. There's so many ways of getting what you need that it can be a little overwhelming. You can get out of the usual gamey mentality and do some common sense stuff, and it'll probably work.

Overall, this game feels like those ""once a decade"" experiences. It's amazing how deep and engaging it is. If you're a sucker for CRPGs, don't miss out on this one.",1691118885,1708800005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gave me a lot of Dragon Age vibes, the only downside i'd say is you dont get to visit as many areas as you do in DA:O, yes DA:0 is a shorter game but has a bigger world somehow. 

But then Act 3 starts and most of the endings of the storylines thats from acts 1 and 2 seems rushed, a TON of sidequests are incomplete with no explanation as to why somethings happening, the unique elements from first 2 acts seems to be gone and there isn't as much interesting encounters and even after so long there's a ton of bugs still in act 3 specifically. The team 100% rushed this, needed a year or 2 more, they claim not to have investors so why would they feel the need to rush this out? Very large missed opportunity imo.

Ending can basically be described as Mass Effect 3-like. Its not satisfying and unlike the rest of the whole game the ending locks you down to 2 choices, no matter what you do you are forced into doing something which a lot of proper rather not do. I heard they added the epilogue in a later patch so originally it was worse but yeah the epilogue makes it a tad better, maybe they can improve the choices upon it in the future, it'd be a shame to have a game this good have such bad endings. Even after 14 years Dragon Age Origins' ending is still superior and they didnt need to patch in an epilogue lol.

As someone who has played table-top DnD for something like 20 years, the lack of variety in available sub-classes available from the base game was difficult to get accustomed to. (Essentially, only the sub-classes that were shipped with 5E player's handbook and base rules were available.) I spent the first 28+ hours of playtime in this game either making painstaking decisions at the character screen, or re-rolling once I hit level 3 because I couldn't see myself liking that character for an entire play-through.

Keep in mind, this was before the ability to re-roll your class, which was added sometime after I had hung up the game after those rough beginnings. Even with the ability to change classes, I was miffed that I couldn't change my race or starting background, as all true addicts to character creation in DnD can attest that a race that makes a great fighter may not be the same that makes a great illusionist wizard for example.

I also understand that I could simply download one of the many community-built mods out there to expand the choices of sub-classes. But doing so would run the risk of taking away from the carefully designed world that the developers intended, and I didn't want to 'cheese' fights with mechanics or combinations that the developers hadn't intended to be in the game yet. I'm sure some of you are rolling your eyes at that, but for now, that was and is my stance.

Needless to say -- I desperately wanted to enjoy the story and world this game had to offer, so I made myself  a compromise: I would play the game as a class that I didn't really play at the table, just so I wouldn't be obsessed with the 'perfect' build or with trying to recreate some of the great experiences I had with table-top characters. This allowed me to simply roll a character that could get into the world and encounter whatever there was to encounter and take it as it came. This worked for me, and now I'm 50+ hours into that character and not looking back.

I'll probably roll a new character after I finish and come back, hopefully when the dev team has introduced several new playable sub-classes/races. But either way, this has been a great experience and I'm glad I found a way to enjoy this truly remarkable game. (If you're curious, my compromise class is a fighter using a 2H weapon; an arch-type I have never found all that interesting.)",1708793093,1708793093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's fusion of artistry and gameplay is truly exceptional. Combat is a strategic ballet, while dialogue choices weave a rich narrative tapestry, each decision shaping the story in profound ways.

The diverse cast of characters adds depth and emotion to the adventure. From the enigmatic Astarion to the steadfast Shadowheart, their stories intertwine with mine, creating lasting connections. (got to love Astarion dating sim)

This was my first time experiencing a DnD type of RPG game thanks to a very dear friend of mine and oh boy was it a great suggestion. You can have up to 4 people in your party, but there are more than 10 people that you can recruit into your camp but every single one of these characters have their backstory fully fleshed out and extensively immersive. I mean I played 95% of the game with the same party but your whole playthrough can change just because you're going with another party member. Not going to lie, the combat can be fun but I was immersed with the story and the world itself so after 2-3 hours I went back to the easiest setting and I think it was the right choice for me since what hooked me was not the hardness or the combat system but the story and world itself. And I don't think I lost much, although again, I played this game more casually than any other player, not caring too much about the min maxing but even with that game had an extreme depth of a story. The choices you make are permanent and you can like blind yourself for the whole playthrough just by choosing a dialogue option or just plain out kill a main character without talking to him and that character's actor won the best actor in TGA. So you can just not make him talk in the game and killing him and it does not really affect the game but make it a little smaller. I mean I can go on and on about the story, voice acting, different branches that the story can unfold, your party's and everyone around's story has different endings, choices and more.

But biggest showstoppers/experience breakers for me were:
1) Overwhelming amount abilities/skills/bonus skills/special actions/passive/active/etc., that should be selected/obtained from first levels without at least somewhat clear examples how it would work further in game.
I played NWN and NWN2 and never had such problem.

2) It is hard to predict possibilities of upcoming enemies (even if they are on the same level). Sometimes my party could become mostly paralyzed/frozen/asleep/onhold/etc. and there was not much I could do to mitigate such situation. 

3) Fast travel can not be used to return to previous locations to complete companion quests.

4) Sometimes (too often for me) ""dice roll"" mechanics felt like ""gambling"".

I'd recommend to wait for sale if you never player BG game or played NWN games previously in order to minimize potential disappointment.

But if you are a fan of BG or just feel risky today - go on :)

You are abducted by mindflyers, which are highly intelligent, mind dominating creatures, scheming to conquer the world. You have been planted with one of their tadpoles into your brain. With fear you can transform into one of the tentacle thralls any moment, you are pushing forward to find answers as soon as possible. Story progresses with feel of urgency and it is full of unexpected twists and important decisions. Through 3 Acts you will visit wilderness, underdark, shadow-cursed lands and revisit the great city of Baldur´s Gate from original game.

Gameplay: Surprisingly true to D&D tabletop rules. Almost every aspect is implemented. Most notably there is roll for each skill check with 20-sided dice using your primary stats and proficiencies. This dice become without doubt most recognisable feature of this instalment. This time around your party is restricted to only 4 characters, which I am not fan of. This results in constant changing of your party composition. In original Baldur´s Gate I was using 5 characters most of the time and 6th spot was reserved for guest companion tied to some side quest. I really appreciate I could choose side and go semi-evil path, which i took without hesitation. This is improvement from previous games, where evil options were present, but fairly limited to few minor quests.

Character creation: Pretty basic, but sufficient. There is good amount of customisation and races to choose from. There is no rolling for stats, but you simply assign extra points to attributes you will use the most according to your class. When level up, you have really nice look on your characters. Every couple of levels, you can choose special ability or attribute improvement. I find special ability choices with few exceptions quite marginal and I almost always took main attribute improvement. If I compare it to previous rulesets, i think levelling up in Baldur´s Gate 3 is better than Baldur´s Gate 2, but worse than Icewind Dale 2.

Graphics: Graphic side is simply amazing. I have made literally thousands of screenshots. Locations are beautifully done with attention to detail. Underground areas are especially immersive. Lights and shadows create spectacular projections. I really appreciate return to isometric view, which is true to original games, but with ability to pan and zoom. What will not please is lack of dynamic weather or day and night cycle. 

Cutscenes: This is where game shines. It is clearly an area where most money went and it is visible. Hours and hours cutscenes. Certainly, it deserves awards for best story, cinematics, atmosphere, immersion and voice acting. Especially voice acting is mind blowing. Every character is voiced by different actor and voice acting is really there. It is not just soulless reading. Almost every character with few exceptions has its own unique face. Their face mimics and voice syncing are breathtaking. 

Music: Ranging from OK to good. There is no track overly bad, but no memorable either. Soundtrack does good job overall. I mostly like music and ambience from dungeons, rather than music from outdoor or city. In no stretch it can compare to excellent soundtracks from Baldur´s Gate 1+2 or Icewind Dale 1+2 by Jeremy Soul, which i keep dear in memory to this day.

Combat system: Not a fan in the slightest. Combat itself is easily the worst part of the game for me. Main reason is turn-based combat. In original Baldur´s Gate, there is dynamic real time combat with option to pause anytime. Turns were used merely for effect duration and how often you can cast spells or make your next attack. Tactical pause was a such distinctive feature in the series and game feels less authentic without it. Main action and bonus action system is step in right direction. Fact that everyone can jump around during combat across the battlefield is straightforward bad design, your formation means nothing. Combat in this game is few and far between. This is not necessarily bad thing, because you can role play and talk out from most encounters, if that is your preferred game style.

Magic system: Nothing to write home about. Feels like placeholder. Spells don´t have enough information on them. You can´t even say if it is area of effect spell, touch or missile. You can´t see duration of effect. I would much rather have spell book from original game, where i could inspect all effects, spell pre-requisitions and detailed description. Option of using higher tier spell slot for lower tier spell is nice, but it makes chaos in spell tabs. I can´t properly see what is naturally tier 3 spell and what is boosted low level spell. I have been using it by selecting tier I spell and then chose which tier i want to use, never other way around.

Inventory: Terrible experience with inventory. Loads of junk and garbage. Lot of items you will never need. Mostly uninteresting magic items, which i could barely remember i have in inventory. I think it would be better to have fewer items in the game but more useful. Lack of dedicated potion bags, scroll bags and arrow quivers. Yes, there are plenty of bags and such, but no way to differentiate them one from another. Also, you can´t sell stuff stashed in bags. You need to manually remove them from bag and then sell it. Short and neglected item descriptions. In Baldur´s Gate 1 and 2, Items had their page with detailed monochrome hand drawn picture, history and description. Hundreds of different potions with not enough opportunities to use them. You can´t see duration of a potions and in lot of cases you can´t use multiple potions together, because they nullify previous effect. I was using lot of poison coatings though. 

UI: Could be much better. You have hundred icons for basic attacks, movements and abilities. Not sure what led developers to implement this MMO style layout. It is hard to organize. When you do reorganize it, each new item will insert new icons into empty slot and makes mess again. There is an option to switch between different tabs though, like main action, bonus action, special ability and such, which i have been actively using.

Final Verdict: 8/10. 
Story and immersion carrying this game sky high, but it is dragged down by bad quality of life features. There is room for improvement.",1708782285,1708782507,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I don't mean the engine, I don't mind it, and I have +200 hours in DOS2. I mean the mood and atmosphere, the feeling of freedom, the feeling of ""what the hell I am supposed to do now"". Things actually got interesting only after reaching Last Light Inn, but no spoilers. After that it started to feel little more like Baldur's Gate, and after reaching next area it had like 90% of BG's charm. 

The Cons:

- Camera and hiding floors is annoying. You get stuck in places and have to reload because you jump/fly/teleport to a place but then camera doesn't show the upper platforms so you can't jump/teleport/fly back (Cazador's Dungeon for example). This could be solved by adding ""Show all walls and floors"" button.
- Pickpocketing is as bad as it was in DOS2.
- I want to punch pretty much every single companion I have to their stupid faces

The Ok's:

- Unlike DOS2, this feels like I have so many ways to approach the bigger issue, but I still feel like every single way eventually leads down to same place and same fights, but I have about 200 hours too little to be sure about this. 

The pros:

- I can punch every single companion I have to their stupid faces.
- Throwing enemies is fun
- Petting dogs
- It's a BG
- It's a Larian game

Summarum: 
I'm bit underwhelmed about this currently. I expected better based on the fact that it carries name of the best series ever, it's made by Larian, and the hype like never before. It's definitely not a bad game, it's a good game, but not the Jesus Christ reincarnated and don't expect too much.

After 5 playtroughs and finishing in Honour mode, I'm not underwhelmed anymore. ",1704438089,1708776572,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

its a great role playing game. if you have time to study the game, explore every inch of every single map, read lore and every doc you find, etc, you will love this game.

but i cant play this. i have 2 problems: loss aversion and i hate studying.

i see videos on youtube explaining how to get items, how to lvl up, get perma buffs. the shear amount of things you can miss out is outrageous. so i have to study the game (wait what? i dont have a youtube channel, so why do i have to study the game to have ""fun"").
 game mechanics are not explained very well, spells use some stats that you dont know it would since it doesnt tell you any where on the game, you have to go to the wiki to understand that, after a few hours.

i made a char for the first time, a paladin, whithout any points on charisma, and after ive seen a video tutorial i had to respec because nothing in the game said that my spells deal more dmg with charisma. this doesnt make sense to me because using smite, in my little brain, shouldnt be tapping on my charima, if it was a spell that charms or intimidates yeah that makes sense, but not a dmg spell.
did i know what i would get for skills, passives, etc in the next lvl up? no. there is no way to see what i will get for multiclassing for example. you have to commit, then use it on battles, and then regret and start watching vids on youtube. frustrating
most info is just not there until you get there and i see myself spending too much time reading things in game, after ive spent time reading things on the wiki and watching videos.
to be minimally knowledgeable of what im doing at any given point, i find myself wasting lots of time reading and trying to understand things 

and the xcom problem: i failed 3 consecutive 85% hit rate atks.
is this possible? yes
is it fun? no

i killed Karlach to ""please"" my blood thirsty companion wyll. i went against my feelings and saw her reaction when i chose to fight her, it almost made me cry. i still regret that decision. and then, wyll, asked ME if he did the right choice.
this is exactly what i went through with my girlfriend. i hate people who dont know what they want, on the most important matters.

I endured the abrupt nonsense that was the finale of Divinity 2. It's among my Bottom 5 worst moments in gaming. The way the final fight happens is not telegraphed, has no lead-in, and does not make sense. I did not have much faith the same studio that did that would make another narrative-heavy game a winner. 

But, some of my regular gaming partners from college wanted to play a co-op Baldur's Gate 3 game. It seemed to work smoothly enough. The first act was interesting. So, I gave it a shot. 

It ended up being one of the glitchiest add-insult-to-injury-as-often-as-possible experiences I've had in gaming. 

1. Combining Polearm Master and Sentinel does not work as intended. They interact appropriately about 20% of the time. IT'S NOT EVEN ALWAYS OR NEVER. HOW DO YOU GET THE MECHANICS WRONG LIKE THIS??

2. The romance option I kinda fell into by accident in my parallel single player game, ended up being abruptly cancelled, as best I can tell, because I simply didn't have enough Long Rests in Act 2. It was not telegraphed. HOW CAN YOUR WRITING BE SO BAD THAT YOU DO THAT WITH NO TELEGRAPHING? THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE **THE NARRATIVE GAME**. 

3. Using the whole tabletop long rests + spell slots system in a computer game was a dubious choice from the beginning. A whole bunch of interesting alternatives are well demonstrated at this point. There are lots of ways to avoid the arbitrary restrictions this imposes on the game. 

4. One of the clear-and-specific benefits the DND roleplaying system ought to have provided to this type of game should have been the lack of exponential increase in item power as your characters increase in level. (In my mind, this was the other flaw of Divinity 2, aside from the absolutely scarring abruptness of the finale. A Level 11 shield tended to be twice as powerful as a Level 10 shield. That does not make sense in any system or universe. Except Divinity 2, apparently.) 
Instead, they introduced so many unique mechanics in items that lots of build guides, and my more optimization-focused friend, basically can't talk about a build without listing off all the essential items for the build. This has a pile of narrative and overall-path-through-the-game consequences that can easily suck the fun out of a playthrough by itself. 

5. Jumping doesn't work. 
JUMPING DOESN'T WORK.
I GOT STOPPED IN MIDAIR THREE TIMES IN OUR MULTIPLAYER GAME FOR NO REASON. The paths said I could do the jump. THEY WERE WRONG. 

6. THE THIRD FAILED JUMP PUT ME IN A CHASM AND KILLED ME. 
WHAT THE EVER-LOVING FUCK IS THIS??!??
It's jumping. You guys tested this. I do not need to do this in the form of a question. I know you tested it. How did you fuck this up? It's a Bonus Action that every class gets, and they all have use cases for it. And it abruptly killed me when the trajectory arrow said it would work. 

The awards tell us that you're plenty strategic about it, Larian. But you have basic quality-of-life features that you do not give a fuck about. There's no way you didn't test for this. But you left it broken. So FUCK YOU. This is comfortably my worst experience in a video game.",1708751945,1708751945,False,4,1,0.447980523109436035,0,True,False,False

Now that I've got... a few more hours under my belt, I figured it's time to do it right.

I waited so long, trying to make up my mind about wether I should get this game or not. Obviously I finally decided to go for it, and I have not regretted it a single second!
I actually don't think I've got enough words to properly describe this game, but to put it a bit into perspective: I've never played D&D, so I had no idea about how that part worked, and turn-based combat has never been my favorite, but this might actually be the greatest game I've ever played. At least it's in the top 5 of all time. And I've been playing videogames for about 30 years or so.

I haven't even finished the game yet, and I'm already planning my next playthrough. And I haven't been spending 112 hours on one playthrough because it's too hard. No. It's just too damn good! I want to see everything! I want to do everything!
I've lied my way into a huge goblin camp to murder their leaders. I've sniffed a spider carcass. I've talked a boss into killing himself. I've avoided so many fights because I'm just too damn handsome (and I also excel in the arts of persuasion and deception). I've made people laugh. I've made people dance. I've argued with a tax collector about gold. I've watched surgery being performed (not my fault, but definitely my fault). I've talked to animals. I've talked to corpses. I've solved murder mysteries. I've uncovered conspiracies. I lied to a skeleton. I'm wearing some sexy underwear that I stole from a boss I killed. My best friend is a brain. An angel lives in my camp. I've got unstable blood that explodes when it comes into contact with fire. My hat is fabulous.
Also, what's not to love about being a halfling bard with a lyre, running naked through the streets of Baldur's Gate, showing the citizens and the Steel Watch just how dangly the game's physics can be?
And there's still so much I haven't done. If only I waited just a bit longer before advancing the story.

To summarize:
The story = Amazing
The side quests = Unique and exciting
The characters = Interesting and believable
The combat = Fun
The choices = Many! So many choices!
The graphics = Beautiful
Replay value = Very yes!
Quick save = Gets used
Should you play it? = Absolutely! (Well, maybe not if you only play competitive shooters, but if you did, you probably wouldn't be reading this anyway, would you?)

There's also a ton of little fixes to both D&D5e rule system and Larian's battle system. Brilliant use of Shove, Throw, Jump, and how the famous surface system is toned down to be a fun advantage and no longer a Splatoon-fest of insanity.

The characters as a group are subtle (god knows they aint as individuals, but I digress). What starts as a gang of drama llamas (and Karlach) show real varied depth and maddening oxymoronic traits by close.

Big quibble with the lack of sliders for sound. Only overworld barks could be adjusted individually, continuing the backslide seen in SMT V, whereas the below Nayuta did have this.

I'm currently stuck in the Steelwatch Foundry because trying to get out crashes my game and trying to make progress also crashes it. I've tried every troubleshooting trick in the book and followed all of Larian's tips on keeping the game stable but nothing works. And when I reached out for support, they gave me a generic ""we know about this issue, please stay tuned"" response with no suggestions or further information about the problem.

Baldur's Gate 3 has funny dialogue, personally intriguing and visually good looking characters and engaging (at least on the tactician difficulty) combat.

Despite that, I can't recommend the game to the average consumer. People usually have 500GB to 1TB drives. Baldur's Gate is 120 Gb*. Installing BG3 comes with the opportunity cost of not having 3 - 10 other games in the same space. For reference, let's compare it to it's genre peers.

* NOW IT'S 132 AS OF PATCH 5
* 141, Patch 6

Baldur's Gate 3 equals
2.4 Wasteland 3's (50 Gb) 
5 Disco Elysium's (20 Gb) - Which includes more voiced lines than BG3 
5 Torment: Tides of Numenera's (20 Gb)
8 Tyranny's (15 Gb)
8.5 Shadowrun Trilogies (10 + 2 + 2 = 14 Gb)
OR one of each of these games.

Played beta, and have played through the game extensively several times. I have been running also modded version creating and manipulating the game to my preferences, like lots more of gear (close to full legendary items rocking 27 str as a level 11 fighter.) 
But the enemies are enchaned through more mods than you can count on one hand. 

The first 500-600 hours unmodded i loved it also. 

This is a game i want to play forever, if we could have different adventures and quests inside the game i can like in 5e Faerun and enjoy some of the best content Forgotten Realms has to offer.

Looking back there has been -many- bugs, lagging, crashes and just annoying and stupid things happening during playing vanilla. 90% of that is fixed now! And they have added multiple endings, more dialogs and alot of Quality of life updates that makes this run on a 3080Ti OC on ultra and a widescreen with surround headset a special spot in my heart. 

Find your own way how you can have the best possible time inside the game, custom modes and all the different settings to difficulties and options to make it more tabletop feel like hiding rolling and health bars etc. 

btw i have played this with my best friend, always and only the whole way. Can it work solo? 100% and i will do it myself. But find someone to play with!

Hats off for Larian Studios, you have by far the best game studio in the world currently. This is the cheapest game i have ever bought. 1000h played / 60usd... 
 
NO LOOTBOXES, NO P2W, NO BLACK ECONOMY

Thanks for taking the time to read my delayed but honest review. 

Best wishes and good luck to you (ps make custom characters, much cooler than the origins)

The thing that makes it stand out above every other single-player game I've picked up in the last few years isn't the amazing voice acting, the excellent story, the creative and interesting characters, or the deep and engaging class system of DnD, though all of those things are excellent and worthy of praise. The thing that puts this game above anything else I've played recently is that every encounter you experience in its world feels intentional. If you get into a fight as you're exploring, those enemies, and that whole encounter, are interesting and unique. If you start a conversation with an NPC, chances are they have something individual to say to you. If you pick up a quest, it is unique and memorable. When you make a choice in one place, it affects your outcomes in another place, because everything about this game was put together with thought and attention.

On top of this rock-solid foundation of a core game design that respects the player, Baldur's Gate 3 also possesses outstandingly engaging, replayable turn-based combat; branching narrative decisions which, after 600 hours, I haven't even come close to exhausting; and all of the visual polish of a AAA game. The biggest problem with BG3 is that Baldur's Gate 4 doesn't start as soon as the credits stop rolling, but that's also somewhat okay since this is the first single-player game since KOTOR that I've wanted to play over and over again.",1691882024,1708724868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sa više od 310 sati igre i više puta završenim pričama koristeći različite likove, mogu reći da sam potpuno zarobljen u ovom nevjerojatnom svetu.

Ova igra se može pohvaliti ne samo prelepom grafikom, već i pažljivo osmišljenim svetom, dubokim narativima i izazovnim borbama. Svaki put kada započnete novu avanturu, osećate da se suočavate sa potpuno novim svetom, jer svaka odluka ima posledice i oblikuje vašu priču.

Mogućnost kreiranja vlastitih likova, svaki sa svojim pozadinskim pričama i veštinama, dodaje dubinu igri i čini je beskrajno ponovljivom. Svaki put kad počnete novu kampanju, imate priliku istražiti nove puteve i testirati različite strategije.

Baldur's Gate 3 je odlična igra za fanove D&D sistema, ali i za one koji se prvi put susreću s njim. Sve je predivno objašnjeno i pristupačno, što omogućava uživanje svima bez obzira na iskustvo.

Iako je trenutno u early access fazi, razvojni tim marljivo radi na ažuriranjima i poboljšanjima, što obećava još više uživanja u budućnosti.

Iskoristite priliku i upustite se u ovu avanturu. Sa svojom neograničenom ponovljivošću i dubinom, Baldur's Gate 3 je igra koju ćete igrati satima, dugo nakon što završite glavne priče. Sjajno ostvarenje, neka ne propusti!",1697189847,1708724672,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

De forma alguma é um jogo ruim mas ta longe de ser tudo isso que dizem, ainda mais considerando a queda de qualidade no Ato 2 e o fiasco que foi o Ato 3.

Zerei o Divinity Original Sin 1 e pude ver claramente vicios da Larian no BG3 e sinceramente duvido que vão melhora-los algum dia, principalmente fatores no gameplay. Esse jogo seria um neutro pra mim.

[hr][/hr]

GAMEPLAY - 8/10

Positivos: 
-Larian faz cRPG com uma bela variação no combate e aqui não foi diferente, há um tremenda variedade de classes e habilidades uteis, as opções para combar ou causar danos são impressionantes (ainda mais se você usa os barrils e habilidades elementais); 
- A camera durante os dialogos foi um adição bem legal ao jogo;
- Há bastante atenção a detalhes no cenário e possibilidades de você aproveitar;

Neutro: 
-A tão comentada opções de escolhas e suas consequencias são vastas, apesar que as realmente grandes são minimas e no geral as escolhas caem no grupo situacional do qual você ou resolve na porrada, na fala ou algum subterfugio(por exemplo ao invés de matar um npc chefe para conseguir um informação você vai conversando com os capangas pra conseguir a informação);
- No geral, é legal já que tem algumas escolhas que carregam desde o Ato 1 até o 3, mas fica restrito a apenas NPC's, mudanças drásticas como fizeram propaganda não tem. E apesar de não ter feito uma jogatina no caminho maligno ouvi dizer que tem bem menos conteudo do que no lado ""bonzinho"";

Negativas: 
- Larian não sabe trabalhar com inventário desde o DOS 1 e aqui continua a mesma porcaria de sempre, e ainda pior já que o loot é quase sempre inutil, servindo pra apenas vender e ocupar espaço, já estavam na hora de saber trabalhar com um sorting decente;
- Outro problema é a IA burra dos companheiros e seu posicionamento, toda hora que tinha armadilha o infeliz tinha que pisar na armadilha (pior que isso se aplica ao personagem do jogador já que você só clica para onde ele vai e não o controla diretamente);
- Há vários problemas com camera, principalmente em lugares com andares onde é um porre acertar o local para ele andar;
- O Ato 1 é melhorzinho, Ato 2 mais ou menos mas o 3 é um desastre com relação a bugs, tive que fechar o jogo várias vezes para poder ""resetar"" um bug que travou tudo ou pior, ter que voltar save. Acrescente o conteudo fraco e faltante do Ato 3 e fica claro que a Larian se apressou pra lançar BG3;
- Necessidade de Save Scumming é MUITO chato, literalmente você tem que ficar salvando a cada 5 min pq pode entrar num area que não era pra entrar e você morre ou a cada NPC que fala porque você não pode nem peidar sem ter um lançamento de dado pra ver se você cagou nas calças ou não. Se torna cansativo num jogo de 100 horas ter que ficar voltando pra saves antigos;

[hr][/hr]

HISTORIA - 3/10

Positivos:
- O lore do jogo é muito legal, ainda mais por ser tratar de DnD, a historia por trás dos Mindflayer e Githianky é bem interessante, além das palavras caracteristicas do povo Gith;
- O mundo parece ser bem rico;
- Alguns personagens interessantes(Hope foi uma das minhas favoritas);
- As quests pessoais da Shadowheart e Lazael foram as mais elaboradas;
- Vilão do Ato 2 interessante, apesar de claramente lembrar o Dark Knight do DOS 1(e a luta lá ser bem mais divertida);

Neutro:
- O mundo parece ser bem rico mas fica só nisso, tem praticamente nada de aprofundamento nas raças e povos diversos de Fayrun, o maximo que teve foi só com os Gith's e um pouco dos Druidas.
- Muitos detalhes sobre o cenário espalhados pelo mapa;
- A quest pessoal do Astarion foi interessante mas com um vilão patético e um desfecho bem mais ou menos no final;
- Quantidade consideravel de quests;

Negativas:
- Não há complexidade na história, não tem nuances ou conspirações elaboradas, não há um caminho neutro ou algo do tipo, assuntos para questionar e fazer o jogador pensar. É tudo preto e branco, básico e direto, bom para um jogo de 30 horas mas terrivel para um de 100 horas porque não prende. Não esperava um Death Stranding, Metal Gear ou SOMA, mas pelo menos um pouco do The Witcher, Dragon Age, Persona ou Mass Effect mas no fim os escritores foram mediocres;
- A historia principal é BEM meia boca pra ruim. O Ato 1 começa interessante ainda mais com o mistério dos vermes e Mindflayers, mas fica num looping de chegar num lugar e ter que resolver todos os problemas ali que fica cansativo conforme vai passando as dezenas de horas, o plot avança de forma tão arrastada e desinteressante que chega ser tedioso. 
- Tudo referente ao Ato 3, é evidente que ele é INCOMPLETO, as reviravoltas são fracas (Do Emperor e Ansur achei bem sem graça, um tremendo potencial nessa quest jogada no lixo pra uma reviravolta barata que no final não faz menor diferença), os vilões são MUITO mal aproveitados ao ponto de parecerem palhaços de circo (sendo menos pior a mulher), NPC's supostamente importantes mas com carisma de uma porta como a Nine Fingers, madam Aylim ou a atendente do Devil Fee, as quests bem desinteressantes\sem graça e algumas beirando o ridiculo da má escrita (como o desfecho da quest do artista).
- Todo o cuidado de escrita com os companheiros no Ato 1 foi jogado fora no Ato 3, eles se restringem a quest pessoal e depois disso não tem mais NADA de dialogos ou cenas a mais, só um comentário ou outro sobre alguma coisa mas não passa disso;
- Os companheiros praticamente não interagem entre si, é totalmente focado apenas no jogador;
- As quests pessoais de Wyll, Gale e Karlach são fracas, pouco inspiradas e muito básicas, é bem claro a diferença de escrita entre eles e Shadowheart com Lazael, não há um conflito interno intenso como as delas, até mesmo Astarion teve um conflito interno (apesar de mau apresentado no final infelizmente). Isso torna eles desinteressantes (já basta Wyll ser o Batman da Sword Coast, Gale o mago prodigio da senhora da Magia e Karlach ser o general de um duque demonio logo de cara na historia), falta conexão já que é inexistente conflito internos;
- Jaheira e Halsin são interessantes, mas totalmente desnecessários de ser companheiros(além de só entrarem pra lada metade do Ato 2). Halsin era pra ter ficado no Ato 2 já que sua historia termina ali, apenas o colocaram na equipe pra cena do urso lá. Jaheira tambem, só entrou na equipe porque ela é dos BG's antigos, mas não achei ela tão interessante assim, muito básica. Minsc foi bem interessante (10 minutos dele foram melhores que 70 horas de historia do Wyll, Gale e Karlach) mas totalmente descenessário entrar na equipe tambem e pior ainda entrar tão tarde;
- EXTREMA falta de momentos marcantes ou épicos, literalmente não tem nenhum momento marcante nesse jogo, é tudo bem meia boca, além que a musica do BG3 não ajuda. The Witcher e Dragon Age são anos luz melhores nesses aspecto;
- Falta de Bromance como Alistair, Garrus, Wrex, Varric, Lambert, Eskel, Dandelion entre tantos outros ótimos personagens. Focaram em poder ter romance com todos que esqueceram algo simples como isso (além que achei forçado ter flerte com Gale, Wyll e Halsin sendo que eles são claramente heteros, ao contrario do Astarion que é claramente gay); 

[hr][/hr]

GRÁFICOS - 7/10

Positivos:
- Belos gráficos;
- Cenários bonitos;
- Personagens bem modelados;

Negativos:
- Pouca variedade de cenários, sendo negativo pela longevidade do jogo e torna maçante;
- Boa parte das armaduras são bem FEIAS e tem pouca variedade, diria que uns 4/5 das armaduras e roupas são feias demais. As melhores são as pesadas, e as piores são as roupas de mago, chega ser ridicula uma das ultimas armaduras que você pode comprar na Torre do mago.

Every single person in my friend group was raving about the game, so I decided that I would buy it and give it a go. In the beginning I kept waiting to be hooked in like everyone said I would, unable to put the game down. It was an easy pick up and put down in the beginning, but now I'm obsessed with getting every single sidequest possible and pick up everything I can get my grubby little hands on.

To make matters worse (or perhaps even better), I introduced my mom to the game. I thought it would be a fun little hour or two of running the keyboard while she made the decisions, and then she would be done wtih it. That was very much not the case. My mother LOVES this game. My dad does, too. In fact, so many people in my house want to play it that I had to buy a second copy so we could play at the same time! Astarion (also known as Oregano/Octavious/Octogon/Asparagus) is a favourite because of how ridiculously high you can get his roll bonuses for lockpicking. It is a surreal experience when you hear your father go ""Astarion tried to proposition me last night and got all snippy when I said no"". Especially when he is somewhat laughing.

My mother is obsessed with Karlach and is determined to make Karlach her character's girlfriend. Said character is named ""Dolly Parton"", a super beefy high elf war cleric who runs around in skimpy clothing and beats the ever loving shit out of all her enemies. Easily the best $60ish usd I have ever spent. My parents have put in more playtime than I have, and I replayed a solid 20 hours because I decided I hated a decision I made early on. They play it for date night. Its one of the cutest things I've ever seen.

The character customization is not as extensive as I would have hoped, but the various sassy dialogue choices more than make up for it. 100/10 would reccomend, hands down a delight to play!",1708715461,1708715461,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had poured 70 hours into my honour mode save only for it to screw me over with game-breaking bugs. I was in act 3 and was so close to ending the game and finally getting the achievement that would make me feel good about myself. Then when I killed the red dwarf, all my companions started attacking me, and then i thought it would be a good idea to SAVE THE GAME. WIPING THE EXIT TO THIS MADNESS BECAUSE HONOUR MODE FORCES YOU TO ONLY ONE SAVE FILE. I could have loaded the previous one. Maybe lost a couple of minutes collecting stuff, maybe redone the monks quest that was also bugged, talking to Bhal's victims that they would die ""none of them took me seriously"" and then i could have done it all over again. But my dumbass wanted to save the fucking game with the bug that ruined my honour run COMPLETELY.

So dear Larian Studios, if you would be so kind and fix this bug (and maybe remove the single save file setting) that would be perfect.

I've played 179h so far. However, that consists of only 1 playthrough (of Tav origin), and my last save (at pretty much the last decision point before the ending credits) is at approx. 141h. Which means I spent ~38h reloading either due to curiosity getting the better of me and/or simply on the verge of wiping a battle (TBF, I reloaded every time somebody in my party died - even if I could've resurrected them).

As someone relatively new to the DnD scene, it was a rough start for me, learning to survive bigger battles, even on Explorer mode. My brain, used to regular RPGs with limitations, couldn't even imagine all the creative approaches this game allows the player to take.
On the other hand, I've learnt more about DnD mechanics in general from this playthrough than I ever did from internet guides...

I did a playthrough of 141h, occasionally peeking at guides to explore and find everything possible...and there are still multiple locations/interactions I managed to miss. Not to mention all the story paths I didn't take.

I aimed for a good-aligned playthrough with as good endings as possible, and yet, nearing the endgame, it got trickier and trickier to correctly guess the 'good' course of action.
So. Many. Plot twists. So. Much. Lore.

Cons?

My major gripe is that a certain party member bugged out a bit before the transition to Act 3 and I wasn't able to ever actually add them to my party after that.

Inventory and party management could still use some QoL improvements. Nothing a few mods can't fix, but an official patch would be better.

One could argue that the Act 3 could still use more fleshing out and improvements. There have (allegedly) been some major changes in the storylines compared to the Early Access version, and the rushed bridging occasionally shows, with some minor details not really making 100% sense.

Still, by the time I actually finished the playthrough, quite a few essential patches had already been applied to the game, so aside from the specific companion mishap I was able to progress through the game relatively smoothly.

Would I recommend it?

Hell yeah!

Now excuse me while I go make a new character with a Durge origin and go on another adventure!

I think it gets most of it's hype by just being old-school as a game instead of what gamers have been subjected to from AAA studios in recent years (that is buggy unfinished poorly designed over-monetized piles of trash with pretty graphics), so when this comes along and it's NOT the usual garbage it got a very warm welcome.

And for the most part it deserves it.  Plot has been solid and pacing is ok, graphics and sound are nice, voice acting is on point, map design is lovely, combat rewards interesting use of the environment, and so on.

The main cast though?  Uninteresting.  Boring.  Disappointing.  Overly difficult to get to know with the one most ready to talk about their life stories being the one who is supposed to be keeping secrets as a matter of religion.  I suppose I was expecting something closer to the old BioWare experience of character writing and presentation like from Mass Effect or Dragon Age, but this is just... missing something.  Part of it at least is how little they interact with each other or the main character in general which I think stems from not just committing to a central player role ala Cmd Shephard that can be written around and instead having to write around the protagonist being any of the pre-made characters OR a player-made option.  The result is just a bit 'meh'.  And when your main cast feels 'meh' it makes it harder to care about the main story because it's harder to care about the cast that's in it, and this is especially a bad thing for a story-driven RPG so what would have been a mole-hill problem feels bigger.

The other thing holding the game back from being a great game is the modern-day D&D mechanics.  It feels like Baby's First Leveling System.  Customization is bare-bones at best, classes don't really feel all that impactful and just kind of feel like all you're doing is choosing a primary DPS option for each character.  Sure, it means you don't strictly need any particular class types or whatever but it also means none of them are all that interesting either.  The multi-classing is also a disappointment.  The choices made in leveling just don't feel all that meaningful when compared to D&Ds of yester-year.  Streamlined is not always better once you've been streamlined out of making interesting choices.  

I've also never been a fan of the D20 core dice mechanic as it's too linear and 'dice-y' making it feel like the outcomes rely too much on dice and not enough on player choice or skill.  Replacing the D20 with 2D10 would make a far better game on it's own.  Bell-curve dice outcomes give you a better feeling of player agency when you have a generally reliable range of results on the dice with a noticable curve of things getting difficult or easy and still get that outside chance of amazing or terrible outcomes once in a while.  But again, that's a D&D problem which this game just inherits by sticking so close to table-top rules.

The character editor, while 'ok', is also disappointing.  Body sliders should be a given in this day and age, or at least instead of 'normal' and 'tall' body types have a few actually different body types and a height scaling slider.  But then, my standards were set by City of Heroes 20 years ago and the vast majority of games have been a disappointment in character customization ever since.  Not being able to pick a casual clothing outfit is also disappointing, especially when I have to steal Shadowheart or Minthara's outfit if I want something other than 'villager #67' as an outfit.  I also continue to be mildly dissappointed that a game actually feels the need to give genital options but still doesn't have one for hermaphrodites.  I mean if you're going to go that far on that one customization option, why not go all-in?

Still, at the end of the day the game is worth the price and you'll have many enjoyable hours out of it.  Just because it has room for improvement doesn't mean it's Bad.  I'm also all for supporting this classic business model of one-time buy and done in the big mass-market gaming space.",1708688563,1708688563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's the game's magic, and that's also why I'm not even going to attempt to do a long, detailed review of the game. I'm not someone who necessarily vibes with the combat in [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]- I prefer things to be faster pace, and a bit more forgiving to the occasional incorrect input. However, that's not stopping me from being extremely positive on [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]. The main reason why I love it so much, and probably the best thing I can say about it, is that it respects your time and decisions more than any game I've ever played. Companies like Telltale blew up by creating games that give you the illusion of choice; you pick between option 1 and option 2, but the ultimate outcome is essentially the same regardless of your choice. [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] doesn't do crap like that. You will make decisions 2 hours into this game, that will impact quests and stories 50 hours into the game. Your decisions will impact who lives, who dies, who you're allied with, etc. This expands out on such a scale that there isn't 1 or 2 different outcomes, there are hundreds, probably thousands of different outcomes to thousands of different scenarios. If you and 24 of your friends all play this campaign, you'll all have wildly different experiences across the entire game; that's not something you can say about other games that have sold themselves on ""player choice/agency"". This same respect translates to exploring the world; you're rewarded with unique weapons, spells, character interactions, etc. The respect Larian has for your choices and exploration, combined with the brilliant characters and voice acing make [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] an unforgettable experience that is extremely replayable.

That was me as well- until of course I started seeing clips everywhere and decided to give it a go.

From my experience? Baldur's Gate 3 is a genre-defining game for this generation. It ties in and streamlines CRPG elements into gameplay while weaving story-rich and character-driven narratives thoroughly throughout its run.

It's very evident that Larian as a team put in a lot of passion and care into their development of BG3, whichyou can see in the countless amounts of small details laid out throughout the various dialogue and mechanical interactions a player can make towards resolving an encounter. Talk it through? Sure. Blow it up? Sure. Jump from the top rope of a 300 foot drop as a bear to RKO a walking heap of infernal machinery? Nothing stopping you besides your creativity.

Virtually fully voice-acted (and particularly excellent work on this). Graphically pleasant and solid in building the right feel for each environment and situation. Lovable characters with a whole range of depth. Compelling baddies and NPCs and factions and encounters. Fantastic replayability. Engaging gameplay for the turn-based enthusiast. Bear sex scene, as advertised. And certainly much more- the game's a gem and definitely deserving of it's GOTY win for 2023.

Overall: It is a brilliant and charming game with intriguing characters and an engaging narrative. This is a game you will have to devote quite some time to if you really want the full experience. There are so many different routes you can take that every playthrough will feel unique. However, Act 3 is not laptop safe. You will need a decent pc to be able to experience it in full.

 Only downside in my opinion, is that while Acts I and II are more exploration based and spread out in content (allowing you to take a breather and process where you are at in the story), Act III is super content dense, and all packed within the city of Baldur's Gate. I've had the game for awhile now and still haven't been able to finish Act III, because its so dense that it doesn't give you the opportunity to catch your breath, as your constantly being pulled around every-which-way into the climaxes of quests you have been on throughout the entire game. 

Act I and II's average time between encounters is 0-3 per hour, whereas Act III's average time between encounters is closer to 5-7 per hour.

What don't I like about it? Well...

First off, the game doesn't run particularly well if you're not running it off of a SSD. I got the weird portrait bug multiple times during my playthrough, crazy texture pop-in and even T-posing models at times. Granted, I was running the game just fine otherwise, but it was really jarring how unpolished this game was technically just because I wasn't using an SSD.

I think the writing is extremely overrated. If someone gave you this storyline in an actual D&D game, I guarantee you would think it's boring. I don't like putting spoilers in my reviews, but yeah - the game has a twist that doesn't really end up mattering that much depending on your choices, and the overall plot just doesn't land. There's no driving factor beyond the Mindflayer thing (being careful not to spoil here). Any other game would get shredded for how utterly mid the story of BG3 is.

And people really love the characters of Baldur's Gate 3. They're designed well, they're voice acted well. But to give Astarion of all characters Best Performance? All love to the VA, but no way. Astarion's story doesn't even progress until Act 2, more specifically the end of Act 2. And then once you get to the city, his story's done. How is that worthy of Best Performance? That'd be like if in 2015 we gave Best Performance to Piper Wright of Fallout 4 instead of Geralt from The Witcher 3. It sounds ridiculous on paper.

I do like the companions, I do! But they're not that interesting. They're all good, and none of them are great. I love Gale, but his story just ends on a conversation unless you detonate him. Wyll's story is probably the most entertaining, and you have to do his too, since you can't get a satisfying end for Karlach unless you do. Yeah, unless you do these specific things for another character (Wyll), Karlach doesn't get a happy ending. I know people love Shadowheart, but good God is her story boring. I don't care about any of this, and I actually killed her by accident in dialogue at one point. Which by the way, bugged out, causing the game to fade to black, and then when the game faded back in, she was permanently gone, so I had to reload. No indication that I killed her. I got the best ending for each character and honestly, I wish I cared more.

People love calling this game a sprawling RPG, but it's actually quite small if you really think about. It has huge open areas, but those are only really a puddle deep once you really start exploring. There's a good amount of side quests, sure, but none of them were really that interesting or worth doing until you get to the city in Act 3. And I did actually like doing quests in the city. I loved doing back to back run arounds in the city, since it gave me shades of Oblivion, which I love.

I think the worst part of this game that gets a pass is the combat. But I think I just personally hate 5th Edition. I think 5E has a plethora of issues compared to previous versions that weren't mitigated in this game. Larian used the most boilerplate and generic as possible version of D&D, with what feels like the Player's Handbook alone. And then they have the nerve to cap you at Level 12 instead of 20. Why? But I'll ease up on Larian a bit and blame the issues with the combat mostly on my gripes with 5E. I've whiffed so many damned attacks in this game. I've whiffed attacks more than XCOM! How's that even possible?!

I'll leave this by saying I hated playing this game, but I respect it and I'm still going to score it high. Because I respect Larian and I think they made something great here, but I don't personally find it fun or interesting to play. To be honest, if BG3's combat used an Mana system instead of 5E, I'd enjoy it way more as a whole - because Larian is very good. The game's beautiful, it's colorful, it's voice acted well, it has choice and consequence, it has replayability, it's great. Just not for me.

TL;DR: Baldur's Gate 3 does a lot of things well, but those things it does well are Larian things in spite of how garbage D&D 5e actually is, and I believe it gets a pass for the things it doesn't do well. Overrated, but I still respect it a ton.

It was my first turn-based RPG and I didn't really understand the mechanics, the dialogue was overwhelming, and the game seemed to move incredibly slow. However, my girlfriend loved the game (Astarion) and talked about it (Astarion) constantly. It did sound like a lot of fun, so I finally caved and decided to try it again, but this time doing a multiplayer play-through with them.

After 80-ish hours of exploring the Sword Coast, I am now afraid to purchase any other games because I know nothing will compare to it.

Pros: Choices matter, each charter is unique and you have have multiple ways to react.
Each play through it different because you should be making different choices and no game should feel the same.
You can play with your friends, thus increasing the likelihood of 1 &2.
Its 5e in your computer, the changes from the core ruleset make sense and are in service of a better product, has a fan of DnD I fully support this.
the plot is creative, the voice acting is top notch, more general praise, ect..

cons:
not fast paced.
turn based combat moves slow but with magic it needs to be that way!
something else I forgot to mention that doesn't matter because the pros outweigh the cons by so much.

there is my review, you have heard the hype now try it!

But if Larian doesn't stop with these massive friggin updates that keep bugging out the game, I'm going to scream. Ever since this last patch, my game has been a headache of arguing with ""No, don't CLOSE the door, WALK THRU IT"" and random crashes in the middle of important cut-scenes.

The graphics and level design are astounding, the voice acting is impeccable and the story is everything I've looked for in every game I play. The game doesn't hold your hand as you begin but it also isn't overly challenging from the start. It encourages exploration with intriguing surroundings and something new on every corner that even I- someone not particularly fond of exploring being a huge aspect in the game- can't get enough of every tiny location. Everywhere you go there is someone to talk to, something to do or someplace to loot. There are multiple ways to achieve the same goal, and each one brings something different to the table. At first I was sceptical about the turn-based gameplay and dice rolls because I dived into the game with a very vague understanding of DnD. Yet, everything fits together so well and I've come to appreciate if not love dice rolls and TB combat the more hours I sink in.

As a long-time fan of the series, I embarked on this journey with high expectations, and I'm thrilled to say that Larian Studios has not only met but exceeded them in nearly every aspect.

First and foremost, the world-building in Baldur's Gate 3 is nothing short of breathtaking. From the moment you step foot into the mystical realm of Faerûn, you're enveloped in a rich tapestry of lore, intrigue, and danger. The attention to detail in every nook and cranny of the game world is evident, and it's clear that the developers poured their hearts and souls into crafting an immersive experience that pays homage to the iconic Dungeons & Dragons universe while still feeling fresh and original.

One of the standout features of Baldur's Gate 3 is its robust character creation and customization system. Whether you prefer to play as a cunning rogue, a wise wizard, or a stalwart warrior, the game offers a staggering array of options to tailor your character to your preferred playstyle. The depth of choice extends beyond mere aesthetics, with each decision you make during character creation impacting your abilities, strengths, and weaknesses throughout the game.

Of course, no RPG would be complete without a compelling story to drive the action forward, and Baldur's Gate 3 delivers on this front in spades. The narrative is masterfully crafted, weaving together themes of betrayal, redemption, and the struggle for power in a way that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The characters you encounter along the way are equally captivating, each with their own motivations, quirks, and hidden depths waiting to be uncovered.

In addition to its engrossing story and world-building, Baldur's Gate 3 also shines in its gameplay mechanics. The turn-based combat system is both strategic and satisfying, requiring careful planning and tactical thinking to emerge victorious in battle. The ability to interact with the environment in creative ways adds an extra layer of depth to combat encounters, making each skirmish feel dynamic and unpredictable.

All in all, Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece of the RPG genre that seamlessly blends the classic elements that made its predecessors so beloved with innovative new features that push the genre forward. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the series or a newcomer looking for an epic adventure to sink your teeth into, Baldur's Gate 3 is an absolute must-play.

Then some game braking bugs, like fire condition that never ends. Even water does not help. Fix your game!
Fix romances, they are bugged/ one for example is when i want to make love with good Minthara. There is only a talk to wait for the night, but nothing wont hppen- only kissing. Obviously it is bugged due to other things that are going to happen in your camp at the same time. Same with Karlach. It just does not feel natural anymore/ rather static and robotic.
Not many different spells, cause some classes feel the same thanks to this. It is boring!
I can not suggest an overrated game that is also short (most time goes being into the minigame lol). Lack of content. I obviously speak more loudly about this game when it receives all these fixes, and also a green button from me. Sadly not right now!",1706292716,1708637326,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wanted to see the phenomenal best CRPG ever that everyone else saw, but I don't. I see an average CRPG with pretty graphics, decent writing, a poor adaptation of DnD 5e (a combat system I actually really like), MCU dialogue (not a good thing), very poor PC optimisation (I had more crashes in 48 hours of this than I've had in 150 hours of Starfield), safe faux-edginess, and a fanbase who thinks it's an eroge and are probably the most annoying people on the internet right now. It's a 7/10. But what's most egregious to me is one simple fact: it's not a good sequel. Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 are among the greatest video games ever made and this doesn't feel like a sequel. It references their events on occasion, sure, and has a couple of returning characters, but frankly they feel like completely different characters and the world feels totally different.

The open-endedness of a lot of situations makes to look like there will be a good amount of replayability. There's also a great amount of content for the price of the game.

I really want to love this game but it's bogged down by some of the worst camera and controls I've ever seen. The camera has a nasty habit of falling into pits, and the locked angle means that a task as simple as looking up a flight of stairs is a challenge. The controls are similarly lacking. Sometimes you'll try to move to some location lower down and the game will decide that the logical way to do this is to jump down and take 30 damage rather than use the ladder next to you. AI controlled characters are a chore to have helping you. They'll run straight into your cloudkill spell and nearly die, then become hostile to you.

Overall it's a game with huge potential which is somewhat held down by poor controls and a frustrating camera. 7.5/10",1708633793,1708633793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lacks an official mod support. You have to use a third person mod manager, and if you want to play a modded multiplayer, you have to put much effort into having the same version, the same order of mods, and even then, it's not guaranteed you can play together. I just spend over 2 hours trying to fix an issue of a friend not being able to join my lobby, modded and unmodded. Every solution I could find on the internet isn't working.

I guess I won't be playing until Larian either stops patching the game (since that breaks both vanilla and modded saves ever since I started playing pre-patch 4), or adds an official mod support. Because right now, the game is unplayable modded, and vanilla game is extremely unpolished (and buggy).

Also, it took them a few months to fix shield bash not working and for Halsin to actually play his voice lines as a companion, so I assume if you want to play a finished product, and not one that seems like an early access, you will have to wait a good few years before this game becomes playable, or before Larian stops trying.

As a long-time fan of the franchise, I had high expectations, and I'm thrilled to say that Larian Studios has exceeded them in every way possible.

First and foremost, the depth of storytelling in Baldur's Gate 3 is unparalleled. From the very beginning, you're thrust into a world teeming with political intrigue, dark magic, and compelling characters. Each dialogue choice feels meaningful, shaping not only your own character's journey but also the fate of the world around you. The writing is superb, immersing you in a captivating narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish.

The gameplay mechanics are where Baldur's Gate 3 truly shines. The turn-based combat is both challenging and rewarding, requiring careful planning and tactical thinking. Whether you're engaging in a heated battle against formidable foes or navigating treacherous dungeons filled with traps and puzzles, every encounter feels dynamic and engaging. The freedom to approach situations in multiple ways adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, ensuring that no two playthroughs are ever the same.

Visually, Baldur's Gate 3 is a stunning achievement. The attention to detail in the environments, character designs, and spell effects is nothing short of breathtaking. Each location feels alive and brimming with personality, inviting you to explore every nook and cranny in search of hidden secrets and valuable loot.

Furthermore, the voice acting is top-notch, bringing the diverse cast of characters to life in a way that feels authentic and immersive. Whether you're conversing with allies or facing off against adversaries, the performances are consistently impressive and help to further immerse you in the world of Baldur's Gate.

In conclusion, Baldur's Gate 3 is a must-play for fans of RPGs and newcomers alike.

[h2] Edit after finishing the first run: [/h2]

Baldur's Gate 3 delivers a breathtaking and immersive experience that transports players to a world filled with magic, mystery, and adventure. As a long-time fan of the Dungeons & Dragons universe, I was eagerly anticipating this release, and I can confidently say that it exceeded all of my expectations.

One of the most striking aspects of Baldur's Gate 3 is its stunning visuals and attention to detail. From the lush landscapes to the intricate character designs, every aspect of the game is meticulously crafted, pulling players deeper into its fantastical realm. The environments are rich and diverse, ranging from bustling cities to dark and foreboding dungeons, each with its own unique atmosphere and challenges.

The gameplay itself is incredibly engaging, seamlessly blending elements of classic RPGs with innovative mechanics. The ability to interact with the environment in meaningful ways adds a layer of depth to exploration and combat, allowing for creative solutions to encounters. Whether engaging in strategic turn-based battles or navigating intricate dialogue trees, every decision feels impactful and meaningful, shaping the course of the adventure.

One of the standout features of Baldur's Gate 3 is its robust character customization options. From choosing your character's race, class, and abilities to shaping their personality through dialogue choices, the game offers a level of freedom rarely seen in modern RPGs. This allows players to truly inhabit their role within the world, forging their own path and forging meaningful connections with the diverse cast of characters they encounter along the way.

Speaking of characters, Baldur's Gate 3 boasts a memorable cast of companions, each with their own personalities, motivations, and storylines to explore. Whether forming alliances or facing off against enemies, the relationships you forge with your companions have a tangible impact on the narrative, adding depth and replay value to the experience.

Furthermore, the storytelling in Baldur's Gate 3 is nothing short of exceptional. From epic quests to intimate character moments, the narrative is expertly crafted, drawing players into a gripping tale. The world of Faerûn feels alive and vibrant, teeming with lore and history waiting to be uncovered.",1704719493,1708627853,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The sheer amount of player freedom, choices to be made, build variety, character dialogues, moral dilemmas etc. that the game features just leaves every other game I've ever played in my life in the dust. These days I have very little patience for newer experiences and I have a rather unreasonably high bar for what I consider to be a game that I place in my favorites, but BG3 has shattered all expectations - even moreso considering the fact that prior to this, I wasn't even a fan of CRPGs or D&D in general. Unlike most games I've played in recent years, this game genuinely feels like a labor of love by dedicated and talented devs, and the fact it received GOTY and is recognized for its achievements gives me hope in the midst of a rather bleak moment in the games industry.

I recognize it's sometimes unreasonable to say this considering every developer and game has its own strengths and uniqueness to it, but I do hope that developers and designers will look to BG3 as a lesson and inspiration for what a game of this scale, depth, and dedication looks and feels like.

Now for some rantings:

Divinity Original Sin II completely changed how I felt about what games are capable of. Baldur's Gate III proved just how unique the ideas in DOS2 were by meshing the format with DND. One things for sure... the studio behind these games are quite different from their contemporaries. Where others have attempted to garner attention with flashy licensing deals, battle passes, and loot boxes, BG3 instead brings us back to the time where games were just... games. 100% of the progression in BG3 and DOS2 are in-game, no pay 2 win, no store page, no paid DLC. Hopefully this game allows the AAA industry giants like Ubisoft, Activision, 2K, EA, etc... to take a hard look at their financial models and maybe just maybe... put more time and effort into making a fun but challenging game on launch rather than the shopping malls most games are becoming nowadays.

This game is stable unlike any other games. It just doesn't crash. It works. I saw some games crashing even they are 2D, made with major engines like Unity, Unreal, etc. And I cannot be silent about Diablo IV, MW III, they were nightmares and headaches.
I'm telling that those kinds of games are crashing like Hell, often, not just sometimes.
Actually Diablo IV was better than its released version. It just had to stay as an early access.
It's hard to see normal, standard, sane games these days. So many games are crashing, they don't work with controllers, they've got errors, bugs, faults, and they are too many, and they got paid, they keep selling. Oh, how on earth they get money with those products with so many errors!
Even NVIDIA's RTX 4090 flickers, blinks, especially with G-Sync.
Yes, it's a future we dreamed about yesterday, but is it really better than before? Cutting-edge techs, better looking, but they've got so many bugs, errors, faults than before. And it causes crashes. They cost more, they provide more errors. Is this common sense? Is this sane?
Some people said ""They are blinded, they are crazy about money."" I didn't agree, but now I agree, because I can see this, I saw.
Oh, RTX 4090 flickered again. Gotta turn off that stupid G-Sync again.
Oh, I bought ultimate editions and I haven't played Diablo IV, MW III for long time. It's OK, there are plenty of other games like 'Baldur's Gate 3', they don't give headaches, they don't waste players' life, time, energy, they don't provide many errors, they can be enjoyed, playable, they don't hurt, harm.

Larian Studios deserves every bit of acclaim it gets, and more.

this game continues to surprise me with its sheer depth and complexity - there's as many solutions to as many problems as one can think of.  the reactivity of the world and characters to your player actions is amazing.  this game is like no other, and is probably, in my opinion, the best video game ever made.

EDIT:  I do have some criticisms now.  One of the things I originally thought was great, the constant updates/bugfixes/whathaveyou, are actually getting a little out of line.

Imagine this: you're half-way through the very long game, then updates come out, and they are MASSIVE, code-changing, mechanics-changing, story-changing, you name it, updates.  There's several big issues with this.

First, it is pretty easy that the save game becomes broken.  Now you have to start over, even if you didn't want to.

Second, the mechanics/story/etc. change, and maybe now you want to start over.  but, you wonder is it worth it just to see what's different?

Third, you know what you're doing but then you do something as simple as visit a vendor, and the entire system is changed.  Yes, the new version may be ""better"", but I'm half way through a game, I don't want to have to re-learn how to play it.

I think doing bugfixes and hotfixes was a great idea in this early part of the games release; HOWEVER, I think changing core mechanics, battle mechanics, lines of dialogue, and essential pieces like this, should have probably waited for a Definitive Edition release - or - until the majority of players had finished their first run of the game.

Its better for the players, and its better for the game, because, if say I had beat the game already, and then found out you changed/updated a lot of things, that gives me more incentive to play it through again and see the differences.

I do not, however, want to be in the middle of the game and have the game completely change on me, when I was enjoying it as it was.

That all being said, its still a fantastic game.

BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY PURCHASED/PLAYED GAME - I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU WAIT TO DO SO, UNTIL THEY ARE DONE FUCKING AROUND WITH THE GAME AND RELEASE ITS FINAL VERSION.

As it stands, the game is basically an inferior clone of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, except with better graphics and far worse gameplay mechanics, a distinct lack of customizability and modding potential, a horrible cast of characters that you want to strangle after a 2 minute conversation and a nonsensical story that craps all over established Mindflayer and Githyanki lore. Speaking of which. Are you a fan of BG II? Do you remember being a fan of characters like Valygar and Haer'Dalis? Well, in Larian's eyes 'extraplanar' now means 'non-binary drag queens who make skeletons dance for entertainment purposes'. Yeah. I was actually relieved when I found out they didn't turn Zariel into someone who identifies as a man. I just hope these people never get their hands on the Planescape Torment IP. You get it, right? This game has a serious case of gender ideology allyship, right down to the incredibly offensive 'body type' nonsense that also plagued Cyberpunk.

Is it all bad? No, mechanically the game is fine, it's your standard party-based Western CRPG, there are just entirely too many chests, satchels, barrels and other (often locked) loot boxes added everywhere, so if you are a completionist, the game quickly becomes busywork. The AD&D system and combat mechanics are implemented well, but they removed all the interesting stuff like character alignment and meaningful differences between the races, leaving us with a bland and communist interpretation of Faerun. The inventory also reflects this communist mindset and design philosophy. There are millions of lackluster items, all with with poor to downright unhelpful effects and a couple really good ones that you have to be lucky enough to stumble across. A lot in this game is left up to chance, and in my eyes that's just poor game design. I don't want to spend hours sifting through random crap, only to find a necklace of Charisma +20 lodged in a dead cat's anus. How can this game be worse than Solasta at this? It's not like Solasta was the gold standard of CRPGs, far from it. But at least they didn't encourage you to click on every single speck of dust in their game world.

What Larian did give us was a bunch of fun and meaningful decisions, even though the eventual ending is about as good as Mass Effect 3 and nothing really mattered. And the Jaheira character, she is pretty faithful to the original, so I'm very pleased about her inclusion. I am also pleased with the amount of freedom the game gives you, especially in the sense that you can kill almost anyone you don't like. There are hardly any consequences and you can act good or evil without any internal consistancy and the characters, nor the game world, will punish you for it. I will admit, finally running a spear through a certain Aasimar was probably one of my happiest gaming moment for 2024. And I seriously can't stop cutting off Karlach's head. I must have seen her ugly, malformed mug roll through the mud about 10 times now.

Do I recommend you try this game? Absolutely not. I finished it because I paid for it in Early Access, but this was definitely my last Larian game, ever. This game killed any and all faith I had in the company. Too bad, because some of the people who worked on this clearly have talent. All i can do is hope AI development speeds up to the point where I can design my own party and rely on my own writing instead of being subjected to more of this distasteful gender propaganda.

One last thing: there is no dwarf dominatrix with a whip in Baldur's Gate, so don't get your hopes up. Larian teases you with this, but she's already dead, and it's a pointless quest. Another wasted chance to make this game into something worth playing. Well, we'll always have Loviatars priest.",1692033236,1708606406,False,0,0,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,False

But as soon as I started this, I just dropped my other gaming and spent all my free time playing this wonderful CRPG for a few weeks.  

It has a depth to it.  Characters and conversation pathways are very branched out and diverse.  Graphics are popping even on my lower end gaming laptop.  The turn-based combat system is fantastic and this plus the story is what really drives the game.  

It has a great atmosphere and I was truly sad to be finished with my campaign.  I'm already thinking about having another go at it with a different lead (you customize from start) and focusing on different ensemble throughout.

This world of BG 3 was made with a passion and is a treat to immerse yourself in.  There is a reason this is the only unique game among Steam top games.  9 of the top 10 of them are shooters/battle royale types and then there is this standing out amidst those others.  I just had to see for myself what made BG 3 so unique, and what a great decision that was!

 - waiting for the enemy to take their turn, watching them stay and do nothing OMG
- no speed up for the movement on combat and out of combat, this will take your times

It's extremely good, well made, attentive and an accurate implementation of D&D rules and lore. Not a whole lot of negatives, except for maybe the enormity of this game. Too much to explore, too many character arcs, side quests up the ass, insane item glut, so much to steal and so many backs to stab. A good problem to have in a game I guess, but it can be overwhelming. Definitely not a pick-up-and-play kind of game and the turned-based combat isn't for everybody. But the story is great, and the characters are well written and voice acted. BG3 is similar in scope and time spent on the Witcher 3 base game.

- 5e DnD has been changed slightly for this game, and I think the changes have so far been for the best. BG3 knew how to tweak the underlying system for the video game's maximum enjoyment and I am glad they did. I wasn't sure DnD 5e would be enough to carry a game that is trying to do so much, but they added some clever complexity that works great for the video game (but might not be feasible at a table).
- As someone who went through the previous two games immediately before this one, I can say confidently that you do not need to play the previous titles to get a good time out of this. That said, as someone who did play the previous titles, I was given plenty of callbacks that I understood.
- Like the previous two entries in the series, the story, characters, quests, and overall plot are the strongest suit of the games. While I am not a big fan of the Forgotten Realms as a whole, the stories told in it have been worth the effort I have put in.
- The game looks gorgeous, certainly a big jump from coming off the previous two games, but I think it was the only way it could be done today. The amount of motion capture this game must have seems staggering. Conversations feel so fluid and real, and just looking at everyone as they speak has been lovely.
- Like many others, I find that I might be even more well-prepared for playing real TTRPGs after my playthrough was finished. DnD 5e is also not my favorite TTRPG, but this didn't stop my enjoyment of BG3.
- As someone who played Dragon Age games abck in the day, I can see the influence in this title, and I can also see that they have made many of the ideas they might have taken and made them their own.

I have never been interested in turn based combat games as i am more familiar and intrigued with shooters, so this game was a gamble for me first when i picked it up. 

I can honestly say i have never been blown away by a game so unique for it's genre and it's unique approach to setting the staple to what a good game is supposed to be. It has been one of the best experiences i have had in my 20 years of gaming. I haven't even finished the game yet since i dont want it to end, it's really that amazing.

I love games that introduce a good story, and since it's an RPG i didn't have any big hopes that it would deliver just that. I imagined it would follow the basic formula of ''Here take this quest, go there, kill that thing, return and get your reward'' and repeat. No character or development to the quests. But that is simply not true in this case. Every single person you talk to if it is to just to simply chat or take a quest from literally changes the game in some aspects. These can be huge and they can be minor you will simply find that out by making them. They can be personal changes in your party, how your companions will react to you how much they will like you or hate you. They can change the world around you literally bringing up new things to do or things that are now unavailable to do thanks to your poor/good choices. All these choices you make will affect the outcome of the game since there are countless different endings that are not bland at all, but extremely detailed, making them all feel crucial to the players taste when making their choices, deciding who they want to be in the world.

Alot of RPG's lack something that other games of different genres such as Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us or God of War dont. Character development. This game defies that bane entirely, your character is mute and has no dialouge when chosing things to say (Except certain cutscenes) And your character feels more alive than ever still. There are so many dialouge options to pick not just simply ''yes'' or ''no'' but things that gives the character life and his/hers personality. Not to mention your companions you are going to encounter on your journey that has one of the best pieces of writen character arc and dialouge i have ever seen or heard. You start to literally care for someone that is not real and their feelings and ambitions because they feel so alive and real when you speak with them.

The score of the game is amazing, nothing more to say about that honestly, listen for yourself.

When it comes to the world of the game and it's accessability open world is a sort of. The game is divided into acts and during each act you are in a specific area with things to do and explore. People to talk to, help and kill if you so wish. You are limited to that specific area until you reach the next act of the game by playing the story, this might at first sound like it is limiting the players freedom but in my opinion it is encourging the player to explore the points of interest and characters that are available to them. An important thing to mention is that when you are done with an act and you enter the next one in the story, you can not return to the area again. You can not talk to the characters there, you can not explore it it is simply over. This will impact your run in the game since there could be important characters or quests or enemies you didn't explore there that could and will impact the outcome of the game.

Baldur's Gate 3 has won game of the year for a reason, alot of people thought it should have gone to Spider Man but those people haven't even played it and those that did after, alot of them have changed their minds completely. It is simply a masterpiece within gaming history. If this game was a dish at a restaurant it would be in a michelin restaurant at the center of Paris.

Being aggressively, sexually advanced upon by my party members, to the point of making my socially awkward self uncomfortable irl

Restarting the entire game halfway through Act 1
Giving myself small mental breakdowns over dialogue in a fantasy role-playing game because I decided to bully women and children and it turns out I kind of liked it?

However, as a casual gamer, I cannot finish the campaign... I'm stuck against Raphael in the House of Hope and there's no way I can beat him with my current team/skill/knowledge. 
And that's why I leave a negative review. The game is too hard for non-aficionados and the game difficulty is so steep in Act 3, it removes all pleasure and only brings anger and frustration.

Larian absolutely knocked it out of the park, but i'm sure you don't need me to tell you. There are some points that may rebuke certain players :

1. This is a very horny game. Larian knew what they were doing when showcasing the bear scene. There is an option to turn of nudity, however, it won't help with your defense if someone walks in the room during a frisky scene
2. This is a very long game. It took me around 450h to complete the game 4 times and get the 100%. An average playtrought will need around 100 to 120h. It is important to note that I am very slow, so my situation might not be applicable to everyone.
3. It is a turn-based combat rpg, so if turn-based combat is not your thing, you might very well not enjoy this game.

One of the greatest strenght of BG3 is the way it react in a way that matters to your decisions. Since every dialogue is mocaped and voice acted, Larian cannot take the simple route most rpg takes by planning a simple text. One would think this restricts the potential for BG3 to make companions of npcs react to events, yet it doesn't seem to. After all the time I spent with it, there are dialogue, items and outcomes to quests I have never seen in game. The map is huge and filled with new things to discover at every corner. Most important of all, it never seems like are there just to be slain. A majority of the time, you can tell what they were doing before you showed up to behead them, that is if you choose to do so. 

On another note, the decisions you make do not impact the story as much as it let believe. Most choices to be made dictate the path you will take, but the destination will majoritarily stay the same. No matter what is done, the second and third acts of the game will end in the same fight despite your choices. Act 1 is not included as you don't even need to engage with it's content to proceed to the next acts. The game ends with 2 possible ends, but the permutations are so numerous I wouldn't dare to count them all. So while the story cannot be changed in a major way, the consequences of your decisions taken torought the game are taken into account a displayed with such care the small amount of possible ending doesn't even bother me. 

As for the system, it is much more simpler than most crpg you can find, the original was meant to be played pen, paper, dice and no calculator (looking at you Owlcat, I like your games but the math gives me a headache). It is very similar to D&D 5e, but with quality of life improvement to simplify so rules while adding to the possible combat options. The fights gain a lot of depth with the addition of environmental hazards and conditions not present in the original pen and paper rpg.  The added rules do give way to overpowered builds and cheese strats, but I wasn't even aware of most of them until my second playtrought. It is also a solo non-competitive game, so balance doesn't really seem like an issue to me unless it truly ruins the experience of first time players.

In our case, we decided to go with two custom characters and build relationships with the various origins characters in the game. We created our characters and thrust ourselves into the new campaign, both completely new to the world of Baldur's Gate, but not new to the work of Larian. 

The game's writing is amazing, with every choice having the weight you'd expect if not more. The approach to the narrative, storytelling, and story progression is in your hands completely. From smaller things like specific races and backgrounds having extra options during certain dialogues giving more depth to your story, to annihilating an entire faction. Easily one of the best implementations of DnD to a game.

8h into the game, while exploring, we unlocked a way to reset the levels of our characters. Considering this was a title developed after Divinity 2, I went into it expecting there would be the possibility to change your character's appearance, but that wasn't the case. When the option wasn't available alongside the respec, especially as it has less actual impact on the game, I decided a quick search was mandatory as both me and my friend wanted to change a few things about our characters we were not happy with.
Although a way to change your looks has now been patched into the game, that was not the case more than two months ago and in an attempt at enjoying the many more hours we'd have on the title, we restarted from scratch, recreated our characters and quickly got back to where we were. 

After that, it was smooth sailing. We kept exploring every crook and cranny and would never leave a region before making sure all loose ends were close and we had explored everything. The quantity and quality of content the game offers it's magical and calls for multiple playthroughs just to see how much love and attention has been put into it. We took our time - clearly - and made sure to play as meticulously as we would alone not letting the coop get in the way of attention to lore, books or dialogues. We had a wonderful time, really. Great game to play with the right person!

All dialogues have so much depth and have been motion acted! There is a moment in the late game, where one of the dialogues has such amazing voice acting and animation that it has forever engraved itself in my mind. That's how good it was. Another moment that comes to mind is a discovery we made during a mission. Something very unexpected, yet it was the truth and completely changed our objectives going forward, at least for our roleplay whereas for others it might have motivated them even further. This is the beauty of this game, everything you do and every approach is just as valid as the next one. This was not unique in these 160 magical hours. Throughout all of them, me and my friend kept being shocked by the level of detail, interaction, and ramifications of the story. There are so many other examples I could give. 

But where there is good, there is bad. During the final Act we did encountered a few bumps. Still god-tier, but it is worth mentioning. Progression in particular felt sluggish, as if at every corner we would meet a wall that would make all our choices and plans crumble somewhere else as a consequence. It took us many hours, with a lot of different approaches to our progress to find the perfect balance for what to do first.

Regardless of our best attempts and careful approach, during our finale, we could not forsee this turn of events. We had to make a really hard choice to get the best outcome and find common ground with my friend, so I was already saddened by that. Right after that, my favorite origin character, my romance and companion through most of the run took a steep turn I didn't expect in their story. I was so confused by this end result considering the path we had both walked on was not the one they were now choosing, even slightly hinting at it being also my idea when it never was. I later learned shortly after seeing the finale that what I thought was an inconsequential choice made during a dialogue -  one I would even say was quite neutral - was the dialogue that would permanently determine their story. This was prior to even learning and talking about the potential alternative new objective for this origin character. There is no other dialogue or check of any sort that can change that and, in my experience, nothing in the game made me understand things would have gone this way after I made this choice. Hell, it even sounded like it was still up for debate. 70h after I learned my price. 

For the whole game, I have been preaching this, so: I know it's technically the result of my own choices, and since then I accepted the end result and found many ways to level with it when it comes to roleplay. That said, I stand my ground that having the choice to determine which path the character will follow, prior to knowing what are the options, and with a neutral response isn't well done, not when for everyone else it was quite clear. A simple dialogue after the events would have done it.
 
Add to insult injury, although I was the host, my friend during the whole finale was the only character visible besides the origins, only because he had the character that could defeat the final boss in his group. That was the case even for dialogues with my romance and companion. The coop never had any such issues until now, often having our characters at least in the background during dialogues.

The game is a solid top-down CRPG, and controls very similarly to Divinity 2. I wished for some of the prior games' limitations not to show up again. After all these years of early access and a new camera zoom that can go close to third-person perspective, I was disappointed in not having the choice to bind movement to WASD when that is the default for controller players. Especially in a game that, with all the dev's good intentions, still struggles with camera angles and environment objects at times. Yes, things become transparent when too close to the camera, but are still interactable making your character move in the wrong direction or teleport back to the area you just came from simply cause it's a big door and its hitbox is still in front of your mouse.
As a hoarder, something I also was hoping would have been improved is inventory management. There are plenty of bags in the game to order your items around, although you can't name them. When sorting, identical items will not merge into one stack, making entire lines of the same spell scroll unless you manually stack them, which I obviously did. A small icon next to books to let us know if we had read them would have also been a nice addition, especially with the large amount of literature available. 
Other than that, the game plays perfectly fine and it's an extremely polished experience, with almost no gameplay limitations but your imagination.

Still, you know what they say: it's not the destination, but the journey that matters. Although I had wished for a better ending to my adventure, nothing can change our journey. What really matters is how excited, happy, and impatient I was to come home and play this game, and no amount of sour endings could erase that. I made a mark in this world and shared this crazy adventure with a friend, with highlights we'll bring back for likely the rest of our lives as already do with other titles, or until the next Larian game. 

I find myself already thinking of what to do on my next run. No matter how hurt I may be from how a part of my story ended this time, it clearly can't keep me away from this game or lower it's magnificence, and that speaks volumes.

take the gameplay mechanics and features and make a better game that is actually polished.

better if you play solo probably. won't stop most of the bugs and some soft locking though.

Great dialogue and story, awesome mechanics. Fun level design and all around great gameplay… when it works. 

This game is a buggy mess and shouldn’t be considered in a playable state. Main story works fine but side quests and even quests that lead into the main story are broken to hell with wild bugs. Act 3 alone is a bugfest that honestly ruins the experience. 

If the game worked it would be a 10/10 but Jesus Christ it just doesn’t work! I have over 200 hours and 100 hours are from restarting due to game breaking bugs. Still haven’t finished the game and before you say anything my pc requirements exceed the maximum recommended specs and I rarely have issue with any other game… unless they are unoptimized to shit like this one. 

Don’t get me wrong I want to support this game because it has great bones, no microtransactions, and has a fantastic story… but fuck it’s like it is still in early access.

The amount of content and freedom you have in BG3 is unprecedented, and it's hard to find another RPG that combines story, character development and exploration so well.

I could talk about how good this game is for hours, and I did with my friends. Mind you, we are all 40+ yo and have a lot of things to do. But for BG3, we managed to find 100+ hours to finish it. Because it's THAT good.

However, there is one big issue (at least for me), and it's the combat system. Obviously, DnD isn't the best choice for a computer RPG, and in terms of battles BG3 feels like a step back compared to Divinity Original Sin series. I don't get why we should limit ourselves by a dice roll in XXI century, and getting those critical misses is incredibly frustrating on balanced, might lead to losing a battle on tactician, and even be game ending in honour mode.

Sure, there are a lot of ways to ""cheat"" in this DnD implementation, and there are many very powerful character builds, but dice roll rng still feels annoying and unnecessary in a modern computer game. Still, BG3 on balanced is definitely easier than Original Sin on normal, so at least there's some counter balance to using a paper based game system in a CRPG.

And, for TTRPG fans, it's an incredibly faithful translation of the 5e rules, a better than the previous Baldur's Gates/Icewind Dales/etc did with 2nd/3rd Ed D&D.  It redefines fantasy tropes and presents scenarios that allow the player to actually role-play a character rather than always go for the ""most perfect"" choice.  
So, obviously, this game is worth playing.
That being said, there's some real bad flaws in there that need to be addressed.  Some I can see getting patched up, others are inherent to the game itself.

The former: 
The camera:  Oh sweet, merciful Selune, the camera.  It is probably the single worst thing about the game; it will get hung up on objects in the scene and pull WAY back making interacting with the world much more difficult.  Sometimes higher floors will display between your camera and character, forcing you to go to the absolute (get it?) tightest shot of your characters face to see anything, again making the environmental interactions a pain.  And then, on occasion, it'll just freak out and bounce around, trying to find an angle that it thinks works.  It's awful.  
The timing: There's this weird concept where your party can be in turn-based-mode but the rest of the world is still moving through time normally.  This is truly insane; it's as if your whole party and the people they are immediately fighting are literally waiting while everyone involved politely takes their turn, all the while other NPCs are just walking around at a normal pace and glancing over going ""what the hell are those guys doing"", until they too get sucked into this weird game and start participating in the ""I'm next"" fight.  It makes setting up ambushes much more tedious to arrange.  
The Shadowlands: Without giving too much away, at some point in the game you will encounter an area that does Necrotic damage every turn, with (as far as I can tell) only one solution to mitigate.  Unfortunately for me that solution bugged out so I was forced to screw around for a few hours in the easiest mode until I found a way to get around it.  To my mind, the entire area should have used the much-under-appreciated ""Exhaustion rules"" from 5e, maybe inflict a level every so many rounds, something like that, but either way, they gotta fix that bug since the plot funnels to that point.

The Latter:
Incredibly mopey yet horny world: If NPCs aren't moaning on and on and on about their misery or threatening to murder you then they are desperately trying to get in your pants.  It becomes comical after awhile, especially against the backdrop of the plot; ""What's that?  You've got a worm in your brain too?  I find that irresistible..."".  Having the option to romance a ton of different characters sounds good on paper but plays out in a very awkward way.
Wildly Imbalanced Encounters: Definitely not the rule but, in several important spots, the encounter challenge is way too high.  That wouldn't necessarily be the case if it weren't for the timing issue mentioned above.  Trying to take down a building full of enemies quietly, a room at a time using Silence and surprise attacks gets all screwed up when patrols are still moving in real time against your round-by-round actions.
No Hovering: While you can fly from a surface to a surface, there is no levitation.  You can't have a mage float up off the ground out of melee range and bombard the enemies with fireballs and magic missiles, only to get shot out of the air by a lucky crossbow-bolt.  Real missed opportunity.  
No Weather/Day Cycle: Or at least I haven't encountered any.  Huge missed opportunity; could of had rain dousing fire and interfering with missile attacks, returning to sites at night to loot the place while everyone is asleep, etc.  

All that being said, if you made it this far, I do recommend buying it even at full price.  But, boy-oh-boy, prepare yourself for some moments of real frustration.  Great game, 9/10.",1708525813,1708525813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

took a  longer break from the game and HOLY SHIT they still push new patches and improvments and QoL stuff out even after they already won the GOTY and have everyone praising them.

Great game that continues to get better with each patch. I really like the story and the depth of the conversation tree's. The voice acting, sound effects, and music is outstanding. The game mechanics are fun and the closest thing I have found to playing 5e as a video game. The Mature game rating is defiantly appropriate and I've enjoyed the adult setting and how far they push some of those aspects of the game. You can play as so many different races, classes, and moral paths to get several replays out of it. 

-

The Bad:
Some of the graphics are a little sloppy. Hands moving though things, armor glitching, etc. Even playing with a 3080 and having everything turned up, it sometimes feels a little last gen in some areas. Honestly this is a minor issue and every patch it seems to clean it up a bit. 

I just don't like how much inventory management there is. I'm constantly sending stuff to camp or cleaning my inventory. Its not always clear what items will be useful, so its easier to send it all back to camp than to risk losing it forever. I honestly spend 1/2 my time playing the game just sorting inventory. 

-

What I'd change: 
- Ability to send items to any teammate, even if they are currently back at camp. 
- A ""wares"" bag where you can put anything you want to sell. Currently when you add something to wares, it clogs up the main inventory page and cant be placed in a bag. 
- Documents and items with no action should not automatically show up on the action/weapon wheels. It takes forever to scroll through it. 
- Items shared between teammates should also show up on all weapon/action wheels or not be shareable. Scrolling though the inventory trying to track down that random spell scroll you need is a pain and really takes me outta the fight.

This game came out in early access in 2020, i decided not to get it and waited 3 years for the final release, the wait was absolutely worth it. 

It's perhaps the best RPG i've played since The Witcher 3. Everything, from the story, to the gameplay, graphics is exquisite quality. 

The story is set up in a very clever way, all major and minor quests are interwoven together so that your decisions in small ones make a big impact towards the end of the game. I have not found a single quest that was filler material or boring. What stands out the best from the story point is the characters. Each and every character is thoroughly written, well voiced and have a distinct personality. The characters are so distinctly different from each other that you will quickly have favorites and non-favorites. Let's go over some of them in summary:

1. Shadowheart: Absolutely the best girl and my favorite in the game, she's a cleric, have a ""Damsel in distress"" story arc which is a joy to explore and complete her companion quest. Very logically written character.

2. Karlach: Karlach! Can i say enough about how adorable this character is? For some funny reason she always calls us player ""Soldier"". Absolutely endearing character, a bit rakish and devastating in combat. A must have character in your party.

3. Wyll: A Warlock, always sounding upbeat and boosting the party's morale.

There's so many more characters you'll encounter during your playthrough.

Now gameplay, combat is punchy and smartly designed, i'm more of a RTwP (Real-time with Pause) RPG liker but this game made me like Turn based combat, the physical attacks are devastating, the spells are spectacular, especially the Warlock/Sorcerer spells are great. Cleric/healing spells and others are a thing of their own. Moving party here and there and is great, it's basically D&D game with much simplified combat. You will feel the imposition of the spells and attacks during combat.

Graphics, the game looks beautiful, character models are superbly detailed and environments are colorful and have a sense of atmosphere. The spells graphics are great, the costumes, armors and awesome looking, you can dye your armor with different colors. 

Sound, just click on Fireball in a sorcerer/cleric spell bar and listen to the character preparing the spell with whiffs of fire getting reading to be shot, the sound design is impactful, certain environments have atmospheric sound that set the tone of the area, some areas are downright jolly and some are spooky. Voiceovers are professional and well done. 

This game needs to be experienced, one pointer i would give is to not skip any side quests, i skipped some in Act 1 by mistake or didn't understand properly and had to struggle with XP, you need XP to level up, so do all the quests in order to have proper level as the later fights in the game get quite tough. 

All in all, it's a great achievement by Larian to develop such a game, it won several awards including Game of the Year (2023) and it was well deserved. This game is not to be missed.

Ready your swords, snap your fingers for spells, Mind Flayers have descended upon Baldur's Gate, and you're the hero the city needs, onward!

I'm the kind of gamer that is all about the story when it comes to video games, often lamenting a lack of depth in game plots (and the impact of decision making) despite great gameplay/mechanics, but BG3 might have*too much* story. It's so deep and nuanced and adapts so well to your decisions and random ideas that I've purchased it here on Steam, on Xbox series X, and other copies for friends. It's THAT good.

They keep adding extra stuff to ""round out the edges"", and it keeps making it better despite them barely needing to make changes in the first place.

Update: They understand us, and it keeps getting better! 
The systems, gameplay and dialogue are so vast that every time i play a new character it feels  entirely different. I'm now a dark urge  bard and I think I'm having just as good if not a  better  time than my first play-through.

Each scenario is different in some way, for example, if you're a monk, you can be silent, the entire game!!!!

I've played a LOT of games, but nothing—absolutely nothing—has grabbed me quite like this one. It's like the folks at Larian Studios took everything I love about fantasy and RPGs, mixed it all up, and then dialed it up to eleven.

First off, creating your character is a trip. You've got all these races and classes to choose from, and it actually feels like it matters who you decide to be. Your character's background changes how people in the game treat you and what options you have for dealing with stuff, which is super cool.

Then there's the fighting. It's turn-based, which might sound a bit slow if you're used to hack-and-slash, but trust me, it's intense. You've gotta be smart about how you approach battles, using the environment and planning your moves. It's like chess, but with fireballs and sneaky backstabs.

The game looks incredible, too. The worlds are so detailed and beautiful that I've spent hours just wandering around, looking at everything. And the magic effects? Insanely cool. Every time I cast a spell, I'm sitting there like, ""Wow, did I just do that?""

But what really makes Baldur's Gate 3 special is the story and the characters. It's not just some generic ""save the world"" deal. Your choices actually matter, and they can change the game in big ways. The folks you meet and team up with aren't just there to carry extra swords; they've got their own stories, and getting to know them is half the fun.

Voice acting and dialogue? Top-notch. I've laughed, I've gotten a bit teary-eyed, and I've shouted at my screen because of the choices I've had to make. It's like being in a really good fantasy movie, but you're the star.

In a nutshell, Baldur's Gate 3 is the most fun I've had with a game in ages. It's like the ultimate fantasy adventure that you never want to end. Whether you're a hardcore RPG player or just someone who likes a good story, you've gotta check it out. Hats off to Larian Studios for making this masterpiece.

Playing with one of my friends on multiplayer mode, he was telling me that there had been a ton of things that I wanted to explore was not even remotely in his play through on his first single player run. There was an entire other area that we had discovered that he had never seen before but had fun exploring. We hadn't even scratched the surface 25 hours in when the first Act ended. 

There are also some really cool things that can happen if you choose to play as one of the characters already made for you at the beginning of the game. I don't know if that is possible for the custom characters though. The character, The Dark Urge, has a lot of things that you can't control, and it's interesting how you can respond to each instance. But, I don't want to give out any spoilers so I'll leave it at that. 

I would like to point out how detailed the game is and how easy it is the pick it up and put it down. There are a lot of beautiful scenery moments and the dialogue choices are amazing. In fact, one piece of dialogue could change how things turn out in the end. Choose wisely. Your life could very much depend on it. You can also save at anytime, even when in the middle of dialogue. It makes it easy because you don't feel like you have to finish a battle or figure out how to get somewhere in one go. It's very easy to understand, too, when you look at the different spells and weapons and what they do for each character. It takes a little bit of getting used to but I love how they lay it all out for you in the, I'm gonna call it an action bar, and it's very easy to click and cancel each of the actions if needed. 

In conclusion, this is, overall, a really well-done, thought-out game that takes the hobby of D&D to a whole other level. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I have. I hope this review helps! Have fun out there!",1708484093,1708484093,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

update: I might change my mind slightly soon, but be aware that the technical issues persist and I'm pretty sure it's my RAM 

I typed up my whole-ass review without switching which thumb-button I was on and when I switched the button it deleted my review. Thanks, Steam. What the hell.

Game is buggy as frick. There's too much content and a huge amount of it isn't properly integrated so everything starts spazzing out if you do things in an unintended order. There's also something wrong with it because my PC specs really outstrip the recommended specs but it's still dipping to 30fps all the time. Not sure if it's a CPU or RAM bottleneck because I've got a 10700K and 16GB/3600MHz RAM, but those still both are overspec'd, so I'm thinking it's the fact the game absolutely sucks at cleaning up after itself.

Also the story is mindblowingly mid so far, though I haven't even made it to the eponymous Baldur's Gate yet. Like you have a lot of cool setpieces, but none of it feels like it belongs in the same game - and not in a good way. I couldn't give less of a rat's ass about what's happened in the story so far because I don't care about any of these people or places, and the companions feel like wet toilet paper used for stroking off the player character or something. The depth is incredibly superficial. Origin characters getting their soul sucked out of them if you play them is also fantastic (sarcasm). I know these story complaints are #JustWRPGThings (I hate WRPGs generally speaking), but the genre being what it is doesn't mean you are supposed to pretend a single-player experience can play out like a live D&D campaign and keep the flair.

All these complaints and more, and yet I can't stop freaking playing because the gameplay itself is great and scratches a primordial FE/XCOM itch that those games can't quite reach. It's just... I'm nearly at my breaking point wrestling with the insane FPS stuttering when I move the camera just because I use the controls like an RTS gamer, and when games are jank, I usually press on for the story, which in BG3 is basically just ""lol look you can play Curse of Strahd with the tulpas in your head""",1706990798,1708482152,True,0,0,0.497872322797775269,0,True,False,False

But it's a game where I feel you have to invest a lot of time and energy into understanding the gameplay to have a better experience, or you will go down a frustrating journey. Don't be like me.

Combat rules:

Always examine new types of enemies (right-click and press examine) to see what works and what doesn't. Read everything and press ""T"" on effects you don't know.
Spellcasters are weak, so use your tanks and physical attackers in the enemy's face.
If you fight on split levels, establish high ground as fast as possible.
Always use your action and bonus actions as often as possible.
When you can pick a feat, pick Tough for everyone. After that, follow this:
Shadowhart: War Caster (Helps her keep concentrating)
Karlach: Savage Attacker
Your Tav (Rogue): Savage Attacker
Wyll: Ability improvement. Put both points into Charisma.
Here were my impressions the entire time I played—minor spoilers ahead:

That part where you have to kill all the goblin leaders took ages. I ended up looking online because I wanted to avoid killing everyone in the place, but I did that anyway. I only had one stealth potion and ended up using all the gold I stole from the goblins to resurrect my companions after legging it away with a bunch of goblins and other creatures, knowing what I just did inside the sanctum. I will admit, it was fun trying to problem-solve how I was going to kill these three leaders without alerting everyone else, lol.

Why is Wyll so weak? Also, Shadowheart, why do you suck with fireballs?

Shadows are cowardly enemies; they'll often attack my character who's just been revived and teleport away or just suck the companion's energy. As soon as I'm done with all the shadows, there's one left, but he keeps hitting my teammate and blending in. Screw those lemons!

The difficulty really starts to ramp up in the shadow-cursed lands. It feels like no matter the level I'm in, enemies will be tougher. Every boss is too high-ranked for me to take on properly.

Gale is starting to annoy me as he keeps eating the good loot I find. I ended up ignoring him.

That session has me knackered—protecting Hansil with the portal while getting overwhelmed. I ended up having to change from a Drow rogue to a wizard for more power. I barely won in the end.

I reached the moonlight tower, and some orc told me to find someone, but this battle was really annoying. That fat-ass demon that keeps his mother in a jar didn't lift a finger to help. The enemies kept spawning and spawning, a mix between Hansil's beast form and a lot of healing from Shadowheart got me through it. I eventually ended up blocking one of the archers so he would target me instead of the rest. It got tedious, wave after wave, until it was 4x4. I felt this fight.

So, I got to the part where we siege the general, but a frontal attack wasn't the greatest idea. After 3-5 attempts, I found out I should have talked to the wolf creatures about turning on the master. But when I took the invisibility potion and did that, the fight began. Oh no, we died. In the end, I started the battle with a two-sided attack from the front and the side. It was great, but eventually, most of the people on my side died.

Auntie Ethel is back, and I killed her again. But it's annoying, as I also had to kill those reviving fungi. Stay dead, Ethel.

I ended up reuniting then betraying Dayme. Due to some real-life things happening, I just wanted to be evil, and it reinvigorated my interest in roleplaying as my character, the opportunistic bastard he is.

This clown is really heavy to carry. Just sending everything that I can to the camp.

Had an easier time killing Orin than I expected after killing her grandad ended up killing the last 2 people on the list as I got tired of going no where ",1708265440,1708478758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought this in very, very early access. I believe I only paid £15 for it - so as value for money, at 170 hours in I have nothing to complain about.

To address the elephant in the room of this being 'woke', it really isn't. The age/sex/race elements of the game are just all open-ended, so you can be any age/sex/race, and have sex with any age/sex/race. It really is as simple as that. It certainly isnt forced down your throat as people are making out. It is a mature game for a mature audience with no hard-set boundaries in that space. That's it.

As for the gameplay, I would describe the story and world open-linear. The main campaign is mostly getting from A to B with some dice rolls in between. Ultimately, you do get to the same place in a round about sort of way. The rest of the quests and stories are totally optional and can be completed or skipped entirely.

The in-game store-keepers have set items which refresh every hard-load of the game, while this makes controlling the items available to the player easier, I feel this should have some element of randomisation to it. Its quite normal for traders to have different items day to day. On the plus side, as their funds refresh, you can rinse money from them selling stolen junk.

The class selection and progression is relatively sane and inline with DnD. There are of course some certain combinations which probably 'over-perform' compared to others, to the point of almost being broken, or in the words of Spiffing Brit, 'as the developers intended'.

The control and movement is your standard point & click outside of battle (I use M+KB, cant comment on controller!), with a pretty standard turn-based interface and dynamic. The turn mechanics take into account the DnD style of turn-based battling in quite a clever way, so I do advise to any newcomers to this format, that you take the time to do the tutorial aspects of the game. There is a lot of options at your disposal later on, and knowing how to properly use the option available to you can make you a truly formidable opponent. As a wizard for example, you can attain sorcery points to use for giving yourself spell-points or casting more powerful offensive spells. There are also items for getting more spell/sorcery points, adding a bonus action to your turn or even action points. Knowing how all of this ties together in combat can make the difference between winning confidently or loosing miserably. A similar thing to note is the dice rolls - if you are new to this type of dynamic, I would take the time to learn what you can do, and what different things mean (advantage, disadvantage, modifiers, penalties). You can stack some things to get extremely high rolls, so that's worth noting.

The lore and story of this has kept me interested and engaged to a very high level - to the point I have read basically every note and book in the game. Some of the books/notes you find tie up to other books/notes so you can loosely follow other stories within the world. I found this to be an interesting point. I wont give anything away about the story, but it does make sense, lots of twists and turns - even late game - where snap decisions must be made. There were part that came to light as I played I certainly wasn't expecting. The Dark Urge story line is particularly interesting.

All in all if this is your type of game, you will enjoy it. The game is still getting updates and improvements, so can only hope this game continues to evolve and improve, and seeing what Larian have done so far, I am confident it will.",1708183241,1708476997,True,2,0,0.549950540065765381,0,True,False,False

If you are of the same mindset, you should speak up because this may change their policies. Other than that, this is an amazing game, and you should try it. However, mod users should avoid it.",1610239818,1708475879,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First of all, like any respectable relationship sim the game provides a lot of great outfits that can be easily customized so you and your better half can look absolutely dashing every time you step into the lower city sewers. 

However the more I played this game I just can't stress enough how good the extra stuff like ""combat"" and ""story"" is. There is even a very elaborate leveling system where you can select different ""skills"" and ""classes"". 

At times I got so involved in completing those ancillary tasks surrounding the main game I almost completely forgot to upkeep my relationships back at the camp.

Ok now that THAT horrible comment is out of my head and out of the way, it's honestly refreshing to play a game where your dialogue options and actions in the game ACTUALLY affect how you experience the rest of the game. 

Remember all those times other gaming companies have promised that your ""decisions have consequences,"" and then you come to realize that the only consequence is that one of the npcs now thinks you're a jerk but that's all that changed? 
That is NOT the case for this game! 

Don't like a certain NPC? Kill'em. I don't care. The game does though and you might regret it later. Or not. Who knows? Maybe it was beneficial? You'll find out later! Or not, if that something that *would* have happened required that NPC. Too bad / Good. Because they are dead. You unalived them.

Want your party to be rich and you don't care how it happens? Well with some stealth, some smart thinking, and maybe a little bit of luck, steal all the money from every vendor. Then wait for them to replenish their stock and come back to steal it all again! Then you can buy stuff without worry! Or... why not just steal that too? (Not recommended if you are a Paladin. wouldn't want to break your Oath now, would you? Unless you want to be an Oathbreaker paladin. Then go ahead. Break away!)

The amount of things you can get away with in this game and the number of DIFFERENT ways you can solve issues is probably just being limited by your imagination (or choices you made previously). 

There really isn't any other (video)game out there that is THIS in depth with decision / consequence layouts.

For table-top Dungeons and Dragons players, YOU might have a little less freedom, because you don't have a DM to allow your insane out of the box idea that breaks rules for the sake of ""cool"" - but there are still PLENTY of fun, cool, hilarious, or serious character building ways to handle the situations in this game. 

SERIOUSLY - I HIGHLY recommend this game. 
in fact, there are no words to properly describe the level of ""recommended"" I have for this game. 

So in the words of a dead meme -

So much so, that other game companies find the need to berate Larian for making a game that is ""too good"" to set standards towards. I've spent 80 (update, 350) hours in this game and I'm STILL learning new things every day that I play. I get so entranced by the incredible storytelling, the infinite places to explore, the Easter eggs and hidden secrets, the fights, everything about this game has been made in a way to appeal to us as gamers, not as pockets full of money. 

This is the very first CRPG that has ever caught my attention, and has completely made me fall in love with the entire genre at this point. Now, I want to play actual DND just because this game helped me understand it so well, and appreciate it for what it is. 

The only real downside is some of the bugs. Recently (2/20/24) I've come across a bug that causes the game to lockup and eventually crash. In Honor mode you can lose hours of progress (at least, until I realized you can still quicksave just not quickload), but Larian is incredibly good at listening to feedback and fixing these game-breaking bugs as fast as possible. 

Good to see that not all game companies hate it's playerbase now. Best $60 I've ever spent! If you've never tried this game, you're doing yourself a disservice!",1694794291,1708469073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

          Additionally, this game has so many different ways to play. I discovered created homemade pipe-bombs by putting barrels of explosives in backpacks and throwing it at bosses.

This game is amazing but to pretend like its perfect is just not true. It is near perfect and the blend of turn-based vs live makes the game more immersive while maintaining the strategy component. 


- Game story and variation 5/5

===== I just completed my first play through and started my second. I've already encountered a bunch of stuff I missed the first time. This game has TONS of replay value.  The story is  immersive and very much impacted by in-story choices.  I do wish you could chose your alignment and have dialogue more geared toward (good / neutral / evil). 

- Game mechanics and interface 3/5 

===== Interacting from one floor to another lower or higher floor is super annoying and sometimes impossible. 
===== Inventory management is a freaking nightmare.  
===== A smaller issue is when the characters move into a cut-scene for the story. The characters will go into conversation and interact in the story but then they revert to where they were when you walk into the room. This is good for setting up a strategy but, also feels janky because its strange to have the characters go from talking to a npc back to hiding behind a pillar when the cut scene ends.",1708452313,1708452805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Superb. Once I read the little note that said ""SSD required"", which I somehow missed on the original min tech spec, everything fell into place. One external SSD later and it's all up and running and working like a damn dream.

The mechanics of the game are outstanding, the story engaging, the graphics on point - exactly what I wanted for a bit of escapism. Highly recommend!


Original review:

I was hoping to fall in love with this game as so many have clearly done - but unfortunately I'm one of the thousands for whom the game is broken. Start it up, hit ""Continue"", or ""New Game"", crash. 

Would you like to spend 20 mins verifying files? Might as well. 

Does it work? Nope.

Brilliant.

I love a an evil play through when it comes to D&D; most games do not deliver true ""evil"" options without ending or breaking the game. BG3 has multiple ways to be thoroughly evil. Yes, the plethora of goody two shoes stuff is still there, and is fun also, but the depth of the writing in this game... I just want a picture of the flow room. You know those diagrams with the strings and tacks you see on homicide dramas? I bet the one for this game looked like spaghetti noodles for 400 people, with some poor dev curled up in a ball under it all, just rocking it away. There's a few bugs here and there, but the company seems intent on squishing them. If you're good at D&D and pissing off your DM with your creative problem solving IRL, you will love the ability to do so in this game given enough time, strength, inventory space, and creativity. I am on my 3rd play through and I've not stopped discovering new things, despite being one of those annoying MFers that has to peek in every. single. corner. I also love the amount of representation in this game. It's beautiful. The more I play it, the more I love it. I resisted for so long because I *knew* I'd be obsessed. And here I am, correct in my obsession. 

I don't use mods or anything, but I hear there's fun ones out there if that's your thing, too. But it doesn't really need them.

Between the quality in animation, storytelling, voice acting and graphics, you get a very good experience ,that is, only if you can play turn by turn games because fights can get very frustrating especially those that lasts a good while and that you have to start again.
Beside that every character breathes with life because choices matter and it's very rewarding to make one get off a dark path or feeling the consequences right in the face because you forgot about something or dealt a situation badly. It makes you wonder how you could have done things differently and that's great because the game can be easily done again and again. 
Though it must be known that later part of the game is kind of lacking in terms of content and the endings can be very disappointing as of now.
Gameplay wise Baldur's Gate 3 gives many classes to play with as well as a many settings to create your own character which enables you to have many lines in conversation especially made for your class/race.

There are a couple of good characters but not really enough to fill your party.   Not that it even matters because every one of them wants to screw  you (the good kind)  after talking to them basically once, so there is no point in even interacting with them unless you are looking for a fancy dating sim with no real character development.  It may sound strange but I wanted to actually play the game and interact with my party members without constantly being hit on sexually.  It doesn't even take any effort.  You literally cannot interact with them without being rude or leading to a romance.  Any by the way, its ALL of them.  You can't even make ONE friend, comrade, buddy, teammate.  Talk to them nicely once and it becomes awkward.  Character romance in itself is fine but do you need to be bombarded with it by every character whether you want it or not?   

All that aside the story tries to be so epic that it is completely ridiculous, childish, and terrible.  There is no adventure to it, no subtly, or nuance.  Even little things like your camp are annoying.  Why the hell is your camp like a 5 star luxury hotel?  You escape a mind flayer ship with nothing but a....fully furnished luxurious portable apartment.  You are supposed to be suffering hardships and overcoming trials not living it up in style like some spring break road trip.  Where is the rugged adventure?  It is beyond stupid and makes the game developers look like spoiled children who get anxiety if their triple venti soy latte isn't made to their standard.   Beyond that there are many many more problems that you will discover on your own after wasting 60 of your hard earned dollars.  

To be somewhat fair there are elements of the gameplay that are very good and I do really like the graphics.  The combat can be annoyingly slow if there are a lot of enemies but it is still fine.  Overall though, a wretched game.  It did not have to be the original Baldur's gate, but it did have to be a good game.  And at that, it was a critical miss!

I just thought that I needed to warn everyone of a couple things first. Without spoilers. This game is still buggy, in a frustrating, rage-quit way at times. I have had to backtrack HOURS of tough, grueling gameplay, because the game either a) did not warn me of a ""point of no return"" and online spoiler-free quest order guides blithely told me to do those things in the wrong order; or b) certain party-npc related story-development cutscenes fail to trigger (again, found this out after more hours of questing, when looking up a hint). I've since read many reddits about bugs and bug fixes, so it WAS worse, but it is still not 100%. There are also a lot of very non-intuitive things regarding some of the strategies which are most effective. I've played a lot of d&d (including 5e since its release about a decade ago), so I know a lot of tricks, hacks, and out-of-the-box tactics that work. That said, I should not have been getting Dark-Souls level stomped on as much as I have been because I didn't do something juuuuust right (there are very weak enemies that can one-shot, no-resurrect, kill your party members for instance...if there is a cliff nearby). 

So, in conclusion: this game is absolutely worth the high price tag, just for what it does well. BUT you need to make a lot of manual saves (it allows you to change the label so you can keep better track, so A+ for that) because almost certainly there will come a point were you did something WRONG (according to the invisible game mechanics) and probably don't want to slog 50 more hours into a game that you: have a broken NPC which no longer will follow the party and just stands in whatever dungeon you left him; somehow glitch-stalled a romance you had been working on for no discernible reason; you can't revive your main character for some reason no matter how many scrolls/spells/or money you throw at it; will die over and over again fighting bosses with tons of allies if your first round isn't perfect.

Edit after 240+ hours, patch 6 downloaded, complete Tav and Durge playthroughs: this is now my desert-island game. I am STILL finding dialogues and character interactions I missed or which changed based on different choices I made my second playthrough. There are still bugs I encounter but I learned enough from my first run how to fix/avoid some of them (seriously, sometimes it's just talking to people in the wrong order that does weird stuff). Patch 6 just went live and fixed a ton of stuff and added some nice extras as well. It seems like Larian's patches repeatedly add content (I guess those poor gamers at release didn't get an epilogue?) not just fixes, so it is well worth a revisit to old saves. I hope they keep adding stuff on the regular. I don't even need ""new quests"" type DLC, just more time in this world and more time with these ragtag weirdos I've become so enamoured with.",1705608472,1708401288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Finished my first adventure. Great Game, but I felt the ending was a bit rushed and incomplete especially during companion's parting after final boss fight. I had to press Spacebar to continue cutscene because it paused everytime a character finished speaking.
Act 1 and 2 was superb but Act 3 (end game) was underwhelming and too short. 
Trading items with NPC became difficult after patch 6, I can't buy things with gold stored in camp now. Also I can't see prices of wares that I'm selling, It's hard especially when NPC has few golds and I have a lot to sell. Add to wares function became useless.

There are redeeming qualities (mainly in dialogue writing and environmental design), but they aren't enough to compensate for what a big great mess this game is. 

It's not a good CRPG (most of the times you still end up fighting the entire camp no matter your choices), the combat is very tedious and takes way too much time, the quest design is extremely janky with you never being able to do what you intended to do (it's like I'm playing a game written by an alien that just don't understand humans).

They are typically huge time commitments, and even if it's a good one, I treat it as a one and done. BG3 is the only one I have played from start to finish multiple times. And I am STILL finding new content and there are narrative paths I still haven't taken. Try as I might, I can't seem to squeeze all the fun out of BG3. 

Immersion is a trite word for game reviews, but it really is the best word to describe how BG3 feels. In some ways it reminds me of Red Dead Redemption 2, in that its production values and atmosphere made me want to linger even when I wasn't actively progressing in the game. The game invites you to inhabit and explore its world, not just mindlessly progress from one area to the next. 

Given how much content is in the game, I was shocked--and then disappointed-- when I heard they cut the upper city from ACT 3. (It's no spoiler that you ultimately make it to Baldur's Gate, it's in the title.) I hope Larian adds it back in , even if they repackage the assets as DLC. I was also shocked to hear they weren't planning any DLC or expansions, but it seems like they don't hate money after all and are going to do some. This is good news, since a game this good, with such a well realized engine, should serve as the framework for yet more. 

A few words about the story. IMO the main story is not as compelling as the way the companion character's own quest lines feed into it. The dynamics between the companions is the best part of the story. These are fully realized characters, with their own motivations and purposes, who at  first mostly want nothing to do with each other. They are only brought together because by a stroke of fate they were all cursed with the same problem. It was a stroke of genius for Larian to weave these character's plotlines into the main narrative arc. Too many rpg devs don't take that opportunity. 

Another great touch was how many quest lines evolve from act to act. Choices you made in act 1 will come to fruition in act 3, and it gives the impression that you are leaving a mark and that your actions have consequences. 

That said, I thought the main narrative was a little too gimmicky. It all revolves around the mind flayer tadpoles and a deeper conspiracy, but it still relies on MacGuffins (gimmicky plot devices) too much, and I was never really fully sold on the threat the Absolute represents. It kind of felt like a marvel movie plot, flashy but short on substance. Still, all the pieces are there for motivating you to advance the plot with a feeling of tension and urgency. As a framing device for all the companion characters extremely well done quest lines, it does the job.

I do hope BG3 gets some old school meaty expansions. It deserves it, and Larian is the studio that can do it. As huge as this game is, the world of DnD is much vaster. Even with all its content, BG3 only scratches the surface.",1708389713,1708389876,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

This game has a bug that it even caused me to lose my saves in honor mode, which traumatized me. I'll explain how this happens next. Please note that this may reveal part of the plot in act 2. After you obtain all the gems, you can let the character ride on something similar to a flying saucer to go to another road. Another thing is that the latest version of Patch 6 did not have this problem before. In addition, I collected four gems, but when I finally try to open the door, I found that I only had three. After confirming it in different places and arrived at the camp and checked, I still couldn't find my gem. I suspected that it was because my character died somewhere after clearing the invisible floor tile test and disappeared. After that, I still couldn't find it when I arrived at that location. Closer to home, you might it said that you can use the witch in the camp to resurrect my character, but he entered a stable state after drowning, making it impossible for me to resurrect him in this way. Since he was in the middle of a stone wall that the character could not reach, I Nothing can be done. I'm angry about this because the Patch 6 update was not my wish, I was forced to update. I was a little worried that my game would be unstable after the update, but it still happened in the end. I will try to post a link to the game video below where my character died, so that interested parties can watch it themselves. , and provide some proof for my remarks.

By the way, what really makes me angry and disappointed is that the above problems can be perfectly avoided by just some simple 3D mold testing tests, but these situations turn out to be catastrophic in a mode that cannot be saved. occur! In the end I didn't use any mods, so it's not anyone else's fault but a test that the game company ignored. Lastly, I hope the game development community can see my comments and make fixes.

And what's ESPECIALLY annoying about this, is that DOS:2 already fixed this issue with a simple setting, so why have they gone backwards for this game.

Actually and sadly a lot... and I am still confused and astonished how gravely my opinion went downhill.
30 hours in, having almost finished the first act, I stopped playing the game out of boredom and even annoyance over some aspects. Here are some:

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
Its ok... When you play a D&D-game you expect some level of randomness due the game system being solely based on die roles, but this is ridiculous. I had one encounter where enemies appeared unexpectedly. Before I was even able to perform my first move, three party members were dead, one had 2 hit points bleeding and burning in the middle of an AOE spell. Reload... The same fight: not taken a single relevant hit. And this continues on and on. Each fight is basically the constant decision process when to reload or keep gambling.

[h3]The presentation[/h3]
The graphics are ok. Spell effects, animations and sound design are quite good. I get it why the main Character is not talking. This would have caused the need for multiple recorded versions of the main character for multiplayer, but man... what a hell of an immersion killer this is! Having the own character just staring emotionless into nothingness during important ""conversations"" is not thrilling at all.

[h3]The Story[/h3]
I am not in the position to rate this after having only finished the first act. Until now it’s a pretty standard okayish fantasy plot. It is not enough to keep me playing considering all the other downsides.

[h3]The environment[/h3]
Unplausible. Obviously driven by the design goal to have a lot of ""hidden"" areas. Looks nice but is composed out of a lot of empty space with far too much empty containers. (Containers with worthless 1-goldpiece-crap are technically empty)

[h3]The option to solve the quests in many ways[/h3]
In the main enemy camp of act 1 I found a hidden passage that retrospectively was a major shortcut to the end of the act 1 main quest. This results in the only option to basically wipe the whole area without further story interaction afterwards. I love games that trick you into bad decisions with catastrophic outcome, but this felt like accidentally picking the wrong story-breaking meta choice without even knowing the options. Killing everything is not exactly my understanding of multiple interesting story paths.

[h3]The party members[/h3]
This is my overwhelming pain point. You assemble a group of the most annoying and unrelatable characters I have ever encountered in such game. Instead of being interested in their (over-the-top-ridiculous) backstories I was hoping for them to just stop talking. This is even made worse by an absurdly exaggerated voice over-acting. I do not even dare to compare this to beloved characters in - let’s say - the Mass Effect series or alike. After 30 hours I did not connect with a single one of them. I give Karlach the credit for being the least annoying though. At least she is funny, but this is only based on her being one of many fantasy clichés: the stupid, blunt barbarian.
And then the romancing... I mean this is kind of childish in all RPGs, right? But this part of BG3 is downright silly. Throughout the whole first act there is no hint of romantic interest by any of the other party members and then the celebration at the end of act 1 suddenly turns into an NPC-all-you-can-plow-buffet. The interaction options could have been a drop-down menu: Who do you want to hop in bed with?

I did enjoy the level of player choice available and a few of the characters you meet are memorable, but most are boring. Many characters and writing in this game is very ""modern"" and does not fit the dark and gritty setting I prefer within the fantasy genre. ie (Witcher, GOT, LOTR). Characters are all young, pretty, and dress in bright neon colors or armor that looks like its made of pure silver/spun gold, rather than iron plate.
The side quests are good and worth doing with a few stand outs. But they do not come close to the side quests offered in Witcher 3 or Fallout 3 and New Vegas. 

The main questline is good but really loses steam in act 3. Due to the length of the game and how strong the first and second acts are I think people either haven't played the third act or gloss over its short comings.

[h3]Baldur's Gate 3 is great. Simple as that.[/h3]
Second playthrough, playing completely differently and with mods this time. The game is unique and beautiful every time you play it.

This game is easily within my top 10 games I have ever played, and I suspect it will stay there during my entire lifetime.

Baldur's Gate 3 is [b]NOT[/b] a tabletop role playing game [TTRPG]. I, [i]stupidly[/i], thought that this game would allow me to pretty much do anything and everything that I wanted, like a TTRPG. It doesn't let you do that. The game has limits, and honestly that is a good thing [i]at times[/i]. There were plenty of times that I just wasn't allowed to do something that I thought I was able to do.

In six and a half months, tons of hotfixes and patches, many of the former had to be pushed out to solve problems introduced by the latter. One hotfix wouldn't even launch on the Steamdeck - one of three platforms available at the time - so Larian does zero software testing.

The characters are two-dimensional stereotypes, and Astarion, far from being the LGBTQ hero he's made out in the press - is a bad trope from 1970s that younger queer folk have been using to point out how self-loathing previous generations of gay people are.

This game is crap fest of bad story-telling, bad design, bad corporate management, and horrible writing. But hey, there are dicks in it, and sex, so GOTY!

This is why I never take game awards seriously. Beautiful art? Sure. But I can go to a museum for that. This was sold as a piece of software. As such, it's a miserable failure and anyone who falls for the hype deserves what they get. 

I'm fully expecting next year's GOTY to be an empty box with a card that reads, ""Ha ha, suckers!"" inside.

Save your money. Hasbro and Larian aren't worth the hassle or the expenditure, and I've seen better D&D campaigns written by pre-teen lemurs with cognitive problems.

BG3 is a shitty game, and I put in hundreds of hours wanting to like it, hoping it would be better. It's not. It's just popular. If popularity and jumping on the bandwagon is why you game, then [i]greiff zu![/i] If, however, you actually like playing video games more than kissing the ass of developers who will never give one shit about your opinions - good or bad, then this is the game for you.

Incredibly good writing, engaging dialogue, fun interesting characters, phenomenal voice acting, epic soundtrack, and gameplay that gives you tons of freedom in your choices.

If I could point out any cons this game might have is the fact that the balance at the time of writing this is a bit off. Some classes are unfortunately VERY weak (yes I'm talking about arcane trickster come on larian please fix mage hand also this entire class is just super weak in general) and the game tends to get very easy by the end, but I heard this is a problem with the 5e system in general.
Also multiplayer still has some bugs, and I have little nitpicks here and there with how they handled multiplayer.

But honestly even with those little nitpicks game gets constant patches and updates, so I'm sure everything will get ironed out in time (also mod tools soon maybe?..pls?)

This game is just impossible and by far the most overwhelmingly complicated game I've ever played.
It's just too much. I really want to like this, but I just don't.
The combat is luck based, whereas I have always preferred skill based. ""Almost"" Every encounter I had with enemies, I had a complete team wipe, because all my characters miss all the time and when they do hit, they only do 2 - 4 damage, whereas every enemy is hitting me for 10 - 11 damage each time.
I find it just unfairly difficulty and it just isn't a fun time.
When you level up, you get the choice of around 15 or so different things to pick from, each of which isn't easy to understand what you're picking or useful in combat at all, since I can never seem to use them anyway.
Inventory system is extremely complicated as every items seems to be very cryptic in what it does. Some make more sense than others.

Baldur's Gate 3 is a very, very complicated game to play. The learning curve is steep and uninteresting because of dozens and dozens of, and let's be honest about CRPGs here, useless systems and sub systems which could have been hidden to the player like in most others modern rpgs, without harming game and metagame richness.
Everything in the game is unnecessarily complicated so if you don't want to waste hours learning how works spells attributes, sub attributes, sub-sub attributes, characters attributes, sub attributes, sub-sub attributes, dice systems, sub systems, etc... maybe think twice before buying it.

[h1]Moving in the game with K&M is a chore.[/h1]

The worst thing about the game though, is how poorly the mouse & keyboard combo is managed. Thanks to outdated point&click movements which are unsuitable for moving through very complex environments like the ones in BG3. The game is slow, clunky and adds to player fatigue generated by already overcomplicated mechanics and the general slowness of the game. 

Players with controler are more lucky and will be able to move their character more naturally, almost like a modern third person RPG. But even them will eventually get bored by several radial menus in which they're forced to navigate through, only to make one action. That's the reason why I can't play with a controler either.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I don't want to waste more of my time on BG3, because personally, the issues aformentionned are a deal breaker. So I'll wrap it up by saying that video games should not exhaust players with unnecessarily complicated systems management or outdated point&click controls and for these reasons, I don't recommend Baldur's Gate 3 for players who don't like CRPGs, even if they're fans of modern RPGs, like I am.",1602434421,1708359155,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the best rpg game. Act 1 and Act 2 are amazing and fabulous, but let's put it in order.  

The first and second acts are written logically, there are a lot of dialogues, conversations, companions communicate all the time and there is no sense of plot drawdown, as it is in the third act. 

I really like this game for its romances, it's amazing that there is such a game in the world in principle! Thanks for that, it was missing! But one romantic scene in each act is not enough for me. The game is big, I have to wait some romantic scenes for a very long time and they are very short. I would like more romantic dialogues. After all, 1% of romance in the game is very little. 

New kisses appeared, but I also want hugs and animations of lying next to a romantic partner while sleeping in the camp. 

Next, I'll be more specific and that includes [u]spoilers[/u]:
All the companies, and there are more than 4 of them, I romanced Astarion and was mostly on the good side, only once making assholes: he ascended, and I captured the Absolute. To be honest, there is much less content on the good side. While the ascended Astarion has an additional great dialogue after Casador, where he praises me, three kinds of kisses, four very beautiful answers to the question ""who are we to you?"" then the non-ascended Astaron has only one vague answer to this question, one new kiss and one old one. that's all. 
If I'm on the good side, then I want more romance, especially from the spawn Astarion. I want to listen to sincere declarations of love, perhaps a special additional dialogue about it. I mean, we all know that the ascended Astarion calls us [spoiler]""consort""[/spoiler], so why not make a really romantic transformation of spawn Astarion then in revenge for the ascended? 
Also, when I was dark urge and defeated it in special scene in [spoiler]Bhaal Temple[/spoiler], I was dissapointed by spawn Astarion answer to me. It was so strage short response after what we've been through together.. Especially in romance. I expected more, frankly speaking.

Act 3 feels very raw and boring if you take out all the side quests and climb into every basement. The companions in the third act seem more detached and do not comment much, especially among themselves, as in the first act. The plot slack is felt. Companions stop commenting on such trivial things as [spoiler]the bombing of the Steel Watch Foundry[/spoiler] or the defeating [spoiler]Orin[/spoiler]. There are less camp scenes than in act1 and it's boring. Because in act3 we obviously need sleep more than in act1. 
 

But in general, the game is the best and deserves all its awards! Thank you for being there! I hope one of the creators will read this and listen to my humble requests. 

With love, Kitty ^_^",1708348602,1708348602,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Why? Lets do some philosophy. By buying this game you will support the devs, and the devs care about creating high quality products. Also, Larian does NOT (and likely NEVER will) incorporate loot boxes or other such anti-consumer nonsense into their games. Therefore, by buying this game you will contribute in helping the industry recover what it once was: a bunch of nerds creating games they were passionate about. 

Your purchase will be a small, but not insignificant, step toward wresting control of the industry from the greedy technocrats that currently control it. Such people do not even know how to set-up their smartphones yet they are the ones making all the decisions. You only need to review the backlash this game received from the big studios following release as proof of how it made them squirm.

Larian set a new bar. Right now they are the only studio across the entire planet that can make a compelling RPG, but all good businesses have their copycats. I say let them. The more studios like Larian the better. However, this game needs to make as much money as possible, the greedy technocrats need to see proof that there is significant enough demand for excellent games, therefore you must buy it. 

If my philosophy holds true then one day a developer that makes games more to your liking, if for some reason you don't like BG3, will do so to an incredibly high standard. First it is up to you to demonstrate that you are happy to spend your hard-earned cash so long as the product is good and doesn't waste your time.

Support excellent studios and buy this game. No more CS weapon skin marketplaces, no more loot boxes that are designed to prey on addictive personalities and no more fucking horse armour!",1708334985,1708335194,True,1,1,0.509202480316162109,0,True,False,False

You will be playing BG3-inspired games for a decade after this (see: TW3 inspiring ""question mark open worlds"" all over the place).

Snappy, deep combat system that gets more rewarding the more you learn about it. Great story with very high stakes that hits all the beats you want. Grand adventure through a large variety of locales that never wear out their welcome. Every party member is compelling and complex in their motivations. Excellent soundtrack. Your choices matter, and can drastically alter your experience. Difficulty levels reward game knowledge in a very satisfying way. Very high production value among others in its genre. Immense replayability.

[2/18/2024] Edit upon game completion on playstation 5, not steam (yet)


I would have never expected such a masterclass of a game to emerge into my sights when I first laid eyes on it a year ago, I never knew about the game even in its beta and alpha stages, but when the full release came out and a friend asked me to buy this game to play it with him I had my doubts like any human being would with purchasing a $60 game, but after hearing this is one of the truest and accessible adaptations of the Dungeons and Dragons format of play, in a no hassle online game with proper world immersion I bit the bullet to decide to try the game with my friend.

Good god did this game catch me off guard with its splendor instantly.

Games that advertise a roleplaying factor to some degree like diablo, divinity original sin, and skyrim all have cemented a status worth praising. But I never felt a strong enough connection to my character in these games since all story points and cutscenes were so out of my control, my character felt plainly to put it, just a controllable character. Most scenes would be left up to your imagination as it is told and described through a text box, which makes sense in a proper DND setting since the DM would be doing this in real-time to you, but I never felt apart of these worlds since I felt held back with a leash on how much I can explore or interact with the environment. This game finally broke that line between static cut scenes and linear gameplay. I could not be more blown away by the beauty of the game that I was apart of with my carefully custom created character, FINALLY a game acknowledges the absence of true cutscene interaction and proper engagement within its own game. Gone are the days where if you played with friends they were soloed out of all cutscenes or you are not apart of any at all to begin with. Everyone is apart of the action and everyone should be included within the story that you all want to tell, I HATE IT when games just exclude people for the sake of their stupid a## pre-rendered cutscenes, this game only uses one pre-rendered cutscene but its before anything is established for your character so it makes sense to use one there, instead of in the middle of the game where all of a sudden you are just deleted from existence, unable to act because the game needs to force this character introduction down your throat its so awful. 

Combat in this game is immensely satisfying and made beautifully, the amount of customization and options you have to work with on any character is astounding. I think the dice roll system is perfectly fine as is, it may have its moments where it could be annoying but I think this adds its own layer of suspense and risk to any combat encounter, A strong foundation of proper positioning and tactics make this fun to play alone or with friends. Winning an encounter because of wits alone is an unmatched feeling, instead of brute forcing the victory like most games task you to do, brute forcing a win, is not fun! That is not good game design that's just an object with a health bar, its not innovative, and its not engaging. 
The leveling of this game is great, always keeps with the pace of the game and rarely will there be times where you will have to forcibly get out of your way to get another level for a boss fight unless you are genuinely biting off more than you can chew.

Character customization by far one of my favorite aspects of this game, I have made numerous characters just for the sake of it. Also with all of the diverse races and vairants you can choose from really hooked me into the lore of all that is DND, like where did the drows originate from? What are tieflings? And why are dwarves so... tiny..? I think in any playthrough, everyone should really take the time to make a character that they would want to be proud of, I just advise against making ""yourself"" in a videogame, thats not original, think of something fresh! For your first playthrough any choices you make should be what you want to do, but any after that I highly recommend actually rping as your character, and doing what they would do, it really adds a layer of depth into the game you should try it!

My only complaint with this game is that some classes feel a bit underpowered at levels 1 - 5 and it really shows with the amount of options you are given for that class. Ranger I almost never choose starting since from a roleplaying standpoint, and a combat standpoint fighter or even bard is just a way better option for any ""ranged"" combat until you reach like level 6, but even then having to wait until you are a certain level to enjoy a class sucks a little bit, it all evens out though.

Well I could go into more detail but I am running out of text to type, overall, 11/10 game, New favorite game ever of all time, and anyone with a console or a pc should buy this game and enjoy it from beginning to end, by yourself, with a friend, or an entire adventuring party, the choice really is yours..!",1699823189,1708323381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't mind if it was just a few that had this problem, but it seems that many people including me have been running into game crashes on load or quicksaves, or even launch.

Having a blast! I'm playing alone and in a multiplayer scenario - enjoying multi the most but both are fun. The D&D logistics are teaching me new things about tabletop playing. The many storylines and character arcs are awesome - evidenced by how many people have Youtubed various character scenes and sequences. As someone who doesn't do a ton of PC gaming (more Switch, tablet stuff) I will say that the camera and character movements gave me a lot of frustration early on but I quickly built the muscle memory to the point where I no longer have any issues. And I absolutely love how much control I have over visual angles during game play so it's worth the work to learn. I recently (and with some hesitation) tried streaming the game from my gaming desktop to my more portable laptop and I actually feel like laptop play (keyboard plus trackpad) is a bit easier for me than desktop play (keyboard plus mouse)... but the smaller screen is definitely a hinderance. This is one to play on the big screen, folks.

PSA: As a mom gamer, gonna say that I'm super cautious about playing this anytime or anywhere that my kids (6&9) might walk in. Lots of blood, scary stuff, and of course sexy escapades so....

The game has major bugs and issues. It's 2024, 3 years after this game's early access, 4 months after it came out. I bought this gem a week ago and already ran into multiple issues:
- Game thinking it's the first startup, losing all settings made, for no apparent reason. Happened multiple times already, many players seem to have the same issue according to discussion boards.
- Losing all progress. Can be solved after searching through the internet and copying saved games. Yet many people don't have the technical knowledge to fix losing their progress themselves. Apparently I was even lucky, as many people reported being unable to restore their progress... 100+ hours of save games lost, forever, according to online discussion boards. Such a major bug should not exist in a AAA-Game three years after early access. According to some sources this problem is known even since older games Larian created. Not good.
- Broken questlines [spoiler]Can't talk to Mol after the Investigate the Beach quest as I already had contact with her previously[/spoiler].
- Updates need free space the size of the whole game, which now amounts to 150GB. From a developer perspective I don't even want to ask why, but it seems they took the title BG to their heart. An game eating up lots of space for no valid reason, but make it twice as much for a tiny update.
- Broken story continuity. A whole game made with player choice in mind doens't adhere to it in storytelling. There are lots of characters talking about things that don't reflect the current in-game reality any more - not tiny things one could overlook, but major things like talking about an influental person in game being a threat... although they're already dead and they know it.

As a software developer myself I can't think of any reason why Larian did not put any effort in these fundamentals. Fixing major issues is not only basic respect paid towards players who bought that game - it is a measurement of the quality a company is able to deliver. Larian, you can do better. It's a ""Game of the Year"" where players lose hundreds of hours they put into the game, and no fix in sight. Any other software being sold for 60 Euros with such issues would have the worst reviews. But games aren't software, they are considered art. Your art is great. Please let the coding effort and mechanics live up to your art.

Minor issues I have:
- Certain controls and the user interface could be better. Level-up options should not be pre-selected to prevent mistakes made by newer players. Movement and aiming sometimes behave erratically, being able to hit enemies although the game deems it impossible, and other times pathfinding leads one to a really bad position. It's already on a high level, so this is complaining about the finer details and not a major issue.
- They probably wanted to create a dating sim, according to the comments from other characters if you don't want to bed anyone of the main narcissist characters. Was it an all-male crew? ""Hey, it's your story, but if you don't want to see the neat graphics of 2 characters gettin' it on, we try to mildly harass you with commentary."" - get that into your head: Just because somebody gets into a life or death situation with other adventurers doesn't mean they'll develop any romantic feelings for them.
- Maybe a few other things I am unaware of or have already forgotten. I can't guess and haven't checked if connection losses in multiplayer sessions or bluescreens are due to a problem on my end, or due to software issues which may be related to certain hardware used, or are a general issue. That is out of my knowledge, and I won't dig deeper here.

Verdict: Great game, but also BG. I'll continue to play it. A game worth buying, but with some major issues which simply don't allow providing a good review.",1704230706,1708302516,False,3,1,0.47792208194732666,0,True,False,False

I've heard so many things about this game. Reviews , awards , social media posts , etc. 
So since I am a RPG guy I had to check what the fuss was about. And damn right they were.
I never had friends who played DnD, and after the movie I had an itch for it.
I am half way thru (i think) the campaign and this brilliant game  scratched the itch I had to play DnD.
IF you like RPGs , this is a game for you. IF you like DnD this is a game for you. You can play solo and experience a unique story and that is the big plus of this game... I return home after work wanting more. To see more, to adventure more, to crawl one more dungeon. Also lets not talk about the replay-ability... 
The only two negative things I've experienced so far are that there are times that this game feels unfair (but usually it rewards you), and that if you are new to this universe there is A LOT reading to do... When choosing a character to play with, I just picked one of the main protagonists because when trying to create one it just got confusing.

Is it worth getting, especially if you've never played a DnD simulator before? Yes and no. 

Yes, if you love role-playing mechanics and freeform problem-solving. The extraordinary amount of flexibility is staggering, and that means the risk of losing hundreds of hours of your life as you try different ways to tackle the same situation.

No, if you prefer a more organic, immersive experience. This game is overtly scripted (and sometimes manipulative) to get you to the next plot point. It's about accomplishing the next task, not to just wander and enjoy the atmosphere.

PROS:
- Some of the best vocal talent in recent memory
- Characters are charming and complex
- Extraordinary flexibility in regards to customization, combat and problem-solving - excellent replay value
- Diverse library of spells, creatures, equipment
- Wide variety of themes, locations, characters, moods
- Karlach is an absolute cutie-pie.

CONS:
- Even with a decent computer/laptop, you must customize to avoid frame-rate / glitch issues
- Camera controls are frustrating and clunky
- Inventory management can be overwhelming (and uses up half your time)
- Interface is complex and can work against you if you're not careful
- Cutscenes are choppy and buggy

PERSONAL OPINIONS:
- The music is overall uninspiring and repetitive
- This game is obsessed with tieflings, halflings, devils, and cats for reasons unknown
- The story can be pretty silly, convoluted, and with a big dollop of manufactured melodrama
- Art design is not unique. Looks a lot like other games in the genre
- Relationship mechanic was distracting and artificial. Honestly - is everyone bisexual?

Pros: Extremely immersive world. Great graphics. Excellent voice acting (and *tons* of audio dialog) and facial animations. Interesting story. Valuable story and strategy clues in various readings and dialog. In the first half, there are many ways to develop story and relationships. Ease-of-use features (e.g., magic pockets, send to camp). Easy access to camp whenever needed. Turn-based combat makes constant pausing unnecessary. Tons of quicksave slots. Objects that come between camera and characters fade to transparent.

Cons: No display of character skill totals, so that you don't know which character has the best stealth skill, etc. Game can't be paused (turn-based mode pauses only the world inside the battle). Camera can't look up. Camera controls are clumsy at best, with only 2D commands in a 3D world. Can't select characters by clicking on them. No combat AI for PC/NPCs, so battles require micromanagement. Combat animations take too long. Horrible pathing often requires micromanaging party movement (e.g., characters will walk through lava rather than around it; characters will walk into traps you've already discovered and warned them about). The highlight objects function only highlights *some* interactables (e.g., containers and most things you can pick up are *not* highlighted). Object interaction can be a hassle (e.g., reading a book before picking it up takes two distinct action cycles, each requiring you to select the object and choose an action). Can't click on a spot on the map in order to have your party walk to it. Initiative is badly broken: Attack a sleeping monster and it may still get initiative. Sneak up and attack a monster, and it may still get initiative. Startle unarmed naked monsters having sex, and they may get dressed, arm themselves, and attack before you can do anything. The story is also inconsistent at various points: The *wrong* character can successfully complete actions *required* of another character, and that other character gets the credit. Completed quests are not reflected in later dialog. NPC banter doesn't evolve, even when it contradicts the story. Oh, and make sure you're somewhere safe when you save, because bad things can happen to the party while the game is loading. Finally, the story falls apart eventually, with no enjoyable path forward.

Stuff I don't like but you might: No alignment system. No traditional multiclassing (as per BG1 & BG2). All classes have rogue skills (everyone can pick locks, disable traps, etc.). All joinable characters will invite you to pursue a romantic relationship, regardless of sex or species. Some dialog options require INT, WIS or CHA saving throws specifically on the PC (e.g., NPCs can't initiate dialog in the PC's dreams), so some classes will always have fewer interesting conversations. Some people probably like the story. I've personally never cared for the parts of D&D that have nothing to do with medieval lore. 

Final thought: Yes, it's buggy. But it's new, so we can forgive that. Micromanagement, tactics-driven battles, and poor controls are annoying but not game-breaking most of the time. The story starts of well but becomes horrible, in my opinion. I have not finished the game because of this.",1693119089,1708296202,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are so many instances where you wonder how did the developers have the time or the thought process to include this little tidbit in the game.  It deserves all of it's praise as a whole and probably deserve the overall 10/10 rating that it often got. 

With that said, it doesn't mean it is truly perfect or for everyone.  Obviously if you are for fast pace action type games, this is not for you.  But even among its genre, the studio's own predecessor (DOS2), I think DOS2 has the better gameplay, ie. the fights.  It's overall rule set, and depth and breadth of it's combat is superior and that is because it was created by Larian and not beholden to Dungeon and Dragon's rule set.  Also, they have different pacing; BG3 starts with a bang and slowly whimpers towards the end; though there are key moments throughout each act.  DOS2 starts slowly and crests as the acts go on.  Where I think BG3 still gets the overall nod is the presentation is phenomenal, the voice acting is probably the best ever... in any genre.  The freedom to do what you want, and Larian having thought of it and allows you to do it, is probably the best ever, again in any genre.  And then lastly, the characters in BG3 are far better than DOS2.  Every last one of the origin characters are great.

From EA to the live version (being lovingly and obsessively updated and crammed with as many hours of game play possible) Larian has done it.  Not only making a wonderful game but doing so at a one time cost without fleecing their fans.  Not an anomaly with Larian Studios either.

A full spectrum of gaming style is met on BG3. From number crunching to overcome the most difficult possible custom settings or Honor Mode to casually strolling through enjoying the story on easy mode. With regard for difficulty there is a thousand hours minimum over multiple games played through different story elements and outcomes for both the lifelong hardened DnD veterans and also the clueless first timers.  Larian brilliantly embroidered modern gaming and DnD concepts into the old, vibrant, soulful land of Faerun to create this masterpiece.  Much like BG1 and BG2 before it, BG3 exists as a partition of life.  A universe so rich and full of countless opportunities.  Whimsical enough to follow your every fancy.  As safe or dangerous as you'd like.  Create anything you want, tell any story you wish.  Log in to this game and forget about the ebb and flow of normal life.  Only near perfect MoCap, soundtracks, and voice acting can make something so beautiful.

Larian has set an unrealistic bar for the game development community.  The only problem you may have with this game is constantly having to update it because at no additional  $$ cost to YOU.  Larian Studios respects their following and the gaming community in general.  Regardless of how you may feel about these kind of Dragon/Magic/Fantasy video games;  Know that as a gamer, and a consumer, THIS is the kind of content you deserve from your studio overlords.  No fleecing.  No shop.  No subscription.  Just a great game.  Love, dedication, and respect for the craft.

Characters are beautiful, interesting, funny and everyone is immaculately voice acted (even side characters). 
The fights are engaging, difficult and unique.

Only thing is I wish there was a tad more character customisation in the sense of more face options or body proportions sliders or something like that, as well as maybe some more diversity in the voice options because some of them feel quite similar - BUT that being said the textures are nice and the diversity in skin colours, tattoos, gender, (and even genitalia) are great to see in a game and I appreciate seeing those kinds of options for sure.

My story:

Tiamat Knowledge Cleric (2)/Dragon Sorc.

I read and heard a lot about how an evil campaign kind of sucked, but for my playthrough it was fine due to being politically savvy rather than murder hobo/pick bad option because it says it's bad.

*The entire story is basically a Tiamat campaign, even though there doesn't seem to be any Tiamat NPCs to interact with. I would have liked more and mostly used outside knowledge to guide me, which explains why people think there's not many Tiamat choices. You can get an extremely good ending for Tiamat though.

Why isn't it the best game?
* With the Upper City political section cut from the game, it felt like a lot of interactions lead nowhere, rather than leading to some sort of big coming together and outing Gortash in Act 4 (which obviously can't happen). Probably some sort of court case or coming together of the council (it's obvious to see how they changed this, for the worse).

I expected any sort of Tiamat NPC in the Upper City.

Aylin and some other camp NPCs and world NPCs just start to feel broken and repetitive in Act 3, it felt as if their stories had been cut, and must have had something to do with Act 4 being changed.

In all the removal of that section felt like there was a massive hole in the story, and that a lot of actions and choices didn't matter. E.g. I was being manipulative and helping people with the intent to betray them eventually, but the opportunity to do so was removed- I did get to do this for some characters though. Sorry Lae'Zel. :')

As that was the entire point of my character, a more political section of the game being removed directly lowered the quality of the story.

Act 3 problems:
There's some really fleshed out sections when you first arrive, but some really unfleshed out sections. The circus felt like it could have had more to it. 

The inside of the big factory felt shallow and bugged out for me really badly.

The changes they made to force boss fights in act 3 really made those fights weak, and one of the fights I expected to be really good was one of the worst in the game.

It almost feels like you stumble into the end of the game by accident? At the time I didn't know the Upper City had been cut, and everything felt like it was leading there for Act 4, so I expected a Thorm style escape section, but it was actually just the end of the game, and I missed out on finishing some quests because of it. After that I read about it being cut and the Chosen of Bane/stumbling into the end of the game made sense.

I really hope they add Act 4 back.

A lot of bugged quests or forced ways of interacting with the quest:
- More ways to knock out Minthara has been addressed, but I had to reload before Act 2 to ensure I did it right. Really time consuming
- The haunted mansion questline was all over the place for me, and I felt like an NPC was hostile for seemingly no reason (I explored the sewers and other places with minions before heading to the main part)

Other problems:
- Item management - I used the bag of bags mod, which made character item management better, but you still have to manually do it for the camp and it takes way too long
- You're not sure if items will ever be useful so you end up with lots of junk in the camp chest, including ingots and books
- Need an auto read books for new games
- One of the NPCs with an over the top accent connected to the Chosen of Bhaal's voice was so ridiculous it completely killed the moment for me. It's so bad that his voice even breaks while speaking and nothing has been done to edit it.... (I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE CHARACTERS VOICE FROM BEFORE I HAVE ONLY EXPERIENCED BG3)

Of Baldur’s Gate 3, I sing—a digital realm wherein pixels dance and polygons cavort, a veritable phantasmagoria of swords, sorcery, and serendipity. Yon game, wrought by the skilled hands of Larian Studios, doth transport us to the Forgotten Realms, a land where dragons soar, and adventurers tread with hearts both valiant and quivering.

In this hallowed expanse, characters emerge—fully realized, their voices resonant as if whispered by the very gods themselves. Behold, the protagonist, a cipher for our own desires, embarking upon a journey fraught with peril and possibility.

And lo, the choices! Aye, they abound like leaves in autumn, each decision a fork in the road—a crossroads where destiny dallies with caprice. Shall we befriend the enigmatic warlock, or smite him with righteous fury? To romance the bear, or seek solace in the arms of a spectral bard? Such quandaries vex the soul, and yet, they exhilarate!

The combat, too, is a ballet of blades—a symphony of strategy played upon the stage of turn-based skirmishes. Cunning tactics prevail, and the warlock laughs as wooden gates splinter before his arcane might. Fire spells ignite the flammable, and axes sunder doors with a satisfying crunch. Walls, invisible to mortal eyes, yield to nimble climbers, granting passage to secret realms.

“Nay,” quoth the game, “I shall not deny thee.”

And hark! Co-op beckons, a merry band of friends—each with custom characters—joining the fray. Whether online or upon a couch, their seamless presence enchants. One distracts the guard, while another pilfers treasures unseen. Verily, this camaraderie rivals the finest mead-soaked tavern tales.

Now, ye seekers of CRPGs, hearken unto me: Baldur’s Gate 3 is no mere diversion; it is an opus, a magnum opus, nay, a celestial crescendo that reverberates through the annals of gaming history.

And so, ere I conclude, let us raise our goblets to this masterpiece—a chalice brimming with cinematic storytelling, sandbox mayhem, and roleplaying aplenty.

Verily, it is the greatest RPG mine eyes have beheld.

People have said this more eloquently: but this is a top 10 game. If you love RPGs, or D&D you should give this a try. The sheer amount of choice and ways in which to approach problems may seem overwhelming, but it's also incredibly freeing. My first play through I didn't feel the need to ""save-scum"", but the ability to save at any time, including in the middle of a dialogue tree, makes it so that you can play the game anyway you want and craft your perfect story. For people who prefer combat to story, the combination of party members and various spells and abilities will give you so many ways to destroy your enemies. The approach to romancing your party members is quite novel too, although I still feel there needs to be more and better polyam representation, there have been a few interactions that I really appreciate.

I actually think this game is incredibly assembled and the team deserves all the accolades they have earned for this project. The detail and polish are fantastic, and they should be very proud of what they've accomplished. 

I purchased this game in the wake of it winning GOTY and on the recommendation of a friend. I had heard numerous disclaimers that this game was very reliant on Dungeons & Dragons mechanics, and familiarity with these would be quite helpful. I played D&D two times, roughly ten years ago - but I figured it had multiplayer capability so I could be helped. I was wrong. Another caveat is the number of hours I've supposedly put into the game is misleading - as several times I was either pulled away with work and parenting duties, or just raged out and never closed the game.

This game does a wonderful job of giving you options. You can play any way you want, as anybody you want, and the game and story organically evolve around these choices. The amount of work that has gone into divergent branching narrative is mind-boggling, and frankly beyond praiseworthy. But the freedom to do anything you want, comes with a cost; especially if you're not familiar with or into D&D. 

During my first attempt, I played a rogue. I got lost several times, in areas I thought were hostile, and ended up making several assumptions that basically ruined the run. Chalk that one up to learning. My second attempt, I played a warlock. This time, I played co-op, figuring my buddy would be able to teach me better. But I found him able to attack multiple times per turn, and I was only ever able to do one thing, often with a 20-30% chance of hitting and even then, frequently low damage rolls. I felt so weak, I tried a third run as a Cleric. I figured trying to heal people instead of dealing damage, would mean I would be targeted less and not care as much about low damage output. Again, not successful, so I tried Paladin - thinking hey, I can be tankier and still heal? Wrong again. So I tried a Monk. Won't even tell you how bad that went. Finally landed on Fighter, and his was the most successful run I had. I had good damage output, good survivability, multiple action uses, and fit the team I wanted best. I made it through Act II, but I still feel like the mechanics of this system elude me. 

I had long understood weapon/armor proficiency and stats help drastically, but I have never once found the ratio of damage output to the amount of enemies in encounters to be well-balanced. I'm either constantly struggling through one encounter, losing half my team in the process, or just wrecking bosses moments later. If you use a bunch of abilities, you have to rest to regain them, and most of the worthwhile ones require going to camp and spending supplies to replenish. If you want to press on into multiple encounters, there's a good chance things will get very difficult very fast. In game that sells the sheer urgency of it's story, and limited number of canonical days, it sure struggles to balance how much you can ostensibly accomplish in a day before needing to rest and recover, with how much you ""should be doing for the story."" Essentially my biggest issue is that I am not familiar with the mechanics or very good at understanding them.

The game also struggles with letting you know which encounters are appropriate for your level, which both supports and kills the concept of free-roam. In my fighter run, I found the dragon rider patrol in Act I, and the angry lizard woman ran to talk to them. Trying to follow, I started a fight I was in NO WAY equipped to win, and after several save-scums, I decided I'd send her to talk, grab another party member from camp, and come back with better numbers. Whoops, lizard lady got killed while I was doing that, and couldn't be revived with a scroll. It was at that point, that I realized not only did I not care about most of the characters, but that I also wasn't having fun. Choices you make will all impact the game, in ways you cannot predict. Most of the time, they align with traditional story-telling and can be predicted, but in a few cases they seemed completely contrarian or in other cases created a ""cock-up-cascade,"" chaining negative effects down the road. I wasn't seeing the point of crafting my own narrative when I could save-scum my way to any outcome I wanted, but couldn't see where that narrative would take me. It's like folding the ears of pages in a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book. This is made even worse by the colossal load-times for booting or re-loading.

I never really connected with most of the team I assembled. I tried to be thorough and complete - assembling as many as I could, exhausting dialogue, being friendly to get the most out of them, but they all felt distant to me. They all kept hitting on me, which is another problem - this game must think I am hornier than I really am - but I didn't feel much kinship with the vast majority. They all feel like they're trying to be tragic heroes, but that trope gets old after five or six people. I am not a writer, nor do I profess to be a reputable critic, but the story seemed absolutely loony. There are parts that take themselves very seriously, and parts that are either references to other fantasy games or that don't take themselves seriously at all. The juxtaposition of these pulls me out of the story, almost as much as the frequency of sleeping despite impending global destruction. In short, I think this game struggles with tone. 

This all sort of culminates into the notion of side-quests. You collect a TON of side-quests, which is great for world-building, but not great for other reasons; predominantly not often having a clear direction of how to progress them, or whether those are distractions or actually impact the story. I will say, the game gives you hints for some by way of some text, and generally tells you if proceeding past a certain point might prevent you from finishing some quests. I just frequently felt like there was more fluff to pad out the game in the name of world-building.

In the end, there is a lot to praise in this game, but I cannot recommend it. If you're on the fence about picking it up, think very carefully about your connection with D&D. If it's something you like or love, or something you really want to try, by all means - the glowing recommendations across the community are testament to the likelihood of you enjoying this game. If not, I'd save yourself the money and put it towards something else - or at LEAST wait for a serious sale down the road.",1708277506,1708277506,False,2,0,0.438950985670089722,0,True,False,False

[u][b]What I loved:[/b][/u]
[list]
[*] Good character development on most of the companions and your avatar
[*] A lot of good utilities and spells to use in or outside of combat
[*] The ability to manipulate/take use of the area you fight at to your own advantage
[*] Boss fights are decent enough
[*] The Mind Flayer is such a fascinating creature!
[*] Excellent music score, sound effects and ambiance
[*] Actions with consequences
[*] A wide array of class/race to mix and choose from
[*] Nice to be able to dye most of the equipment
[*] Beautiful locations ranging from lush forest, deep caves, catacombs and swamps to dark and eerie areas. Large buildings/city with different cultures to explore and small nooks and crannies with secrets to tell for the brave
[*] A few puzzles that adds a little flavor 
[*] A lot of cool familiars that you can bring with you on your adventures or just summon when you want them for a fight
[*] Plenty of side quests with memorable characters and some with excellent fights.
[*] A camp where you can interact with your companions/familiars and chill between fights. Felt like home to me:)
[/list]
[u][b]What I think could be improved:[/b][/u]
[list]
[*] Inventory management is a chore. You can't rename bags which is something that you should be able to do. I would have thought they'd learn from past mistakes like with Divinity: Original Sin 2
[*] Act 3 felt a bit rushed and sluggish. I know Larian has been patching and getting this act better, but I have not visited Act 3 since last play through, so I will be doing a honored mode to see the major changes
[*] I would have liked to see a bit more lore in different books. Most of them were paper thin and while that works for some of them, others could have expanded more on the history of the areas you visited to make them come even more to life
[*] While there were plenty of secret items to find, I would have liked to see more unique feeling items
[*] More puzzles like they did in Divinity: Original Sin 2
[*] Character drag/chain system did not feel as responsive as in Divinity: Original Sin 2. I do believe Larian has fixed this now though
[/list]

Score: 10/10. The score reflects when I finished the game with patch 1 installed. While the game had it's flaws, those were not enough to bring the score down. This is by far one of the best video games I have ever played, so a big thank you to Larian Studios is in order:)",1708276803,1708277205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gobbles up your time. Modding recommended at least after first play-through to speed up certain aspects of the game, like dice rolling speed, perhaps lock-picking speed, movement and combat speed. This is the biggest one for me when it comes to subsequent play-throughs.
Some (many) plot holes with the story if you care. Someone can wish you to death but leaves it to her minions... Villains appearing for the sake of appearing rather than for consistent narrative... but this is offset with good dialogue and characters.
Balance doesn't exist. If you are obsessive about character building, this will obsess you for a while. Swords bards seem to be able to do everything better than other classes after level 6 (full caster and ""full"" martial with burst). ""Don't use it"" is a difficult argument when it's a great addition to any multi-class at level 6-8-10, and can make almost any build better.
Some bugs, which are being worked on in patches.

I loved almost everything about it. The story, the choices, the voice acting, the combat options, and all of those are made exceptionally well.

However, combat still had its bugs and glitches from time to time which made me forcibly retry some fights. There were no game or save breaking ones, but still, skipping a characters turn because hitboxes or throwables didn't work correctly is not something you want to see, 

Despite these little hiccups, this is still an almost perfect game.

However, I feel there are some major flaws that have yet to be addressed by Larian, and I am going to lay them all out plainly, as I have finally completed the game. Spoilers ahead.
The main issues the game has, both technically and story-wise, are found near the end. One of the most glaring problems is that of Wyll's quest. Wyll as a character has been the most neglected in terms of content, and his story is lacking. Seeing that the Wyrmway quest is now a side quest rather than a part of his main quest is disheartening, and his story has so much potential that is just missed and seemingly brushed aside. The fact that he was forced into Mizora's pact due largely to the Dragon Queen coupled with the knowledge that a dragon lies dormant under Baldur's Gate, apparently destined for Wyll's family to awaken, are two very interesting pieces of Wyll's lore that could have been explored much more than they were. In the Wyrmway, which was originally the final hurrah of Wyll's quest, Wyll's character development is brushed aside in order to develop the Emperor further. It's unfortunate. It would have been much more satisfying to see Wyll learn about and connect with his ancestors, as well as have his own moment with Ansur, undead and turned evil or not. In general, the Wyrmway just feels very rushed, and does not honor Wyll's story in the way he deserves. Wyll also has less romantic content than other companions, and less content in general, as mentioned. He really needs more love and attention from Larian, even if he is less popular than characters like Astarion or Shadowheart.
Another gripe I have toward the end is with Gortash's fight. It does not feel like a boss fight at all. Ketheric's fight was an incredible way to wrap up Act 2. Bhaal's fight was not as good, but still fun. Gortash's just fell flat. He was this huge antagonist, and it was very disappointing to see him treated more like a minor antagonist than a major one. He is the tyrant of Baldur's Gate. He should be in a throne room surrounded by an army. The traps should actually be tricky to get around, and make the fight more difficult. The ambiance should be better, the music, the buildup to the fight, it's just all very forgettable, and leaves you going, ""eh."" 
After that... oh man, I just have so many problems with the way the game ends. Let me lay it out. Once you reach the Morphic Pool, you've essentially reached the point of no return in that you cannot go back to camp and switch out your characters. You are stuck with your party from then through the final battle. This would be fine if there was any indication that you would not have any more chances to return to camp. However, I think it would just be better if you could reconfigure your party RIGHT before the final battle, like, when all your allies are gathered in the Upper City. Jaheira and Halsin show up to say good luck, but not any of your other companions...? It would make sense if they were all there, and you could switch out companions as you pleased. But I'm getting ahead of myself. 
Before that, you are in the Astral Plane with the Emperor, who reveals that he is going to consume Orpheus' power. On a good run, this is where you are usually like, hold on, I want to save him. But the Emperor is adamant that a) Orpheus will kill you if released and b) only a mindflayer can effectively wield the stones to stop the Netherbrain. Okay... Why? Just because mindflayers have psionic powers? A mindflayer is about as similar to a Netherbrain as a microwave is to a super computer. Orpheus was the one protecting us, not the Emperor. He is the one with the power, not the Emperor. He can protect us from the brain's influence for the entire game, but he cannot wield the stones to take down the brain unless he is a mindflayer? Bullshit. He's the singular most powerful enemy against the brain in terms of lore, it makes no sense. So then you're like, nah, I'm freeing Orpheus, which is the obvious good choice. And the Emperor is just like ok well I'm gonna join the brain then bye. Ahhgdhhsjfsak,dnje. HYDBHJWKNDK. WHYY. WHY. It was revealed that he was the FOUNDER OF BALDUR'S GATE, Baldur himself. Every single thing he's done this entire game--protecting us, protecting our allies, urging us to fight the brain--has been to protect Baldur's Gate. His city. It is made very clear time and time again how he is AGAINST the brain and how important his city is to him. But he just leaves. To join the brain. No hesitation, no nothing. Even if he did believe Orpheus would kill us, why wouldn't he just stick around long enough to see how Orpheus would react? And if Orpheus attacked, he could still mind portal the fuck outta there. It's just so out of character it drives me crazy... He's our ally, we can't even do a persuasion check? So he leaves, we free Orpheus, and Orpheus is like, welllll one of us has to be a mindflayer to defeat the brain. Again, no real reason for this, really just hate that so much. And your options are to turn into a mindflayer, turn Orpheus into a mindflayer, or turn Karlach into a mindflayer. Okay. Say that this annoying line of reasoning is used regardless... Why can't we recruit Omeluum to help us? I went through all the trouble of saving him, I'm sure he'd wield the stones for us. Really, there's no way we can't even ask him for assistance? Reaaallllyy? Why. WHY. Omg. Ok well, in this scenario, the best decision is to turn Orpheus into a mindflayer, even though it still sucks. I freed him hoping he would lead the Githyanki people and destroy Vlaakith, but that's off the table now. Ahhh. So you get to the final battle, it's pretty fun. If the Emperor turned against you, you have to fight him. Even though he can clearly see Orpheus is non hostile and actively helping fight the brain. Again... Ugh. The fight against the brain itself is pretty anti climactic, you are able to take it out in a few hits. I was hoping the final battle would be more like Raphael's battle, with an epic song with lyrics and such, and better ambiance. It isn't the worst, it just isn't up to par with what I was expecting. :( So yeah, those are the big issues I take with the game. I know Larian has been adding a lot of content and fixing stuff, so I hope some of this is addressed in the future! :)
But again, it is truly a fantastic game, and I am so happy to have had the opportunity to play such a work of art. Thank you for all the consistent updates, keep them coming! <3

It's also worth calling out Larian's dedicated support on fixing bugs and adding new features, with extensive patches being released regularly.

The original review is below:

The story is incredibly well done and intricate. Everyone and everything feels like it belongs and there are so many unexpected interactions that make the world feel real and lived-in.

The only thing keeping it from a perfect 10 is that there are a fair few bugs still hanging around in gameplay, but the list grows shorter with each patch.

Their picky-and-choosy adaptation of D&D5 rules is jarring and frustrating. Correspondingly, they don't know how to create balance using this mish-mash of rules. They have no meaningful way for the player to tell their own character's story. These flaws make me regret giving in to the hype and buying the game at their asking price.

There are still MANY things that need to be fixed about the design of Baldur's Gate 3. They have improved a few things, and I'm hoping Act III is finally in a play-worthy state, but I still cannot recommend the game at the full $60 asking price. I STRONGLY encourage Larian to focus on fixing things like basic gameplay, programming, and stability instead of touching up kissing animations.
It seems no designers at Larian bothered to sit down and address the concept of balance in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition terms before designing the game. You will see this in every boss fight, and in multiple other encounters. No thought was given to level-appropriate abilities or strengths - or if they were, they were ignored in favor of ""lawlz, wouldn't it be cool if..."" mechanics and ""gimmes"" that the enemies receive that make combat and other encounters endlessly frustrating. This is not even counting the problems of using a rigged dice bot that in part is used to create difficulty levels.
""Save-scumming"" is not only common, it is impossible to meaningfully progress without it, thanks to the rigged dice-bot in and out of combat, and the frequent imbalances. Larian didn't make a tactical or an interesting game so much as a looooong game - and it appears even they gave up on anything like quality control about 2/3s of the way through.
I regret ignoring my own rule and choosing to purchase the game at full price. Neither of the patches addressed serious issues at the core of the game, and I have next to no hope that Larian will address the serious imbalances and other issues that should have been addressed during the years of early access.

Addendum 1: Quality-of-Life Fixes
--replace the current dice bot with one that is more random (on ""medium"" difficulty)
--add content that allows us to tell our original character's story (through dialogue options, and maybe quests based on our choice of class, background, or added ideals, bonds, and flaws)
--balance intended encounters to the expected character level. It would be acceptable to make the zones a little more linear so we don't have to double-back very often to finish content, like we do now (probably not a workable fix after release)
--AND/OR add random encounters during long stretches where nothing else happens (but not in boss fight zones, obviously). For example, goblin scouting patrols, shadows rising from dead bodies, or rioting citizens
--if an encounter (such as a boss fight) has a specific strategy that is intended, allow our characters to make checks (such as Investigation, Perception) that give big clues as to how the encounter is intended to be beaten
--speed up quickload times
--fix opponent AI so they do not waste turns trying to perform actions they cannot complete
--reduce the effectiveness of instant death by shoving targets off cliffs (either don't make it so common, or give the shoved target another save to see if they can catch a hold, etc. This seems like a perfect use of the Slowfall spell.)
--improve lip-syncing during dialogues and cutscenes
--clarify what exactly the ""target"" is during pickpocketing. Is that the total value we need, is it the die number we need to roll, or what? My Astarion had a +8 bonus with advantage on a ""target 20"" check, and he did not succeed after 30 tries. I ran a simulation on MS Excel, and I got 3-4 20s during repeated batches of 30 attempts (including advantage)
--take out the checks with uselessly low DCs (like DC 2-5) and just give us the results of a success
--following on that, remove ""critical misses"" and ""critical successes"" from skill checks. They specifically say that is not how skill checks work in D&D5, and it results in ""failing"" checks that we would've succeeded at anyway, mathematically
--finish Act III and polish the entire game before you dare call it a ""full release""
--AND/OR drop the price 20-33% to match the content
--my final request: Please give us a companion who is not a Mary Sue with CHA as the dump stat and a tragic, haunted backstory. How about a lizardfolk who just wants to eat all the tadpoles they can find?",1693279311,1708229706,False,6,0,0.515399575233459473,0,True,False,False

Interface
1. Add UI scaling.
2. Add a setting to speed up the dice roll animation (so that you don’t have to click the mouse every time to speed it up).
3. Add a setting to speed up the battle animation by 2 times.
4. Add the setting to always press ""Alt"" (to highlight objects). We're tired of holding the Alt button...
5. When you hover the cursor, show information about whether a book has been read or not (including books from merchants).
6. In the alchemy tab, show the properties of the future elixir or potion, and not just the name.
7. When trading with NPCs, scrolls will display information about what spells the character has already learned and what level is required for this spell.
8. When sorting, put identical items into one cell automatically (now this has to be done manually). And yes, why can’t the infernal iron be put into one cell? After all, enriched iron is possible! Give me the opportunity to fold infernal iron too.
9. Add text chat for multiplayer games.
10. Add a button to change floor (sometimes it can be difficult to move between floors because of the camera).
11. Add WASD controls. Moving the keys is really very convenient for many people.

Balance
12. It is necessary to upgrade the weapon to red (very rare), which can be crafted in the infernal forge (at the end of Act 1). Now it is blue (rare) and absolutely useless, as it is worse than even some green ones.
13. Act 3 bosses should be strengthened.
14. The dragonborn race should be strengthened (the dragonborn are the only race with only 1 ability, when other races have 4-5 abilities).

Basic moments
15. Give the opportunity to choose who will conduct the dialogue during a dialogue that has already started! Ideally, who will answer each question. If it is possible to switch during dialogue, that would be just great!
16. After the finale and the end of the game, it would be good to see the statistics of the game - what percentage of additional quests were completed, how much gold we received, how many enemies we killed, what key decisions were made during the passage, etc. The result of our passage in one picture (we would be interested to know the result of our passage and compare it with our friends).
17. Add a crafting profession! There are a lot of different stones, metals and materials in the game, of which there is a lot, but there is nowhere to use it (or there is a lot left over). We want to create new unique equipment!
18. Add the possibility of a romance with Jaheira.
19. When you started an affair with one of your companions, it would be logical that they now sleep together in the camp.

Graphic arts
20. Add support for DirectX 12
21. Add support for DLSS 3.5 (this already includes Super Resolution, Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction)
22. Add support for FSR 3.0
23. Add support for Path Tracing (or at least Ray Tracing)

Miscellaneous
24. Add Steam cards and a Steam game profile in the style of Baldur's Gate 3. We've been waiting for this for so long!
25. Add Steam Workshop support!",1708225986,1708225986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But this game sits differently. This game may not be for everyone if you don't like fantasy lore such as DnD or have an idea of certain races. But I can tell you this. Race and Class type doesn't matter in this game as much as you think it does, and thats a huge positive. Because they are all useful in many different ways. You can be an OP one punch man monk or a oathbreaking pally. 

From a Fighter/Ranger to a Druid or a wizard like Harry Potter to a Sorcerer named Raistlin Majere. It doesn't really matter. What matters is how you have fun with your party. From Act 1 of spending roughly around 40 hours of game play to Act 2 of spending 80 hours. And still, there is more to see lore wise, every person in the game has a unique story.

Now I am going to address the bad parts of the game and unfortunately this going to be extremely long  First and foremost is class design Might be some of the worst class design I have ever seen Can't decide between zerker and fighter Don't worry they do the same shit Wondering if you should pick wizard, sorcerer, warlock or druid Go with any they all do the same thing All have the same spells None of the classes have individuality Classes don't synergize with each other OR you can play ranger, monk or rogue All these classes basic attack and that's it Nothing changes as they level up other than they can basic attack again Finally we have paladin, bard and cleric These two classes are just completely full of trash Each level up you get useless spell after useless spell. Maybe next time they should spend less time give trash to those three and more time give ranger/rogue/monk literally anything Another massive negative is spells slots Got a new spell you want to use Sorry to bad it takes a spell slot so you can only use it once Please continue to use shitty magic missile for 99% of the play through because apparently that is fun Seeing that we have divinity original sin we know that the devs can comprehend a good combat system but for bg3 for whatever reason they just decided to remove it Maybe one of the greatest sins in the game is the fact that armor is incredibly unrewarding As you move through the game you expect armor and weapons to get better but in bg3 this isnt the case The sword that you find on the level 1 imp in the tutorial zone is just as strong as the super rare hard to get legendary sword Same goes for armor You are basically punished for wanting to get armor because armor nerfs your characters by proficiency And probably my last big issue with the game is the endless amount of yapping. It is simply non-stop Everytime you go anywhere someone has to talk You want to do long rest so that you can use a cool spell for once before going back to magic missile and cantrips To bad you need to talk to 13 companions and a dog before you go to sleep otherwise they will leave your camp because of neglect All in all, this rates as probably one of the most overrated games of all time I DO NOT RECOMMEND If you want a fun game go get Starfield

Between this, palworld and helldivers I think its pretty clear that gaming community is out of touch with real gamers Unfortunately dont see anything changing this Back in my day kids grew up playing world of warcraft and runescape and now these kids grow up playing Rocket league and Fortnite IT is simply just the sad state of affairs of today's reality CS2 is fun tho ",1697233348,1708221821,False,0,3,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

so, whilst i'm giving this a thumbs up.. its not for me. i should start by saying i have never played a D&D game so the rules are a complete mystery to me. i have tried for 25 hours to get into this game. i have read the wiki and i have watched tutorials on youtube. But, as soon as the combat starts i looses me. missing 3 attacks in a row at 75%, doing one damage with spells, failing 2 or more checks in a row and missing a character until later in the game... these are all things i just cant deal with. In divinity 2 i felt POWERFUL. in this, i got killed by the 2 brains with legs at the start of the game. i dread combat encounters. i REALLY wish i could play more because i want to enjoy the story but playing the game is a chore, and i would just rather be playing anything else :(

*** Possible Act 2 Story Spoilers ***

The bug/quest blocker that myself and many others have encountered causes a major Act 2 quest line to fail; and a companion eventually abandons you because of it!

I will make this as spoiler free as possible, but I do describe the issue.  So please decide if you want to keep reading now.

___________________________________________________________________


I killed a certain kid in Act 2 that tried to kill me in a game, had killed others, and wasn't going to stop. I felt they needed to be stopped. Fair enough.

Later I find out that this kid is EXTREMELY important to a major quest line in Act 2.

Even if a player kills this kid they are supposed to be respawnable if you have a certain dialogue with a certain Druid in Act 2. The dialogue option should come up allowing the player to tell the Druid they killed the kid. Then the Druid will respond that you cannot really kill the kid, and the kid will respawn when the player goes back to the place the kid was previously killed with the Druid.

However I don't get the dialogue about having killed the kid. I only get the dialogue to tell the Druid I saw the kid. So the kid won't respawn to be able to talk to them and progress the major quest line.

Not being able to progress this quest, and also that the outcome is so very drastic, seriously trashes my game story. And I loose a companion! It is a major bug/quest blocker that needs fixing. (If I wasn't watering this down, to try and avoid spoilers, you would understand the consequences to the story better.)

I don't even want to start Act 3 until they fix this and various other issues that you can easily find out about in online forums and gaming articles.  I don't want more bugs/quest blockers to damage my story more.

I submitted a report to Larian about this and got no response.

EDIT: Still not fixed after Patch 6. Still no response from Larian after months.  This is a quest blocker that causes the player to loose a companion.  That is HUGE.",1691200626,1708214677,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is good and could've been a masterpiece, BUT is heavily plagued with bugs and broken mechanics which break the game and ruin immersion. Lots of poor execution and lack of quality assurance. The game has been out for 6 months officially and I am still dealing with lots of issues, even after multiple patches. Gets extremely infuriating and annoying. It seems like the game was not properly play tested, as well as the patches. The worst is the pathing and hitboxes. It is so janky and hard to select what you are trying to. Companions and especially pets/summons are consistently getting stuck on ladders or nothing at all, to find that they got stuck 10 minutes ago. It is a constant battle of making sure everyone in your party is actually following you. It is seriously bad. Had issues with not being able to progress a few quests due to no fault of mine. Transitioning the camera between levels/floors is pretty bad. Some QOL is missing that you would think is common sense which is a shame. There are way too many traps and puzzles in this game, it just gets very annoying instead of fun and exciting. I end up having to interact with every object, book, or person in fear that I may miss important content, items, quests and progression (although the game is forgiving if you don't). It would be a lot better if this was more easily done and indicated. Not sure if some of these issues can even be fixed due to the engine and bad principles. These are only my major complaints... there are still a lot of other minor issues. Overall, the game is rich with story, writing, creativity and customization and is MOSTLY well made. But still needs a lot of polishing.. 

It is still mostly a fun experience and you definitely get a lot of play time. This may be GOTY for 2023, but there wasn't any fair competition. I expected more especially with that title. While they are working on improvements, it is a slap in the face that new patches bring dumb little quirks (like new animations for kissing and your companions at camp) instead of ENTIRELY focusing on fixing the plethora of bugs/issues first... Some of these new features they introduce are also buggy and poorly executed. Example: the new bartering update just makes any items offered disappear out of my inventory without actually offering them. If the game left early access, it should feel mostly complete and polished, but at times it doesn't. Gives me a sour taste in my mouth.

8/10 -- with all things considered, the good still outweighs the bad -- would easily be higher if the game wasn't half broken at times.",1708115749,1708212818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Literally filled with endless, countless, and in times senseless possibilities on how one can take their story through. Be the crazy psycho bad guy that unleashes hell against your enemies and fear on your friends, or the savvy wondrous bard playing lute in the middle of combat while beating your enemies with dual wielding salami sticks. 

The characters/voice acting from everyone is 100% quality and passion, giving us fleshed out characters and an arch between all of their stories that allow for anyone to quickly find their own favorite group, and an even greater pool of neerdowells that will tug at your heart strings and support you along the way. I recommend finding yourselves a way to rotate everyone throughout since all have unique dialogue wherever your story may take you.

I have never done turn-based gaming and am a veteran of countless FPS shooters and action/adventure games, nothing in my library at all plays like how this game does and it has been the most satisfying from any game I ever played. I couldn't look away and found myself vibrating in anxiety or excitement when rolling dice for a chance at an action. And every action, choice, and decision you make completely matters as to how the ending plays or the way you are perceived at the moment and in the future.

I could hardly contain myself in most cases, being unable to finish Act 2 and get near Act 3 not because of boredom or conflictions, but because I love it all in the beginning so much it makes me want to experience it all over again through the eyes of a different character and class just to see what other options and exciting opportunities would present itself. You get lost in this game and the design that it will literally make hours feel like minutes.

This game has invoked all the love I have for RPGs and returns it in the most gratifying, and loving experience I ever had in any video game. Not since the days of Mass Effect have I felt this way in a long time, leaving me completely ecstatic to be apart of something bigger than all of us with a community across the world experiencing this either for the first time or a veteran of DnD and the Baldurs Gate series in general. I will no doubt be playing this game every day and chance I get for the next years of my life, and am excited to experience it all in my repeating gameplay and the mods that come out in the future.

10/10 Across the board, beating any and all games developed by ""Triple A"" studios. 
May Larian Studios bring more wonderful experiences to our lives, may the team experience riches that now comfort their homes.

As I’m sure you can imagine, this did not set my expectations very high. Nonetheless, I decided to check this game out anyway and oh boy do I regret that decision. Too much of my time has now been taken up not just by playing Baldur’s Gate but also playing D&D with my neighbour Keith in his basement. The lack of sunlight I see on Sunday’s is truly troubling, but Keith’s storytelling is impeccable, the man has a way with words. Possibly not as good as the storytelling within Baldur’s Gate 3 but he doesn’t get paid to write our campaign so you can’t expect too much from him.
This game really excelled at utilising the best parts of D&D, creating such an immersive experience within a world that feels lived in. The incredible characters and voice acting help to make the player feel like they are actually a part of this tale, something Keith could improve on as the only accents he can do are Jamaican and South African. Another area BG3 tops Keith would be the atmospheric music. He would never have a villain singing their own theme song during their boss fight, which really made Raphael a standout for me in this game. The entire period spent in the House of Hope was one of the tensest sections of a video game I have ever played, knowing that at some point Raphael would show up but not when. Then when he finally does, he is singing the battle music himself, absolute madman.
The ensemble of characters that make up the adventuring party within this game are excellent company throughout the game, all offering different skills and personalities to aid in the fight against the absolute. The ability to swap them in and out depending on what you need is quite helpful, and I wish I could swap out Keith’s friend Louise as she is fucking annoying, but I guess that’s just another thing BG3 has over actual D&D.
Overall, I would highly recommend this game (and D&D in Keith’s basement) to anyone interested in playing and would absolutely place BG3 within my top 7 games on Steam.

This is a great game, but remember that this is in early access and only the first act is available. That means there are immersion breaking moments that the devs are working on- it also means that certain quests are uncompletable since they go beyond act 1. The levels are capped at 4, which you can quickly reach if you explore thoroughly. However, if the game and devs continue to grow and receive feedback as they have, it will be a 10/10 game when it comes out, better that DOS2. If you are still reading this, then either buy this game, or get DOS2 if you don't have it already and want a full developed game. OH!!! Also, this game is in early access and already as a mod community that is as big (if not bigger) than DOS2, if you like to mod.

Edit - I read some reviews regarding optimization, so I will share my build that gets me decent performance, but my computer cries whenever it loads up this game:

Ive played every medieval fantasy game you can name and, while Ive enjoyed many - NONE come even close to representing the actual D&D experience the way this game does.  It surprises and delights me at every turn.  From challenging puzzles, unexpected plot twists, humor, drama , romance and adventure Its simply amazing.  I am purposefully playing slow and limiting my playtime so I can savor the expereince for as long as possible. 

There are a few flaws - The party size limit is 4, despite you often encountering significantly more foes than that - Id like to see 6 or 8 allowed and Id rather do it without mods, which are not yet supported.  But really, those are my only two, very minor, complaints.

The good?   The story, Engaging, well written and not a series of ""kill 10 rat"" quests.  Each subquest is strange and wonderful... in the past week ive worked for a Musroom King, freed an evil drow with explosives so I could cut off his head, and saved a senile dwarf from a field of explosive flora. 

This morning I met a blacksmith who I gave a random piece of metal to that I found nearly 25 hours of gametime ago - and totally unexpectedly - he made me some plate mail armor.

Decisions have consequences - every conversation you have to consider the long term ramifications.  I suspect strongly that decisions I make early will continue to reverberate throughout the game.

You may find yourself making multiple attempts to replay the game just to try out a different character or strategy. In doing so, you will discover new areas, items, quests, etc. that you haven't seen before.

The combat is extremely fun. I can go on and on about how great this game. 

Also love the various relationships you can build with party members. 

Larian if you’re reading this, congratulations on showing the AAA studios how it’s done. You’ve beaten EA, Bioware etc at their own game and written a worthy successor to the CRPGs of old.

Absolutely stunning game, amazing story and voice acting. The characters are written really well and there is a variety of different types.
The different Acts are visually pleasing. They're also incredibly different style wise. 
There is a lot of freedom in this game, you can genuinely do so many different things, in so many different ways.

You can explore, quest, fight, flirt, throw poo (or rub it on your face,) piss yourself, have a lady essentially peg you, marriage, etc etc. There is SO much to offer.

My only issue is that the radial wheel isn't more standardized (playing with controller). Wouldn't it make sense for scrolls and potions to be in separate wheels? Or separate wheels for spell types/levels? Instead, every time you pick up something or learn a new spell, the game randomly throws it into the end of the wheel, and you have to manually find the right place for it. For all five party characters. Every single time. Until you give up around the middle of Act II and stop keeping track of any new spells/scrolls/potions.

i like the romancing- a lot ! !  and the saucy bits took me by surprise in a good way !

without any spoilers, the druid camp party was probably my fave 'scene' I was so shocked to have all the npc's at camp and get to talk to all of them. usually in games you complete x quest and they say thanks and thats it.  but that interaction felt so positive and like my actions had consequences 

edit- I finished the game today, my ending was absolutely heart breaking and made me cry real tears. this was a really amazing game. but the ending was soooooooooooo sad. such a fantastic story and characters, but i need therapy now.

**********************************minor spoilers*********************

Story: The hook of the story is immediate. There is no ambiguity about what needs to be done. There is tadpole in your characters eye socket and it need be removed or embraced. As the your characters explore the world, the rich story enfold to other parts of the game that is magical.

Difficulty: Rogue-like difficulty: Each combat is intense so knowing the game rules and spells are important or the part will wipe out and may start at a saved sport or check point, but with honour mode check the game is truly a rogue - like:

Graphics: There are two main types on instances the dialog scenes and the isometric play. The game plays very similar to Dragon Age Origins. There is the party that is in a strategy mode which only has 4 person teams,I wish with their was 6 though. The graphic in that mode are decent, but when it comes to  dialog mode the graphics are awesome.

Dialog and options: This is where the game goes up an way beyond the call of duty. there are 9 classes and 10 main classes but each option weather you are an 1/2 Ork, Elf, to other races, the world subtly treats the character unique. even if you are a male or female, the world adjusts to the character. Each choice impact the character and the world around....12 out 10!. Extra credit for the amount work and detail the developing team took.

System requirements: The requirements for the game requires a state of the art machine. This is a bummer because in order the play what the authors intended for the best experience, I would say it may cost up to $5500. Not going to into super technical details, I hope after it is written, PC gaming machines to play this game will be a lot lower in price. I used an Intel i9 processor with Nvidia 16 GB graphics card with Asus motherboard. I might of over killed it?

Overall: if you have the gear play this game, you will not be disappointed, enjoy the rich and painstaking work and detail Larion went through so everyone can enjoy it. Enjoy the story and the confict the world has to offer.

is the game different from BG1 and BG2? Yes, but that's what happens when twenty years and different developers separate the entries of a series. Many of the disappointments people express are not invalid, because they come down to preferred styles of gameplay. That being said, I think this game is an excellent entry into the BG franchise and I have been thoroughly enjoying it so far. As it is the first day of early access, there is some roughness in the production values that will likely be smoothed over by full launch. The fun, substantive integration of 5E systems into an RPG of this size is excellent. Of the present classes and races, there should be enough to interest anybody, though I am greatly looking forward to the rest of the PHB material. One aspect of DOS2 that lent it a lot of longevity was the modding scene - I hope the modding scene for BG3 becomes just as developed over time.

Absolutely i would. Also there is plenty of room for new player of this genre to learn how to use the gameplay mechanics and interact with the story. 

There is so much to do in this game and how you can do it, is simply mindblowing. Speaking with animals, speaking with the dead, stealing shit from people while distracting them, and many more ways, how the world reacts if you use different actions and spells on the NPCs. And the dialogues? Entirely unique with every playthrough, painfully aware what race, class, and former choices you roll with. Even with a failed dice roll, the experience can be so epic, just like with a Tabletop game with humanly chaotic outcomes and events. 

The companions, you enlist during your journey are profoundly original, with their own piece of mind, but capable of coming around with any kind of playthrough you go with, if you care to listen, and talk to them. With voice actors so talented, they perfectly capable of displaying the vast array of euphoria, dread, strife humor and pityness that makes them truly believable and humane. Even if you get to know them, the game offers you moments, when they display adaptivity to the story and your choices.  This is what really makes them feel more lifelike. 

Only the amount of quests in this game is simply astounding, and the depth some of them is remarkable. I had many great moments, during my 400+ hours when I was just struck before the monitor. Sometimes soultearing, cathartic cutscenes blew my mind away, many times the simple contentedness, how my character's actions could solve some dread issues for people. And of course there is plenty of opportunity for Larian's sense of humor to shine trough.

With regular updates they always add some more spectacular and fulfilling content to the game. Even some elements that were missing from launch have been succesfully implemented with these updates. I believe it is one of the best games I ever played with, and I am really proud to say this is a game I will always come back to. Also, congratulations for the Game of the Year Award!

I came back a few months later and got hooked right back in almost instantly. There's a reason this is GOTY. I can't think of any other game recently that came close. Maaaybe Hogwarts, but that was mostly nostalgia and it wore off after playing fewer hours.

This game hooked me right back after a few month hiatus. I only have the single playthrough, but I've tried to do all the side-quests, and they're all pretty worthwhile. It's not like side quests in other games where it's ""go find x and kill"". There's lore to read, conversations to have, things to discover. Almost 100 hours in a SP game, on a single run-through, and I've only just finished Act 2. I cannot recommend this game enough.



I purchased in EA and honestly, probably got my money's worth there. However, this is very much in the same vein as D:OS/2. That is to say that it's a great isometric RPG.

If you like Divinity: Original Sin or the followup, or any of the more recent CRPG's like PoE, then you will like this game. There's a depth to it that you rarely see these days. With plenty of creates to talk with, corpses to animate and interrogate, etc. Everything about it seems like they built it to be a great CRPG, and then said ""What if we just keep refining the base and adding layers?"" and then went ahead and did just that.",1614299649,1708187436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The devs took into considerations tons of player's choices and variations of his actions.
Gameplay is really interesting since the game itself is a mix of a vidogame and a board game and there are aspects of such D&D genre such as dice which you roll for almost every action from fighting to flirting. Some players may dislike this thing since you may lose some content and use safescam method. But the game is made to be replayed multyple times with different roleplay models.
I loved the world of Faerûn! The world itself is giant and you will always find some hidden locations. The devs made a big work to fill the books and dialogues with pieces of the story of this place. I enjoyed to explore all locations, they're all have their own atmosphere and meticulously worked out details which is incredible.
Also want to mention how various the game is in dialogues and relations between characters. There are several characters in your camp and you can get through their stories if you want or don't interact with them up to the end. Having a certain character in your group cause different ingame situation, i.e. having Lae'zel when you appear to githyankis camp may make it easier to get to the camp since she can talk to representatives of the tribe. AND THERE ARE TONS OF SUCH INTERACTIONS!
Also the plot is kinda interesting with the idea of an ""Absolut cult"" which I won't spoiler. But I will say that endings vary because of your choices during the plot.

AAAAAAND It is extremely fun to play with friends!

All in all the game deserves its Game of the Year 2023 and other awards. This game is a work of art! The devs put their souls into this game. Play it and you will see why!

Pros:
1. VAST AND ENGAGING story/content.
2. Fun classes and combat.
3. Extensive intractability.
4. Can save in cutscenes, battle, and out.
5. Well fleshed out companions and NPCs. They all have their own personalities and it's believable.
6. Voice acted cutscenes on virtually every encounter.
7. Great graphics.
8. Respecable relatively early on.
9. Allows mature content fitting with story.
10. Voiced dialogue.
11. !(This addresses most Cons)! Devs have and continue to add improvements. These include quality of life updates, such as accessing quest items from camp chest when away from camp.


(Most Cons are fixed/remedied by point 10 above)
Cons: 
1. Some bugs.
2. Inconveniences:
  a. Map:
    i. When Map opens it doesn't center on character.
    ii. Can't look at maps of other locations without being there while looking.
  b. Can't lock in place items in inventory.
3. Not developer's fault but DnD leveling power up feels underwhelming and lacking in player choice of how to grow skills/talents/abilities. Any choice of feats is usually every 4 levels.",1692032885,1708174629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

P.S. Larion, if you are looking for inspiration for the re-brand, I was thinking something along the lines of ""Miscellaneous Locations Around The Forgotten Realms 3"" 

or even better; 

""It Wyll Take You 300 Hours to Reach Baldur's Gate.""

BUT...

Only the vanilla release day version. Every single hotfix and patch after it was made only to break the game more and more every time. They state about 1000 fixes every patch, but some of them are not even actually still fixed (hi, doors). And on top of that they are keep adding 2000 new bugs and glitches and degradations every time. While also successfully fixing cool features instead of critical bugs (fixing possibility to transform the statue into the sheep is surely is more important, then everything else).

So, Larian, tell me, why players must be your beta testers? Why can't you keep building that Definitive Version without breaking your game every week with patches? Just rollback to vanilla version, and test all of your changes before releasing one single Definitive Version. But yes, i know that this is impossible now, because saves are not backward compatible...

So if you want to play this game, get the vanilla release day version (or carefully choose a patch, which you really need to have). Otherwise, wait for Definitive Edition... If it is gonna ever happen.

2nd play through , steam early access, to my utter joy and excitement , found the game here and promptly brought it, played a little bit but decided to wait until full release

3rd play through, after a long, long wait, 3rd of august 2023, larian released the full version, I sunk my hrs into this game, playing a custom made elf female rogue tav, accidentally murdered everyone in last night inn, thanks isobel, all prisoners in moonrise towers killed, halfway through act 3, read online that I could actually save everyone, decided to try again.

4th play through, custom made half elf rogue elf, to my surprise, new not seen before dialogue etc appeared, saved everyone, near the end of act 3 game constantly crashed, until I figured out why, I was using a hdd instead of ssd lol, moved game to ssd and deleted corrupted save files

5th current play through, dark urge half elf rogue/ranger tav, am in shars trials atm, zero crashes now that the game is installed on ssd.

Holy heck. I spent 200 hours for just one campaign, and i still feel like i missed at least 50% of its content. I havent seen the legendary bear scene, nor the one where Astarion got crushed by a building, nor all the other darker endings for everyone. Imagine my surprise when i realized some bosses dont have to be fought, and can just die by talking. Definitely have to play this game multiple times.

Something that amazed me the most was controller compatibility. It was crazy how different the UI was when switching between KBM and controller. 

Next campaign, i shall get Minthara on the team, since i didnt know she can be recruited and got her killed last time. And try to get the legendary bear scene. And the Dark Urge path. And conquer the world.
(Edit: just completed second campaign with Dark Urge on Tactician mode. It still took me over 150 hours despite knowing what to do, and knowing what characters build to use. Since i wanted to get all companions during the epilogue, so i had to be good the whole run. Thus again, didnt get to see the darker endings.) 

Edit: Campaign 3 will probably be modded run. Maybe even Honour Mode. I am getting all party members all at once. No more waiting in camps. I want to see all those interactions and banter. And maybe now i can go for more ambitious routes? Again, i just realized there is an entire grove defense battle that i missed on both campaigns. 

Some complains about the game (during Patch 5): Act 2 and 3 has quite a number of bugs, as compared to Act 1. Sometimes some characters face has a really long stick protruding out. One specific gnome has a face of polygons. Some conversation options in act 3 do not make sense. Some characters just move funny in the submersible mission. And i dont know why Viconia just got knocked out when I killed her, and she can still do conversation when being talked to. If she was important i didnt see her again after that fight. And if they let Minthara die just like that, surely the game is not forcing me to let Viconia lives and it was just a bug? (edit: Viconia's scene got better in campaign 2, it made sense at least).  And then when we are knocking out Minsc to recruit him, the recruit scene may not happened if the main character was too far away. It was annoying, he immediately woke up and started attacking, we couldnt knocked him out a second time, he died. I had to reload a few times before realizing the problem and reposition myself to be closer. 

My biggest complain yet, was the city Baldur's Gate kept getting mentioned in conversations, but we havent actually been there in the entire game? Surely the lower city doesnt count? 

Overall, 90 out of 100. After the bugs are fixed, it would probably be 98 out of 100.",1706119694,1708168350,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But after having read such raving reviews (also the reason why I had originally bought it) and after having read that I should take my time in exploring instead of rushing to solve the NPCs' issues, I decided to give it another go. And boy, was that the best thing I ever did in gaming!!!

The game is a pure gem. The story, the exploration, the interactions and the immersion are second to none. Skyrim is great but it doesn't compare in so many ways (not least because its actually a different genre). Also, take the time to select the best items for your individual characters - the most appropriate weapons, spells, scrolls, armour etc. As you begin to discover the game you realise that there is a lot of strategy involved in the game - in almost every aspect of it. And there are a lot of aspects to it but it is so well set out, so well defined, it truly is an incredible game.

My only criticism is related to my initial challenge and I found that other had experienced the same challenge. Perhaps with the next iteration, there could be a little more initial guidance on where a new player to the genre might best travel and manage.

For fans of deep story lines, impactful decisions and character driven stories the game is a must. However when you prefer to have fast past action Baldur's Gate 3 might not be for you. 

I have played ~150h and so fare and I have not finished the game so fare I am in act 3. There is so much to do and explore (I have a second play through with my girlfriend but it here we have not left the first act so fare). Every quest feels like an adventure with multiple possible outcomes even the conversations can go so different. The extend of difference in conversations I had between my main and second character I have never experienced in another game before.

The companions all feel like there is something going on and they are interesting in there own way. Usually I feel like there is one or two companions that are topical soldier guy or another less interesting trope but not so here . Every character has its unique personalty and adds interesting conversations and story lines to the game.

The game creates this feeling you have when going on an adventure with friends in a pen&paper. If captures this seance of possibility to tackle a task in different ways and it captures the chaos that can happen due to some of your decisions very well. For me this is the best game I have played so fare. Since it feels like the open adventure most RPGs claim to be for the first time in this quality. 

The amount of effort to plan ahead capture all the different conversation paths with actors and animators is an astonishing feed by Larian. So as a conclusion I would recommend everyone to at least take a closer look at the game since this is a very unique title that shows us what the RPG genre is capable of.",1708164227,1708164227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't played a video game since the 90s, (yeah, I'm  a woman in my 50s) was completely WOWed by the graphics, fine details, interactions and play options. This game is nothing like your Mothers video games, let me tell you. I love how immersive the environment is, the details and renderings are like a beautifully enhanced reality, they are stunning. Sometimes I just sit my avatar down and enjoy the scenery :) My favorite part of this game though is my companions, I find myself wanting their approval and to help them fulfill their personal quests. Wish there was an option to just hang out with them, like by sitting around the fire chilling at camp or more alone time with a chosen love interest, I would like it if they would seek out more interactions with me just to chat (that goes for Scratch and Owl Bear Cub too, who by the way could use a name) and it would be nice if there was a prompt for when a specific companion would benefit from being there like, ""Hey, Astarion would like to join"" or something of the sort. ..Would like more puzzles also, its fun to puzzle them out. But the inventory, it seems like a bit of work to manage, it would be helpful if we could transfer without having the member in your party. I'm playing a wood elf wizard and am impressed with the variety of spells available. This game has sated a need for adventure and fun, I am enjoying it immensely and find myself looking forward to the moment I finally get to sit down and play with it.

Turns out that I can actually run it pretty well! That being said, I'd recommend checking your system and storage info first, because it's a pretty big game, but I've had a lot of fun with it so far. Takes some loading time for me (aging computer), and some of the features have taken me a while to learn. That being said, it has still been very worth playing for me.

Fun take on TTRPG combat overall, and I think it was translated pretty well overall from ""multiplayer table top open endings"" into its more linear, single-player-friendly form. I played 5e years before this game's release, so I already had a rough understanding of its rules, but I think the game's rules have a relatively solid mix of general accessibility and challenge to them, imo. Also, I appreciate the offered difficulty levels; cool touch. The way they implemented inspiration feels very funny sometimes, but I also enjoy it.

Character creator has some cool stuff to it; my biggest gripe with it would probably be the lack of curlier hairstyles. This doesn't impact me personally, but games tend to favour straighter and euro-centric hair styles, and it's a shame to see it in play here once again. (That being said, I hear there are cool mods around.) I've also heard complaints about the overall lack of face and body customization, but I, myself, haven't yet played enough saves for that to be an issue.

I cannot yet speak to character romance, as I haven't really messed with that, but I hear a lot of people are very into that, and I do think that they did some really cool stuff with the characters' branching arcs as they interact with your Tav, romantically or platonically, and as they make strides toward their individual goals. Cool stuff, really hoping to explore more of it as I find the time.

It's very clear that a lot of effort, time, and passion were put into this game. The actors are all great so far, the stories and characters interest me, and the map has lots to explore. It's got lots of ups and downs throughout, but if you think it's something you want to try, I've really enjoyed it so far, so I would recommend it, depending on your interests and circumstances.",1708141644,1708141644,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Yes because the game is that bad. Today, which is a Friday, I felt my work would be more fun than this while playing BG3 (which was just endlessly reloading a save to get lucky rolls), and that was the end of it and it pulled the plug for me.

In my [i]k[/i]-th go at restarting the whole game from scratch, I ran into githyanki dragonrider patrols at level 3 in balanced difficulty, and it is probabilistically impossible to even run away from the fight. I can manage up to 2-3 members to run away but the main character ends up dying because she was positioned badly.

I can change the difficulty to explorer mode and do save reloads to do the fight until 1-2 patrols are left and my party gets wiped. I know that with enough reloads my party can win the fight but at this point this isn't gaming anymore. This isn't a gacha game.

I keep only one save because I am honoring the dice roll that determined Lae'zel to play along but the gith guy caught the lie, triggering the fight. I know there's an inherent problem in dnd where lower levels are rough, but any advices to avoid fighting at lower levels are dismissed because that would mean restarting the game from scratch as I have only one save right before the fight starts. Oh and there isn't even an option to save your character customization, right?

The very fact that devs decided to spend time on a useless feature dubbed karmic dice, which effectively rigs the dice probability mass function (why the hell is it even defaulting to On?), but decided to not implement a basic UX element where it should at least display the expected value of how much damage would be dealt if the attack roll succeded, immediately indicates they don't know how accommodation works. This isn't 2000s anymore. The intent of karmic dice is to help the players, right? Well, when I am pointing at a target I would like to know how much damage I will be dealing as a number (just the expected value is fine), because otherwise I need to manually look at the stats of the target and figure out the distribution myself, which I can do but it gets tedious. This would have taken a fraction of time to implement but this was not done, in favor of spending time on even considering to implement something hideous as karmic dice. Luckily, this is a fixable problem and I've laid a solution here, and I will pay the full price again when this gets implemented in a future patch.

Just to be fair, the characters are amazing. I really wish I could be motivated to see the rest of the game, but this isn't 2000s anymore.",1708123354,1708140842,False,1,1,0.421779632568359375,0,True,False,False

I grew up as a Playstation boy and never shot my attention towards PC games unless they were Club Penguin, Poptropica, etc. This game, a Dungeons and Dragons semi-clone in video game format, was the main reason I built my PC. I've been excited for the past few years waiting for this game and when it was on BETA, I spent over 60 hours just messing around in the First Act discovering, testing and enjoying my time with all the customization. This game has honestly changed the bar in the gaming industry, not only setting the new bar in all RPG games but all future games in general. I know it's a lot asking for the AAA studios to make great games like this when all they want is $$$, but it gives me hope to see more enjoyable Masterpieces like BG# to hit the homes of all types of gamers no matter what background they have.

If you like any RPG/Action/Turn-Based  games, this is a great game for you. If you are curious about this type of game, go to a friend's place that has it, to try it out before you decide. If this game isn't for you, that's okay just be cool and patient, whatever genre you enjoy the most, I'm sure some company will make your PERFECT game soon!

Why though?

1. RND is King. Whichever level of difficulty you are playing the realization that a random roll dice on (both yours and on the side of AI) can end your playthrough makes each and every campaign unique. 
2. Customization and multi-classing. You can be whoever you want. Want to be a spicy mix of a paladin and a bard? Here you go! Or maybe a druid/warrior/ranger? As you wish here it is! 
3. Role-playing. Sheer amount of dialogue options based on your background and deeds allow you to live the life of your character. 
4. Amount of builds and equipment. With every new game you will be able to come up with new combinations and variations of loot and equipment for your characters. Just imagine hundreds of different optimizations routes to consider based on your race, class, buffs, blessings, equipment attributes.
5. Constant optimization and develop support. Larian prove again and again that they listen to their community and implement the best solutions to make your game sessions the best experience (based on the patches in the first year post-release). And wait until we hit a full-fledged DLC or expension from them.
6. Soundtrack.Just Borislav Slavov. Some OST are just made for constant repeat on your preferred streaming service. 

I am in love with this game. It's not my first game in CRPG, but it is definitely my favorite one so far. I am happy to report that this is a new standard and my hope is that is just the start.",1708137001,1708137001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the slower pace of turn-based combat and exploration may be less than appealing to some (myself included), once I got in the mood/mindset for it.  It did remind me of Planescape Torment, with the engaging storyline and DnD flavor, altho I did miss the floating talking skull.  But unlike PT, there were clearly more potential ways to resolve conflicts, which is nice to see the difference in what 20 plus years makes.

It did help that I had become more familiar with DnD thanks to the likes of Critical Role, High Rollers and other content.  But, the most defining aspect for me is that its been a long time since I've felt a game was worth full retail price.

It isn't perfect, but despite its limitations there's still a lot of fun to be had. I'd describe it as the closest to the feeling of playing D&D in a video game. No spoilers in this review.

Pros: Customization for classes adds a lot of flavor/replayability to the game and the choices you make throughout the game mostly have an impact. I played a fighter my first playthrough which made me a beast at combat but a failure at dialogue (but failing can still be fun!). Now I'm playing a bard which is a very different experience and a lot of fun. I really enjoy the turn-based combat that allows for strategy and the scaling in both character power and difficulty keeps combat engaging throughout the game. Interactions with companions are interesting and, perhaps most importantly, you can choose which companions to engage with (you'll probably hate some of them). The game starts off strong and ends really strong as well.

Cons: Combat can be cheesed and/or trivial at times depending on your build and party. The combat is secondary to the story though so I didn't find this to detract much from the game. The story is kind of interesting but sometimes bland and there are times where choices feel forced or like non-choices. For example, choosing an evil playthrough limits a lot of your options, which might make sense story-wise but can be disappointing gameplay-wise. Pacing also slows down toward the middle and middle-end of the game. I think it's 100% worth completing the story, but you can tell that more time was put into the first acts of the game and less time in the later acts. I did have to make an effort to come back to the game and keep playing at times where the game pacing slowed down.

Overall, I really enjoyed playing BG3 and I think it's worth buying even at full price if you really enjoy RPGs.",1708122512,1708122512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[url=https://media.tenor.com/JKWt8u7f8lcAAAAC/mike-stoklasa-who.gif] So who cares! [/url]

[u] It's a great game held back by the age old question of what to do with D&D game mechanics. [/u] If you're inexperienced with D&D, the mechanics you use to get through each encounter may be very confusing. The main reason for this is that game developers throughout the decades would use D&D for inspiration and reinvent fantasy combat to suit the video game rather than be beholden to D&D. What works in D&D works at the table, and the GM can mitigate shortcomings through experience, advice, and knowing when to make a judgement call.

[h2] The Good [/h2]
Where BG3 succeeds is how it builds a world and story choices and variety in the outcomes. You can play how you want to play, with a list of proverbial asterisks. That said, there are many situations where your knowledge of D&D and how video games usually work will sadly clash. Video games in general solved many situations where BG3 seems to ignore. 

[h1] It's all downhill [/h1]
This usually comes in the form of traversing environments where you almost wished it wasn't so complicated or difficult to discern the means of getting through. Some areas are obvious to reach, and others aren't, and without proper guides you may skip content because your gamer-mind knows from experience that what you see is background visuals but BG3 actually intended for you to go there. 

[h2] The story itself gets in its own way. [/h2]
A lot of time and attention was given to balancing evil factions with neutral factions through the main character who can potentially mediate overlapping motivations. However, by the time you get to this point you realize the game can rob you of the thrill of being a good mediator. You will struggle to trust the game to let you covertly navigate tense factional situations. Trusting the game is a difficult task because the RNG will let you down sooner than later. Managing mission-critical resources like supplies and in-game time (story-based days) become a huge drag. I personally got so frustrated with one area that I decided my guys were ""good"" murderhobos because I couldn’t trust the game to give me a good outcome. I still had to explore an entire area and I was sick and tired of looking up each section which I didn't know you could traverse - each time too. Also many fights are basically glorified cutscenes you can win but were designed for the bad guy to get away. If you don't win in 3 turns, the fight is over. You're not told this. Why did you waste your daily spells?

[h2] The combat gets in its own way. [/h2]
The combat shows that a lot of attention was taken to translate D&D spells to the video game experience, but sadly you will not fully utilize it. Some spells are only useful for conquering dialogue scenarios, but the dice is not on your side. It becomes extremely difficult to ignore that the component holding you back from playing the game how you wanted is the dice roll. The inspiration mechanic is there to help you acquire re-rolls but this isn't enough because especially early on you don't know how many chances you will get. It becomes extremely frustrating that your character is built to succeed in specific areas like dialogue, but the RNG doesn't allow for that. It makes you wish for a Fallout-like approach to stats, you dream of dice-rolls being an optional alternative to dialogue choices you are ill-equipped for, but it's not there. 

The combat problems continue when many D&D monster abilities are there to remind you that D&D combat is designed around specifically focused campaigns. An Underdark adventure is something GMs prepare parties for, a cursed land with monsters that steal your turns and deny you mobility is also something GMs prepare you for. Make no mistake, these locations are talked about way in advance. But sadly, these monsters with these abilities are not Final Fantasy monsters where you can cure statuses away pre-emptively without extensive knowledge of D&D and knowing way in advance how to avoid it. Most monsters by this point will disappoint you with the ability to teleport close which limits your combat options since area-effect spells become a liability. This game enhanced hazardous surfaces as a combat mechanic, but sadly they just get in your way and continue even way after combat is over. ""Oops,"" that enemy you killed blew up and damaged everyone around it but you couldn't have known this would happen. It's so random. Pick WIld Magic by the way!

[h2] Spells in general are confusing[/h2]
Because the game sadly is ill-equipped to educate you on how they work in D&D or how they changed them to work in the game. Some spells were changed to only affect party members and keeping track of that over the ones that affect everyone is difficult. Some spells work without fail because an intelligent choice was made to limit who or what they affect. This becomes even more difficult to manage when the environments are either too big or too small for the party and the enemies. If your default ""cannot possibly fail"" contingent battle strategy is bottlenecking enemy hordes and bombing them, you better expect them to teleport into your face.  Enemies go through obstacles and other enemies but your own party will block each other like it's CSGO. 

[h2] You will have to jump through your party. [/h2]
But this wastes Actions. Spells and abilities that take a turn to charge are going to be ignored no matter how you enjoyed them in D&D. Battles are too frantic and stealing turns from your enemies is your main priority. It is already ubiquitous to do so in optimal battle strategies across different games. But in this game it's mandatory because of the wide range of damage monsters can cause and even the simplest enemy has spells and abilities to steal your turn. You will be surprised with how many enemies make 1-action-per-turn a non-factor that only you have to deal with. By this point you will realize that most classes, sub-classes, and most of what the game offers in general is not viable.

[h2] You can build a throwing character. [/h2]
But they didn't design the inventory management properly. It's very detailed and offers a lot of quality options which are necessary to skip past the lootfest, but sadly it's not enough. You can send your items to your camp, but you still need to ""Add to Wares"" which puts them back in your inventory.  You will wish for a Torchlight sell experience instead of barter and merchant mood mechanics which you will never make use of. Even really minor things like equipping your characters is strange because the graphical boxes seem to resist dropping items in and swapping them out. You can miss your attack and throw away your turn because it is difficult to click on enemies despite how much control you have over the camera. You can miss your chance to heal your teammate. Shoot at the floor instead of the enemy because the cursor can't assist you.

[h1] You're special if you read this and none of it mattered! [/h1]
All of this is completely noticeable on the moderate (medium), aka ""Balanced,"" difficulty. If you can manage this on Balanced, Tactical, or Honored, more power to you. Understanding D&D mechanics in such an intricate way is a very special skill set. Being able to beat bloated damage sponges is proof you're a special kinda guy. Maybe the easy difficult which takes out most of the combat complexity is a far more rewarding experience. But for those who saw past the D&D and viewed it as a hindrance, it made BG3 a nearly unmanageable experience. I'm the type of person that can go back to playing Icewind Dale and know what I'm getting into. But if you do that, you remember how they changed the D&D experience to accommodate video games. Even back then as it is now, you can't play the game how you wanted.",1708120705,1708120705,False,0,0,0.473559588193893433,0,True,False,False

As someone who's never played much RPG (more RTS instead) and definitely never played a turn-based one, the learning curve was a bit steep starting out. Act 1 is big and tutorials are limited. That said, the sense of discovery throughout the game is incredible. The amount of dialogue choices, storylines, etc. can be overwhelming but going through my second playthrough now feels so different. Especially since I went evil this second time. 

A few things I wish were different from a personal preference style. There's a lot of mutilation and gore. Bodies and blood litter the ground everywhere as if pestilence and burying dead didn't exist ever. I love the dark aspects of the Shadowland, the deeps of the Underdark and Grym Forge. Love the Act 1 surrounds and even the chaos and confusing Baldurs Gate and surrounding area in Act 3. However there are times when I feel it could be toned down in terms of graphic content. I don't mean to say that death and savage scenes shouldn't exist but this game feels more fantasy-horror than fantasy for most of the playthrough.

I do love that you can romance and build real relationships with your companions. I love the battles that can come out of nowhere and slap you if you're not ready, it really makes scouting and being clever rewarding. I love that you can do so many types of playstyles from sneaky rogues, to brawling Owlbears, to raining down lightning or simply bashing a big sword down on someone repeatedly. 

I did feel the end to be a bit anti-climactic given the massive (hundred-plus hours build up) to fight the biggest baddest boss. I'd been saving a certain cleric spell, had all these companions to aid me and didn't end up needing them or using them thinking there would be a bigger fight. Of the 3 main sub-villains, the General was the most standout, the others a bit more lacklustre. I definitely found the difficulty hard enough in the early-mid game and then... 

For Origin Characters, Shadowheart and Astarion are very 3-dimensional and flushed out. Minthara also has interesting depth. Karlach is 2-dimensional but is such a golden retriever of warmth that that is very ok. Gale and Wyll however... Lackluster. Though I did like the Mizora element of Wyll's story. 

Some comments for quality of life:
• Would love an encyclopedia or wiki in game of items, clues on where to find them (what quests), etc. Maybe toggle-able on 2nd-onward playthroughs. It really sucks to find out you locked yourself out of key items you were hoping to get. 
• In character creation, it would be really cool to see what each class gets with level ups. 
• Would love to be able to change body type and gender in magic mirror. Ex. took a female dragon body type thinking it was male (gender, voice and genital were all set to male). However all clothes fit as if to cover non-existent boobs and in-game postures are feminine. Kinda of broke the roleplaying for me and couldn't change it without completely restarting.
• The inventory... is kind of chaotic. Ways to make it more friendly or organized would be appreciated. 


So Larian staff, thank you for a masterpiece. I think this game is out of this world and I am hooked on the DnD concept and look forward to anything you put out next, even if I have to wait to play it in a decade or two. To anyone thinking about this game. Get it. For the price of a night out you can immerse yourself in novels of lore and fantasy and interact with this world, experience epic battles etc. I haven't payed full price for a game since Age of Empires 3 in 2005 and this game won me over... hard.

Honestly, if I had known this was click-to-move with turn-based combat I would never have bought it. For me, both those control modes are big time immersion destroyers. Constantly manipulating a floating camera to try to figure out where you are, where you are going, and what's going on around you is unnatural and often disorienting, as apposed to simply looking around yourself in the first person perspective like you do naturally (whether its true first person, through your own eyes; or third/first person over your shoulder.)  And turn based combat, as opposed to real time, is just plain tedious.

Okay, so admittedly that's more a critique of click-to-move with turn-based combat games in general than it is of Baldur's Gate 3 specifically. The game environment is gorgeous.  The character creation, character races, character sub-races and sub-classes give you endless options and is a lot of fun just to browse through. The game is pleasingly narrated where appropriate and the cut scenes seem to be well paced. Finally, the nod to classic D20 D&D is kind of cute and fun.

En fin; I'm disappointed because this game simply is not going to engender the kind of addictive immersion I look for in an RPG, but it's still worth playing on a more casual level.


Edit - 

Now six and a half hours into the game and I'm requesting a refund from Steam. I tried hard, wanted to like it, but the reality is I'm spending more time trying to wrestle the camera into submission than I am enjoying the game. And to add insult to injury the turn based combat just feels like it's running slow as molasses, both issues together make the game simply aggravating.  If you are a fan of turn based combat and third person, unhingd camera games you may find a way to forgive these shortcomings as the game is gorgeous and the story compelling.

Second edit: After deciding to get a refund for BG3 I learned that I had played a couple hours over the time limit for a refund, therefore, I kept playing and my frustration grew, until... I poked around on the community discussion forum, and specifically on a thread entitled ""story mode is b.s."" I should come as no surprise that there are numerous trolls and condescending gaming demi-gods injecting their own b.s. into the discussion but if you read through it there are a plethora of tips and tricks for anybody serious about figuring out game strategy and game mechanics. But probably the biggest thing that's made the game enjoyable is switching from keyboard and mouse controls to a game controller.  I still have issues with the camera mechanics, particularly when you are being attacked by mobs from overhead, and I still  maintain that if I had known this was a strategy/turn based combat game I would not have bought it in the first place. I am, however, getting a kick out of the whole D&D feel to the game. Overall I am definitely now enjoying the game and I'm switching my recommendation from a thumbs down to a qualified thumbs up. If it were stars I'd give it a three out of five.",1706995891,1708117493,True,0,0,0.5016213059425354,0,True,False,False

Quit and refunded after 30 minutes and bought BG3.

Obviously this game is one of the best games ever created.

My personal opinions on different aspects:
- playtime is roughly 5 times worth the price of a standard offline RPG which is very generous; makes about 2,5 times full playthroughs with unique content all the way up to the end.
- I am still surprised how they could implement so much high quality content without losing the red thread; speaks for a very well structured development process - or a very detailed preparation
- a bit too much rolling dices playtime for my taste with save and load time wasted my lifetime a bit but small criticism compared to what you get

Being a gamer for decades and following the game industry since SNES and PS1 era, my opinion about this game is very positive. This game raised the bar for the game industry, it's the new standard, just like Skyrim did more than 10 years ago. I'm sure that this style and some of the elements in this game will be copied over and over, even on other genres.

Talking about game design I think this game is just wonderful. Larian Studios, which I've been following since Divinity Original Sin 1, did an awesome work on transcribing the feeling of a tabletop RPG session to a CRPG game. The D&D system is not a revolutionary system nowadays, even though is the most known RPG system, but the way Larian implemented the system on a computer game is revolutionary because: 
[list]
[*]They put a good effort on optimizing and adding new capabilities to their engine (it's the same used in Divinity Original Sin series). You can explore the game on different ways, you can talk to people, reading books, you can use your spells to maybe reach places you normally couldn't, you can swap your party members to get other dialogue options, you can use yours skills to detect hidden items, passages, get to alternative entrances, etc. There are so many tricks the game don't tell you, you just need to explore and try different approaches.
[*]The narrative -which I think it is the most superb thing they done here- is fantastic, there are so many ways to approach the same situation, depending on many factors... Things you've done before, things you want to do, your class, your race, the time you spent to get there. When this game released I had a mind blown when talking about it with friends, they did so many different things, they took different routes, they had dialogues that I hadn't... The sense of discovery is powerful, it makes you want to replay it over and over again. 
[/list]
Maybe the most brilliant thing about this game is the fact that it could be as much complex and flexible as you want.
You're new to RPGs or CRPGs? Okay, you can play it on Explorer Mode, which is more focused on narrative and less combat. Also, the fact that you can handle many many many situations only using dialogues helps a lot. Still a great game.
Maybe you're already a RPG fan but new to CRPGs, and that's ok, you can play it and it will offer a challenging combat system that is rewarding to learn, plus the narrative that I already gave my compliments. Still a great game.
Maybe you're hardcore RPG gamer, you've played other CRPGs before: Tactician and Honor Mode will make your brain explode to get through some battles. You can play the entire game on turn mode if you want to. Still a great game.
In my opinion, that's why the game burst the CRPG bubble. For the CPRG community BG3 borned good game, it used a well known and established system (D&D), with a new narrative standard for the game industry, running on a well crafted engine, but the fact that this game is as much complex and flexible as you want made this game reach people outside the CRPG community.
The icing on the cake of course its the production. Its so clear and palpable the love the Larian put on this... They cared for the artwork, the voice acting, the narrative... They cared for the community, and this is so rare nowadays.
The game stayed in early access for 2 years before the release, Larian listened to the community, listened the feedbacks and bug reports since the beginning and still doing this, they still correcting bugs and implementing suggestions, hotfixes. The game has 0 micro transactions and requires internet just to download patches or to play coop with friends (I really suggest you do that), even being the most accessible game by Larian, it still have that pre-internet feeling, the game will make you read and pay attention to details, it may guide you sometimes but it doesn't have that tiktok-generation-UI-style with arrows blinking, interactive objects blinking, objectives popping up in the screen every minute. The game just let you enjoy and discover it at your own pace.
I think Larian represented the best in our RPG community, they really love what they do just as we love the games.
They showed the game industry that we, as players, just want to play, we don't want to pay for the game and pay for anything ""special"" inside the game store or any kind of ""additional content"", it's so simple and we lost it during the years. And if the game takes some time to release that's ok, if we see that the studio is putting an effort to make it better, we don't need to rush game releases, specially if they literally don't work.

My only negative opinion is the resource consumption and the fact that it's not optimized yet. Yes, it's not a light game, you'll need a relatively powerful PC to run it. Act 3 still bugged and an overly heavy act. You'll probably notice some FPS drops and you may find bugs during your adventure, if that's the case you always have the option to report these bugs to the developer and they will answer you, just like they did to me.

At the end of the day, this is one of the best games I've played in my entire life. Thank you.",1708113561,1708114250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now that I've played it a ton more, it is absolutely amazing. Probably my favorite video game of the last decade, perhaps even my favorite of all time. There are some things I don't like, mainly the inability to return to past acts, but honestly I can forgive it. Easily the best CRPG I've ever played, and that's saying something. I'm not going to lie to you, it is basically Divinity 2 Electric Boogaloo, But it really is that good. There are so many things I dislike about the game, genuinely, but it is so much fun that all the negatives don't matter. I think the main reason I enjoy the game as much as I do, is because It really feels like I can do what ever I want. I don't have to allow clearly villainous characters to live. Rest in pieces Lucretious your necrosexual ass will not be missed. 

10/10 Best game I've played in the last ten years. Mind you, I love CRPGS, so if you're not a fan of turn based games, it might be a 9.5/10 for you. Give it a try. Just do it. 

Positives 
++++ Karlach
+ Items and Gearing from DnD. Which means you basically never really out level that really cool weapon you found. Because even a +1 is still a good bonus enough bonus if the weapon has a cool ability.
+ Most of the companions are great.
+ Super Varied. Playing an Evil campaign is almost basically a different game. Sure the over arching story is similar, but the people you befriend and the encounters are different. 
+ Complete freedom. Don't like a character? Push em off the cliff. Don't want to fight someone? Convince them to allow their students to murder them instead!
+ Charisma is king.
+ Mind flayer powers are weird, but fun most of the time. 
+ Certain subclasses are way better than they are in the PHB.
+ Rangers don't suck!
+ You can go almost anywhere. Really high cliff? Fly! place that seems like you can't get to? Jump! Honestly I've been so impressed by how easily I can go places. 
+A certain Companion got a new ending!
+New After party scene is absolutely fantastic. 
Negatives
- Certain spells are completely neutered from 5e Like polymorph and fly.
- Swimming and Flying freely just don't exist.
- Not enough subclasses. They basically just use the PHB, which is a shame.
- No artificer!
- 12 level severely limits certain classes. Come on man, I just wanted my find greater steed. Which would have just worked like a pet, but gimme my gryphon damn it!
- Ranger pets are quite limited. I would have liked at least a couple more options. (Like a giant frog. Granted I'm biased as hell.)

Ultimately it won't change whether or not I recommend the game, because I do genuinely hope for a revival of expansive, branching single player experiences, but I can't pretend like the experience months later is the same as it was on release. There's been a huge amount of micromanaging the reactions and storylines of the origin characters, evidently based on continued feedback throughout the release...which is not how games are meant to work. Lae'zel should not get less abrasive based on post-release feedback. The game is out. It's over. What is the significance of these characters if their whole demeanour can be changed based on a handful of pissy forum posts?

But my biggest beef with the game at this point is that while Lae'zel has had her dialogue endlessly sanded down to make her less hostile, while Halsin has gotten a thousand iterations of kisses and his entire perspective on certain character events changed, while one of Astarion's endings has been made toothless and twee to prefer players who wanted the bad ending with none of the consequences, Wyll's fans have continuously pointed out very easy choke points for his character that remain entirely unaddressed or even acknowledged or discussed. His warlock patron hangs around camp, unable to be dismissed, even after you schedule the break of his contract. He is constantly treated like a monster by his father, a conflict which is resolved by his father going ""oopsie doopsie"" and Wyll insisting that he was never upset nor affected at all by this intimate betrayal by his only family. Wyll is turned into a devil in the early game, a change in model which is significant from his human form but not significant from the tiefling model. Unable to actually hear or read dialogue, fans assumed he was being mean to tiefling Tavs by being at all bothered by his forced transformation, and so rather than change the model at all they just cut a huge chunk of his dialogue where he talked about being too self-conscious to join the party.

Wyll, an origin character, doesn't have a sex scene. Halsin and Minthara, two side characters, do. Mizora, his primary antagonist who again, you cannot remove from your camp, does. My entire experience with the act 3 Wyll romance has been triggering his final romance scene entirely without warning or prompt (he didn't even have the ! over his head, I just went to talk to him and it triggered) which has ended with rolling around on the ground fully clothed and an abrupt cut back to the inn we were staying in. He doesn't kiss you in the epilogue. Larian seems to have entirely given up on him, which is frustrating as we receive roughly ten thousand micro-patches to [checks notes] change a missable note that a major antagonist writes to a dead npc that's hidden in his basement to cut the erotic content. To this day I don't know why anyone's brain power was dedicated to that when Wyll's quest never seems entirely sure whether his father is dead or alive at any given moment.

It's been disheartening to learn as patches roll out that Wyll's major issues are going to go entirely unaddressed, while everyone else's character remains in constant flux depending on how a handful of people react to them. The game released in August, and again I have to ask: what significance do any of these characters have if they are either in a constant state of change depending on what players prefer, or else entirely ignored? What are they telling me about the plot? The latest patch notes contained a note about how Lae'zel can be told to make her own decisions post-Netherbrain: Wyll will not personally chose whether or not he leaves his father for dead, or renews his contract with his patron. YOU have to choose. There's not even an option to ask him to choose and then to have him bounce the decision back to you, or even for him to ask you to choose because he can't in the first place (which would also suck, but would at least address that he's the only companion with no real agency in his personal quest), YOU decide whether to kill your friend's dad to get him out from under the thumb of his patron: a decision with NO consequences, as you can save his dad anyway, he never loses his warlock powers unless you manually respec him, and, I cannot stress this enough, MIZORA WILL NOT LEAVE MY CAMP.

Ultimately I truly hope they never make another game like they've made this one. I was excited about this game in EA and curious to uncover all the possible branches on release. Now, I just want to experience a story that Larian wrote instead of the Larian forums.",1695231896,1708113142,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game wants you to be creative, it rewards you for thinking outside the box and outsmarting the DM. It's a game that almost never says no and encourages to go with whatever crazy idea you might have.
If you think that you can cheese a fight you most likely can - hoard explosive barrels and end the fight in one turn? Sure. Polymorph the boss into a sheep and shove him into the void? Why not. Exploit a very specific magical item to kill enemies by doing literally nothing? Go for it.

When a game makes you think about the characters, the choices you've made, the choices you still want to make, the next place you'll want to explore, and the overall progression of the story AFTER you've closed the game and maybe you're in bed or away from home and you can't wait to play again, then something is going terribly right.

This game attracts you in a way that I have rarely felt in anything, it is a different experience, a different reality, it is your own life seen through the eyes of the narrator and your character. You and your character are one.

I'm not a D&D player myself. That's why I barely know the rules, but the game gives you enough information to orient yourself and over time you learn things ""playfully"".

The world in the game seems so incredibly alive. You never feel like you're ""working on"" quests because even the quest log is written with written hints, as if you were taking notes on things yourself.

Wandering around the world, you discover something interesting around every corner and get distracted by something on the way to a quest and then you poke around here and there and suddenly half an hour has passed and you have to remember where you're really going. because you've discovered a hidden place that you absolutely wanted to explore ""just briefly.""

Another point to highlight are the characters. It feels like traveling with ""people who live and feel."" When you go around the world, depending on the combination you make in the group, people also have things to talk about with each other, some understand each other and joke, others get angry, comments are made here and there. It looks ""real."" And I don't even want to start with the personal relationships you make with your colleagues. Sometimes you forget that it's just a pre-programmed game.

And then the moral choices you have to make! A simple encounter with an NPC can trigger a powerful story that will leave you not knowing who to believe. Should you believe anyone and who you help and who you don't? Should you help anyone at all? Everything is possible, nothing is mandatory. The possibilities seem endless.

Basically, I just started playing (I'm 30 hours into the game) and I've only seen part of the world so far, I can't even begin to imagine what it will be like when I get to town.

I'm sure I've forgotten a number of things I'd like to praise. Come to think of it, I really don't know how I'm going to justify buying another full-price game in the future given the quantity and, more importantly, the quality you get for what you spend here. I know... it hurts to spend such a large amount of money, but $20,000 (about €60) for this game is really not enough when you see what you get (a finished game with hardly any bugs, nothing to buy through DLC, without microtransactions, you don't have to be in a season pass every month thereafter). You get a game that is just plain fun.

I could have given a thumbs up and left it at that. That's a good thing because no one will read this review anyway. But this GOTY deserves as many words as possible about it. I haven't even begun to do it justice, I could talk about it for much longer.

If you even just enjoy dating sims, I feel like you'd still love this game. This game is really worth it, and worth your time. My only complaint is with the customization; it is good, but you can only pick from presets for the face. You can't edit individual things like the height of the eyes, for example, or the type of nose, another example. I also feel like there could be more options with things like eye colours, tattoos, makeup, and piercings. I'd love to see an all-white eye colour! I'd also love to see things like face piercings other than nose piercings, or even having different categories for piercings, like an ear piercing category, a nose piercing category, etc. Or, where you could choose mulitple piercings.

Insane replayability? Check.

The general experience I'm having is ""early access, but polished graphics"". As you can see I have over 200 hours in EA and approximately 50 hours on ""Full Release""

The game plays like a lazy Dungeon Master who doesn't keep notes and is railroading you the heck out of it. The main beef I got with the game is that I make choices, and not a second later the game will COMPLETELY IGNORE SAID CHOICES... One of the many examples is *SPOILERS AHEAD* Last Light Inn. This corrupted winged Flaming Fist is coming to abduct the Selunite priestess, his minions knock her out, and suddenly the game cuts off mid encounter to give me a cutscene of my WHOLE PARTY witnessing the dude abducting the priestess, then even further proceeds on taking my party out of the Inn without any reason at all. Furthermore I explicitly DID NOT say anything about the Gith Artefact in my party's possession to the Harper Leader inside the inn, yet in future conversations she knows for some reason. I reset to my last save outside the inn, I defeat the ex-flaming fist, then get a quest for The Urge to kill the Selunite. I kill her, and guess what? The game pops a cutscene with my whole party strolling out of the Inn while the magic shield perishes and discusses with the Harper Leader the death of the priestess. Like, why? I didn't want to do any of that. I just wanted to stealth kill her and get out...

So it's a no from me.

EDIT#1

I keep getting softlocked in various situations. **********SPOILERS**********

Softlock number 1: During my fight with Ketheric down the Elder Brain Lair I defeated the Apostle of Myrkul, Astarion was at 0 hp, therefore when the battle ended he was waiting for Help Action. I made the mistake of thinking he was dead and Used the portal. Astarion remains behind and now I have to manually go walking again down the whole Mind Flayer colony just to help action the dude then proceed on helping him. Tedious.

Soflock number 2: I just reached the outskirts of Baldur's Gate, I jumped down a warehouse and got arrested for trespassing. For some reason only the selected character is taken to prison, where I have no idea where it is, therefore I can't manually go walking down there. Now I'm down to prison with Karlach and I'm trying to talk to the NPC guards where none of them wants to talk to me and I'm doomed inside the cell without being able to do nothing. 
 Somehow the guard outside opens the door, and I'm casually walking out of the cell and then attacks me saying fugitives will be killed on sight. I'm finding this a good opportunity to kill Karlach then ressurect her, but the problem with me not having my items as Karlach is the mule of the party remains. I'm fighting the guards and manage to kill Karlach, but she is put back in the cell at 1 HP. No dying for my barb... I then decide to enter the warehouse again. I'm getting arrested, again for some reason only the selected character goes to jail, which is my caster... I manage to kill all of the 4 guards and get them in front of the prison cell with Telekinesis, so I can loot them, which I do, but none of the keys work on my cell. Softlocked again. Thanks Larian.

ΕDIT#2

Having finished the game I have to say Act 3 was a dreadful experience in itself. A buggy mess with obviously way too much cut content, exactly as DOS:2. Ultimately every single decision I made kept being undermined, having Shar's Army and being the Chosen of Bhaal meant literally NOTHING. Oh, sorry you can summon 5 NPCs who will cast cantrips. Also, it was a no show for the cult of Bhaal. Side quests kept becoming meaningless one after the other. Also dreadfully directed. Seeing my Characters who can all fly struggle being kept by the spine of the Elder Brain kept destroying my brain cells. 

Larian should be ashamed for releasing this game. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Borderline Scammers...

ΕDIT#3

This is by no means any factual reason as to not get the game, just a personal frustration I'm experiencing.

While Larian will keep updating and adding content to a ""finished product"" Ι'm here not being able to download any new patch further on because the SSD the game is on is full (Don't have access to a bigger disk), exceeding the announced size of the game. One would argue that adding new content is good, but the truth is they just extended the EA period and outed and unfinished game, which by no means will get fixed by any amount of polishing because there's a shitton cut content in Act 3 and the general plot starts falling on its own right after Act 2. 

Act 1, as good as it is, feels like an entirely different game, it's design is grand and ambiguous, but the reality is that Larian's choice to use this variant of the Divinity Engine for such a grand sequel as Baldur's Gate 3 probably made them give 0 shits about the General storytelling and the implications a high level adventure taking place in Faerun carry. Wizards suck, spellcasting is butchered in this game because it would be an enormous strain implicating what a Wizard is capable of doing in this engine, hence why verticality doesn't exist, because Larian chose comfort making a cosplay DOS game instead of making a Baldur's Gate game. 

EDIT#4

The game hasn't fixed itself and its pretty apparent it will not be doing so, at all. The way the game was marketed was borderline scammy, a very huge chunk of the game which is Baldur's Gate upper city will not make the cut, ever, and it's pretty apparent that the game is further catered for horny teenagers which is sad. 

Here is an article pretty much summarising my thoughts on why this game is garbage and why I regret ever spending these hours, mostly on EA hoping my engagement in the forums will be taken seriously.

https://www.themarysue.com/the-game-just-fundamentally-undermines-itself-game-designer-breaks-down-baldurs-gate-3s-most-fatal-flaws/
 
This is not an industry staple, games SHOULD BE fully developed upon release, even more so when there were under early access for almost 3 years. I prompt everyone to go to Larian's forums and witness for yourselves the absolute abscess of developer presence during EA, the engagement people had giving serious feedback, and also the gaslighting given by comm representatives, which made their appearance during the last months of EA, to the people trying to engage with the devs. Still a no, Larian is not a saviour nor a great studio. This is a model for Larian as BG3's development is mirrored in DoS games as well. Borderline scammers.

exploration/open world
turn based battle that focuses on strategy 
the Story line so far
The Characters

The majority of characters in this game (companions or NPC's) have unique stories and personalities. Different and sometimes morally challenging choices keep dialogue fresh and exciting throughout the game and choices made do often have an impact to how the story plays out. 
Combat feels very good in terms of difficulty. On normal encounters are difficult enough to require thinking about the situation and the next move to make. Once you know how the game works the higher difficulties will keep challenging you to think of new strategies.

After that being said I would also like to exert some criticism: 

Act 3 looses a lot of the games drive. I manage to get to level 12 at the beginning of Act 3 very consistently and then it feels like everything I do in Act 3 is just prolonging the end of the game. Maybe partly to that a lot of quest lines that sound very interesting become ""well let's just do this quickly before closing out the game"". 

Having romance options in a game is fine but in BG3 it feels very forced. You are constantly being pressed toward romance dialogue without really being able to avoid it. I would like to just not be bothered with long cut scenes and multiple dialogue choices by almost every party member. Personally I would like it if the player had to initiate romance.

Congratulations, then you have found your very happy final resting place. It is so vast & so complete & filled with surprising side-quests, easter-eggs & countless hilarious NPCs, that at some point it does really feel as if you'd spent all your life there already. As regards the gameplay & technical realisation, it is simply Divinity II perfected. And what more could one ever wish for? In early early access I felt a little anxious that the D&D-ruleset might conflict with Larian/D2 mechanics but instead it rather feels like D&D was perfected, too. By implementing those actual dice-rolls as a fully-animated part of the gameplay-flow, devs have really managed to destill the best from both worlds. Is there anything left to wish for? Yes, even more dialogue, please. Especially in the personal relationships with the companions it can feel dull at times after a while. But, naturally, you can only pack so many hours of soundlines into a game, & the sheer amount of quotes does not lack, admittedly. Also, individual situational quotes of each character can be discovered in replay-sessions, which is certainly huge fun. It is just in the inbetweens, where it can still feel lonely due to lack of anything but the ever same line to talk about. You will also have the same troubles to keep any overview over all those thrillions of items in you inventory as in any Larian game, but that's a ok. Nostalgia makes up for the boredom of sorting sessions. Fully recommended for old-school Roleplayers, BG- & NWN-veterans & puzzle-fans. Not recommended for grinders. This is a game where you want to read journal-entries AND dialogue-lines AND in-game documents. Or you will really get lost & eventually no longer understand what is going on at all.

I played World of Warcraft for 10 years, and the Zelda series is my favorite of all time, and I've found BG3 to another game I can play over and over again. I didn't complete all of the available story content on my first play through, and it still felt like a complete and satisfying story. I'm on my second play through now, and having done all of the side quests this time, I've just grown to love the game even more. The ability to play as origin characters, the changes in the story based on your romance options, and the changes in dialogue based on your race/class all make this game immersive and fun each time you play. Knowledge of Dungeons and Dragons or the rest of the Baldur's Gate series isn't necessary at all to play and enjoy this game. 

I will say that anyone that is fairly new to gaming will have a bit more of a learning curve to learn some of the most basic functions of this game. While the tutorial is very helpful, it does still demand a level of game literacy not every player will come to the game with. Guides online will help bridge that gap in knowledge, but there's nothing to teach people that they can pick up and move objects in the world in real time. Basic things like that gamers take for granted are missing in the instructions, but I suppose that's also part of the fun of figuring a puzzle out during a game like this.

At the risk of sounding like a Larian Fanboy, this is the best game to come out since Original Sin 2, this is a ""proper"" RPG where choices are properly tracked and things can actually come and bite you in the backside, sometimes to hilarious effect, not only is this a fantastic RPG but it's an amazing DND game, it's a hoarders paradise (thank you to whoever implemented the ""send to camp"" button, much love) and while the stealing in the game is a little broken right now, I cannot help myself every time I come across a trader. Only about 30 hours in so far but the story is compelling and I'm massively enjoying it and i'm enjoying the pace as I like to take things a little slow and explore everywhere and do every side quest and collect everything I can first time around.

If you even remotely like RPG's or DND, you MUST buy this game, if you cannot stand turn based then maybe don't but other than that you can't go wrong.

Only thing that has remotely annoyed me is sometimes when I am trying to attack someone in combat and I click as my character is moving it will update the path and sometimes make them travel there rather than attack because the camera is moving with the character who is being controlled.

- Fully voice acted (minus player character) which adds a lot of immersion
- Play how you want -> can be creative, can be straightforward, can be good natured, can be evil, lots of options. A proper RPG (but its not a sandbox, so be mindful)
- Mostly bug free. At the time of writing this I have not encountered any game breaking bugs, only some minor glitches and items/skills not working correctly, but it has not been a major issue
- Visually stunning

Negatives:
- Some performance issues in Act 3 (framedrops, weird textures)
- With so many paths available, FOMO is real and its easy to get overwhelmed when starting Act 3
- Some classes/subclasses feel underpowered compared to others
- Might be hard to get into without prior knowledge of tabletop RPGs or similar mechanics
