[b] Cons; [/b] [list]
[*] Story is more geared toward elementary school kids.
[*] Environment is too bright because there's no longer a dark, poorly lit ocean. Every area is instantly seen without a flashlight.
[*] They copied roughly 95% of plant and animal life and simply changed the color pallet to something less aesthetically pleasing.
[*] This game is supposed to be in the arctic, but virtually everything underwater shows almost no sign of an arctic ocean. In the first Subnautica, you could watch the discovery channel in a tropical ocean and play this game feeling as if they copied that real-life environment. In Subnautica 2, the conversation made no since. There's just as many plants, if not more in an arctic environment than the tropical.

the game has long since come out.

but in short, honestly its just mediocre.

theres no single thing i can point at and go 'this is bad' but everything except for the textures feels like original subnautica but worse.

its just... lesser.


the game is less dangerous, like you arent surviving anymore, and reuses hostile wildlife more.

it has far less 'fear of the ocean', the moments where you gotta go down but you cant see the bottom so you descend into the inky blackness.

the map is smaller (by 60% aprox). 

the map is less deep (by 30% aprox). 

the map has less biomes.

oxygen is far too lenient considering how shallow the waters are. 

i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to find ""the drop"", like how once you reach the red grass area near the jelly cave in the original game everything starts getting much deeper.

the new writer scrapped the whole story midway in production and it show. the writing is not great, the plot we got was the worst of both worlds and full of nonsense.

In the real world most people struggle to make the best product possible. Most fail and you never notice them.
Here you have a company that created a masterpiece (original Subnautica) but instead of continuing to take their craft seriously they release this.

The core is still visible and don't get me wrong ... there are parts that are even better than in the first game. For example I really enjoyed exploring some caves where you need to refill your O2 while diving. The original version had this mechanic too but it was not utilised in like you never had to use that.

The negative parts include the story riddled with woke identity politics, a colored ""body type 2"" bad-ass main protagonist, children acting as scientists on a harsh ice planet, a PDA with an Indian text-to-speech accent, the stupid Spy Pengling that is needed to harvest fur, a vegetarian game option, ...

It isn't a death blow, but the developers did some brave things, and not all of them paid off.  The original was quiet - the character didn't speak at all, and any recording or evidence of another human being was precious.  The player felt alone, and I found myself hording odd items just to make my base feel ""lived in"" - but, there was also a strange peacefulness to the silence.  In Sub-Zero, you're a can-do woman with things to say, but she was given some pretty substandard lines by the writers.  Her voice acting is passable, but there is an ongoing dialogue between her and another character (the ancient alien) which is so foolish and flat, it's genuinely bad for the game. The conversation comes through often enough that you lack that feeling of quietude that made the original so special. 

The overall ""quest"", however, is interesting - you're on a mission to discover what happened to your sister, who was assigned to a corporate scientific team on a frozen planet, but all communication went dark.  It's good stuff.  Yet, it can be challenging to know where to go next, and this game doesn't guide the player as neatly as the original.  Pacing isn't really a thing, and it can be all too easy to miss something small, but critical, especially when first getting the lay of the land.  Still, this could be a feature instead of a bug if you don't like having your hand held by the designers.  No matter your preference, though, the original should be played first.  This shouldn't be anybody's introduction to Subnautica.

The additional items and structures added to the game are only sometimes an improvement on the original - I'm sad but understanding of the omission of the full-base-sized submarine from the original, but the sea-truck cannot hold a candle to the Seamoth (the single seat submarine from Subnautica I) in terms of appeal.  On the other hand, the recent inclusion of a new base structure that allows a truck with multiple modules to dock completely is VERY well done.  Whoever designed that?  Hats off to you.

In summary, Sub-Zero was an attempt by the designers to add some fresh ideas to the original, but not everything was an improvement - the dialogue was poorly executed, and navigating some of the three-dimensional mazes are a clinic in frustration, but despite these painful hurdles, Subnautica as well as Sub-Zero are deeply evocative, stirring experiences, and should be explored.  Just, for this title, maybe wait for a sale.

Then all of the plants and stuff that lays on the ground just stopped appearing, meaning the entire ground was just a flat empty pile of sand and rocks. The plants would randomly pop back into existence for a while then leave again. Then it got worse when all the fish and mineral rocks stopped spawning, meaning literally the entire ocean was empty and I couldn't collect anything. 
Then because it somehow could get worse, one of the biomes just didn't render right, and it was just pure white. Like I was swimming around in a grayish rocky area, then BOOM, hard line dividing the biome I'm in and the next one and it's just pure white.

while it definitely isn't as vast and as captivating as the original subnautica, i would still recommend it once it goes on sale. it is a new experience for returning subnautica players and offers some truly beautiful environments and excellent creatures. although...

i can't deny that the on-land game mechanics feel undeveloped. it still genuinely feels like a chore to climb up land and get over ledges, and once you play the game for long enough, you wonder why the snowfox even exists when you can just use the prawn suit with the grappling hook upgrade. the freezing mechanics don't help with the fact that land exploration in subnautica is already far less dynamic compared to sea exploration, which only makes the game feel more like a chore than an adventure. additionally, some of the animations outright look unfinished and overall weak.

as for the storytelling aspects of this game; i overall felt underwhelmed by them. by far my favorite part has to be the exploration of the architect race and ALAN, as it only further develops the intricacies of the species and dives deeper into the unknown universe of subnautica. not to mention, there are a few well written interactions between the characters which i found pretty entertaining. as for the rest of the story, though? it feels like a weak rehash of the original, being told in a far less interesting way. in the original subnautica, a major focus was put on the player themselves, the mystery of the universe, and naturally piecing together the story by observing and interacting with the environment. in subnautica: below zero, it feels like you are just listening to a voice actor do their job in the studio due to how the game presents itself, and when you add the fact that the environmental storytelling is far less subtle than the original, these elements really remove the sense of wonder and mystery that the original game had.

if you have never played a subnautica game before, definitely play and finish the first before playing this one. by no means is this game awful, but the first game simply delivers a better experience for players than this one does in my opinion.",1678210404,1708126666,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story line is captivating and the voice acting really helps that. The only main thing I'd really criticize is that leviathans are much to easy to avoid and don't have as many unique ways of attacking or getting in your way then I'd like. As well, I think this game has less of a sense of wonder then the first. Idk if that's just because the player is used to this world by the second game or if it's because the environments aren't as awe-inspiring.

The constant droning of way to frequent, annoyingly long and quite frankly uninteresting audiologs contributes to the same factor as well as making sure you never feel alone, while the feeling of being alone was to me one of the factors that really drove said lasting atmosphere of the first game home. The first game was a masterclass in how reduced design makes a world feel natural & believable - after all reality isn't constructed to be visually entertaining either - just to be all the more intense when you break that scheme at the end to slowly lead the player into very otherwordly setpieces.

I still despise the new PDA voice, I turned the voicelines down to 20%. I actually went through and beat the game this time and I'm changing this to a Yes for the story.

I have accepted I am never going to finish this game. The map design is irritating and difficult to navigate. The land areas in particular are labyrinthine with winding paths and multiple levels of elevation and are very annoying to deal with, especially during the scavenger hunt the game sends you on. (Way too much time spent on land for a series originally centered around deep sea exploration.) The flora & fauna are pretty similar to the first game but the hostile creature designs were lackluster and are rarely seen in the game, especially compared to the first one where reapers are a frequent threat. There are some very minor improvements to the base building system (basically just a larger room option) but it feels like this game is riding on the coattails of a successful standalone game. There is very little in this game that I consider successful that wasn't imported from the first game.

I became entirely dependent on walkthroughs to progress the story because after a while I wasn't getting dialogue triggers or objectives telling me what to do. Not sure if this is a bug, related to me accidentally finding a plot point out of order, or if the game really does leave you dead in the water later in the story. I put a decent number of hours into this game but most of them were not fun - lots of time backtracking for specific resources, traveling back and forth across the map looking for objectives the game wasn't marking for me,  and carefully following walkthroughs to try and figure out what I missed.",1707936159,1707936159,False,1,0,0.508620679378509521,0,True,False,False

""But why do so many people who enjoyed the original also enjoy hating Below Zero?"" You may ask.

Because there's a certain expectation with a new game in a series to follow things exactly as they are done in the previous games of the series. Innovation tends to be punished when a developer deviates from an original formula.

I think BZ is better than Subnautica in many ways, but that's just my opinion. I'll try to outline why I think that way though.

The first is obviously narrative. Subnautica had little to no story, with only a silent protagonist and drop pod messages probing you to explore deeper to uncover what happened. That's fine, the focus of the games is different (and this is why I think so many people hate BZ, but I'll explain that in a bit). While the original focused more on exploration and the fear of the unknown, the sequel wants to tell a story within the world that was built in Subnautica. The voice actors are good, the story is decently written (imo), and the way it unfolds is similar to the original in that you will receive clues at certain intervals (this time from a character that the MC interacts with instead of because of dead drop pod messages). Overall the story is better (imo), and it's given life with just a few characters. A few of the people (not all of them) I've seen complain about the story generally seemed to hate the characters as people rather than giving any legitimate complaints about story. It boils down to insults including vague things like ""boring"" and ""annoying"", then going to the weird like ""too many women"" or ""too g@y"" (Yeah, some people actually wanted to make those complaints). It's fine not to like the characters and judge the game based on that, everyone is entitled to their opinions (and this is just mine). Just know that there are certain biases tainting those opinions (everyone has biases, including me).

The second is the world. Subnautica was about the fear of the unknown, unexplored areas, and mysterious dangers. The world was vast, sometimes dark, and often incredibly scary. This worked well when you first play the game, but after that it's incredibly predictable. On a second play through of the game I found myself jumping out of vehicles and knifing leviathans until they died after I stunned them. You can do this in BZ too, it's just not as interesting to do so because the world is more interesting than the fear (imo). You see, with the original the biomes eventually became large open spaces (for a specific reason that I'll get into next) that didn't hold much more than a few resources and one or two leviathans to keep you away from the borders. In BZ each biome has lots of interesting creatures, plants, and resources. Things are more abundant and the world feels alive. I always thought it was a little weird in the first game that a MASSIVE space conglomerate like Alterra came to a planet to strip mine it while I'm struggling to find enough resources to build a SINGLE base under water. The story in Subnautica tried to hand wave that away, but it was only vaguely successful in doing so. The original felt too *dead* to me for the story it wanted to tell. BZ is tightly packed with tidbits of info everywhere, and the environments are better at telling that story too (imo).

Finally there's the vehicles. I don't know if people are romanticizing the Seamoth and the Cyclops from the first game but this is where I adamantly disagree with a lot of people who don't like BZ. The Seamoth, while useful in the original, actually only had one purpose: faster exploration. Well, two if you count ""getting away from leviathans"" as another. Because aside from arriving somewhere quicker without running out of oxygen, it was essentially useless. In the beginning bumping into a small fish could cause you to lose 10 percent of your hull, never mind bumping into a spire or getting grabbed by a leviathan. I found myself repairing my Seamoth more than actually travelling in my first play through until I found the hull upgrade. Which is just a waste of an upgrade slot honestly. The Cyclops... Oh, the Cyclops. An unwieldy and even more annoying ""vehicle."" The open and dead spaces I mentioned earlier were probably meant to allow you to traverse them using the Cyclops... Because if it wasn't as open it would be an even bigger nightmare to maneuver that thing than it already was. Not to mention that if you're using the cyclops it's to get somewhere really dangerous... but you'll have to be jumping out to knock off fish hiding on the hull and sucking your power or to repair the Cyclops hull... or even putting out fires if it's your first time piloting it without a specific upgrade. Less fun, more micromanaging, much more annoying. The Sea-Truck is a good cross between the Seamoth and the Cyclops. You have more speed if you detach the modules, a sturdier hull than the Seamoth, more maneuverability than the Cyclops (which also works better in the tighter and more focused environments), and finally, it's not annoying to drive it.

Below Zero isn't trying to be Subnautica 1.5, which is what I see a lot of people wanting. It would be impossible to reclaim that success, especially with how Subnautica relied on the fear of the unknown. I think the developers understood that many second time players were going to find it predictable thanks to how things worked in Subnautica so they wouldn't be as afraid as they were in the first game. People probably would have complained about that as well, and I think they knew that. It's a ""d**ned if you do, d**ned if you don't"" scenario honestly.

If you think a game that's set in the same world as Subnautica but *isn't* exactly like Subnautica doesn't appeal to you, then the first game still exists. You can definitely replay that, and it would probably make you happier than this game.

To someone looking for something fun and a little different than the original, well, dive right in, the water's warm.",1706551551,1707581222,True,140,5,0.824032425880432129,10,True,False,False

Personally wished this was more of a sequel than a sub mini sequel, prawn suit feels nerfed compared to the first game, can't swing like underwater spider-man as you could in the first game which bothers me but I guess it was done to push the new sea truck which was an interesting idea.

I appreciate the attempt at a more direct story line whereas the first game was much more of a ""figure it out and explore"" kind of game, Below Zero is also somewhat the same but has a more direct story as well with characters and a voiced MC which I wasn't a fan of, MC felt bland and basic and so did the story. Could of been more with more in depth characters and personality but it's kind of just ""Oh no my sister"" rinse repeat and the cure stuff we already had in the first game.

Still enjoyed it for the game play but the story was lacklustre and not as good as it's predecessor. Just could of been much more really.

I'm going to cry.

I loved the first Subnautica.  It was the ocean exploration game I'd always dreamed of.  The creatures were beautiful in sound and in design.  The story unfolded through your exploration.  The world felt so big and alive.  It was an immersive (lol) experience near perfection, especially for an aquatic science nerd like me.

Then they decided to make Below Zero.  And somehow - either through incompetence or spite, because there's no way this was done through ignorance - they took everything that people loved and replaced it with the parts that people hated.

Namely, the biggest change: instead of exploration driving the story, story drives the exploration.  This sounds great on paper, but is terrible in execution.  Mainly because the game utilizes Forspoken-style dialogue long before Forspoken made it noticeable.  You know the reveal in Subnautica when [spoiler]you try to deactivate the gun, only to be told you are infected and the planet is in quarantine[/spoiler]?  How the player is given that much information and then gives them time to realize the situation?  If it were this game's writers, [spoiler]Robin would have shouted ""Quarantine?  Infected?  Oh, this isn't good.  I need to find a cure and fast!"" and Alan might have chimed in with a ""I concur.  Time is of the essence, for the infection spreads quickly.""[/spoiler]  That's the game.  [i]You[/i] don't get to decide how you feel about the situation you are in.  The game will tell you what you need to feel.  It will tell you where to go next.  And it will rip you out of your immersion every time.  [spoiler]Also I [i]hate[/i] that they brought back Margeruite.  Ruins the Degasi storyline just to give people fanservice, because people decided that people who kill wildlife indiscriminately are cool.  I never liked Marge.  And I don't like that she's here.  Especially since her presence amounts to NOTHING.[/spoiler]

Creature design is a step down.  They don't look or act like beings adapted to their environment, as the critters in the first game did.  They look and act like beings adapted to be in a videogame.  The predators have looks and sounds that demand the audience be scared of them.  Its the same effect as a man in costume chasing you in a haunted house screaming ""OOGA BOOGA BOOGA.""  The Leviathans don't deliver the same awe or terror as the ones in the first game; again, the designs try to hard to be spooky.  Honestly, the only design I encountered that I liked were the sea monkeys.  And even then, they're overanimated to the point of parody.  

The only thing this game did better than the first was base building options.  You can build a huge underwater house with rooms, rather than a bunch of circular modules.  These options lead to a much more homier base that looks more refined.  But they added a lot of that back to Subnautica, so there is really absolutely no reason to get this game.

If I sound unusually harsh, its because this is a franchise I care about.  I bought this game day one of Early Access.  I remember when Robin was a researcher sending samples to her sister Sam up on a satellite [spoiler]which would lead to Robin accidentally sending a live Kharaa sample, needing to find and befriend Sea Emperors to save the research station (or at least, that was the theory)[/spoiler], and when [spoiler]Alan[/spoiler] was a prick who warmed up to life [spoiler]and was heavily implied to end up getting put in a Warper body[/spoiler].  It was cozy and a great base line for an unfolding story set in a growing frozen world.  It was all about research and exploration, just like what I wanted.  And they THREW IT ALL OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE I DONT KNOW.  I genuinely do NOT know what they were going for.  And the final result is such an obnoxious, hand-holdy, unimmersive experience.

Here's hoping the true Subnautica 2 will be a return to form.  I shudder to think of the result if they decide to do the whole ""throw out the parts people liked and buckle down on what they didnt"" cycle again.",1707017200,1707017200,False,60,1,0.699213325977325439,0,True,False,False

That said, however, this game does lack with its story. The story is a bit bland, doesn't make much sense, and has too much direction. The original Subnautica was a masterpiece, you were thrown into the deep end (literally) and had to figure everything out yourself. This is the opposite, and in that regard, it fails. Subnautica is renowned for its ""Leviathans"", the scariest aspect of the game, but Below Zero offers very little with regards to this. Only 1 real 'true' leviathan within the waters, and only 1 real 'deep' location to explore.

I can only hope that with the sequel that is coming, they take the visual aspects of Below Zero but return to their roots of Subnautica... No dialogue, No direction, a vast open ocean, and depths that really challenge your decision making. With new and spine chilling leviathans.

All said though, I would recommend picking this game up on sale, as it does offer some hours of fun. And even if the story does lack, exploring the beautiful sea is very calming.",1706963266,1706963266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How to play the game: start, ignore the normal modes and select custom -> disable story. As mentioned in game's description, this mode will disable steam achievements but at least the game is more enjoyable like the 1st one. But you can always start the game and you get the idea if you like with or without the story withing minutes.

If steam had one of those ""maybe"" instead of a ""yes"" ""no"", i would have chosen that... This game is more meant to attract mainstream users than to offer a sequel to what fans of the 1st game loved.

Like: the MC is voiced!... you know what I realised? MC voice was a mistake. Why? Well if MC was voiceless = they could add the option to create your own character, regardless of gender, race, colour, it doesn't matter. Why? because all of this elements Don't even matter in this game.

If you look on the ""cut out content"" wiki and similar stuff that where not added in the 1st game, you will realise this game, is much smaller exactly to add as many of those cut stuff as possible. In the 1st game, iirc, they wanted 2 glacier ares, but wasn't added.... so now you have a game featuring the whole events in an arctic ocean... ruining already the ""explore the deep ocean"" because: you are to focused on the weather (another added cut out), so above it's not a safe space. You go under? it's just caves and caves and more caves, you get claustrophobic at most, but you feel no sense of deep since the caves are small, so you go down and instantly get to ""bottom"", like a ""L"" tunnel....  Anyone who finished the 1st game, know what I mean since the end game areas ruing the atmosphere of ""going down in the deep dark endless ocean"" as well You even forget you are in the ocean.... or fish.... well this game is fairly similar

Copy paste for so many elements that where not added in the 1st game that where added here (like weather), so of course this game is much smaller.



Exploring: You get very annoyed that there are tons and tons of small equipment, the same one, over and over again. Aka to create a use for the scanner since there isn't as much in this game

Now, the best part this game did: Seatruck. Why? it's small so you can go into the caves, like very small. And being a truck, you can add more units..... except... whoever decided the storage unit should never be in charge of game decisions ever again.... Once thing I hated even with the 1st game: Fasting time to go back and forth since inventory is full. So getting said truck extension for storage was my #1 priority. I needed to explore everywhere to get items and more, and of course, need to go back and forth since inventory is full. Finally I found where to find the blueprints but aggressive and dangerous enemy and traps. Due to again, the whole, going back and forth due to inventory, missing equipment, new ways to protecting and more, it took like what? 1 -2 hours? to get all of them while trying to not die. Finally got the blueprints.... they need resources that I had no clue where they are.... finally got all of them.... what do I get? One of the most horrible storage units ever. It's like the devs are trying to punish you for wanting this. Imagine there are 3 different shape and types inside. so instead of using 100% of the wall, they just trowed different size for reasons only they know. And all of them have very small storage... one of them has only 12 space... it actually makes me wish that unit was a wall, so i could add a wall storage that gives me 30 space. And of course, because it's such a little space, you need to go back and forth between them when moving stuff, only all of them having the ""naming"" screen so you will end up pressing that one to many times. I don't know how far I am in the game, but I honestly wish there is something better because this storage unit would be the most perfect think for this game to allow player to collect as much resources as they need without wasting real life going back and forth. But hey! if you collect more materials you can create and attach more! how wonderful, if it was not for the speed penalty so you ending up wasting as much real life time driving the long with tons of important storage space, as you would going back and forth full speed (and this with a non stocking module to increase speed). So you guessed it, the dev themselves ruined one of the best aspects of this game but punishing players to actually try and use new features. Then they wonder why no one touch most of the stuff in this game (look at global %), after all, you need tons of space to transport all the needed resourced and equipment.... something that would NOT be an issue if a certain green storage box had a massive storage size, or connected to a warehouse or similar, but nope, small storage, to make some people happy that the game is realistic instead of enjoyable

End of story question: why are every last game developers obsessed with limited inventory? guess what, it makes us NOT use a lot of the stuff you add in the game exactly because we have no space to carry them for when we could use them and no one will go back just to get them. Even games that have stacked, the always put 99 max. Regardless what SIFI in game explanation, if everything collected, would go in an infinity inventory, accessible any time if you need to use something, create or build, games like this one would get rid of a lot of unnecessary game element that just ruins the idea of exploring, collecting and utilising everything game has to offer.",1706762384,1706935452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I definitely recommend playing the first game first. This game has some slight improvements in gameplay but still has the same core. It also came with some of Subnautica's flaws. The game has a small hotbar, clunky inventory and there are some parts of the story where I feel like its easy to get lost. 

The world is still beautiful, deep and interactive. There are very interesting creatures that make up the world and their lives and interactions give the world life and interesting gameplay interactions. I do find the large predators less interesting then the Original but there are many more interesting small and medium creatures. 

The world building of the first game really helps with setting up the story for this game. The story is a little more direct and I feel like it was done well. There are good characters and interesting twists. 

There are several base additions that are really fun. Making your base a home with comforts and some fun stuff really helps balance out from the exploration.

[h3] On the surface [/h3]
Generally speaking, it's good.
The general gameplay feels nice and exploration feels mostly rewarding with many things to discover.
While in the first few hours of gameplay it might feel like a copy of Subnautica with some ice slapped on top of it, one will soon discover, that the game does indeed have it's own charm and feel to it, wich is mostly due to the fact, that this time [spoiler] you're not alone on 4546B.[/spoiler]
This is where the game goes it's own way, and not necessarily only downhill.
From here on out I'll no longer censor spoilers, since it'll just be too much censorship.
[h3] Positive aspects [/h3]
- The game gives you an objective from the very beginning
- The progression regarding ressources and technology is (mostly) steady
- There are [b] almost [/b] no instances, where you truly have no idea what you are supposed to do next.
- Story has an interesting concept
- Many new customization options for your base
- Non-linear story progression and exploration
[h3] Negative aspects [/h3]
   [u] Map Design [/u]
  The Map not only became [b] significantly [/b] smaller, but also a lot more barren and repetetive. The biomes don't feel 
  very unique (except the cave biomes) and large areas are completely empty, especially the eastern and western arctic 
  regions.
  Additionally, a large portion (roughly one third of the map) is now dry land / Ice. The ice areas are not only very empty   
  and difficult to traverse, but also extremely annoying because of the unkillable ice worms.
  [u] Gameplay [/u]
  Whilst i have mentioned earlier that the gameplay feels nice, there are some major flaws in the progression mechanics.
-My most dominant issue is that you unlock the Prawn Suit way too early. Once you have built it, there is absolutely no 
  need for the cold suit or the Snow Fox. There is not a single cold area that you cannot enter with the Prawn Suit, which is 
  also more resistant against Ice Worm attacks and can mine the ressources, which are scattered around the areas.
-Due to the small size of the map there is no need for a Seatruck functioning as a mobile base and you have no 
  encouragement to build secondary bases like in Subnautica.
-It's very unlikely that you will ever have shortages of ressources in this game. There are way too many large ressource 
  nodes placed on the map, many of which are also mostly unguarded, which brings me to my next point.
  [u] Danger [/u]
-In comparison to Subnautica you feel way too safe in this game. Enemies other then leviathans can barely harm your 
  Seatruck, since you get a free defence system early on and all enemies simply flee whenever they take damage, so that 
  you can easily repair your vehicle back up to 100%.
 -Leviathans are nowhere near as scary as in Subnautica and are very easy to fight using the Prawn Suit. Additionally they 
  are rare and easily avoidable, since they are not very aggressive.
 -The lack of danger takes away a lot of the original feelings.
 [u] Story [/u]
 -While the story is indeed interesting, if feels not nearly as well thought out as Subnautica's story, since there are many 
  unanswered questions, so many that i can only

  [h2] Conclusion [/h2]
  Subnautica: Below zero is, despite my seemingly endless negative points, in my opinion still a great and worthwhile game 
  to play, especially if you liked Subnautica. This game however, doesn't shine nearly as bright as Subnautica does and has 
  many flaws, which made it difficult for me to decide wether or not I should give a positive or a negative review.

  Map design: 6/10
  Gameplay: 7/10
  Story: 4/10

  Despite this somewhat disapointing sequel, I have very high hopes for the third installment of the series, and am eager to

✅ Review does not contain spoilers. TL;DR at the bottom
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[b]• STORY: 4/10[/b]
Not even comparable to the original game, the story in Below Zero is ""Meh"", it's not terrible but I finished playing it two days ago and can barely remember it. It's basically just a [i]""go here and find this thing, then go there and find that, and go over there to find those, bring them here and put X, Y, and Z together... then profit??[/i]

[b]• DIFFICULTY: 3/10[/b]
Just as easy as the original game, there is no real challenge at all. Everything has a big glowing map marker, and there is not a huge amount to explore in this game. This game could really do with a bunch of mods to increase the difficulty.

[b]• GRAPHICS: 5/10[/b]
Pretty much exactly the same as the original, very brightly colored and pretty but one of the first things I did was create a ReShade preset to reduce the color saturation, make the game darker so it was better on an HDR monitor, and also add a lot of underwater blurring/water effect so I can't see nearly 1km underwater.
With a dark and water blur shader it did make it a little challenging, plus I had to enable mod to change the recipes for crafting to make them much more grindy and challenging.

[b]• MAP / EXPLORATION: 4/10[/b]
The map feels a fraction of the size, The distance between one story objective and the next one can be as little as two minutes of swimming, it really does hurt the game. There are estimations that the map is 1/4th (25%) of the size of the original game's map, but not only from one side to the other it's also the depth, it's 1/3rd (30%) of the map depth in the original game. 
There are around 40 biomes in the original game and they mostly all feel different, whereas there are only 12-15 in Below Zero and I would argue a few of them are the same.

[b]• MOD SUPPORTt: 7/10[/b]
It doesn't have anywhere near as many mods or as much support as the original game but it does still have a decent number of mods and it uses the same tools as the original game so it's fairly easy to create mods for it.
Installing them is super easy, drag and drop, click play.

[b]• Replayability & Game length: 4/10[/b]
The main story is very bland and you could probably complete it in 5 hours if you weren't bothered about going off and exploring. I don't think it has much replayability because there just isn't the exploration that there is in the original game.

[b]• BUGS: 8/10[/b]
This was one very good thing, I only encountered a couple of minor bugs, a few of the large leviathans still clip through walls, and you can occasionally get snagged on something you should easily be able to walk or jump over, but overall, nothing game breaking at all.

[b]• PERFORMANCE & FPS: 8/10[/b]
Another good thing, running at 4k (2160p) resolution on maximum graphical settings I was able to comfortably run at 100+fps even with a heavy ReShade preset enabled on a 3080Ti.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[b]TL;DR (Conclusion):[/b]

Below Zero started off scratching the Subnautica itch and gave me those same feelings from the original game... but that only lasted about an hour until I realised it was a shallow puddle.
When I saw how rinse and repeat it is, and how tiny the map is, it spoiled the game right at the beginning when I knew it wasn't going to be a shadow of the original game.

It's not a [b]bad[/b] game, if Below Zero was a standalone title in a world where the original Subnautica didn't exist then I would say Below Zero was a pretty decent game, but it's not, it's a sequel to [b]Subnautica[/b]... one of the best games that has been released in the past 20 years, and Below Zero is not Terminator 2 or Aliens, it's not an amazing sequel that many would even argue is even better than the original... Below Zero is Robocop 3 or Dumb and Dumber Too... it's a slightly embarrassing far cry from capturing the original's magic.",1706813924,1706829630,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is just something about Subnautica. Maybe it's the unknown. The sense of adventure and discovery. Perhaps it's that sinking feeling when you reach a new depth in a cavern. Perhaps it's those leviathans that just scare the absolute crap out of you. Or the seatruck and it's many modules. Whatever it is, I just love this game.

I am a ''scaredy-cat'' by nature, and have a healthy respect for the vastness of the ocean. This game is terrifyingly good, and the new custom settings really do cater for underwater phobias, but alas I found my experience would have been fantastic on standard difficulty.



You should play it. Stuff your phobias down and dive!

this game while it does certain things better than the first, its not good enough to be touted as as sequel.
any player of the first game can see some of the fundamental things this game did wrong hears a list 
the story is meh 
the characters bland boring and annoying
the biomes are mid and to clustered together 
 the ""fear"" factor witch is basically not present at all.

Sub: Prefix, from the Latin ""sub""-, under, expressing a lower position in space.
 
Nautică: Feminine singular or neuter plural form of the Latin word ""nauticus"", meaning ""sailor"" or ""naval"", and in a broader sense related to the sea.

One thing that stands out and really contributes to the feeling others have described of this feeling like a Subnautica DLC rather than it's own game is that you are basically spoon fed the blueprints. If you played Subnautica, you'll remember scouring the ocean for tech fragments, taking you to new and exciting areas of the map. In Below Zero, there are many times where you'll scan one thing and get between 2 and 6 blueprints out of it. Very little fragment hunting. The progression was extremely fast. Where I had no less than four bases in the original game to take advantage of things only found in those areas, or to help with exploration there, in Below Zero it was one and done. 

I never felt the sense of apprehension or downright terror I did in the first game. The new leviathans were cool, and I did like them, but the overall sense of ""Oh God what's down there"" never really hit me here. 

The map is very small, and to go deeper you'll be looking for quite small caves leading down. I felt like most of the biomes, while still unique and striking, were too small to really develop the kind of personality you found in the first game. And the land portions, taking up probably about 1/5 of the explorable areas, were frankly miserable to slog through. Without spoiling too much, one major contributor to the first game being as great as it was, was your ability to see that there's something spoopy up ahead, and move around it carefully. Or, if you did get ambushed, you could usually run away to safety with your heart in your throat. These land sections on the other hand have enemies that pop out of nowhere and are very hard to avoid, meaning you're running into them every two minutes, and you aren't afraid of them as much as you're annoyed. 

However, I have to give props to the Twisty Bridges biome. That place was just stunning in every way.

Overall, if you haven't played the first one, go play that instead. Below Zero would be an ok game on it's own, but honestly I feel like I only enjoyed it as much as I did because I was trying to fill the Subnautica shaped hole in my heart after finishing the first one.",1706429480,1706429480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The map was big and without crafting/leaving location coordinate markers all over the map at key locations it was easy to get turned around and lost.

If you haven't played the original Subnautica, treat yourself and go do that since it's one of the greatest survival games of all time. Below Zero, not so much. I'm just going to talk about differences and what I did and/or didn't like about them.

- The map feels much smaller than the original. I'm not sure if it actually is or if it's just so cluttered that it feels more confined so I didn't have that feeling of exploration that I had in the original.

- The story is kind of bland and completely removes the atmosphere of complete isolation that the original did so well.

- The Seatruck is an obvious attempt to combine the Seamoth and the Cyclops from the original. But it lacks the maneuverability  of the Seamoth and the customization of the Cyclops so it ends up feeling inferior to both.

- The land elements are a little rough but nowhere near as bad as they were in the original Subnautica. It's like people forget that the few land elements in the first game were terrible. In Below Zero, the land elements are passable.

- The Prawn Suit still exists but I never built it. I didn't need it. There was nowhere I needed to go that the Seatruck couldn't reach and no reason to mine resource nodes.

- I don't know why people say it lacks the feeling of threat from the first game. There are still monsters ranging from small biting fish to absolute giants that will straight up try to wreck your Seatruck and end you. There are even predators on land. Much like the first game, none of them are difficult to deal with once you learn their attacks.

- In the first Subnautica, I built multiple bases around the map and enjoyed doing so. In Below Zero, I built one small three-room base and two one-room outposts. With there being a pretty linear story that's constantly giving you goals to follow and finish, building elaborate bases felt like a waste of time so I didn't.

- There were so many things that I didn't bother building or gathering blueprints for because they were not needed. There were also things that I used one time then never again. I feels like many of the new additions in Below Zero weren't very well thought out before being implemented. 

So that's it. It's not a bad survival game but it doesn't expand upon what made the original Subnautica so amazing.",1706313934,1706314170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On its own, it's a mediocre and almost instantly forgettable game, with annoying cookie-cutter characters and a cheesy, predictable, checkbox-ticking (and ultimately nonsensical) ""plot"" (or rather, two separate plots that don't even mesh together, and actually contradict each other at several points).

* Generic and crappy soundtrack
* A shallow horizontal map
* No feeling of discovery
* Too much land
* PDA voice is hard to understand
* No feeling that you're alone and stranded
* No more cyclops, instead you have a seamoth-like vehicle where you can add seamoth-sized ""modules"" as you discover along. The end result is an ugly abomination.
* Story is bland

It's got a lot carried over from subnautica, but enough is missing to make this a very unflattering comparison--

There is little sense of mystery, isolation, danger unlike in Sub1.  The VAs did well with what they were given, but the addition of SO MUCH conversation, including the protag's constant commentary on everything, makes you feel like you're being led by the nose on what to do.  Even with that much handholding, a lot of changes leave us with less of a game.

Land travel is a large part of this game, very odd diversion from the prior installment and feeling very clunky.

The Alien passenger in your brain-- I am sure this could have been an interesting idea in some game, but part of the wonder from Sub1 was that the precursor aliens were a total mystery.  Everything we knew of them was through environmental storytelling.  Having 1st hand interaction just feels... wrong.

And the seatruck is a terrible trade for the seamoth.  The seamoth was so fun to use, and while the seatruck has some utility, it's boring as heck to drive.  I hated having to use it.  The prawn suit seemed clunkier than in Sub1.  I mainly was using the seaglide for everything because the other options were so darn cumbersome.

If I am playing Sub1 or its follow-ups, I would hope for that feeling of total isolation, mystery I have to unravel, freedom to fail, and danger that isn't totally able to be ignored.

Exploration no longer has the streamlined metroidvania style of Subnautica, but is much more open-world. This means that if you are the kind of player who likes to explore every corner of a newly discovered area, you can easily end up accidentally sequence-breaking the already questionable progression. This risk is further exacerbated by the strange decision to give the player a map of the entire playable area very early on. 
And without taking sequence-breaking into account, it also gives you things that trivialize certain elements of the game before they get to be relevant.
All of that without mentioning the resource balance, which is all over the place now.


In terms of world design there are some areas with good visuals, but a significant portion of what you will see underwater looks so similarly empty to the dead zone that you may end up in it accidentally, with barely any detail or interesting features in the terrain. 
Even the more detailed biomes have little purpose beyond a few ""points of interest"" (or even a single one) which are lackluster more often than not. Just scan or grab this one thing that is randomly scattered on the ground and you're done with the zone, time to move on to the next one. Most of them feel pretty much identical to each other from the scenarios to the writing.

Land sections are not really any better despite the fact they were a major focus in the marketing of the game. They basically consist of massive empty areas, enemies that can be easily ignored and a weather system that is more of an annoyance than a challenge, with storms that greatly reduce visibility happening way too often.

There's also a very excessive amount of loops and dead ends that make exploration feel like a chore.


I really missed the horror elements Subnautica had too, which Below Zero does not really expand upon. It's a survival game, yet you never really feel like your life is actually in danger.
The music has some great tracks, but like the rest of the game lacks the spooky atmosphere I was hoping for in supposedly tense situations.

This game is quite focused in its characters and has plenty of dialogue, but it's generally not for the better. It's full of cheesy lines, stereotypical characters with one-dimensional personalities, repetitive scenes, pointless additions and sanctimonious philosophy that sometimes contradicts other elements of the story. I am also not a fan of the direction the overall narrative took.

After learning the original writer left during development and the new one was asked to remake the story, it seems the reason it appears to be rushed is because it was.


When it comes to vehicles, the Seatruck introduces interesting ideas with its modularity, but being somewhere in-between what the Seamoth and the Cyclops could accomplish, it ends up underwhelming in comparison. Modules either add things that could be done with the builder tool in the Cyclops in a less annoying and more customizable way or niche functions you don't really need, a common theme for the new tools. 
In addition, the Prawn Suit feels much less agile than I remember, although I'd still rather use it on land than bother with the Snowfox's awful camera and controls.


There are a lot of bugs too. Subnautica already had its fair share, but Below Zero took it to the next level for me, with multiple game-breaking bugs including freezes, crashes, water disappearing and causing me to fall into the void, an NPC clipping inside the Seatruck making it unusable, the Seatruck getting stuck both in the Moonpool and the Docking Module (the latter of which could only be fixed by destroying it), weird audio volume changes on and near the surface, NPCs getting stuck or floating in the air, foundations and water filtration machines being impossible to remove right after being placed without destroying half the base because of things they weren't even touching being close by... 

I also accidentally went out of bounds multiple times on land, which is as simple as jumping on the wrong spot with the Prawn Suit. That and how good it is at dealing with enemies there makes me think it wasn't taken into account at all when designing the land sections.


Overall, the game does have a few enjoyable moments (particularly at the start), but it could have been so much better it's hard to recommend.",1694533614,1705900231,False,9,0,0.581638574600219727,0,True,False,False

If you are reading this is probably because you played the first one and looking for positives things so....in few words..it is amazing!

- Is it good? Absolutely.
- Is it scary or scarier than the previous one? Not at all, but do not take it easy.
- 38hrs played, why? Full engagement and completition 100% achievement.
- A real difference between both Subnauticas? Well, time management. This one makes it better.
- Is the overall gameplay good? Yes, indeed. It is very fluid, good-looking, immersive, enviromental deep sounded video game.
- Quality of the game? 10/10
-Bugs/glitches counted: none so far, unless you considered few cosmetic resources not fair.

Easier than the original, for good and bad.
Not as fun to explore but still rewarding
Some bugs but not game breaking
Not nearly as visually striking as the original
Land sections were slow but still fun to explore

[h1]THE LONG REVIEW[/h1]

After finishing the absolutely incredible Subnautica I was excited to play Subnautica: Below Zero but I feel like I should highlight what I didn't like about this game compared to the first.

[h3]LESS OCEAN, MORE LAND[/h3]

I understand why the game had so much more land exploration but it never felt like it fit and the extended section of exploring the area around Phi Robotics just dragged on. The Snowfox is hard to control and I ended up using the Prawn Suit on land until I hit the Snow Worms section. 

What I loved about Subnautica was the beauty of it's undersea world with massive mushroom caves, lava vents, the trenches and so on. While there is diversity in Below Zero it pales in comparison to the original. The Mercury II was fun to dive into.

[h3]MUCH EASIER[/h3]

I spent a week of constantly dying and restarting in the first game trying to complete it in Hardcore. I did do it and I felt very satisfied with the challenge, every death was my mistake and I learned from them. In Below Zero I completed the game in Hardcore mode on my second attempt and I didn't even die stupidly the first time because my cat unpaused the game when he stood on the escape button and I starved to death while I was busy IRL. Not my fault...Okay!

The biggest reason this game is so easy is the abundance of oxygen you can get from plants or even some fish. While these crutches weren't available in deeper portions it still makes the game very easy. I never felt worried about drowning so while it made exploration easier it also ruined the tension. I didn't even die to the cold because of how easy it was to mitigate.

[h3]ANNOYING BUGS[/h3]

Because of some annoying bugs I had to resort to opening and using the console. This had locked me out of getting achievements but I hours into my second run and didn't want to restart, Here's a a couple of things that made me have to use the commands.

1. A hatch door made me fall out my base and I was walking along the sea floor. I fixed this using the fly command
2. On two occasions my Snowfox fell through the ground. I had to use the Ghost command to retrieve it.
3. The Propulsion cannon wouldn't grab a box that was blocking a passageway. It grabbed it once then bugged out and couldn't grab it again. I had to use Ghost to get past it.
4. A certain item near the end after three, 22 second items, wasn't able to be interacted with. I had to save/quit and reopen the game just to begin the end of the game.
5. Some Sea Truck compartments got stuck as I was moving them. Partly my own fault I suppose but it bugged me.

Aside from the 4th bug, none of these were game breaking.

[h2]WHY DO I RECOMMEND IT?[/h2]

If you enjoyed Subnautica and want more then Below Zero is a worthy successor. Here's why.

[h3]ROBIN AYOU[/h3]

After playing as Riley in Subnautica 1, a mute protagonist, I can easily understand why Robin isn't as well liked. A voiced player in a first person game is risky since it can remove a ton of immersion from the player. I don't think Robin has that issue. From the start her goals are very in line with how the game is played.

She's a scientist looking for answers on the mysterious death of her sister but she's also a survivor who has previous experience in a hostile environment. That explains why she's here and why she's confident she can survive. She wants to explore the planet, scan everything and unlock the mysteries of 4546B. This is also what the player wants. Instead of her personality conflicting with the game it actively compliments the playstyle the game encourages.

Don't open this spoiler if you want to play blind!

[spoiler][h3]AL:AN[/h3]

I loved AL:AN. Him being in your head and trying to solve the mystery of the differences in Humanity compared to his species provided some insightful conversations that also deepened our understanding of the games lore in a natural way that didn't interfere with exploration. He can seem rude at times, such as calling Robin's body inadequate and inferior but Robin almost takes a motherly role in their relationship. He was superbly acted as well.[/spoiler]

[h3]THE STORY[/h3]

No spoilers here. In Subnautica I found myself lost more often than not which was a little annoying but in Below Zero the objectives are quite a bit clearer. You find some maps that tell you key locations but without a world map to reference, you still need to explore to fully understand where to go. This was fine for me. I liked having a vague direction.

Most of the backstory is told through PDA voice logs and I enjoyed listening to the logs left by the crew of the crashed Mercury II vessel. Whoever wrote their story did so wonderfully.

[h2]FINAL VERDICT[/h2]

Below Zero isn't as good as Subnautica but it is still good in it's own ways. I wouldn't have played it in Hardcore if I thought it was painful to potentially restart over and over. Now that I've finished it I do hope we get more.",1705689711,1705689743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved Subnautica dearly.

I was aware that Below Zero (BZ) was a shorter/smaller game, but whatever. What I didn't realize was how pervasive that was. There's less biomes, and they're smaller. There's less vehicles, and they're not as good. There's less story, and it's not as good.

And I think the story part is what drove me from ""BZ has its flaws but is still great"" to ""wait shit I think I hate it now?!?""

The story is, in a word, too short. It seems like things are picking up and then that's it. Right when the middle part of a story should be hitting you're instead hitting the end. The quality is...not the best but on the higher side of ""fine"".

That's not the horrible part, though.

The horrible part is that BZ is much, much worse at guiding you through the story than original Subnautica. It is very possible to miss absolutely massive story related things in BZ. Some of which are so important and plot critical that they should have been mandatory rather than letting it be something you can completely miss until you're almost done with the game. Which is what I did. I missed out on meeting a certain character who is allegedly a main character. 

I say allegedly because I was able to completely miss what was supposed to be a companion.  A companion that would have allegedly made the story and progression flow better. Instead I got a story that just felt...disjointed? Almost like there was supposed to be someone feeding me information this whole time but the devs made this character an optional encounter.

There are other completely optional story elements as well. It doesn't feel rewarding to find them so much as it feels infuriating that something so big was hidden. This hurts even more when the original Subnautica was so good about pointing you in the right directions and feeding you story breadcrumbs. 

In short, I thought the game was good but it turns out that you can accidentally skip large parts of the story and completely break the narrative experience.

The level details are great. The tight locations and narrow passages are just what you should expect in an ocean floor. Some cases I would search for a corridor to a item and  get turned around. Get ninja'd by a predator behind me. The base building is simplistic compared to other survivor games. Once you have all you need the rest feels like a waste of resources to build, but it is really not the focus of this game. The animals and large predators are localized to certain biospheres and you know there is a risk/reward going in. If you are well equipped with later game tech then you are certainly the peak predator and can hunt for all the treasures without much worry. The story line itself I had a difficult time following.

was happy to see a new Subnautica game come out.

But this game feels more like a shorter DLC and a bit rushed near the end.

The first Subnautica had a nice even progress curve that felt like an unfolding adventure.
Sub Zero however had that for the first half of the game then suddenly everything gets thrown at you, huge tech advances and story discoveries and then suddenly you're in the end game and its feels rushed and unsatisfactory.

The game goes on land near the end and while this sounds like a good idea it ultimately doesn't feel that way and i found myself at the end feeling less and less interested in playing.

Subnautica is a Submarine game and should stay that way, the wonder and fear of the deep was its main draw and the great sense of progression and awe sold in the original is missing somewhat in this title and subsequently falls a little flat.

It's not really subnautica, it's not really a survival game as you have an overabundace of resource, help and other people. On teh other hand in the first game you felt like lost, scared and in need to survive plus You were the character, but in this one it feels like you're just an observer of Robin's adventure.
And all of this could be forgiven if the game wasn't so small, because honestly it is small and doesn't leave room for exploration, as the map is not bigger tan around 2km wide and lacks the levels of the earth 'cos there's some caves and places but they are small, cramped and mainly feel empty.

In summary I would say this feels more like a subnautica mod/dlc than a standalone new subnautica, but if you already played the original, than I can recommend this for a bit of nostalgia and relaxation.",1705435027,1705435027,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know that for many this game didn't quite live up to the experience of playing Subnautica 1 for the first time. But let's be honest, nothing possibly could.

Instead though we got a game that has plenty of fresh offerings to pull the series in a new direction. Some of the highlights include:
- Some of the most beautiful/unsettling environments I've seen in any game ever
- An amazing soundtrack by the legendary Ben Prunty
- Some unique new items/vehicles that change up some of the gameplay
- Some terrifying new creatures to encounter
- An entire new realm of gameplay with [spoiler]an above-ground section[/spoiler]

The biggest negative I've seen mentioned is the inclusion of more dialogue, including having a voice protag. But for me it felt like it took only 10min before not only did I become acustomed to the change, but I realized how there is no way the story of 4546B could ever progress without one.

I sat on waiting to complete the last task for this game for nearly a year, same as I did for the original game. And just like the original I'm left with the feeling of wishing it never had to end.

The large underwater predators were not as intimidating as in Subnautica.

First of all, its hilariously easy, you will likely die once or twice total and it will just be something goofy like forgetting to eat or surface. Its pretty much just one big fetch quest, going from one place to another grabbing mcguffins as you go, the main story progression is infact mcguffin based. Directions on where to go can be vague at times even with a beacon, its like the game is forcing us to explore in a world that offers nothing to explore. This new story kind of ruins the intrigue and the fun of the first game. Robin has some of the worst written dialogue ive seen. The map is tiny with only 2 of the new biomes really giving subnautica vibes, the twisty bridges and tree spires. To much back tracking. No seamoth or cyclops, only a lame seatruck, you will probably only really use your prawn suit as its so much better and can be used to just somewhat skip parts of the game with its grapples. However the building improvements are welcome, while most creatures are downgrades and dont feel very subnautica, there are some cool ones like the shadow leviathan(game overuses it and uses it wrong however) snow stalkers, and pengwings were also very welcome, most of the creatures brought back from scrapped concept art were fine but you can see why they were scrapped. AL AN was a rather fun character, pretty well written IMO and behaves how you would expect.

I think this game should have been a DLC. For a standalone game, the story is too flat I think (not finished yet). But I could live with this since I played Subnautica back then without any story at all. I somehow miss the improvements in the game. It starts with basics like having a fuckin' clock to know when it becomes dark. Or a map, which still does not exist.

Also using sonar with integrated chip to show found items is a mess. All items are shown in your ui with same size of icon and same color. My whole screen was orange. I also posted this somewhere to the devs to maybe change it. Who knows. But this is one of the things which really annoyed me in the original game too. And yet, they did not change it.

Also in you underwater vehicles you have no possibility to see if you are horizontally aligned or not. Nothing.

The german translation is also somehow crappy. Seatruck is translated as ""Seebahn"". I don't know who came up with this. But ""Bahn"" is either used for trains in Germany or for the ""road"". So Seatruck is like ""Searoad"" ... but it is not a road, it is a truck. But still can live with this. Next time they maybe can provide the sources for the community to mod etc.

Caves are a pain in the ass. I hate caves. The navigation in there is so shitty. I never know where I go down and if I can reach the end without drowning. There are also not that many ""dark water"" moments where you shit yourself ... but still good.

I don't know if I really like the ice terrain. It is somehow interesting. But on the other hand ... it is a little bit of waste, since you do not really build up there and there is nothing for you. Subnautica is about water ... and it should stay that way.

I also somehow don't like the main character ... too positive ... everyone is an ""individual"" ... everyone has it's own ""life"" (can't explain that using my shitty english). When the AI (or Alien) told about its kind and their knowledge ... it was more or less all blocked by the main character ... like being human is superior to everything. There is no real discussion about what is better etc.

Inventory is okay for the character but way too small for the seatruck and crab. I don't know who decided it, but why is the storage module for the seatruck so small? I have like 4 modules to collect shit on the ground ... but the first problem is: I cannot really reach the ground very well since the seatruck is too long to be maneuaverable in the depths and caves and using crab on the other hand again lets you go back and forth all the time. Collecting materials is still somehow shitty.

But in the end the materials are also not that important ... you can basically build everything in short period of time. I also recommend only to collect materials you really need. My base is full of crap which is not even used anywhere.

This time I liked that you have a story and it somehow leads you through it ... although I had some problems finding some locations. The crab is as always top. The seatruck is a really good idea. But it is missing some basic features or enhancements to be really cool. Base building is as always, I think they didn't change anything in there.

Environment is also nearly the same as before, but the caves are a pain for me. i just hate them.
The pinning of materials required for construction is pretty nice, but I am not sure if this already existed in the previous game. If not: super enhancement.

Placing stuff inside the base is still crappy. There is no grid or snap function to place stuff in same distance at same hight etc.

Ps, I am playing without mods to get the real game feeling.
I think the game does not really provide enough enahncements to be a standalone game ... but still good.
I like the setting and this more or less ""easy"" going ... no monsters hunting you etc.

What I would like to see in a new Subnautica:
Better bases, maybe also more NPCs in their own bases where you can get jobs etc.. A better graphic would be nice. A map.

Also, it won't show up on my list since I don't own the game through Steam, but I have maybe 30 hours in original Subnautica as well. 

As a more or less casual player, I have some notes I wanted to share my Below Zero experience.

Personally, I have greatly enjoyed Subnautica: Below Zero in particular and I might even go to say that I prefer it to the original. Having read other reviews, I can definitely see where the criticisms are coming from. BZ is a fully featured game that feels complete to me, but the maps are not as large as in the original. There's potentially more time spent out of the water in BZ which can be awkward but I didn't have a huge problem with. Sometimes getting out and walking could be a nice change from being underwater all the time, though it is a weaker part of the game. 

Map-wise, I personally found myself getting lost quite often in the first game and feeling overwhelmed by the sheer size of everything. Instead of wanting to explore, sometimes I'd want to stay too close to my base and not go anywhere. Sometimes I'd go explore for awhile, but It either felt too empty or too hostile. Less so in Below Zero. I've gotten lost in BZ, too, but I admit it does feel more contained. You're less likely to explore for hours and not find anything. There's also way more twisty passages and caverns, so you might get lost in a different way in BZ. I guess it's a matter of what you prefer.

If you liked the first game, and you wanted a straight-up 1:1 continuation of what you got before, then this one is probably not gonna satisfy you. From the first, what you were probably expecting is a whole lot more horrifying creatures waiting to eat you, existential dread, loneliness, and an overall difficult time. You'll get some of that in this one, but despite nearly identical play styles, the tone in BZ is quite different. You'll still explore old shipwrecks, listen to transmissions from people who are probably long dead, meet strange lifeforms, and explore a vast alien ocean world. 

While I wouldn't exactly call BZ lighthearted, it doesn't have quite the negative psychological pressure or weight of the first one. It's different. You're not left alone to your devices as much in BZ. It's a bit less free form, with BZ preferring to guide you through things more. Below Zero is more story driven, with the focus being on Robin and her quest to find out more about what happened to her sister. Instead of pure survival with a small side of corrupt corporation and ancient alien intrigue, you get more corrupt corporation shenanigans combined with amateur detective, and a dash of ancient alien weirdness. In the first one I felt like a survivor in way over their head. In this one, I felt more like I had more agency in the role of xenobiologist / investigator. It was right up my alley, but I can see where the shift might not work for everyone. 

On the relative scale of things, I'd say that Below Zero is a more friendly game overall, with a lot of general quality of life fixes. Where things always felt stacked against me in the original, BZ felt more doable. I felt like there's more options for dealing with trouble when it arises, and for me that works. I like a challenge as much as the next person, but sometimes it's nice just to be able to get further in the story. An interesting game difference I noticed is that some recipes/blueprints become available sooner in BZ, though others that were available quickly in Subnuatica remain elusive. It's an interesting design decision but I approve. It spices things up as you can't just cookie cutter everything from a tropical world to an arctic one. That said, some of the tools were 'universal'. The changes were enough for me to feel like I was exploring the world differently. 

Honestly, the sheer variety of underwater life in both Subnautica games is amazing. I love the cell shaded cartoon-y aspect of the graphics from both, and it's fun seeing just how much there is to see and discover. The sunsets and sunrises and weather events are gorgeous. The ocean itself is beautiful and teeming with life (in most places). Everything about these games is so imaginative that even despite the horrifying moments there's a lot of joy and wonder. Those details alone are worth me coming back again and again, but it's also cool to think of some of the stuff being not that out of the range of possibility. There's a long-ish documentary style video on YouTube by creator Curious Archive that was fun to see that explored some of the real life biological inspiration that the Subnautica series might have drawn from. Highly recommended if you are like me interested in speculative alien biology:

https://youtu.be/1xBrxWzKzDQ

Anyway, do I recommend the game? I do!!

I've been playing for hours and I still want to keep coming back. I'm still discovering new secrets and new aspects to the game I didn't notice. There's still mysteries to be solved. I've loved the writing and the story so far. I really want to meet Potato some day. It's a charming game! 

TLDR; If you were someone who was too intimidated to try the original Subnautica or were having too much trouble with excess loneliness/existential dread but still want to explore an alien water world (or perhaps you just want a more directed experience), then Below Zero may be a great fit for you. There's aspects of the story that you'll understand more of if you finish the first one first, but it's more or less a standalone experience. I hope that you'll give these games a go!

I WANT to follow the story, Subnautica is amazing. But I want to finish the game, not restart after so many hours due to a technical error. Some of the bugs I have encountered:
-Artifact N6M does not load at all, ever. The icon is there but the artifact is not
-Most Artifacts just do not ""finish""(whether its a scan, swimming up the door, etc.). Ai-An is supposed to talk to you during these sequences and in most of my restarts, at some point it will get broken and I will be unable to progress.
-Scans do not scan. I dread finding a new chunk of alterra tech on the ocean floor because there is a probability there will be no option to scan the object.

If you loved Subnautica for its immersion, mystery, silence, its feeling of hopelessness and abandonment, don't come looking for it in this game. Almost everything that made Subnautica great was butchered in this ""sequel"" in a way that it honestly makes me sad, maybe because I had high expectations just having finished the prequel.
You can tell that the devs tried to make it [i]better[/i] by just adding more stuff to it, ranging from a more diverse flora and fauna, different tools and vehicles to adding an excess of voice lines and, simply put, unnecessary storyline elements. I get that they're trying to paint a picture and tell a story, but please don't force it down everyone's throat [b]this hard[/b].

Imagine you're playing the prequel, but all of a sudden you are Dora the Explorer on psychedelics and your PDA environment becomes a dumbed-down corpocratic burden that tells you exactly what to do and how to react to things every step of the way. That is what Below Zero feels like. You are [b]clearly[/b] not the only human on this planet. In fact, you have landed some place that could best be described as a mediocre sitcom. There's way too much emphasis on the characters' personal little discrepancies and funny little stories, as opposed to figuring out how to survive on a strange planet.

Maybe when I come back to Below Zero one day, I will add more things that are good or bad about it, but right now I'm very annoyed and disappointed. Thanks for coming to my TED talk",1704898434,1704913685,False,2,0,0.459016382694244385,0,True,False,False

Subnautica: Below Zero is a game in a different direction from the original. Whilst Subnautica had an atmosphere of complete lonesomeness, danger and wonder, its successor is lacking in most of these things. However it is more Subnautica, and good fans of the original may get a kick out of it just for that much. If that is the case for you, stop reading here.

Story wise, the plot is unfortunately all over the place. Knowing that there was a change in responsible writer, this is understandable. But that does not excuse the fact that a great amount of plot points are left unexplained, motivations are unclear, and the overall story is mediocre at best. The original Subnautica admittedly had a simple, easy to follow story with not much of a mature theme to think about. But seeing that Below Zero apparently tried to go for a more character driven approach with a non-silent protagonist it hurts the more how much it fails in that regard. Characters are introduced in text and forgotten. Characters are introduced and hint at a questline that immediately is done after one mission. Bits and pieces of one writer's vision appear and are discarded for another's.

Gameplay wise, it is Subnautica with extra buildings, no cyclops and no seamoth but a seatruck and a winter bike. Said truck is fun to interact with but becomes tedious with time as too slow for seamoth's purpose and too clunky for cyclops's. The overall size of the map is significantly smaller from the original, with more claustrophobic spaces and frankly less wondrous content in them. The biggest problem of the game is, and dare not read this if you plan on playing the game, [spoiler] a lack of tension and danger in the map. Whilst the original had impressive giant sealife that was capable of ripping the player apart randomly, Below Zero is either too easy to navigate to allow unpredictable predators, said predators are too disinterested in the player or too weak to pose real harm, or they downright don't work properly.[/spoiler]

The game features a land section in a winter tundra, but that section appears lacking in thought and polish. These land sections different from the free-romaing seascapes appear in the form of semi-linear corridors with leading hints placed. Some effort has been done to distinguish the land sections from the sea sections such as a temperature mechanic but it fails to deter from the tedium of wading through seemingly padded long stretches of land and gadgets that don't motivate or entice the player enough to do what the developer wanted them to. The wildlife to be found is meant to serve as a threat but fails partly due to exploitable bad path-finding as well as glitch like failure to harm the player for his mistakes. The tundra overall feels like a neat idea that might have had an impact if properly executed, but you end up wishing more effort was put into the sea parts.

Ultimately, Below Zero changes direction unprompted and falls flat for reasons of bad direction, insufficient content or bad execution overall. Whilst fans of the original can still get enjoyment out of it as they re-immerse themselves in the world, broadly speaking the title does not live up to its legacy unfortunately. Play Subnautica instead if you do not know that game, and otherwise think twice about buying this one.",1704835372,1704835372,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the original game i use to fear going 10m from my pod, this one I can go with my glide from one end of the map to the other and have no fear- map is small btw. What made the original so unique was that it didn't hold your hand, it literally just said to you 'hey, go explore, you ain't getting shit from me' and out you went straight into the unknown getting the occasional signal for a pod. BZ literally tells you to go here, here and here, even your character will tell you to go there. No No No, I want the isolation.
They got rid of the seamoth and the cyclops, why God WHY. Seamoth was the best, they gave us a seatruck instead which I didn't even bother building anything after the first section. Its just not necessary and there isn't really enough space to fully utilize it.
There are larger land sections in BZ for you to explore..... which you will go once to and that's it. Even then you are gonna feel rushed because of the temperature gauge.
The leviathans--- practically non-existent. The sea felt empty without all those reapers roaming around. There are 2-3 dangerous levi's above ground and 6 deep down, I fell there should of been at least 1-2 more. The sea just feels so not threatening. The deep down leviathans were the best imo.
This game should of been a DLC story- like another pod that came out of the aurora when you were entering the atmosphere and it made its way to the ice part were our player then has his own adventure. This would of fit this game better than having it as a standalone with half of its life missing.

Achievements: Practically all story and unmissable except for the achievement regarding the 'infection'. Important Note: Do not spawn anything in with the developer console, you will void all other achievements in that save- do that in a casual run.

Bugs/Glitches: Same as the first game, there still there and don't really impact anything. At most there a reminder you are playing subnautica. No crashes either.

- The Map Is Amazing, People Say All of The Good Biomes Are At The Start Which Makes You Not Want To Research New Diving Gear And Go Deeper, But That Is Simply Not True.

Also People Say The Caves Are Confusing But You Can Use That As An Opportunity To Build Bases Near The Caves, Use Scanner Rooms And Their Cameras To Explore Beforehand. No One Is Forcing You To Instantly Rush Into The Cave And Get Lost.

At The Start Is All of The Regular Biomes You Would Normally Find In The Subnautica Universe For Example The Shallows And Kelp Forest.

But Once You Start Going Deeper You Find The Crystal Caverns, Fabricator Caverns With The Shadow Leviathans.

Tree Spires With The Chelicerate And Vent Gardens.The Lilly Pad Islands With The Glow Whale And The Squid Sharks.

Not To Mention The Arctic Zones With The Snow Stalkers, The Ice Worm Leviathan And Those Cute Penguins.


- The Leviathans, In My Opinion The Leviathans Are Amazingly Made. Their Models Are Very Creative And They Give The Player A Sense of Terror.

Most Notably With The Shadow Leviathan. They Sneak Up On You While You're Distracted And Only When They've Grabbed You Do They Roar Making Them Terrifying When First Encountered.

The Ice Worm Leviathans Too, When You're Exploring The Arctic They Suddenly Come Out Of The Ice And Quickly Snag A Snow Stalker Just Knowing Its Coming For You Next.

- The Story, I Somewhat Dislike The Story As It Wasn't Very Thought Out. The Story Just Consists Of You Exploring Alterra Bases Around Sector 0 Trying To Find Out What Happened To Your Sister.

 But The Best Part Of The Story For Me Was Having To Make Alan A New Body. It Was Fun Exploring New Precursor Locations To Help Alan Make A New Body.

I had purchased this game in the first releases of early access and as they kept changing the story of how things would go, I decided to shelve it till it finished or I remembered it again. This morning I finally finished this game. I wouldn't say its better than Subnautica. In comparison, this game is rather small compared to what Subnautica was. Though I know that in the first one, the vastness of the ocean was an illusion, the placed looked bigger than it was, but the depth was amazing. Area's that I hadn't explored seemed very dangerous and blew up in my mind how big the area was where it was much smaller than intended, especially in a sea moth. You can change biomes so quickly in a sea moth. This game was like that, but without the illusion. There were lots of times where I was thinking there was something at the edge of the cliff only to find the dead zone. Lots of times where I was facing wall after wall. Depth seemed deep but only from the surface level. Once you got into the caves it didn't seem to go as deep as Subnautica. There was no illusion on how small this map was to convince me the map was bigger than I would realize. Other than that, I rather enjoyed the final story they settled on. The end of the game sent shivers up my spine but I felt that getting the final pieces of the end game way too easily. Shadow Leviathins didn't seen very dangerous once I picked up an upgrade but thats another problem. The fact that I had to pick up an upgrade. The only real upgrade slot you can really upgrade is depth modules, others you have to find and there aren't many. 

In regards to the land portion of the game, it seemed too vast. I'm not saying I enjoyed it but I'm also not saying I don't enjoy it. Apparently your supposed to make thumpers to avoid the ice worms, but I kinda skipped that part, then wandered around till I found what I was looking for. Did it make it more difficult? I died once. Wasn't too terrible. I did have to look up where to find certain things though, like where the greenhouse was, or where the medicine was hidden. I know Subnautica is a collectathon type of game but it was too tedious to find where these things were. 

All in all, this game doesn't feel like a sequel but an extended DLC for Subnautica, although I did enjoy it, atleast in the first one I built multiple bases in different biomes. One base for everything here. I did enjoy the story. I won't spoil anything but meeting the ending scenes were amazing since we heard about them all in the first one. All the new fish and such were also really cool. Land travel was interesting though I wished they did less so of Land and more so of water but all in all it was an enjoyable experience, besides my own experience with the game. 4/5 recommend to play but only after beating Subnautica with the thought going into it that it isn't ment to be a full fledged sequel.",1704715810,1704715810,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-No replenishable source of Ion cubes
-No good reason for a base on the Glacial area of the map (or really more then 1 for that matter)
-Cannot use tether to teleport between teleport modules. Why? By the time most people get to this point they'll have already beat the game and be messing around
-Quantum locker only usable floating in water, no quantum locker available to be used in base, again, why? Very silly
-World feels much smaller than the first game
-World too tight for cyclops, no cyclops at all, cyclops was great, again, why? Want to add the truck? Wouldn't have been that hard to design the world around having both
-Cant change ladder position (seriously, why is this still a thing?)
-Story wise, the antidote? Very stupid, really spits on the story of the first game.
-Did not feel like a sequel as much as a DLC

I played this during early access and was very impressed with the game but found that it had become somewhat dull when fully released. For starters the features cut from the game, knowing how much theyve cut from the game like the supply rockets, the sea emperror juvenile and the original way the story played out is so disappointing. its dissapointing because they added in nothing to substitute the substance the cut content would've added to the game. Secondly, the story is worse off in release than before the change of writers. Before it felt like you had motivation because you needed to get a cure for the space station for the kaharaa. that cure being obtained through the cut sea emperor juvenile. you had motivation to get the cure to the people on the station but also at the same time find the person sabotaging the mission and stop whatever they are seaking to do. this original story idea gives you all the motivation to continue throughout sector zero. with the new story you are looking for your sister who supposedly died due to her own negligence. they try to make alterra out to seem shady and like the bad guy but in reality with how they present things it really does feel like Ssm did die to her own negligence and the payoff to curing the frozen leviathan is non existent because Alan doesnt even seem to have any care for doing it, even though its his fault the bacteria got out. thirdly the map is a lot smaller than the original game, which wouldnt be an issue if a majority was so bland and uninteresting. theres so few threats in the game like leviathans that my only deaths were because i was reckless and stupid like not bothering to bring cold weather stuff or eating food or drinking water. there are little to no threats in the game and the ones that do exist are more annoying than actually scary. especially the ice worm leviathans, when originally showed off they actually looked threatening but when playing in the actual game all they do is knock you off your snow fox briefly and you just get bat on it. a small nitpick as well is that all the PDA data you get on animals and plants seems so lackluster and almost lazy. In the original I actually liked to read up on pretty much every animal and even plant but in below zero it feels like they just put down stuff as placeholders but forgot to actually change the placeholders to actually say something thats interesting. People say this game gets trashed on because it doesnt live up to the original but i just dont think thats true because plenty of these issues are with the game itself and not it being compared to the first game. I honestly believe if they had kept the original vision for this game when it was in early access it wouldve been much much better in quality especially the story as I feel like the original idea for the story was much more polished and put together than what they shipped out as the story on full release feels rushed and unpolished and is full of plotholes. like how the hell did a advanced precursor alien race not figure out how to make a cure for Kharaa yet humans can suddenly manufacture the cure that an advanced civilization crumbled to? If you are into Subnautica for the gameplay this game is still fun to play but this game feels more like it's a DLC to Subnautica than an actual sequel given its size. overall I recommend just playing the original first game as it is overall better than this sequel.",1577856775,1704662336,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Is it as good as the first game? No, maybe not. Is it still worth playing? Absolutely. Sure, the story is questionable and navigating the caves and the glacial basin is a monotonous chore, but in my opinion the game's flaws are vastly outweighed by its strengths. The base building and customization aspect are SO fun to mess around with. Being able to color and name your base is such a nice addition. The Seatruck is by FAR my favorite vehicle in all of Subnautica. It has the maneuverability and speed of the Seamoth, while also having the ability of item storage, on-board fabricator, and docking your Prawn Suit like the cyclops had. The new biomes are very fun to explore, and the new mobs are equal parts intriguing and terrifying.
Overall, you're going to enjoy this game more if you treat it as an expansion rather than a sequel to the original Subnautica, because that's essentially what it is. It may not have the same feel as the first game but I still think it's worth picking up on sale.

How do you iterate on your first success by smoothing none of the rough edges, adding poorly thought out mechanics, an uninspiring story, and call it a day? There isn't even a submarine in this one! They should've named it Nautica: Below Zero Fun.

Allow me to elaborate.

Let's begin with the first vehicle, the SeaTruck, or as you'll come to know it: the SeaCuck. It's purpose is to ricochet off of every single edge of geometry like an oblong pinball, spewing your precious cargo every which way because you had to eject a segment of the vehicle to escape that crevice you thought you'd be able to make it through, all while the Sea Monkeys make sweet love to your wife in front of you. The silver lining in all of is the the developers knew it was a SeaCuck and allow you to park your SeaCuck in a faithfully recreated prefab building that resembles a Swedish Penis Enlarger Pump™.

Let's talk about those poorly thought-out mechanics. What's new in Below Zero is a thermal mechanic, essentially, you have to keep warm. However, this really only applies to when you are on land. In a game where you're primarily underwater, this mechanic goes largely unused except for a handful of segments. When you do need to worry about this mechanic, it is absolutely dreadful. I found myself sprinting from geyser to geyser waiting and praying that 
it would erupt with warmth and save my character from death. I came to find out later in the game that you uncover schematics for winter clothing all at once which trivializes this mechanic but you wouldn't discover it organically on your own until you are basically done with the terra firma portions of the game. The same can be said for the Snowfox vehicle. At the end of the day it feels like a punishment for not spending hours reading the fandom wiki to spoil the game with requirements and locations of the technology that should be rewarded naturally for progressing through the content.

The Pengling robot fetch quests are obtuse to control and have no danger or interesting aspects, a missed opportunity. If the developers had only put in a Pengling Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots mini game, it would've easily been a 10/10 ""It's Okay"" by IGN. 

Doing my best to avoid spoilers, the part of the story where you try to complete your sister's mission brought no closure. It felt like a hollow victory because it's really hard to form an emotional bond with your dead sister through non-sequitur audio logs you listen to while busy trying not to die yourself. I can tell they tried establishing this fraternal connection through the recordings but this implementation just doesn't work.

Lastly, when it's time to finally delve into the crushing depths of the Arctic seas, you will be enjoying the Oops! All Leviathans part of an incomplete gaming experience, since there is no variation in the type of leviathans here. As you make your way through the confined space of lower areas, you will encounter multiple patrolling leviathans who've acquired a connoisseur's taste in titanium submersibles. Your life down here consists of a 4 step rinse-and-repeat process: 1. Your vehicle gets spotted and munched on by a leviathan, even though your lights are off. 2. The leviathan, conscious of its figure and not wanting to gain too much weight from binge-eating saturated titanium fats, leaves you alone for now. 3. You exit the vehicle equipped with your repair tool and patch up the damage. 4. You swim around a little bit with your swim-charge fins to recharge your repair tool. Just enough time has passed as you enter your vehicle that the leviathan is doubling back on its patrol to start this fresh hell all over again.

(и после релиза то же самое)

1. Размах мира.
Мне было страшно в тёмной пропасти оригинальной игры. Почему? напишу ниже. Там было столько биомов....ух! Можно было исследовать часами. В почти каждом биоме были свои животные и растения. Большая глубина Резко отличалась от мелководья. Я искал именно  загадки, разгадки. А не продолжение сюжета! Заброшеная база Дегази вынудила искать объяснения без принуждения со стороны сюжета. Не сравнивал размер карты, но до сих пор оригинальная  сабнавтика кажется интереснее из-за огромного мира. Надводный мир ледяных пустынь мне неинтересен. Если в оригинале я не замечал отсутствия карты, то как только я начал ходить по льдинам(блуждать и теряться!) мне в голову начало лезть какого чёрта нет мини-карты или просто карты""

2. AI.  в прежней игре я поставил базу возле кораллового леса. Не без опасений - мне мог приплыть и навалять люлей левиафан!  В SBZ скриптам AI будто бы подрезали крылышки / радиус действия, они стали тупее, безопаснее. Погружаться в темноту стало уже не страшно. Такое впечатление, что игре понизили возрастной рейтинг до 7+.

3. Транспорт. Циклоп это гордость. Циклоп это радость владения настоящим судном.
Когда я собрал в оригинальной игре Циклопа и увидел что я собрал, то первыми моими мыслями было ""о боже. у меня будет Собственная подводная лодка? ооооооо ууааау.""
Мореход /seatruck это безысходность. мореход это отчаяние. 

мелочные придирки: мало растений для посадки, мало светящихся растений. гигантские растения всё так же являются текстурами, они не могут вырасти до гигантских размеров у тебя рядом с базой. Но это уже мечты о песочнице. я имею в виду что ждал больше некстгена: игровой физики объектов, более живых растений, ИИ, дистанции прорисовки, куда же без неё.

Ну и пара слов про сюжет: вы бы уплыли куда то с алиеном, наилучшей стратегией карантина которого было откровенно враждебным решением сбивать все корабли из пушки? может лучше не знаю...силовое поле, радиопередачи? удалённое отключение питания кораблей на орбите? Да я бы к нему не приблизился ни за какие коврижки. А ещё есть телепорты, которые милосердно добьют тебя холодным оружием, если ты случайно выжил после встречи с Харааа.
 А вот ГГ берёт и радостно улетает с таким Чикатилой. По сути она решает, что улететь с ним лучше, чем жить среди людей. гмм. и что люди ей сделали? Поиск фрагментов технологий это простите тупо и ничем не обосновано, в отличие от первой части.
Если сравнивать в процентном соотношении и полностью, то конечно SBZ не так плоха. процентов на 20-30 хуже. создатели не сделали игру откровенно ужасной. Плюсом им идёт благодарность за первую часть. это просто сказка, подводная сказка. 
Но  разочарование есть. От него я никуда не могу деться.
Подводя итог: оригинальная  сабнавтика должна была быть улучшена и дополнена. Но ни в коем случае не урезана.

п.с. да, я переписал обзор в третий раз подряд! я ждал улучшений!

Подводя итог: (макс 5)
1. саундтрек 5
2. графон 4 (дистанция прорисовки будто я на встройке играю)
3. сюжет 4, пресноват, мало сексу.
4. геймплей 1 КОЛ кол!!!


So, I still couldn’t stand it !! comparison with original subnautica:

1. The scope of the world.
I was scared in the dark chasm of the original game. Why? I will write below. There were so many biomes .... wow! You could explore for hours. Almost every biome had its own animals and plants. The great depth was very different from the shallow water. I was looking for riddles, clues. Not a continuation of the plot! Degazi's abandoned base forced him to seek an explanation without being forced by the plot. Didn't compare the size of the map, but so far the original subnautica seems more interesting due to the huge world. The surface world of icy deserts is not interesting to me. If in the original I did not notice the absence of a map, then as soon as I started walking on ice floes (wandering and getting lost!), What the hell is not a mini-map or just a map began to climb into my head ""

2. AI. in the previous game, I set up a base near a coral forest. Not without fear - I could have sailed and piled Lyuli / Kiskass Leviathan! In SBZ scripts, AI seemed to have their wings / range clipped, they became dumber, safer. It was no longer scary to plunge into darkness. It seems that the game has been downgraded to 7+.

3. Transport. Cyclops is pride. Cyclops is the joy of owning a real boat.
When I assembled the Cyclops in the original game and saw what I collected, my first thoughts were ""oh my god. Will I have my own submarine? Ooooooo whoaaah.""
The seaman / seatruck is hopelessness. the sailor is despair.

nitpicking: few plants to plant, few glowing plants. giant plants are still textures, they cannot grow to giant sizes near your base. But these are already dreams of a sandbox. I mean that I was waiting for more nextgen: game physics of objects, more living plants, AI, drawing distance, where without it.

If you compare in percentage and in full, then of course SBZ is not so bad. percent is 20-30 worse. the creators did not make the game downright terrible. Plus they are grateful for the first part. it's just a fairy tale, an underwater fairy tale.
But there is disappointment. I can't get away from him.
To summarize: the original subnautica needed to be improved and supplemented. But by no means has it been cut.

I expected so much with this sequel, and I satisfied with what the team from Subnautica Below Zero gave to us. With a very similar gameplay but different biomes, fishes, leviathans and a new mechanic: we can walk on a freezing land!! We have have to protect us from cold, fight with creatures from those lands and investigate what happened to our sister, at the same time we have a Architect in our mind. 

For me, this game was a fair sequel for the first game. The only bad things I can say from this one are: The world is smaller, less scary and the leviathans aren't intimidating like the first game (at least, from my perspective)

This is a must play for crafting, survival and exploring game, BUT you need to play the first in order to understand this.

FINAL SCORE: 4.5/5 ★★★★✰ I'm still liking the first more, but this is not far from perfection, like the first!

Is this as good as the original Subnautica? No. Is it just as good? Well, kind've. There's some new, (at first) interesting story that keeps you somewhat on track / on the rails compared to the original title.

Tbh, I haven't finished this yet. I'm right towards the very end but haven't gotten enough willpower muster to finished 'er out. Frankly, having my 5 module sea truck moving along slow af kind've killed my drive considering I keep having to trek across the map.

The pacing of the story felt a bit off at times, and at some moments I felt like I was a bit farther ahead then I should have been, but regardless I still was able to follow the story and moments pretty well.

Exploration, like in the first game, is extremely fun and rewarding. The map doesn't feel to small, even with the addition of the Land Segments, and I was always finding something new every so often.

The Land segments felt a bit... clunky, especially using the hover-bike. I can appreciate the attempt they made and I did have some fun exploring on land, but it very much has some flaws.

Transitioning from a Silent Protagonist to a Voiced Protagonist doesn't really bother me at all, although the major thing that comes to mind is the first game, it felt like I was the Protagonist, where as in Below Zero I'm just playing a character. Not really an issue, but an interesting observation.

Going to talk about spoilers:

[spoiler] The segment of the game with AL-AN honestly was really nice. Having him talk to me during certain parts of the game was really nice, and being able to actually SEE a Architect once I built his body was really cool. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] Also, I absolutely loved when I met Marge and realized I knew her from the first game because I had read the PDA's during my playthrough. I thought that was really neat for them to add to the game, even though she wasn't in the main story of Below Zero to much outside a few appearances. [/spoiler]

Overall, Below Zero was a fun survival exploration game that built on the original experience, albeit with a few flaws. 8/10",1703824922,1703824922,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For starters, you're not alone in the vast ocean. You have a buddy to talk to as you paddle around in a large fishbowl. You have a slower submarine, but this is somewhat countered by the fact that you have less distance to travel. Easily the worst part of the experience is the land section, which you must traverse to complete the story and all achievements. You get a hoverbike, the Snowfox, but it's often easier and faster to just walk on foot.

The story is passable, though as a player of the Beta, I can't help think about how much better the story could have been, had the dev team stuck with the original outline. I understand some of it had to change, but they were so far along in making the original story, they weren't able to fully implement the new story without putting square pegs in round holes, so to speak. Al-an's history very much drives the story. In fact, if you ignore Robin's personal quest, the story really greatly expands on the world of 4546B, the Kharaa, and the Architects.

Base building isn't much different from the original. It's not my cup of tea to spend 60 minutes gathering resources to build a replica of Sea Lab 2020, but if you're into it, you might like it. There isn't much in the way of decoration, though. There are some environmental pieces found in the world that would have been easy to implement as buildable or placeable items, but they weren't implemented, probably due to the crunch caused by the story shift.

There are many points in the game where the story simply stops and the only way to advance it is to find things by exploring, with absolutely no hints given to where you need to go. Often times what you need to find is through some random twisting cave somewhere, with extreme low visibility. There is also no map and no sonar for the Seatruck.

Now, one thing I can say is that most of the criticisms of this game that I've read are silly. The story and characters are good. The creatures and environments are cool. The big problem for me is just the game's over-reliance on non-directed exploration with very little assistance. I suspect very few people actually like this type of gameplay when the environments are so difficult. You won't find anything by just casually exploring in this game.

The presence of so many twisting cave systems in particular will make this game unplayable for many.

This game has plenty of cool Subnautica lore, so if you liked the original, you could pick up this game on sale, just expect to use walkthroughs often if you don't want to go insane.

Overall maybe a 3/5 from me. Some of the creature encounters are great, but the gameplay is just otherwise not very good to me.

Alright now that the people who haven't played the game or dont care about spoilers are out of here i'm gonna talk about how this game is bad and good, unlike the original subnautica the map is smaller than the original crater, the levithans never really made me scared because I over-researched the game. It's the thought of something like the aurora being in a deep biome like the crystal caves, murky waters, hard to see in daytime, and ever harder to see at night. The only real thing that scares me now is spike traps, they're well done by camouflaging into the area that you're in, now lets talk about the story, the story is very good in my opinion because I didn't really wanna even go like searching for the actual lore in the PDA'S that are found around the map. Basically the way that they introduce you into the story is by saying ""basically ur sister is dead, go investigate because alterra said nothing about what happened"" the thing is sam's (main characters sister) storyline was actually required in the beta or alpha days, but instead the whole story was revamped to be different, if you own the game it is possible to play the old storyline, the game is beautiful but it does lack the original scary subnautica charm, and the music is made by a completely different guy who did make ONE song in Celeste. now for the downsides people have stated, the map is smaller leading for less exploration, the music isn't really scary, (except for that one bonus track, and the void... the void oh god... the void.) and its not scary really, and the story is forced onto you, one problem people have is that robin talks a lot. I don't really care because this allows me to actually understand what is happening without having to watch 99 videos. Should you get this game if its on discount, Absolutely, it's wicked fun and I didn't explain THE WHOLE DARN STORY. There are some HUGE bits of it I left out. I'd give this game a 8/10.

Silent character and sense of isolation: Your character is now a blabbermouth that never shuts up and has a full on sibling story.

Awesome underwater exploration: Prepare to be lost in an icy hell land segment that never seems to end, is extremely confusing with a worm that knocks you off your bike, its not even tense, its just annoying.

Cool vehicles?: Vehicles are now mostly the Seatruck which is like the worst of both worlds compared to the sub and the small fast vehicle from the first game, don't even get me started on the Snow Fox, its like a drunk driving simulator.

Vast open underwater world?: The world is much smaller, far shallower, less secrets, less excitement etc.

The failure of this game and destruction of all the potential for a great franchise reveals a general rule that can be applied to all things in life, as if the rule was intended by the creator himself. That rule is you can not use entertainment as a vehicle for subversion and expect to make good entertainment. There is only so much energy a developer has and if they are being asked to fill the universe with political narratives, the core of what makes good entertainment will be exhausted, in exactly the same way a parasite devours the energy of its host. A pozzed belief system introduced and forced into a previously untainted franchise will reflect the ugliness of that parasitical belief like a mirror. You can smell the subversion reflected while you play it, you can hear and see it permeating throughout the game. Everytime you catch the whiff of the developers politics you somehow feel infected by it, it is repulsive. The immersion is destroyed by the constant reminder of the degenerate and subversive ideals that drove the developers when they made this game. 

What exactly am I talking about? The best example is the main character. The noisy and intrusive main character that acts as the developers wish fulfilment. She was chosen on skin and gender to act as a vehicle for a narrative the developers wish was real, rather than as a vehicle to tell a good story based in reality. Every propaganda poster, every piece of lore found in a PDF to even the choice of voice for the altera computer system reveals the developers internal narrative, one that is founded in the delusion and insane narratives of the past two decades. Despite the sci-fi setting this is not a story based in the future. This is a story based in modern left wing politics and narratives who wish the world would reflect their internal views, but will only ever exist in the fantasies of this game, and the brainwashing of their minds.",1565445560,1703591448,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1: If you are a returning player from Subnautica 1, this game will feel extremely watered down. The leviathans aren't as scary nor dangerous. The designs aren't as imaginative. Too much of the map is completely safe which prevents those feelings of uncertainty that Subnautica 1 gives you, leading to a stale and boring experience.

2: You don't feel as isolated and alone, which was a major factor in why Subnautica 1 gave you such a unique experience. You have a couple people to talk to in this game as you explore.

3: The land exploration in this game is abysmal, and unfortunately, they decided to focus more on land exploration in this game. Anytime I needed to explore a chunk of land, I found myself wandering in circles for hours just trying to figure out where I needed to go. Ultimately, I had to look up a video guide on how to get the things I needed while on land, despite never looking stuff up in Subnautica before. I am not the type of person to get lost in video games. Remember what I said at the start of this review? I had just finished about a 5 hour trek on land finding some tiny item I needed... and then looked in my PDA and realized there's a whole other mass of land I have to explore to find something I need. Land exploration is not fun. And it seems Snow Stalkers can be killed by ""the tunneler"", which prevented me from ever getting the snow suit, which means I am constantly suffering from hypothermia on land.

4: While your character in Subnautica 1 is silent, Robin on the other hand talks way too much and pulls you out of the immersion.

5: The map feels very cramped because of the icebergs. The ocean doesn't feel as vast and deep as it did in Subnautica 1. 

6: The progression feels all over the place. I built my base in the lilipad zone and found myself wandering all over the place including beginning areas, with only a single plunge into the deeper part of the map so far, whereas Subnautica 1 felt like it had a gradual, consistent progression towards the deepest part of the game.

7: Below Zero should've been an expansion, or DLC, not its own game.

8: I feel like *my* exploration doesn't matter. It feels like the game is telling me what I should be doing, or else I can't progress. I hate that, because in the original subnautica *your* exploration matters. You can progress no matter how you explore. Below Zero on the other hand tells you what you need to go do and you absolutely need to do it no questions asked.

9: Last, but not least, I'm just not... interested in it anymore. I explored all over the place, built a mega base, and now I just feel like I'm being dragged across the ground to finish the last bit of the story. Subnautica presented the story in a very interesting way that hooked me in and made me want to search for more of it. But Below Zero... no.

Overall, I feel like this was just a poorly executed sequel trying to ride on the success of the original. Unknown Worlds, I loved subnautica 1, I played it off and on for 6 whole years even when it was in early access. However, I think you should try pivoting and making another game in another world, or perhaps keep the premise of subnautica but have it take place on another planet. Below Zero is definitely not it, and I'm disappointed in it. I'm still going to finish it just because I've played it for so long already, but it's starting to feel like I'm forcing myself to finish it rather than finishing it because I'm still fully enjoying it.",1703527163,1703527163,False,265,7,0.825299203395843506,0,True,False,False

The main subsea vehicle is Seatruck and it is made to move slow to compensate the smallness of aquatic world. The BZ world is realistic and full of life. I believe the game engine is upgraded with BZ and the graphics looks stunning. There are clear voice directions at the first half of the game. Jukebox inside the bases is a nice addition and you can listen to your own music collection while fabricating some stuff. My advice to any gamer is to play and finish another game inbetween the original Subnautica and BZ. You will enjoy the BZ more in that way.

Let's start with the pros:
- crafting was improved. You can now pin all parts of a recipe (so you don't have to memorize how a plasteel ingot is made, for example)
- progression was different and fresh. I didn't start with a habitat builder, for example (see also cons)
- a much more obvious story (see also cons)
- the seatruck (seamoth/cyclops replacement) was neat. I didn't really use any modules, but the concept was cool
- found squidshark eggs. swam with my little squidshark babies. life there was good
- I was looking for just a little bit more Subnautica gameplay, and if that's all that you're looking for, perhaps this is a good game for you
- I liked learning a bit more about the precursors

and on to the cons:
- the story was....kind of awful. you could complete the game without even completing what brought you to the planet in the first place. the final piece of this ""optional story"" is a crafted item you get a recipe for, but you don't actually do anything with it? it felt rather strange to get a recipe for something you had literally 0 use for. The characters were eh. the interaction with the friend you meet were OK, but left some to be desired. That friend's character was...also kind of OK? it had tie-ins to the first game which was a fun callback, but overall it felt very bland. 
- I felt like they gave you blueprints for some pretty critical pieces of equipment way too early. I got my PRAWN about the same time I got my first seatruck upgrade, which was maybe like a couple hours into the game? They focus so much on free diving that I found the rebreather very early, which made most of that trade off kind of a joke. 
- the voice acting is SO DISTRACTING. Contrast Riley (Subnautica) who is practically silent, with Robin, and you'd think i was playing an RPG instead of a survival/borderline-horror game. There was too much dialogue. existing dialogue was sometimes borderline horrible, and it decided to spoon-feed you the story at every turn/every wreck entered/every new area explored.
- the world is so small. what biomes there are feel quite empty. I also didn't really feel encouraged to explore. I was told if there was something cool in a biome or not (or had a map) so I didn't really have a sense of ""ooo what's over here"" that I got in Subnautica.
- all the biomes are too bright. even deep sea creatures you could see perfectly well in literally all circumstances and it didn't really feel like you were exploring the deep ocean
- the leviathans were poorly done. In Subnautica you had to either sneak past them, run like a little b****, get the perimeter defense module (which I didn't) or stasis rifle/knife them to death (or stasis->run). You are FORCED to interact with the leviathans 1-1 in BZ. they don't do that much damage to you (easy to repair), and once you get the perimeter defense module (I felt it was a necessity) I felt the leviathans were more of an annoyance rather than an actual threat. 
- for a game set after the bacteria is cured, there really isn't that much biodiversity? it felt like there were more creatures in Subnautica than there were in BZ. The fauna that did exist were kind of bland, in comparison, and nothing really stood out to me as ""YES. This is so cool"" (other than the squidsharks. the deep-ocean leviathan design was also cool, even if it was too bright for where you find it).
- I absolutely hated the land sections. Sure they gave you a cool new vehicle (I guess) but it was clunky, hard to use, never had the vast open space it needed to truly shine (maps were more maze-like with too many turns) could only be charged in one spot, and could ONLY be used on land. Unfortunately, much of the game's story revolved around land exploration and I hated every second of it
- resource scarcity was a joke, I was never afraid of drowning. never afraid of freezing. never afraid of damage. never afraid of running out of water or food. the game literally throws all of these things at you as if it's afraid that you're going to leave if the gameplay forces you to play more strategically.",1703386895,1703386895,False,4,0,0.545945942401885986,0,True,False,False

The game looks great, but is a very small underwhelming world. The creatures are very limited and less intense. The story is decently written, but the conclusions are very underwhelming, leaving a lot of the cooler alien/mysterious elements completely dead and not followed up on. The land segments and the snow speeder are fun for 5 minutes and then are an absolute chore for the remainder of time. Materials are plenty and completely unnecessary for the story and general construction. The Seatruck is okay, but is less deft/swift/nimble than I remember the Seamoth being, and as soon as you slap modules on it becomes very clunky and not that fun to drive. I would much rather pilot a submarine through the ocean. Lastly, the game starts off directing you to goals/areas to explore and drive to, but eventually stops giving you any direction, leaving you to wander aimlessly and try to dissect your PDA for leads. 

While the gameplay remains the same, the first Subnautica was a very different experience for me. 6/10",1703362514,1703362514,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The map is smaller in scale and story objectives appear directly on the HUD. There's a virtual companion to keep you company by chatting in your HUD for most of the game.

This time around the story is done very differently with much more dialogue and more cutscenes, but the game itself is much shorter and smaller in scope (original game took me 50 hours, this one took me 30). I do have some complaints that stand out in making this the lesser of the two games: 
- The map is much more vertical, less spread out but many more intricate caves that get very irritating to navigate and easy to get lost in.
- Less dangerous leviathans with dumber AI, which combined with your prior experience takes away nearly all of the fear-factor to this game that made the original so intriguing. 
- Glitches are just as bad as the original game, only this time my Snowfox (a hoverbike) got stuck under the snow which wasted a lot of my time. 

Besides these points though I believe the biggest problem with this game is it's too similar to the original. Not that that's inherently bad, but many players will lose interest because in many ways in both the gameplay and story you're doing the same thing over again. It's not a bad game by any means just a couple poor choices that make it a lesser sequel.

 - More weather patterns
 - More landmass to explore (Although, I see it as a major negative.)

 - Less awe inspiring moments (Moments that lets you gasp at how beautiful the areas are designed)
 - You are no longer the main character, you are playing someone else who is

Plot:
You know when you take a strip of fresh duct tape and drop it in sand, but you hope that its still usable and that it can hold stuff together? 
Thats exactly what the plot felt like.
Having played the earlier iteration of the story as well, it felt like there was no sense of direction for the story. And all they wanted to do, was push their own politically correct garbage.

Conclusion:
Sequels are supposed to be better than their predecessor. But in this case, it felt like they trimmed down what made the original Subnautica good, to try and make the game deliver a politically correct message.
HOWEVER, if you prefer base building, would recommend Subnautica 2. But if you prefer more exploration, vehicles, a better story and better underwater landscapes, I would recommend Subnautica.

The elements that made the first game an such amazing experience such as the fear inducing open waters are absent this time around, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game by any means. A lot of the elements that made the original enjoyable are still here and expanded upon in many ways that are better than the first. There are still wrecks and caves to explore with more emphasis on free diving, creatures to discover with far more personality, and bases to build with more little additions than the first game.

The game basically exchanges the small fish trying to survive in a very big pond feeling from the first game for a more story driven narrative. It's not as memorable of an experience (especially with some of the plot holes), but it works for directing you on where to go.

The good:
- hours of underwater adventure, this game has a lot of hours of gameplay
- beautiful designed, very aesthetic
- very good music, sometimes ambient sometimes a dubstep banger
- awesome story, just like the original game (I won't spoil anything)
- the amount of times I said ""ffs this is soooo cool!!"" 

The bad:
- not a fan of the voice acting of main character, she's supposed to be a scientist but sounds more like a kindergarten teacher
- it's story driven, so not as repayable as a sandbox survival game. Once you know the spoilers, you'll know where to find all the clues. The world is fixed, not generated.

COM ISSO, no quesito exploração, o primeiro jogo é melhor do que o segundo. O primeiro tem mais biomas, mais coisas pra explorar e o é jogo em si é mais LONGO.

Now, don't get me wrong. There are a lot of problems.

**SPLOILERS** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED if you don't want them, only read the lines above. They sum up my views on the game fairly aptly.

[spoiler] I was at first somewhat pessimistic about the inclusion of a protagonist that actually talked, as it made it feel like the journey I wanted to go on was being directed by someone else. In the original Subnautica (will will now be referred to as OGS), every discovery felt like something YOU made, and every piece of the puzzle that was found was like something YOU had perceived. With Robin chiming in every now and then, especially near the start of the game where she was ticking all the boxes for insanity. I still remember how at the start of the game you receive a message about the location where her sister had been, a perfect opportunity for the PC to figure out this small hint, only for Robin to pitch in and state the answer like she's Fi from Skyward Sword or something.

Of course, despite this huge, enormous downside, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy some of the conversations between Robin and Al-An. That is to say, I really don't think Robin knows how to take a hint sometimes. She's so bent on proving to Al-An that the human race isn't flawed it makes the flaws even more obvious. Because we're flawed. And that's okay.

I'm also going to talk about the leviathans and enemies for a bit. I'm not a fan of the design of the chelicerate. Let's face it: it looks like an oversized prawn. In all honesty, the squidshark looks more menacing. Although, I will admit the shadow leviathan is incredibly scary, as well as the ice worm, despite the latter being a bit buggy. I also disagree with the placement of the leviathan spawns. There was one that spawned in a meagre 200 meters away from my base, which I thought was in a safe space (twisty bridges, which I aptly named the coral tendrils biome, as I think twisty bridges sounds somewhat stupid). Really made the map feel small. I also dislike how some enemies are way too clumped together, such as the squidshark and cryptosuchus. When you see these in any large number you tend to get desensitised to any danger from them. Even the sheer number of shadow leviathans in the crystal caves started to become annoying after the third one in such a small amount of time.

I know not much can be done about it since the it's the game's setting and all, but the cold temperature game mechanic really just started to wear thin after I was done exploring the glacial basin and arctic spires. I died more times to the cold than I did anything else - including oxygen and leviathans combined, two things that are probably the scariest aspects of the game to most people.

Okay, now onto resources.
So it has occurred to me that it's too easy to survive. And that's saying something in a game series like Subnautica. in OGS, fish didn't spawn in. They reproduced, just like any normal fish. This meant that the more you took from the environment, the less there'd be. So, theoretically, you could hunt a fish to extinction. Now, that would normally be fine, as you could easily satiate your hunger by just taking a little from every species so none would be overly effected too much, or at least not enough to harm their population numbers. That would be fine if there was more than one way to get drinkable water. The bladderfish, if used at the rate needed to satiate thirst, would eventually be used all up and none would be left. This forced players to find different means, leading them to discover disinfected water, a better, more sustainable water source at the cost of exploration. A good learning tool. In Below Zero, I'm not sure if the bladderfish spawn in  or if they reproduce at an increased rate but I never, NEVER, had a problem getting water. This might be partly due to the fact that so many abandoned bases had water lying around you could probably fuel an entire army. [/spoiler]

I've noticed that this game splits the Subnautica fanbase, and the fault line is the purpose of you being on the planet. In Subnautica, you were dropped on a hostile planet and your objective was survival. The game's music and storyline emphasized that really well.

Below Zero is not like that at all. The theme feels more like exploration than survival. There are survival elements (actually, basically all the core gameplay mechanics are there, and are actually better in BZ), but the game's here to pull you through a beautiful world. It's much more serene and peaceful (though don't get me wrong, the ocean on 4546B doesn't stop being dangerous near the arctic), and you get a modular Seatruck!

Anyway, I am one of those who thinks BZ is better than the original. But honestly, just know what you're getting into.

The main story of big sister finding little sister basically fizzles out very quickly into the game. After this, there is not much reason in the story for Robin to continue other than to get some alien out of her head. 

The story was very shallow and the characters were not very likable. It would have been nice for this to be MY story and not Robins. I felt I was just along for the ride. 

I would have like to play as a chosen gender character.  It seems social politics got into this game. You play as a strong willed black woman and find every male character are either arrogant a@@holes or bumbling idiots. The woman characters are all either Marine commandos or brilliant scientists while the men are delivery guys or security. I felt the story went out of its way to put men down. This is not how I like to immerse into my game stories.  The story also had to thrown in the gratuitous gay plot-line into the story. Overall, the entire story rubbed me wrong. 

Environment - The world map is tiny compared to Subnautica. You go deep through a cave system that can be disorienting, but you don't go far in relative distance. There were several biomes were new and interesting. These were not as large and distinct as the original SN. 

Danger - There was both more and less danger. There were more creatures chasing and harassing your character, but little damage done by them. I found myself basically ignoring the creatures as there was little reason to really engage them. Even the leviathans were easily dealt with with just a push of a button. 

Summary for me: 
Overall Subnautica mechanics are still great. The story was a really turn off for me. The map and area to explore felt very confined. I hope the studio continues this line, but gets back to a bigger better game and story.",1702583994,1702583994,False,2,1,0.483221471309661865,0,True,False,False

While it doesn't nail the full aesthetic of the first game, it tightens up many of the core mechanics and ramps up the quality of its effects and environments.  Most of the game's core loop is so identical to the first game that it sort of ends up feeling like DLC, but enhanced with a handful of genuinely great improvements.

[hr][h3]Presentation Gets a Polish[/h3]
I personally think that [i]Below Zero[/i] has managed to improve the presentation of its world in nearly every department.

[u]Visuals & Environments[/u]
Greater saturation of exotic and beautiful environments to explore.  Nearly every biome is packed with incredible scenery and ideal building sites, so much so that you might even be paralyzed by the selection at times.  Good stuff top-to-bottom, including the new terrestrial (land-based) biomes.

[u]Music & Sound Design[/u]
Ben Prunty knocks it clean out of the park with his contribution to this game.  Prunty's style and talents are a perfect match for the setting and tone of these games, so I have to give it to him over Mr. Chylinski's admittedly stellar work from the original.

[hr][h3]Aesthetic Marred, but Still Strong[/h3]
[i]Below Zero[/i] unfortunately has a few misses in capturing the unique aesthetic of the original game, which I blame on two things:  the voiced protagonist (including fully voiced conversations with other living characters throughout the game's story moments) and the simplified delivery of its plot and story-related objectives.

You're no longer isolated on the planet all by yourself, and there's generally much more man-made (Alterra) infrastructure to be found throughout the world.  There are no more cryptic or disturbing radio transmissions that send you out into the world on a satisfying little treasure hunt for story bits and tech upgrades.  Each story-related location is sequentially marked directly on your screen, with no inclusion of puzzles or clues leading you along, while your NPC companion reveals small scraps of story at a time or rattles off some painfully cliched remarks about ""your inefficient human body"" or ""learning what 'love' is"" etc.  The side-characters featured in voice logs are still engaging and brilliantly voice-acted like those in the first game, and in my opnion more than make up for the occasional cringe delievered by the main duo.

[hr][h3]Resource Management Improves Across the Board[/h3]
[i]Below Zero[/i] has tightened up most of its core gameplay mechanics, improving fundamental aspects of the core building/gathering loop while adding a few brilliant quality-of-life features that don't break the game.

[u]Resource Nodes[/u]
A small but vital change has been made to the ""resource bucket"" system that governs which materials drop from the mineral resource nodes that provide the majority of the game's crafting materials.  You now have far more control over which resources you're taking in, allowing you to better manage your coffers without having to worry about throwing things out.

[u]New Features[/u]
First are the Sea Monkeys, which are passive creatures that gather minerals from your surroundings and drop them at your feet.  These guys saved my ass a handful of times out in the field when I just needed a single piece of titanium or silicon to polish off part of a building project.

Second is the Recylotron, which is a miraculous little machine that lets you un-craft nearly any craftable item into its base components, meaning you can do things like condense 50 titanium into 10 ingots (saving [i]40 slots[/i] of storage space), then recycle those 10 ingots back into 50 titanium back at your main base.  This small feature changes the game when it comes time to store and transport resources between bases, and does a decent job in making up for the loss of Cyclops storage capability.

[hr][h3]Vehicles Both a Hit [i]and[/i] a Miss[/h3]
Sadly, two of the best vehicles from the first [i]Subnautica[/i] have been removed from [i]Below Zero[/i]:  the Seamoth and the Cyclops.  The Prawn suit does return fully intact from the original, which helps quite a bit to ease the pain of so much loss.  There's also a new land vehicle called the Snowfox, which is fun to control but poorly-implemented.

[u]The Seatruck[/u]
More streamlined and fluid to operate than the Cyclops, but missing nearly 100% of the cool factor and aesthetic charm.  You can still dock the Prawn suit, and detach the cabin for Seamoth-[i]like[/i] controls, but I can almost guarantee that you'll miss the old vehicles for a while.

[u]The Snowfox[/u]
A new land-based hoverbike vehicle; great fun to control and play with, but sloppily designed otherwise and poorly-integrated into the rest of the game.  Despite having two upgrade slots visible on the bike's in-game model, you can only install a single upgrade.  This really sucks, because the ability to jump (which is crucial to having fun with the bike) takes up a slot all by itself.  Furthermore, on certain terrain it seemed impossible to avoid the attacks of the [spoiler]Ice Worm leviathan[/spoiler], which were frequently capable of stun-locking me off of the bike and preventing me from escaping until I simply packed up the bike and ran away on foot.  At the end of the day, the Prawn suit outperformed the Snowfox in top speed, agility, storage, and personal defense, so it feels like a rushed or wasted feature that could have been really great.

[hr][h3]Concluding Remarks[/h3]
As I stated at the beginning, I am a huge fan of [i]Below Zero[/i] and think it's a fantastic sequel to the original [i]Subnautica[/i].  I was skeptical for a long time, but once I got absorbed into the new setting and started getting invested in exploring and developing my bases/infrastructure, I was easily swept away by the incredible environments, music, and overall immersion factor that makes these games so special to me.  The game's ending is legitimately satisfying to experience, and (despite some tonal hiccups) an astounding amount of the original's charm managed to slip into [i]Below Zero[/i] by way of its brilliantly-voiced side characters and intimately detailed world.

It has all the mechanics and gameplay of the original, but with a new story and environment to play in - and different props and vehicles to play with - it also has all of the same bugs and quirks, so don't expect it to be more polished than its progenitor.

Below Zero is a much more guided experience than the original (in a good way) - the experience unfolds from biome to biome significantly more naturally, and I never felt the need to reach for the wiki in the same way that I did with the original.  It is also, however, significantly smaller - both in direct scale and because 1/3 of the map is taken-up by above-ground snowy mountains and icebergs.

The above-ground gameplay, while not quite as bad as the original, is still this game's weakest point, and I was grateful when I had served my time in those monotonous mountainous mazes and could return to the more interesting underwater environments.  

With the map being that much smaller, though, the biomes you [i]do[/i] encounter are significantly smaller and fewer in number, making exploration feel much less rewarding; coupled with the game's more effective guidance, you end-up spending so little time in each biome that they never progress beyond feeling liminal.  

The game seems to encourage you to avoid lingering, too: the Seamoth and Cyclops have been replaced with a single submersible: the Seatruck, which can be extended with a variety of modules to obsolete almost every aspect of base-building, allowing you to perpetually stay on the move.  There's no functional reason to build a base beyond recharging batteries, so that aspect of the game has been relegated to an opt-in feature for those that enjoy it.

The leviathans and fauna, too, have been streamlined - their number and variety significantly reduced, and their behaviour homogenised - this has the effect of nullifying the horror aspect of the game from quite early on, as once you have the perimeter defence system up on the Seatruck, everything will leave you alone after a quick zap.  Where each creature from the original had a distinct call that could easily be identified, these new ones all fill the soundscape and blur into one, making aural scouting nigh impossible and removing that aspect of gameplay entirely.

Below Zero is a fine game and, for fans of Subnautica, it will scratch that [i]particular[/i] itch the series creates - but it doesn't hold a candle to the original and I would recommend it only to fans craving that underwater-exploration vibe.",1701901612,1701901612,True,85,0,0.875410497188568115,0,True,False,False

You don't see VR support listed on the shop site? Well that's because the developers decided not to implement it for whatever reason! Luckily the original Subnautica had some more or less broken VR support and the engine is the same. Even many of the assets have been re-used. So in 2023 modders were finally able to fix all VR issues and also add motion controller support. The VR mod is called Submersed and you'll find it and it's BZ version on Github. Without it I wouldn't even have considered playing BZ. I played the first Subnautica without VR about as far as it was possible in the early Early Access versions and liked it. But I never finished the game when it was done. I already had the biggest and coolest submarine in the game so I wanted to resume the game when there are other submarines have been added. Turned out they didn't add any more submarines even though there was also some concept art. Modders have also added new submarines meanwhile by the way.  I tried to get into the Game in VR several times but it was too broken and using an X-Box controller it didn't feel right anyway. Also back then I had bad VR headsets with a thick cable and a bad display, But now with the PICO 4, the submersed mod opened up both Subnautica games for me, I'm so thankful to the modders who did this! Swimming and diving in these beautiful underwater worlds in VR is just awesome and unique, no other game as far as I know! I'm am about half way through BZ yet and still can't tell which of both is Subnauticas is better, I like that BZ is more focussed on exploration and there are a lot of smaller improvements to the gameplay. In the original Subnautica everything tries to kill and in a game without any weapons apart from a knife, this really sucks. So I just ended up setting the 3 biggest predators with mods on passive in the original Subnautica because I saw no point in exiting my submarine to get in a knife fight with a whale-sized shark so my sub doesn't get eaten. In BZ the fauna is a lot less agressive and you always can easily escape or evade the whale-sharks that are there. So if this is your first Subnautica and you want to explore underwater worlds in VR, I'd say start with BZ.",1701548680,1701548680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In Subnautica we have the seamoth, the prawn suit and the cyclops. In my Subnautica review I thought that it would be nice to have more vessels but in retrospect it is a very good lineup which I missed in Below Zero.
The seatruck is slower and less maneuverable than the seamoth and with all its modules it's too big for the deeper areas. When you bump into anything you will be shaken around that it causes motion sickness.
For exploring the land sections we have the snowfox. The handling is even worse than the handling of the seatruck and for me it also causes motion sickness.

The (deep) twisty bridges and in general the whole Below Zero world looks great but the caves are tighter and more confusing than in the first Subnautica. I have definitely spent too much time to get to the right location. The land section is big and also confusing. In Below Zero I get lost very often both on land and in the water.

It's shorter than the first game and not as good as the first ether. Took me a half a year to beat the first Subnautica. This only took me...a few weeks. But this is mostly because I got used to giant leviathan creatures especially once I get the prawn suit. I was a bigger 'bitch baby' than Markiplier before discovering means to defend myself. Even when in deathly combat with two shadow leviathans had nerves of steel when...in something made out of steel.

Like the first, it's a survival Minecraft like game in an ocean environment where you try to escape an ocean world full of beauty and terror. But this time surviving an arctic location so you could freeze your nuts off like a trip to a Klingon penal colony if not careful. On the surface mind you. It's...actually warmer in the ocean. Don't ask, video game physics is always weird and ignores real life physics.

It is much like the first. The isolation is there. Plenty of deadly creatures big and small. Have to search wreckage and abandoned bases for plans to build your own bases, vehicles and gear. Did I mention the isolation. It won't take long to suspect one of the penguins is having an affair with your only companion being a rotten arctic pepper with a drawn on face...and on a stick. ""SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT!"" Penguin with an island drink and cigar winking at me. I look to my Arctic Pepper on a Stick companion, ""Proceed!""

But the story is different. There is one other human there too, but she's not that social. Trust me you're better off with an inanimate object as a companion still...stop smashing my pepper, penguin. Like something out of Korikatsu Sunshine when it makes that face. And you're not there by accident this time but to find your sister, no further spoilers there, and to eventually leave the planet but with a new alien companion and again no further spoilers. Okay so you're not totally isolated here, but the woman is a hardened survivalist with ""get off my lawn"" energy and the alien...can't spoil that. Still your best friend will be...how did you get pregnant from...nevermind.

The game does have it's cons however. While the seatruck was nice and there is now a speeder bike, I moved around the entire game with a prawn suit. Just tanked around the ocean and frozen wonderland like a Morden Soldier from Metal Slug. Why did it take me this long to recognize this suit's design from that? Seriously there is a vehicle in the Metal Slug series that's much like the prawn suit but cartoony. Think it showed up in...3? or 2 aka XX? Whatever this is not about that. Once I got the mech, didn't bother with the other vehicles. Punched or shoot torps at the leviathans when they attacked, repaired my mech when away, rinse and repeat till have to return to base for recharging. Minus the Ice Worm mostly avoided this by stuck close to the walls and NEVER travel in open spaces for too long. It did one shot my prawn when I tried to fight it.

The map is noticeably smaller. First game was huge compared to this. Not nearly as deep ether. The first was 1500m deep when at the Sea Emperor Base. Here the final area was barely 1000m or less? Whatever the real ocean's depths for abyssal plains is around 3000 to 6000m and can be deeper than this. There's a reason normally only robots or James Cameron can go down there in real life.

But the cons are minor the game is still as solid as the first but just not as good yet not at all disappointing. I'd still suggest playing the first before this being the masterpiece game, yet playing this first isn't a bad choice ether.

That's about it. Bu-Bye! The Pepper on a Stick left me for the penguin. Now I have Misses Creepvine! Wait! Do I already have a computer wife?",1701457306,1701457567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If steam had a neutral recommendation I would put it at that, but I can't in good conscious recommend it at it's price point, and for what you get from it compared to the first game.

[h2] What it does right [/h2]

- It adds a lot of QOL changes that are very welcome that weren't in the first Subnautica like making base building much easier and broader, or adding the mineral tracker, to even smaller things like nice HUD changes that can help you out like the resource collection for crafting and what not.

- The actual design of the areas and detail is really nice and appealing. You can tell they put a lot of love into the modeling and decorating. 

- Regardless of the map being smaller, it does feel more condensed which makes travel less of a pain, and easier for finding what you need.

- The themeing/setting of it being in the arctic is really cool and the weather provides a nice atmosphere to the game.

- It's still Subnautica. it's still an underwater survival game, and I did enjoy seeing new things and ideas the devs had for it.

[h2] What it does wrong [/h2]

- The story is VERY subpar, which is sad to see as I followed this game very closely when it was still in early access. They changed the story drastically and even scrapped the whole thing at one point to re-do it. But even with all the changes, it still isn't really that good.

- It feels more like a scavenger hunt, that you can branch off and explore, rather than a whole world free at your fingertips. It's still open world, and there are no limitations like in the first game, but the fact that the game tells you what to do next instead of letting you figure it out on your own, takes away from the joy of being on an alien planet with no help but your PDA. I feel like I'm being taken on a tour rather than being a lone survivor.

- Of course, one of the biggest complaints is that the world is much smaller. roughly only 1/3rd the size of the original game, and a good third of Sub Zero is all on land which can be a pain navigating. 

- The fish are not nearly as scary as the first game, and its very sad to see. There isn't much horror factor anymore. There are definitely some areas that can get tense, but not like the first game.

-  Being on land can get very buggy and tedious. The freeze mechanic is annoying to deal with, and the Snowfox can get stuck on A LOT of things. I don't mind being on land, just make it more enjoyable. There was never a point where I said ""Oh sweet, I get to go back on land."" It was always ""great... I have to go back on land...""

- The removal of the Cyclops really sucks. The new Seatruck is just an offbrand version, and while it's a cool idea, I liked the idea of constantly upgrading to something bigger and better along the way. Like going from the Seamoth, to the prawn suit, to the cyclops was a great feeling of progression. Having the Cyclops as a mobile base was super fun too, and you can kind of do that with the Seatruck but it's very barebones with little space.

[h2] Small Nitpicks [/h2]

- They changed the voice of the new PDA system. It doesn't sound as ""robot-y"" as the first game. The dialogue for the PDA also doesn't feel as snarky as the first game did. It almost feels super monotone. And the PDA has a strong accent, which just felt weird to me. It didn't really feel like an AI, it just felt like an off-brand GLaDOS. 

- The new AI companion AL-AN isn't very amusing, and honestly quite boring. A lot of his dialogue feels forced and un-intriguing. 

- In early access they added a small camera for when you back-up the Seatruck, so you can see how close you are to hitting something, and that made it super nice navigating. It broke my heart seeing it removed for the final version because that was such a welcome change.

- They removed the stasis rifle... why? -.-

[h1] TL;DR 5/10[/h1]

I enjoyed the game for sure, but over time I just couldn't bring myself to beat. I honestly just got bored... I feel like I explored the game super quickly, and I never really had the passion or want to go back and play it. I just... stopped. Overall, It's a good game for sure, has some great moments and exploration was fun while it lasted, but it got stale very quickly. Was very disappointed with the final product.

I've done 2 solid playthroughs and will start a third.  I have such mixed feelings on this even though I do fully recommend it.  The story got worse.  Huge plot holes between the first and second game.  People that have played will know what I mean so I will keep it spoiler free.  Essentially on the timeline you have an event.  10 years later you have the first game taking place.  2 years after that you have this one.  

You're going to play the games in order.  So that's where you run into a problem.  The first game had you afraid of everything.  15 hours later you were brave enough to take on anything you saw.  Then you come to Below Zero with that bravery and that has a cost.  The original game said alot without saying anything.  It was 99% data recordings and you had no idea of any plot so everything was a surprise.  The second game took a more active approach to the plot and the story but had a writer change and a rewrite.  The story follows the dialogue of 2 characters.  One character is interesting, with terrible development, the other character is developed but not interesting.  A third character exists, but I don't know why and doesn't offer much.  I don't want to spend too much time going over all the reasons I don't like the story; I'll just leave it at the fact that it is obvious that the writer changes and rewrites suffered due to what happened.

It's hard not to treat this as a separate game.  It's not, but we do.  The cyclops doesn't fit into this region.  It's too big, too loud and and just won't work.  So you get the sea truck.  The slower than the sea moth, not as fun as the cyclops attempt at a compromise.  It's not a big issue.  I stay in the prawn 90% of the game anyway.  Had this been a part of the original and followed the same character and I sailed my Cyclops out there and saw it was worthless I wouldn't have cared.  The building is alot better in this one, so much so that they moved parts of it back into the original.

Because it's an independently existing expansion it's easy to compare them as the same game with less features, or a sequel that went backwards.  $60 for both without a sale.  I have about 80 hours total between the two.  At 30/30 the first game is a steal, and this one is on the fence.  At 40/20 it's fair pricing.  I'm super picky about story writing and character development.  I shoot for 1 hour per dollar for story driven games and I am about 4 shy before my next playthrough.  I don't hate the game.  I dislike the story.  I would still buy it, play it and moan about it being a 7.5-8/10 just because the first one hit that 10/10 mark.

the concept of the seatrain is in theory a very interesting concept but didn't work well in the game. no comparison to the good old cyclops.

There are two stories, it appears that what happened to her sister is the main story line but it's not and can be ignored.  Only the alien story needs to be completed to finish the game.  I treat the game as an exploration base builder now and pretty much ignore both stories unless a step grants me something I need.

The story in this one was weak by comparison. The public diversity scandal while developing weighed heavy on the creators and it showed in the final game. The characters they created were all annoying at best. The story had promise, but failed. The game play had far less mystery and reward.

The game is playable. It is entertaining. But it is so inferior to the fist game I cannot give it a positive review.

The main flaw for me is the feeling when you are exploring. Somehow the second game's exploration feels slower and cramped while the first game's world felt expansive and your character and vehicles seemed to move quick enough to satisfy. Subnautica has many large open biomes. It's also a darker game, (literal dark, not figurative), so there are limits to what you can see in several biomes and a whole lot of 'unknown' around you. Below Zero has very defined space where you can usually see all the ""walls"" around you. It is well lit the majority of the time via glowing flora and fauna. 

In the first game it felt like I was always working to improve how I survive... I don't really feel that push/accomplishment in Below Zero.  

I'm still ""okay"" with the story so far. I think the focus being on Sam who you don't meet in game is a bit of a mistake as I found myself not caring much. Alan was also a kinda of ho hum but I was more invested in him than Sam. Honestly though Honestly though Fred was more interesting than both Sam and Alan. I'm not nearly as invested as I was in this game as I was with a silent protagonist in the first game. It's not that I think silence is better, it's that Robin does not react/respond at all how I think most people would in the scenario she is in. Even the advertising displays this with her calmly swimming away from death without a scuba mask. Seriously. 

I think the creature designs are lovely along with the new flora. It's a pretty game. 

(If you can't handle the leviathans and that is keeping you from trying Subnautica/Subnautica Below Zero, please know there are console commands and mods that can let you play the games like they are enemy-less survival games; you'll still see them but they will ignore your existence. 'Creative' mode exists in both but that also unlocks everything spoiling one of the aspects I enjoy in regular game play thus why I mention mods/commands.)",1670198940,1700937868,True,51,0,0.820981204509735107,0,True,False,False

Fuck that vehicle and give me back the Cyclops and Seamoth in a game that actually utilizes their strengths and rewards exploration; not bumper car simulator.

Beautiful enviornments are a fun to explore, but the game's biggest strengths are also its drawbacks. You will feel tense and irritated as you navigate in the mid-to-late game because each environment is isolated from others in their own complex and confusing labyrinths that do not allow for the fucking horrible Seatruck to enable your expeditions. If you were a fan of the exploration via mobile base from Subnautica OG, you will be let down in Below Zero. That said, exploration was still fun.

+Awesome new fauna and flora
+Awesome soundtrack
+Jukebox! With some really awesome tunes
+You can take the jukebox with you and play your tunes while you travel in the seatruck
+Jukebox speakers throughout your base
+More challenging early game w/ lack of Altera tech and complex starting area
+Recipe improvements from Subnautica 1
+Iconic and cute Peeper is still here! Albeit an Arctic version
+Prawn suit navigates much better. More smooth movement and less clunky
+Ore Veins are added
+Land areas were beautiful and fun
+Challenging new hostile land based creatures and Leviathans
+Seamonkeys! Albeit, they're a nuisance at first
+Beautiful environment details; however because of the increased environment beauty some barren areas seem out-of-place
+A lot more leviathans in this game. Some that are even passive/non-hostile. The big baddy is terrifying looking despite it's dumb AI.
+Great new additions to base pieces, placeables, and new recipes. Base building is very fun

+/-VASTLY more verticality than Subnautica 1. Definitely to a fault in some areas of the game. 
+/-Map feels smaller due to the verticality, but as you explore more the sense of scale vastly grows
+/-Main pretense of the story was to find out what happened to your sister. But what exactly is the cover-up? Where did all the others go? Why did Altera evacuate this part of 4546B too? Story kind of flutters out despite some heroics by your sister.
+/-(minor spoiler) Interesting dynamic discovering an alive Architect (aliens from Subnautica 1) and becoming a companion with them if you discover them early enough. Massive cliffhanger in the end though.

-Horror/fear aspect is gone/extremely diminished when compared to Subnautica 1.
-Dumb Leviathan & hostile fauna AI. Attacks you by latching onto your vehicle. Will never do a kill amount of damage, unless your vehicle is low hp, then runs away as if it never knew you were there. The camera movement in this is so jarring as it forces your camera to face the leviathan like in the first game, but then throws you back to your original camera position afterwards. This removes a lot of tension in fear, because even outside of a vehicle the Leviathans will hit you once, then run off. never a kill in 1 hit.
-Thermal recharge module is only available for the Prawn, but it's fine... you'll never really have the opportunity to use it. More efficient to carry extra power cells.
------NO CYCLOPS!
------Map wasn't designed to support the size of a vehicle like the Cyclops. Then again, it wasn't for the fucking Seatruck either.
------NO SEAMOTH!
---Many, many linear caves and areas to explore in which the entrance is also the ONLY exit. Becomes jarring and heavily punishes taking the wrong turn. You will backtrack a lot until you memorize landscapes and paths
-You will get lost; a lot due to the labyrinth-like cave networks; especially early game
-Torpedoes still suck
-Hoverfox is a nightmare to drive and motion sickness inducing. You're better off using the Prawn suit to navigate the land areas; at least this way you can easily fight the hostile fauna
-Holy bumper cars batman! You will hit terrain A LOT with the clunky sea truck. Make sure you always have a repair tool on hand with an extra battery!
-Seatruck mobility is all over the place. It's moves like a bag of bricks being drug through the water, but it can turn its axis on a dime in any direction at immense speeds.
----Never felt compelled to build another base outside of the starter area. This is because every area in which you'd need to explore or go to for specific resources are so complex in their pathways and disconnected from one another that it would only become more tedious to travel around. It was more effective and less tedious to dive down into an area for what you need, sail back up, then return to base. This is by far by biggest complaint with the game when you factor in how horrible the Seatruck is.
---Get rid of the seatruck. It's horrible. Seriously, fuck that thing. I loved the teleportation module (never needed to use it though because of linear map design, poor navigation with the seatruck, and extremely limited ion cube supply), the storage modules were fine but inferior to the cyclops, sleeping module was awesome especially for the juke box, fabrication module needed more supply.
-----GET RID OF THE SEATRUCK!
-----Even with a horsepower upgrade (base move speed increase; not a boost) you will still move slower than if you were swimming on your own when at 4 modules. This is not fun and ruins so much gameplay potential because of how frustratingly slow this is. Also, why the fuck would you want a long train like or semitruck like vehicle to use in the insane caves and claustrophobic pathways in this game? I get the point is to detach the pilot cabin from the modules, but then that defeats the whole purpose of a mobile base. Really missed the mark with the seatruck. hate it.",1700899681,1700900474,True,41,3,0.814435720443725586,0,True,False,False

Contrary to what people said that the game is not as good as the original, well, I can say they are totally wrong. 
Not as vast and as deep as the original Subnautica, but still feels magical. The underwater landscapes are breathtaking and can give you thalassophobia when playing. It feels more claustrophobic than the original because this one is more focused on cavern/crevice and above-water arctic exploration.

Subnautica 3 is announced, I hope it gets deeper than the existing Subnautica, maybe like 4-5 km deep?

For a survival and exploration under water (and sometimes above water) game, the Subnautica IP shines.  Here is what I like about it:

 - it is immersive: the environments (biomes as they are usually known by) range from beautiful, to terrifyingly beautiful.  The graphics and colour palettes are very well designed to inspire a range of emotions in the player (from happy and safe to spooky and terrifying).  The sound complements both the graphics and the play - the music and sounds are fantastic.
 - the gameplay is excellent: whether you are a new player or a veteran from the original Subnautica title, finding rocks, crystals, flora and fauna, and mining them for materials is great because it allows you to start crafting tools, bases and vehicles to help you explore further, and deeper into the unknown.  Couple this with aspects of survival, where you have to worry about your oxygen supply, and feed and water yourself (and soon ensure you are warm enough) and you have a fantastic combination for game that will keep you coming back for more.  When you complete the game, there are other game modes that you can explore (Hardcore = one life, Freedom, like Survival but no food, water and cold requirements, and Creative = god powers that let you build and explore without fear of dying or running out of materials).

Conclusion: if you want to get an early start on the game and be part of Early Access community, and you don't mind helping to find bugs in the game, and improving its features, then get it now - it's worth it.  If you want to wait for a polished final release then wait for it, its also worth it.

I was there in Early Access:
 - as Early Access titles, you expect the bugs, but with each update (and they are very frequent) the bugs are squashed and new content emerges.  Each iteration gets better and better, and if the original Subnautica title is a baseline for what the final product is released then you as a player will get your moneys worth.
 - you have a voice in EA: both as part of the early access and final release, the Subnautica titles have a built-in feedback (communication tool) that allows you the player a voice directly to the dev team).  I attribute much of their success to this tool as it helps the title become more polished and relevant to its fans as the work is developed and after it is released.  This tool (F8 in game) allows the community of players to find bugs, especially in the early access, and make the game better as the devs squash the bugs.  It also allows the player community to voice what features they like or don't like in the game, and allows the player community to get a game that THEY like.",1574882873,1700537639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The things they did well, Base building felt cooler. Graphics ticked up a notch....and yeah thats about it. They also did do a good job of fleshing out details from the previous game and giving a lot of answers where there were none before. So I appreciated that.

I think the devs really missed why people loved the first game. I came late to the party and both games were already out and no one even mentioned the second one. And I know these points have already been brought up but its worth reiterating. 

1. The map is a tall build. It seems like a smaller map with much deeper sections but in small caves and twisting turns. I do not consider myself a noob but wow I had to look up videos on how to get to certain places because it is not intuitive nor do you have a way to solve it in game. It also kind of takes away the vast ocean feel. It didn't feel like the first game map where you could pick a direction and explore.

2. Due to the map choices it limited that feeling of running into a Leviathan. I don't think I ever had a point where I thought ""I might not survive this"". That takes away a huge chunk of the experience. 

3. they made the fallout 4 mistake. You can't suddenly give your character a voice and then a deeply personal reason to care about the story. the first game I was myself trying to survive in order to go home. I even put personal pics in the game file to put photos up in my base and give a personal touch. Personally I didn't like that, some people may not care but I don't think it added anything and every time she spoke it reset my own story line for why my character was there. Its no longer your character and you're playing as someone else. personal thing for me to is that If im playing a game then I like to play as my own gender and hear that voice. That made it harder for me to care about the story line because I could never get into the character. First game I was myself and RPGed my reasons. I was expecting that for this one. Very small detail that probably only bugged me. 

4. Vehicles, once again due to the map size the vehicles were so so. I wanted a Cyclops submarine that I could move my mobile base around and explore this massive map. Instead I got a seatruck. Which I promptly named Tonka and proceeded to smash it around the tiny maze cave systems they forced me to get lost in.

5. I like the idea of some land but not in the way they integrated it. Wandering around the cold sucked and then the vehicle to use for land you can't even build until you don't really need it anymore. 

Overall I think Devs missed the mark on why everyone loved the first one so much. I'm hoping for the third one and equally am hopeful they go back to what made it such a good game. 

I did like it overall and it helped stretch my subnautica experience so I appreciated that. That said, When I play Subnautica, I play the first one and the only thing I miss is the jukebox they added in this.",1700292251,1700292251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the main thing which makes it worse than the original is that you feel a lot more in control. You chose to be there, you have a mission, you have a bunch of tech and blueprints. I never got the feeling of being powerless and alone that I got in the original. There's never that moment when you climb onto the roof of your pod and are daunted by being totally surrounded by an alien ocean. The environment just didn't feel as threatening. Hearing the character speak also broke the immersion for me, it made me aware I was controlling a character where in the original I felt like I was the character.

Trying to be fair here, having played the original first probably also contributed, but not feeling like I was fighting for survival with a load of unanswered questions meant I never really felt the need to e.g. set up a base. In the original I didn't know how long I would be on 4546B, or how I would escape, and the pacing meant there was downtime where carving out a little safe space in the form of a base seemed like a priority. Then later I found eggs and strange fish and new blueprints and new resources and new plants to grow, so the base naturally expanded into something quite large. That's still how I like to replay the original now.

In Below Zero I always felt like I was on 4546B temporarily and with a clear mission. I almost always had another way point I could just go straight to. There was much less uncertainty so building anything more than a basic base didn't seem necessary, let alone a base with a load of aquariums etc. so I could carry out research.

I've used base building as an example because its something I enjoy in the original but the general feeling I've described affects a lot of the game. As other examples: why should I explore, or scan flora and fauna, or figure out which species an egg hatches into when its not really relevant to my mission? When I could just go straight to the next way point? There just isn't the imperative to go deeper. Below Zero just doesn't have the magic of the original.

A couple of other things I didn't like:
- The map is a lot smaller. To compensate for this they've made large chunks of it a confusing maze, presumably to try and make it feel bigger, which doesn't really work. It robs you of some of the grandeur that the original Subnautica map has. There's less awe as you enter a huge cave or see a load of reefbacks over a sweeping slope of red sea grass.
- There's a stupid penguin robot that's really tedious to use.

I've probably made Below Zero sound worse than it is so let me be clear: if I'd played this without playing the original Subnautica I'd think it was great. However, the original Subnautica was, and is, amazing. It is my favourite game ever.

[*] [b] Quality of life[/b] : Everything feels so smooth. Starter tools are easy to get and right where you need them, advanced recipes cost less, resource usage is streamlined (no more lockers full of diamond and lead), items can be recycled, and the game can be paused while reading your PDA. You can have a map now!
The new Seatruck is great; The agility of the Seamoth with the utility of the Cyclops. Everything you need in a single package. Did i mention it is modular?

[*] [b] Exploration / Interactions[/b] : indubitably Below Zero's strong point. There is more to do in the different biomes now. Not going to spoil anything, but more things are happening in general. The gorgeous and everchanging Weather and the different surface sections are a welcome change of pace as well (except for the ice worms, that part is bad).

[*] [b] Thalassophobia[/b] : no, not scary. It's too compact, too clean, too well lit. Whatever could have happened, there was always a way out. I've never felt pressured. Which in turn makes for a smoother exploration, which is ultimately what Below Zero aims for. No complaints here then.

I hope it lives up to it's big brother.


See you on 4546B.

Well, ive played a good few minutes and I can say I'm excited for the future. Obviously its early access so there's a lot of barren areas and unfinished things, a few bugs and some item descriptions written in file names.

But it's subnautica, with ice. And square rooms yessssss.

If you loved Subnautica then this is worth it 100%. If you're interested in this, buy and play Subnautica. Once you're done having fun with that gem, this one will be a lot more fleshed out.

First off, the content of the game itself. Where does it fall short, relative to the first Subnautica? Well, the Seatruck simply sucks in comparison to the Seamoth+Cyclops combo. Sure, it's modularity is cool in a sense, but in general it feels so much worse than what we had before. The Cyclops felt like a mobile-base, and it literally was. The Seatruck just feels shallow (pun intended) in comparison, even if it serves roughly the same functions. Then, there's the feeling of aimlessness this game provides at some point. I have way too many hours for how short the game can be, and it's because I stopped playing it halfway through like 3 or 4 times. There just comes a point where you've made a base, upgraded your everything as much as you can, and I ended up losing interest because any and all direction is super lacking. It took a fifth playthrough where I consciously forced myself to finish it.

What about the state of the game, the polish, rather than it's content? Rough, to say the least. First and foremost, this game had a real affinity for crashing on my system. And on top of that, there's no autosave function. This lead to multiple cases of losing hours of progress, until I finally drilled it into my head to save every ten minutes. Let's be real, it's (insert modern year), we shouldn't have to put up with this. Then, there were just awful bugs and unpolished stuff going on otherwise too. What's that weird looking stuff loading in? Oh wait, that's just stuff that HASN'T loaded in, and then suddenly the landscape morphs into what's actually there. Weird. Ugh, the Snowfox just fell through the map again. It gets tiring to be honest, it feels like an early access title.

Now, all that said, I'm still recommending it. Why? Well, let's first say this; if you haven't played the original Subnautica, go play that instead of this. Come on back afterwards and ask yourself, ""How much did I enjoy Subnautica?"" Because if the answer is ""A lot,"" then you should get this too. Personally, I liked the environment of this game much more than the first. The icy depths and all the vivid biomes were visually delicious. And that right there is the main thing that I always loved about this series. The exploration, the atmosphere, just the setting itself is incredible. There aren't too many series or games out there that give you that feeling, making exploration such a focus. If you value that stuff like I do, grab this title too. It ended up being worth the struggle.",1699944405,1699944405,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False
848450,150101155,76561198030691235,222,1,2535,0,2535,1699729231,"It's almost as if the studio did not understand what made Subnautica good in the first place.

What made Subnautica great: 

1. Map Design:

 Not only were the deep trenches of subnautica scary, but pushing into them was paramount to player progress. Facing your fears head on was rewarded with new information, materials, blueprints, and incredible spectacle. Subnautica had far reaching and wide expanding biomes that offered a lot of space to explore and even build. 

Below Zero chooses to build deep, not far. Instead of having new and interesting biomes, we have a few biomes that are filled with needlessly intricate maze like caves, often holding unique and important upgrades for your seafaring vehicles. These caves are often filled with twists and turns, and so occupied that not even your smallest vehicle can fit through without taking extensive damage. I would almost liken these to the Paris catacombs where many dozens of experienced explores lie dead due to the needless expansiveness of them. (These often hold important upgrades that cannot be found anywhere else, despite other upgrades being founds in hundreds of locations)

2. Vehicles: 

In the first subnautica we had the seamoth, prawn, and cyclops. Below zero is far too condensed and shallow to allow a vehicle like the cyclops to operate properly, so instead we have the Seatruck. The Seatruck is slower and less maneuverable than the Seamoth and even with its module add-ons it does not provide the 'moving base' aspects of the cyclops. Its 'Storage' module addition provides about the same amount as the player character itself, very clearly not worth the hit to its already terrible speed and maneuverability.  It is not the best of either world and is a general downgrade from both the Seamoth and Cyclops respectively. 

The addition of the Snowfox for the land section would have been better handled if the player could get all blueprints as soon as they reached the land section. As it stands, you must nearly reach the end of the land based section to even get the needed blueprints before spending an inordinate amount of time backtracking to the Seatruck or a base to gather the needed materials, then craft the new vehicle. An additional 3 minutes on foot would get you to the last needed area without the use of this vehicle thus circumventing its usefulness entirely, as well as a special suit that also requires the use of a machine without any explanation, and it usually achieved well after its usefulness has expired. 

 The Snowfox also has insanely poor handling. While most vehicles turn with player perspective, the Snowfox requires turning perspective, holding either left or right, as well as moving forward. It makes for a very clunky experience for something that is supposed to glide smoothly over land. 

3. Story: 

The charm of Subnautica came from the subtle humor of Alterra not caring about you or really anything on this planet that would not prove profitable. You feel the isolation, and you also feel the cold and callous approach that Alterra takes for this ""rescue"" attempt. You slowly gather clues that lead to a much darker and sinister history of this planet which is also directly affecting you, your health, and your rescue attempts. While not directly told to pursue a specific goal by any character it is very clear what your goal is. 

Below Zero has a very surface level story, seemingly drummed up as a flimsy pretext to get our player character onto this planet. Our character is constantly voicing her own opinions on matter and also engaged in middle-school levels of philosophical arguments with a cookie-cutter rendition of ""advanced species"" that has apparently outgrown us so far they can't recognize the importance of emotion to the prospect of survival.

The story is also driven through the MC's dialogue with an alien. We are no longer a voiceless character simply finding remnants of deceased passenger's logs from our ship that can guide us in the right direction. THIS MAKES BELOW ZERO ROBIN'S STORY, NOT THE PLAYER'S STORY. As soon as you force your voiced main character to have their own drivers, you remove the agency from the player. This is in direct opposition to how any successful open world story works. I want to have a good reason to explore something only because I want to, not because my stupid character does. 

There are many more reasons that this game does not succeed in its predecessor's footsteps, but I found these to be the most prominent. I hope the studio really studies what made Subnatica work well, and why it is beloved and also take a hard look at Below Zero to see where they went wrong. 

I hope below zero was just a grave misunderstanding, an experiment gone horribly awry, and not a symptom that portends the future of this studio's creations.",1699943017,1699943017,False,449,6,0.886376678943634033,13,True,False,False

perhaps that is too much info for what you need to know. as in the first Subnautica there is scanning, puzzles, and a story line to follow along. there for its a straight forward game that will give you the story line.

[h1]Map and progression[/h1]
The map is far more vertical than the first. The first felt huge on pure area. This feels quite a bit more more cramped, like everything is within reach. But instead, each biome is deep as all hell, so there's far more verticality to explore, making depth modules and such upgrades far more valuable. There is a distinct ""stepping stone"" feel to progression now and it's less random which upgrades you find.

Perhaps that makes it a bit less organic and more predictable, but I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the focus on the Architect species and their culture. 

[h1]Problems[/h1]
The complains I have about the game are mainly that some concepts are poorly explained, some story chains are disconnected and rely on luck to find and finally, the whole ""on-land"" section is a pain in the absolute behind. The Glacial Basin beyond the bridge is a maze that is torture to explore as everything looks identical. Add to that some VERY buggy leviathans and that whole section is actually exceptionally unenjoyable. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
As opposed to the first game, this game has several plot threads that are poorly intervowen and it feels like they're more fighting for space than complementing each other. Add the fact that some plot threads have a very unfinished feel to them and the game starts feeling unfocused and unsatisfying.

The main plot thread, involving the Architect species and the story of 4546B, is well handled, well voice acted and is without major plot holes. It also ties well into the natural progression of the game's mechanics and biome exploration.

[h2]The bad plot[/h2]
The plot involving the leviathan corpse, Maida and the deceased sister is a jumbled, unfinished mess that feels tacked on. It feels improperly tied into the game and appears to be almost an afterthought. In spite of it feeling like an afterthought, there's a lot of work that has gone into making assets for locations tied to said plot. Which makes me think the plot was something else at first and they had to rush to rewrite it or something.

There's a lot about that entire section of the story that just doesn't feel either satisfying or tight. There are many ""But why?"" about the story and some things straight up don't make sense at all. Like why did Sam ""accidentally"" kill herself with a bomb when she's been described as an absolute genius? You can speculate, based on other things, but there's so much in this plot thread that feels rushed and sloppy.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Everything else about the game is a step up from the first. The first Subnautica was an unpolished gem that was an absolute blast, and all in all, Subnautica: Below Zero is a very enjoyable expandalone to the original game. It has some flaws but they aren't enough to detract from the overall experience. The sister side-plot is forgettable, but also not required to beat the game, so it's ultimately a non-issue.

If you did not enjoy Subnautica, then you really need not bother as this is more of the same. But better.",1621840939,1699603302,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It felt like story components were missing, or that major plot points weren't hammered home enough (like what happened with the sister.)  Perhaps some voice lines or conversations just weren't triggered appropriately?  

The game world is quite a bit smaller than than the first game.  That's either a plus or minus depending on how you look at it. 

There are no real improvements in features or content from the first game.  Upgrades and resource acquisition pathways for those upgrades were essentially the same as the first game.  Go to X Depth to find Y resource, etc.  No mandatory need to use the Prawn was a weird decision.  I spent the time and resources making one and upgrading it, but I never actually needed to use it.

I might have enjoyed it more had I not hopped into it right after the first game and given myself a break.

Easily a $10 or $15 game. I'd be upset if I had paid $30 for it.

The sensation the Cyclops transmits, piloting this enormous vessel with the switches and controls all over the bridge, cameras, being able to customize the interior to even make it a complete autonomous moving base...

Enjoyment: Loved it! 

Subnautica: Below Zero (SBZ) is a wonderful exploration open world crafting game.  The world isn't as big or deep as the original Subnautica which took me 90 hours to finish.  But it still has lots to explore and discover.  

The above water part was full of exploration.  The key is Thermoses, Pepper Plants, and eventually build yourself a cold suit which gives you very significant protection from the cold.  I was amazed multiple times, when exploring a cave would open up into a whole new area. On land bases also help as you can build fabricators and plant some of your own pepper plants for both nourishment and heat.  

Underwater was equally filled with discovery and exploration.  As you find datadisks and fragments, your technology expands allowing you to delve deeper into the ocean's depths. The Sea Truck is a great addition to the original game.  It starts off with just the cab, but as you discover and craft modules it gets longer and longer, eventually becoming a mobile base of operations.

A few new living creatures are nice and a few biomes look good, now let's list the failures:

- the story is terrible at best you don't care, at worst you don't want to take part in it
- there are characters, a lot of audio recordings and your own character speaks (way too often)
- these characters are all shallow, selfish, arrogant and stupid (your own too)
- the feeling of loneliness is obviously ruined
- the sense of wonder is gone (after 10min you just don't care)
- the world is cramped and biomes don't actually feel interesting
- there is no motivation to explore
- there is no fear
- vehicles are uninteresting and unbalanced
- the land part with its designated path feels like a platform game

In the first Subnautica there was a sense of wonder: the planet, all the living creatures, the accomplishment of previous survivors, the technological achievement of your civilization...  In the sequel, everything is negative, characters are stupid, your civilization appears to be flawed, and the life of the planet is actually created by the same stupid characters.

I really liked the first Subnautica, but I knew that Below Zero was a dark horse. Still, I decided to take the risk.

The first five hours are pure Subnautica. Terrifying, wow-effect, flow, gameplay works, the story unfolds.

After that - it's bad. A monotonous world, with no challenge. Practically nothing new compared to the first part. Less, worse, more confusing.

The game was simply cobbled together from old assets, adding about five nauseating hours of fiddling on nauseating land (I seriously wanted to drop the game) and switching the means of transportation to a little train.

The reapers, which I was scared of even at the end of the first part, were replaced with some unclear funny shrimp, and the ""scariest enemy"" is more annoying than frightening and is repelled by electroshock. /Meh/

I could have a particular issue with the plot, but it's just apparent that first, there was one story, then they rearranged it, underwrote it, tacked on a second, and screwed it all up.

It was very unpleasant to watch the game move from the masterpiece category to the mediocre and, in the end, almost end up dropped and in the trash.
And the vibe from the story at many points was ""I collected everything, read everything, but didn't understand the point.""

After researching YouTube, Reddit, and wikis after completing the game, it turned out that I did catch the entire available story - there just isn't one.

The game itself isn't ""bad"". I finished it and enjoyed some parts of it. 
But the Subnautica: Below Zero could be an OK DLC for Subnautica, compressed to maybe 10 hours and reassembled story.",1699093610,1699093610,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Originally planned as DLC to the original Subnautica, it eventually grew in scope and was released instead as a standlone product. Largely plays similar to the original game with a bit more steamlining I guess (you get some stuff for your base at start without needing to find it for example). If you haven't played the first game through get that instead. Below Zero is a decent game while the original is terrific.

Hunger/Thirst works same as the original but now there is a temperature meter that goes down when you're on land. Diving into artic water strangely warms you up lol. You can warm yourself when in a vehicle and on land by drinking coffee, going into caves, standing next to heating flowers and steam vents.

One issue that Below Zero has is that the game world is much smaller than the original. Swimming and the Seaglide tool speed have both been decreased to componesate. The new Leviathans are smaller that the ones from the original and are generally less scary. Levels feel overstuffed with resources and fragments. Same type fragments were often really close to each so you'd find all you'd need very quickly. Level design 

Another issue is that land sections have been greatly increased. These are largely a pain to explore, it's often very difficult to figure out where you are and are the worst parts of the game. The underwater biomes is what made the game popular. To make matters worse, there's often blizzards that limit your view making it even more difficult to navigate.

Below Zero also contains much less deep and dark underwater areas to explore. The original had truly creepy deep surface biomes to explore requiring you to creep downwards in darkness with your lights on trying to spot something below you as dangerous fishies lurk in the shadows. There's nothing like this in Below Zero. The deep areas are all in caves but these caves tend to have a lot of oxygen plants which take away some of the fear of drowning, are largely wet lit and none are as claustrophobic as the coral caves from Subnautica where you could easily get hopelessly lost. Unlike the original, you don't start off in the middle of the map but start in on an edge and can explore forwards in a cone with edges closed off with ice walls.

Unlike the original, Below Zero has a voiced MC and two other voiced characters you can meet. Some prefer having a silent protaganist and think another NPC takes away from the sense of isolation, you mileage may vary on this. The fact that [spoiler]Marguerit Maida[/spoiler] from the original survived is BS and I don't like their characterization in Below Zero. Shouldn't the [spoiler]virus[/spoiler] have killed her ages ago anyways?

There's two major storylines. One where you character investigates the death of your sister to expose evil corp-gov; this storyline largely meh, major spoilers for both games: [spoiler]Her death is her fault and the plot point of her making a cure of the virus is not good. The first game plot was about curing the virus with the Sea Emperor babies already and how does your sister casually whip out a cure for a virus that a super intelligent alien race struggled to cure!?[/spoiler] The second is to find an architect alien and after they store their conscious into yours, you search out for tech to build them a new body. Generally expands on lore of the aliens from the original and your character has young-adult sci-fi talks with them throughout the game.

The Prawn vehichle is back but Seamoth and Cyclops are gone. The Seatruck serves as a hybrid of the two. You can create modules that you can add to the truck which allows you to customize it and use it as a mobile base as you desire. More modules slow it down through and level design is very cave based so if you have too many modules you may find smaller cave sections a nuisance to explore. It's generally a nice addition, the new Snowfox on the other hand, is a terrible land based hoverbike and was a pain to drive. It somehows keeps you warm while riding it despite being open air bike. Some sections like Outpost Zero have a lot of invisible walls, largely affects Prawn with its jets.

The biomes are least are very interesting and diverse and the general gameplay loop is still good. It's just not as good as the original. BZ is like a 6 or 7 out of 10 compared to original which is easily 9+.

Predators seem to be both more frequent and more aggressive and don't have nearly the same sense of danger as before when you can constantly hear them roaring from every direction and there isn't any deep water for them to jump out at you from. They removed the stasis rifle to stop us from just killing the predators, but they also reduced the movement speed of both the vehicles and the player so much that you can't actually run from them either. The seatruck that was supposed to replace the seamoth and cyclops is just worse than both of them in pretty much every way and really slow and unwieldy. The new PDA voice was also kind of annoying but that might just be because I'm used to the original. 

Since this was labeled as an expansion at first, I thought this was going to have a similar overall atmosphere and sense of ""alien-ness"" and loneliness, but it really doesn't.

If you are looking for an experience even close to as good as the first Subnautica you won't find it here. This game proves that ether the 1st game was a fluke or the company like many others has just given into the woke crap. Another copy paste of strong female colored lead who somehow gets through any and all things and is somehow the only person with any knowledge about how to be a human but at the same time be the most OBNOXIOUS thing to exist in this universe fairly easily with a story about your gay sister (not even kidding) who was lost due to some nonsense Alterra did. Think you will have to scavenge for stuff and really work to survive? Nope. Game just gives crap to you at every turn but with all the added nonsense you will be crafting twice as much because it's a time waster. The music doesn't ever quite fit with where you are and should it should be noted that the way certain sea creatures move is silly and odd, I never felt like I was in any actual danger it feels more like a walking simulator than anything. The new robo penguin mechanic is just gimmicky and has 0 place as part of the gameplay as It just slows things down instead of me being able to just explore and pick it up like a NORMAL PERSON it just becomes an added headache. Don't know why your PDA voice thing couldn't have just been the same robo womans voice from the first one but instead sounds like your on the phone with a call center from India. You remember the Seamoth? So do I but you won't be driving it as they have instead of opted for a something called a Seatruck. Need to store stuff right away with it? Too bad instead you have to build each individual compartment for this damaged refrigerator you will be piloting instead and that includes storage compartments and even a whole separate compartment just to make things. Breaks apart fast, has terrible mobility and did I mention it drifts sideways when it feels like? I was gonna just finish this game just because I was like ""the game has to get better right""?

Original game: Your ship crashes. Survive on an alien world you know nothing about and try to escape.
Below zero: You incarnate Robin, a reckless woman that willingly goes on a suicidal mission to investigate the disappearance of her mary-sue sister. 

THE VIEWPOINT DOESN'T MATCH THE STORYTELLING
Honestly, whilst it would remain worse than the first, I wouldn't care nearly as much about the difference of approach if it wasn't for the fact the game is in 1st person, meaning you are supposed to INCARNATE Robin, and anything SHE says comes from YOUR (1st person) mouth.

The biomes are interesting, and this game has a good deal more variety than the first.  Whereas in the first game walking on foot felt like an afterthought, it feels better fleshed out here.  The music is enjoyable, and the updates to base building are absolutely wonderful.

I especially love the playful little sea monkeys.

But, ultimately, I feel like more effort was put into the quality for the first game than for this one.  I've come across a good number of issues -- some of which existed in the first game and really should've been fixed in that one, let alone this one.  Stuff disappearing through the floor, for example.  I was willing to let a lot of that slide since the first one was, well, the first one.  This being the second one, though, I expected to see a lot of the issues fixed.  Sure, I expected there might be some NEW issues since this game has some NEW features, just not OLD issues.

I would still recommend this game.  I don't regret buying it.  It's still very beautiful, and very fun, and very intriguing.  Just maybe save your game more often than I did, so if something goes wrong you maybe lose ten minutes of progress rather than an hour or two.

With that said, there are spoilers below.  Stop reading now if you haven't played the game yet.

Here's ten issues I had, some of which are more frustrating than others.

1. The mouse cursor is nigh invisible on the title screen.  A lot of blue on blue.  Considering the default marker color in the first game was blue, and in this one it's orange, I feel like this should've been on their radar.

2.  I got a marker twice for the initial distress call.  There are two of them in my marker list.  The second one came after I already went there and did the thing.

3. The conditions for which beacons appear isn't clear, or isn't consistent.  I basically followed the beacons and ended up at end game locations long before even getting the first hints about what happened to Sam.  This seems like a glaring oversight.  I also never got an indicator as to where Maida's greenhouse was, so I had to fumble around for that.  At this point, I don't think that marker exists.  For a game that gives you indicators and markers to progress the story, it sure seems inconsistent.

4. At Maida's undersea base, she gives you access to several snowfox fragments, but only one of them is scannable.  You have to find the particular area of iceberg where those fragments are located to find the other two.  God help you if you go to either of the other two locations first (spoiler: I went to both other locations first.)  I ended up exploring the entire iceberg in my prawn suit, and by the time I could even make the snowfox I was drowning in ion batteries.  This means I also explored those areas without the cold suit.

5.  I put my mobile vehicle bay up near the lily pads since it was pretty safe up there, and was directly above my base.  Then I made a sea truck prawn suit dock compartment, and it landed on top of the lily pad.  The propulsion cannon doesn't work on those, and I couldn't push it off myself.  There was no means by which I could force it to dock with my sea truck.  It's unretrievable.

6. Vehicular engine noise is WAY too loud, and it's grouped in ""ambient noise"" with a LOT of other game audio.  If you turn that down, the game becomes eerily quiet.  It would be nice if this were a separate sound category so I could turn it down without turning down ALL ambient noise.  The Sea Moth and Prawn Suit in Subnautica 1 were a joy to use, and they were so quiet.  The Prawn Suite in Sub Zero is deafeningly loud even just sitting idle.

7. My snowfox is stuck 20m beneath the surface of the ice, bobbing up and down on the water.  Y'know, cause in video games, stuff isn't solid.  There's no reason for it to be.  Anyway, right after I put an ion battery in my snowfox and tried to deploy it, it deployed inside the floor and immediately dropped down inside the iceberg.  It's unretrievable.

8.  On land, every time you exit the prawn suit, you will take fall damage.  This didn't happen in the first game.

9.  The control room only offers the ability to turn off the power to the various rooms.  If you want the lights dimmed, or off, there is no compromise.  It's off.

10.  The aromatherapy item stops glowing if you turn the power to its room off.  It's battery-operated.  Shouldn't it still glow?  What's the point of it glowing when the lights are ON?  I wanted a cool, fragrant nightlight.  =(

I haven't beaten the game yet.  I'm very worried there will be more items to add to this list before I'm done.",1698800361,1698800732,True,1,0,0.520471572875976563,1,True,False,False

This is a good game (and thus a positive review), but I did not really enjoy playing it.

[b]Long story:[/b]
I think this game is really just an expansion, of all the same things that gave us wonder in the original Subnautica (and a very imperfect one at that for reasons that others have stated far better than I can).
It's not alright that it was marketed as a new standalone experience, essentially a Subnautica 2, but this did not catfish me, as I just bought it recently, and was fully aware of what I was getting into.

Even knowing that, it still was very disappointing as this experience feels like a game, not a living world anymore. 
Getting upgrades feels very gamey, there are rough transitions between biomes, and threats are significantly tamed. It all feels like a lesser experience, even land exploration feels worse, which I don't even know how they managed, since they significantly expanded on it!

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
This game is a lesser experience that it's predecessor, which is further hampered by a ''been there, done that'' feeling. If in doubt, my recommendation would be you play Below Zero first, and the original Subnautica after.

Few tips that will help you enjoy the game more:
- don't wait too long to build your main base, when I did mine game was practically finished
- USE YOUR SEAGLIDE MAP. Helps in exploring without missing important blueprints, which I did.

It has some little bugs that don't hinder the game (fish casually swimming/flying in my base).

First, the story is complete mess, it doesn't make much sense. At start I had hopes after Al meeting, but it become such a mess.
 You can even finish the game without finding what happend to the mc's sister.
Secondly, devs decided it would be fun to explore super small caves and crevasses. No it isn't, they are super annoying. Lots of things are so hidden, so if you won't find it by accident you will give up and look for a location on the web.
Archtitects buildings with one thing to scan randomly scattered? Makes no sense - in Subnatuica you had power plant, reasearch lab, gun platfrom etc- all made sense and was connected to each other.
Glacial basin is a joke, full of boxes with water, nutrient blocks and tabs... really? 
You don't even have to catch fish anymore, there are so many diffrent fruits.
Game does really bad job at telling you where to go sometimes, like searching for greenhouse.
You have laser cutter but you can't cut the little opened doors for koppa mining because no, and yes, sea truck won't fit. You can go inside with another way, but you won't find it unless you look up on the net.
You can only have a sea truck, snowfox and a prawn suit, the prawn suit isn't even necessary.. 
Putting a few leviathans in crystal cave just to annoy you, really? They are just swimming in circles in a small space. Totally diffrent from eg. lost river in original game.
There are some small QoL improvements but not much.
There was still a bug from original game with powering base with power relay (on/off on loading save). 
The frozing weather is a joke - you counter it with salad with peppers or only peppers....
New OST is not bad, but the one from first game is better.

You get actual living characters wiþ personalities, whereas in þe first game þe only proper characters & story to be found are in þe logs of long-dead survivors or environmental storytelling. Þis does, of course, vastly reduce þe feeling of isolation. 

Þe fear factor isn't nearly as prominent. Unless you have þassolophobia or related instinctual fears, you're probably not going to find it all þat scary, þough it is still *very tense* when you're in dangerous situations. 
I þink þe gameplay has a lot more to it þan þe first. Þe new vehicles are awesome, as are þe basebuilding features.

I bought this on switch when it was on sale for $5, and then bought it on steam for sale for $10. On Switch I have 90+hours, and on here I have 3 hours.

There are a few good things about it: the graphics of the biomes are really detailed and vibrant and the design of the fauna and flora are all excellent. 

However, the map is way too small imo (which also meant that no large vehicles can be constructed in this game), the main storyline is way about your sister is way too short and even anticlimactic, game isn't really scary like the original game since there a few leviathans within the crater (compared to Subnautica) and they can all be rendered useless with a seatruck upgrade. Lots of shallow areas meant it was hard to traverse and the speed reduction with the addition of modules to seatruck is way too taxing. The fact that you arrived on this planet based off your will, removes the element of survival and the introduction of Al-an made the game too straightforward to play,

As before, I enjoyed exploring an alien world, collecting materials, and learning how to survive and thrive. The environment is arctic rather than tropical this time, which presents new challenges. There is also a mystery or two to investigate. 

As before, I was less enthusiastic about the end game. It sometimes resembles a scavenger hunt for I knew not what, (only that something important was in the area). I scrounged and carefully mapped a large portion of the glacial basin, which was rather tedious, because it can be hard to know whether you've overlooked something. I was relieved when a walkthrough confirmed that I had already found everything important. And I still hate the leviathans, but I guess that's how it's supposed to be.

Below Zero as a stand alone game is fine. But, if compared to the previous game, BZ is just... weird. The story feels more streamlined and forced than the first game, mostly because there is much more dialogue in BZ than the first game. Additionally, BZ doesn't really build off of the first game vehicle and mechanics wise. Rather, BZ takes a completely different direction with it vehicles and mechanics and, in my opinion, did a worse job than the first game. 

Another thing I dislike is the atmosphere of BZ. The biomes in BZ feel more like a stereotypical alien planet similar to many other games out there. The environments of the first game were more barren, but that added to the overall atmosphere of the first game. The overfilled biomes of BZ add nothing to its atmosphere and feel forced. I guess the developers wanted to spice up the atmosphere of the game (quite literally). However, this was to the detriment of BZ.

Overall, I would say BZ is not worth getting in 2023 and beyond unless the developers release DLC, which I don't think is going to happen.",1698040584,1698040626,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Subnautica Below Zero is an absolute masterpiece and a worthy addition to the Subnautica series. As a devoted fan of the original Subnautica, I couldn't have been more thrilled with this sequel. It's safe to say that the Subnautica series has captured my heart, and Below Zero only solidified its place as my favorite game series.

It builds upon the incredible foundation of its predecessor, taking us on an even more mesmerizing and chilling underwater adventure. The icy, alien world of Planet 4546B is both haunting and beautiful, offering a stark contrast to the lush, tropical setting of the first game. Exploring the depths of this frozen ocean feels like diving into a mysterious, otherworldly realm, and the sense of wonder and danger is ever-present.

The storyline is as captivating as ever, immersing you in a narrative filled with intrigue and mystery. Unraveling the secrets of the planet and uncovering the truth about your sister's disappearance is a gripping experience that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The characters you encounter along the way add depth to the story and make the world feel alive.

The gameplay mechanics have been refined and expanded, offering a more immersive and enjoyable experience. The addition of new biomes, creatures, and tools adds variety and challenge to the gameplay. The thrill of exploring uncharted territory, discovering new lifeforms, and mastering your survival skills remains just as enthralling as in the first game.

The graphics and sound design are simply breathtaking. The underwater world is a visual masterpiece, and the ambient sounds and music pull you deeper into the immersive experience. The attention to detail in every aspect of the game is truly commendable.

It manages to create an atmosphere that is both serene and terrifying, and it's a testament to the developers' dedication to crafting a rich and engaging game world. From the colossal leviathans lurking in the depths to the smallest, most intricate details, the game's beauty is unparalleled.

In conclusion, Subnautica Below Zero is a must-play for fans of the Subnautica series and newcomers alike. It continues the legacy of its predecessor while bringing new elements and surprises to the table. I was captivated, thrilled, and utterly absorbed in this underwater world. This game cements Subnautica as my all-time favorite game series. Dive in, and prepare to be amazed!",1698014663,1698014663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The leviathan was not iconic as the reaper leviathan in the first subnautica. The world was small and kind of empty. There was not much to investigate. On the other hand though, I loved that the main character had a voice and interacted with the environment. Not only did we have a face on voice logs but we also talked to a real person and it made the game more lively and comforting. But I feel like that was one of the main problems of the game. It should have been more uncomfortable and eerie. My main problem was how small the map is. I also really loved the building system and I spent some hours just building a base because I had no idea how to proceed with the story.

This is for many reasons, some of which being that the game is shorter, more story driven, easier (in my experience) etc. This game does not take nearly as long to complete at the original Subnautica did, this is partially because in the original Subnautica, the story was furthered by how much the player explored (which they do on their own terms and time), while Below zero has a lot more story quests that tell you where you need to be to further the story. Now don't get me wrong, I love the story, and am eagerly awaiting the next game (and hopefully more of our Below zero characters) and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this game. 
When it comes to in game play, there are a few things worth noting for those who played the original Subnautica. 1. They removed the seamoth and the cyclops, sorry. 2. They add the seatruck and a nice little upgrade that just lets you ""pop"" leviathans off, which honestly was pretty neat, but reduced the difficulty of the game in my opinion. (you could always choose not to use it, but it's helpful) 3. They add a larger room and some other features to build with for those who like base building.

But...
You may have heard tales of the story having 2 major rewrites, and... yeah, its true. The story for this game isn't terrible, its moreso the specific character writing... and the handholdiness.
Its like, they designed the game with clear intent of it being a subversion from the original game by being more story focused, but then they completely turned it right back around to try and be subnautica but again, which... yknow, I get it. people wanted the isolation and scares, but this wasnt a good move on the devs' end, imo. You can tell this game was always meant to be a heavily narrative focused game, with many living characters... and having a large part of that narratives identity stripped away... even if you add detail and quality to the remaining parts and focus on them, its still gonna leave an uncanny taste. That and GOD the main characters writing is like, actually the worst writing in any game ever? Speaking protagonists in first person survival games are already questionable, but robins exchanges with one of the few other characters that does exist? She sounds like shes pretending to be a human. Clearly deep lore /s

It's a good game on its own, if you ignore the questionable story and writing. It's a bit ""go grab the thing thats over here"" at times, but... eh, im conflicted. They really dropped the ball by trying to make this game conform to what people wanted a subnautica game to be, instead of letting it have a unique identity. You can probably figure out how to play early access online, if you care to experience the old story.

The subnautica series has such a good core gameplay loop, I always come back to these games just for that. The resource gathering, exploring and building aspects are simply fun and entertaining - even after finishing the game several times. The biomes are gorgeous in this game, and the creature design is very well done. Unlike the first game, this one features a section that's on ground, and I find that the weakest one. The difference in level of detail is huge, with the sea having all the fun stuff, and the ground being left rather plain and same-y.

The vehicles are alright. You get three. The ground vehicle, snow fox, is by far the worst and I never use it. You get another vehicle earlier that can go on land AND in water, and is perfect in every way - the prawn suit. I still make a snow fox every time, just because it's a pretty sweet lawn ornament.

The story... it's bad. I'd love to defend it because I really like this game, but I simply can't. I think it's dull and preachy, and I didn't connect with any of the characters. It's like the slightest bit of flavor over 'mega corporation bad' and that's it. The mega corporation was bad in the first game too, but at least in that one, we're allowed to laugh at it. Not here, it's Serious Time. There's a custom game option that allows you to turn off the story though, if you get really annoyed by it and just want to build a cool base.

In conclusion: Game is good. I recommend playing the original Subnautica before this, because that's even better. This game is not as scary as the first game, so that might be the only reason to play this first.",1697627135,1697627135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gamplay is pretty much the same, wich ich good or bad, depending on if you are looking for somethig new or still want to indulge in the experience you got from the first game.
At some points it's obvious that the developer has learned from the past and I think they spread fragments and minerals in a different, arguably better, way. Also the Sea Truck is a new concept, that fits well.

Frame rate at pretty much max settings is 100++ on a i7 7700k + geforce 3090 with no lags or stutters.

One thing that just bit me in the butt is, that when you play hardcore, the quit button saves automatically. I turned it down to survival, because even with a spare tank I'm too stupid to change it in time sometimes it seems, and well, the quit button in survival doesn't save. 5 hours gone, yay.

this game also takes place on land a lot of the time, something this engine doesnt really handle well. and the big creatures on that land are an annoyance at best and an inconveinence at worst.

-Color Vibrancy - The game feels like you're on an actual different planet 
-More Walking Sections - I really like how you can drive or pilot your vechicles through the ice glaciers
-Alan- Just the way how he asks the character about his kind and vice versa, it feels organic
Things this game did worse than the Original Subnautica:
-Some materials are easier to craft , thus making the game easier - F.E the Titianium Ingot now costs 5 metal , not 10 
-The depth is more shallow - In my opinion , the original was better because the time it took to get from the deepest parts of the map to your base felt more rewarding. In Below Zero the deepest part is more shallow by like what? 600 meters? 
-The Storyline - Again , IN MY OPINION , the storyline in the original game was more vague , leaving you wondering what happened to you fellow survivors. In this game its like : i need to know what happened hermm theres been a sabotage herrm who could have done that hermm.
-Playtime - I finished it two times quicker than Subnautica , but for a player focused on building and enjoying the views, i thinks you can squeeze out 200 hours of fun gameplay
Final Verdict : Should you buy it? Yeah its worth it , but it wont be like the original.

Nice game, appalling load times, glitches and general bugs. 

The devs made this game on early access business model again for some reason even though they made bank on the first one so kinda abusing the system a bit there.

Load times are still pretty bad considering it's 2023 even on a high-end gaming rig.

The game has dramatically improved since early access. There are some nice new touches to nake it stand out from the original, including a bit more narrative than the original.

Still feels kinda lazy, since so many of the items you can build in the base are cosmetic only, it begs the question why there aren't more cosmetic options. 

The truck dock is a nice idea poorly executed. If you want to change upgrade modules you have to undock and swim around the truck. If you want to change which truck modules you have to undock and do it manually. It would have been a good idea to allow both of these things to be done from inside the base since this makes things considerably more hassle, making the moon pool still the better option.

Only having one under-water vehicle to choose from is a shame. I get that the Cyclops wouldn't be practical in this map but it's nice to have options.

I don't dislike this game, it's still good fun but as a a Developer myself it's frustrating to see a game not reach it's full potential because of perceived laziness on the part of the devs.",1549143564,1697319513,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

About the pros tho. The world feels really alive and worthy of exploring. They made the prawn suit even more fun to use than the original, which makes me ignore the fact that they fucked up the truck. And base building is just as fun as it was in the original and a little less tedious.

It has no scary elements at all, not even unnerving. All the big dangers are essensially sharks, of a few varieties. Every place is well lit. You can navigate almost anything without worrying about running out of air. No dangerous animals in any cave. Not even a humble crashfish.

The map is much smaller, both in field and in depth. With a map this small, the big submarine would be meaningless and the quick seamoth would reach the edge of the map right away. So both are cut.
The plot is very poor. It's incoherent, and poorly written. Two highly educated individuals (one of them extremely old) act, and speak like uneducated children. A third individual has done extraordinarily impossible feats to even appear in the game, but has no real reason to even be present. 
The game has two main goals. One is trivial, the other longer one is scientifically impossible and contradicts itself. The long one can be skipped, even though that is the whole reason our main character is on the planet in the first place. 

Your Survival PDA is with you all the time and is meant to inform you constantly about relevant facts. Unfortunately it sounds smug and has a really thick indian accent which makes it difficult to understand. The only real positive is the design of the biggest deep sea enemy. But it is impossible to avoid and barely injures you, which makes it just tedious again. Such a shame.

The first game is far superior. Big map, deep map. Dark, scary, dangerous places. Areas of ""bottomless"" sea. Simple survival setting. No tedious NPC's, only you- thankfully a silent protagonist. PDA voice is clinically effective and easy to understand, even funny at times.
Great biome variety. Unique creatures for those biomes. Frightening areas, warm areas, beautiful areas. The quick vehicle is useful, and the big sub is a great mobile base, making everything less tedious. Both are fun to pilot.

- A bit shorter than 1. Has a storyline that plays from number 1. A lot more interactive thanks to the protagonist. 
- Robin is very cool to me. Given the story, it is nice to have a character with a voice that progresses it. 
- Smaller map than 1.
- Love the land and land creatures, though wish there were more interactivity. 

Consider this game DLC/spinoff because as mentioned it is a lot shorter but really plays well with the continuation of 1. It's a nice closing-book to the story as a whole.

Subnautica is one of my most enjoyed games.
I've been playing since 2016 and completed it several times in that period. It's mostly what I want out of a singleplayer exploration game. A rich place full of things to explore, and an incredibly immersive experience.

As a player I adore the feeling of waltzing around and exploring new worlds.
Really playing the part of my character. And it helps if that world is interesting.
Which, to Below Zero's credit, it is.

The issue comes from the story.
I have no issues playing as a female character. Give them a voice, and as a guy I can just brute force them into a guy. Power of the mind and all that. It's when your story is so god awful, so unbelievably terrible, incredulously offensive. That my mind begins to slip.

Think to Subnautica, the original.
The story is told through the bare minimum needed.
Logs tell you something wrong has happened, each and every rescue pod, save yours. Has been destroyed, one of them mentions some unknown disease. Another tells you about an island. But very little more than that. Eventually you get the ""Kill Transmission."" You start seeing the warpers, hearing them, and you can put together the information yourself. It's very good at letting you both come to conclusions, and lead you in the direction it wants you to go.

Below Zero, treats you like a child who needs to be coddled.

And thanks to the story, you can no longer have the graceful simplicity of the first game. Now, there has to be a reason outside of ""This may be my best chance for survival."" Which means there needs to be a reason for me to care. I naturally cared in the original because I was a survivor looking for other people, a cure, and eventually a way off the planet.

Now? I'm some generically written woman, looking for her generically written sister, against the generically written evil corporation. I do not, and can not, care about anything that is going on. Since, I barely know anything about any of them. An issue, invited by the fact that there are characters now. I cared to visit the pinged locations because [b]I knew[/b] it would help me survive. Now I'm trying to find my sister because I'm [b]told[/b] I should care. though this isn't the biggest issue.

There was a point, where I'll admit, I said fuck the story I'm doing my own thing.
And it was so egregiously stupid, so unerringly dumb, so offensive to my sensibilities as the player.
That I was inches away from choosing to simply drop the game entirely.

[spoiler] Maud, the Degassi survivor, is alive. Alive and has a polar bear as a pet now. Which, if you remember, means that she [b]singlehandedly killed a leviathan by herself, managed to reach the top of the ocean, [/b[ and after all of that, ended up at one of the poles. [/spoiler]

This  terribly written story truly ruins the entire experience.
I can say, without a doubt. The charm that held the first game up is gone.
I respect the ambition, but perhaps what made the original so good. Was the lack of a traditional story.
At the very least, a better writer would have helped.

Folks tend to love bytchyng and hating things so much more compared to trying to find the good side of things. Total BS. The only way to get a real taste of anything is to try it yourself and avoid opinions as part of them are completely nuts and part of them are full of hate and frustration, mostly independent from the subject that they are actually speaking about. Don't listen to anyone :)

As for the game itself, it is not perfect but it still works. The biggest merit is adding some fixes and enhancements to the bag, compared to the initial game. So, if you enjoyed the game mechanics of Subnautica and just want an another Subnautica experience, it will deliver that just fine. There are many new things to keep you busy, just like the expanded surface area with a lot of odd locations. It has a smaller but somewhat denser map with a little more variation of locations. Also, there are some new gadgets and many new members of flora'n'fauna. The map is loaded with odd locations to discover.

There are things where it falls behind the initial game. Maybe, the most important one is something like the difference between Dead Space I and II. During the very first game, the protagonist doesn't say a single word and doesn't show his face at all. It has its mystique and also will put the player perspective to ""me"". Dead Space 2 is quite the opposite as it has a narration all over, so the perspective turns from ""me"", 1st person into ""him"", 3rd person. Less mystery. Well, the same happened to Below Zero. The protagonist of the first Subnautica game is virtually: you, stranded on an alien planet, fighting for survival. Escape room deluxe. Opposing this, Below Zero gives you a background story (a sort of investigation) and the change of perspective from 1st to 3rd person.

The other thing is, explaining the unknown is sort of unnecessary I think. Do you remember the movie Alien / Aliens? The xenomorphs were just there, as a lethal and unknown mystery. Then, remember Prometheus. Everything became explained, then the explanation became overexplained in Covenant, destroying its own roots. Well, I don't know about you, but I need no, for example, Darth Vader explained. I need no Joker explained. I need no detailed story about his positive ideas or if he is doing gardening in his leisure time or what is his favourite candy whatsoever. All I need to know about him is that he is the greatest villain in the story, period. Then, all these overexplanations destroy the mysteries around these dark characters. Well, as for Below Zero, I won't spoiler the storyline but for me, something like this happens here to some extent: overexplaination. I'd preferred the alien mysteries that were set in Subnautica left the way they were. Now I have a narrative of this game world that doesn't make sense at some points. So, the first Subnautica had a bigger ooomph for that reason, at least to me.

But does that make Below Zero a bad game? No. Is it fun? Yes. Would I recommend it? If you like Subnautica, definitely, yes. Does it have the greatest Sci-Fi stories of all time? No. Does it fall behind the first Subnautica game? Slightly. But should you hate this game for that? 

C'mon. Calm the truck down. If you can't focus on the positives, you will destroy your joy in everything.",1696790308,1696798100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is a lot less scary than it's predecessor, in large part due to the defense system of the Seatruck. Whenever a Leviathan attacks, you can simply left click using the defense system and you will stun the Leviathan taking no damage whatsoever. This removes all fear surrounding the Leviathans, and simply reduces them to an obstacle whose purpose is to be in the way. The only Leviathan that has a chance of killing you is the Ice Worm, which is more annoying than scary. The lack of fear makes it less interesting to explore the world.

The world is smaller, and more compact than Subnautica's. The game focuses a lot more on land adventure, which is boring and tedious, and the Ice Worm only helps make it annoying. I was expecting the Snowfox to be fun to drive around in, but it was just clunky and difficult to control.
I didn't feel the same intrigue exploring the ocean as I did exploring Subnautica's. Since the games take place on the same planet, Below Zero has a lot of the same environments and creatures. I wish the game committed more to the ""Below Zero"" theme, because most of the environments have nothing to do with ice or snow. The world is also smaller and compact, and a lot of the cave systems are cramped and difficult to navigate.
The game was also way too focused on the story, which was subpar. I'll avoid why because of spoilers, but you have to find body caches to complete the game, and they are stupidly hard to find. Also, you don't even have to finish Robin's storyline to beat the game.

With all that said, there are things the game does right, which is why I'm still recommending it. The base building is a slight improvement on Subnautica's, with there being more stuff to build. The game looks beautiful, and some of the wildlife is well-designed. And the survival aspects are the same as they were in Subnautica. There were also only a few bugs. On its own the game was fun to play through, but as a sequel to a beloved game, it was disappointing.


Overall, the game fails with the story, the smaller map filled with biomes that don't fit the snow theme, the maze-like land areas, the unintimidating Leviathans, and the general lack of fear surrounding the game. The game does a lot right too though, the survival aspects are the same as they were in Subnautica, the building is slightly better, and the game is even better looking.

I started to wonder if somehow my wish had come true in Below Zero, but in a somewhat ""monkey's paw"" fashion, as most of the dry land segments in Below Zero made me want to do nothing more than return to the water. Most of Below Zero's out of water sequences are pretty samey and stretch on for far too long. Maybe my biggest overall gripe with Below Zero is that your movement out of the water has not really been improved from Subnautica - it is wonky, slow, and you will get stuck very easily. I found the game's temperature management more annoying than tense or interesting.

Technically, as with the first game, Below Zero looks very good and runs well, though just like the first game I had issues with pop-in/LOD. I think the modeling and design work in Below Zero is maybe slightly better, with the devs learning a bit more about what looks good and what works. I did experience some early crashing which did not repeat as I put more time into the game. Weather effects look really nice in some areas, but bad in others, and most of the time you will wish they were not present as all they really do is limit your vision above water.

The story is more character-driven than the first game, for good and bad. Other people have already critiqued it extensively so I'm not going to bother beyond a brief take that's a bit of a spoiler: [spoiler]I didn't really care for the interaction between Robin and ALAN. It's all pretty trite sci-fi ""alien meets human"" boilerplate, which is surprising in a game that has some pretty good writing. In my opinion, it contrasts really poorly with the first Subnautica, which successfully establishes an emotional relationship between you and the Sea Emperor Leviathan with no back-and-forth dialogue and very little exposition at all. You care about the Sea Emperor because it is just a gentle giant trying to save its young, and/or you are trying to save yourself - you feel something, but what you feel is entirely up to the player. This part of the first game is so subtly brilliant that I can't help but cringe at some of the back and forth between Robin and ALAN. It's not THAT bad, but it falls way short of the first game, through no fault of either of the voice actors, who are doing the best they can with what they're given.[/spoiler]

One of this game's primary differences gameplay-wise from Subnautica is adding a new vehicle and functionally merging two vehicles into one. Unfortunately, the new vehicle (the hoverbike) is both necessary for dealing with the game's extended out-of-water sections and pretty painful to control and use. I'm not sure if it would be better or worse with a gamepad. The other new vehicle is the Sea Truck - essentially a Seamoth with modular compartments you can add to the rear. While it is more useful than the Seamoth, it's nowhere near as cool as the Cyclops and lacks some fairly important features that the Cyclops had. Some people complained that this game is less scary than the first Subnautica, and I would mostly agree. There is still some tension, but there are fewer aggressive creatures overall and most of the aggressive creatures, for one reason or another, are less dangerous. [spoiler]The lone exception might be the Shadow Leviathan, though I think I found the Shadow more annoying than dangerous, as it seems to exclusively hunt the player and seems to have less natural behavior than a lot of the dangerous enemies from the first game.[/spoiler] Below Zero however does deserve credit for adding some features which were reverse-ported back into the first game.

This game had the bad fortune to be a followup to Subnautica, which I consider to be the gold standard for exploration games. With that in mind, this game is not really a sequel but an expansion, it's not something that stands completely on its own and someone who did not play the first game would probably not exactly understand what was going on with some of the game's plot points. Despite having some additional features, it falls short of the first game in world and design, but I'd still recommend it as a solid-not-spectacular follow-up to the first game.",1696099437,1696453305,True,22,0,0.730526447296142578,0,True,False,False

Good game 9/10
If you liked the first Subnautica you‘ll probably like this one. The Story is mostly good but also has its (small) bad parts. The game also has a greather emphasis on Storytelling than the first.
The gameplay is as good as in the previous game, in some ways even improved:
For example there is now a mineral detector tool, which speeds up the search for annoyingly rare resources (Lead).
The Graphics are overall AWESOME, the game looks great!
The new Biomes are also very well designed and feel alive, with each biome having it‘s own „feel“. There is one exception to this, but you‘re not gonna spend much time in that biome anyway so it doesn‘t matter that much.",1628157359,1696408430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*] Seatruck is slow, big and weak. Its only use is to go a little deeper in very early game.
[*] Snowfox is pretty much useless, restricted to land, can't explore caves and else.

No immersion at all; in the first game, the PDA was speaking. The main character was ""me"", surviving in a hostile world where nobody else succeeds to escape the numerous threats.
Here, you're a random woman who never stops to speaks to investigate on HER sister death.
Some fully useless alien artefacts, some human buildings that you wouldn't want or need to explore, a mostly friendly woman who you leave on the planet and it's done.

I absolutely love this game. The exploration, building of different kind of vehicles, building a base, the incredible atmosphere, etc. The story could be a bit tedious sometimes and I also had 0 motivation to continue Robin's story but I really liked Al-An's story because I especially love the mysterious atmosphere around the architect tech so discovering it was very fun. And the ending, damnn it was INCREDIBLE

And no, by no means was this game perfect, but I really, really enjoyed playing it, and I am no game crictic so I judge subjectively and that's why I think that this game deserves a strong: 9/10 Would recommend!

Okay, just finished the game and its was beautiful.

Game mechanics was pretty much the same as in the previous game, it didn't bother me to grind same materials and stuff to make base and everything, i was enjoying it. 

Vehicles in this game was downgrade to first game, Seatruck was good but i didn't even need to craft the Prawnsuit cuz i didn't need it, Snowfox was awful and add-ons didn't help at all using it, so crampy.

Nature was beautiful and I enjoy every moment, especially when I found a new area to explore.
i liked the idea walk on land but it was too much of it, especially when Snowfox was awful to use.

I like to explore so i found things in the game what I shouldn’t have found yet, i didn't know what to do and found wrong things and skip som things on the story. There was many times when i didn't know where to go next and i googled what to do next and got one pretty big spoiler.

Game was optimized much better than the first one, even my potato computer can run it with almost best settings. First game was laggy as hell.

Afterall i was hyped to play this and I liked the game and the story, i cant wait the next Subnautica game which is confirmed. 


i want to give this game 9/10, what a amazing game.



You can go check my screenshots from game but please, be careful i marked those which contains spoilers as ''contains spoilers'' so watch them carefully.

But I didn't get the joy of exploration as much as the first game, some places are really confusing, have bad vision, makes them very easy to get lost.
I didn't get such frustation when exploring in the first game.

I give this game 8/10.
First game gets 9/10 from me.

What I like:
+ Talking protagonist, makes the story more fun and more immersive
+ Have more info about story prior to first game
+ Better guidance of the story than the first game, we get clear objective on where to go next most of the time
+ Seatruck + many useful modules are practical, although it gets really slow and hard to navigate
+ Pretty easy achievements, although some are skippable

What I didn't like:
- Exploring snowy land is really not fun
- Seatruck modules need to be attached / ordered by hand, really hope the Seatruck Dock can be used to manage the modules
- Hoverbike is not easy to control, and we get ejected when touched by the enemy on the ground. Better to just use Prawn
- Teleportation module feels useless if we can't go back and forth multiple times
- Toy robot turns around really slow, and we have to control it fast enough before catching hypothermia (we should be able to control it while inside Prawn)",1695890971,1695890971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

New biomes, new gear, new wildlife, new horrors, and old friends. The much sought after squeal to the legendary first Subnautica game. I did enjoy this game, I wanted to say this up front, but in the end Below Zero was a mixed bag of improvements, alterations, and downgrades.

Gameplay: Subnautica is a survival game underwater with horror and dread elements. You build tools and buildings through blueprints and materials on the planet to survive until you can find a way to escape. This formula hasn't changed and is just as good as before, with some changes to certain recipes and some new features (like recipe pins). This time they added some new tools (mineral searcher, music box, etc) and swamped out old gear and vehicles for new ones. Some make sense (temperature based suits and snow filter system) but I find the new seatruck not as good as the seamoth from the first game. They really should've called it a seatrain as its more of a mobile base (like the sub in the first game) and leaves you without a mid-class vehicle. On the flip-side, base-building has expanded greatly with more items, options, and even music to keep you busy for hours.

Storyline: I'll try not to give too much away for those who haven't played yet. The story is the biggest change and the one most have trouble with. The first game began with you crashing after your ship crashes on an unknown water planet. You quickly find you are alone and must find a way to survive while solving the mysteries of this world. Below Zero has you playing a named character, Sam, who is sneaking to 4546B to find out what happen to her sister, who was a researcher at Alteria's base on the planet. One of the traits that made the first game so immersive was the isolation, alone with only your wits and all other contact was either through messages or PDA recordings. The sequel removes a lot of the unknown from the world (as their are multiple bases on the planet now) and all the characters have recordings and id profiles. This isn't all bad, it helps create a sort of murder mystery. The real problem is how forced the isolation element is, the reason all the bases are abandoned is never explained or explored (and with what you learn it makes no sense that Alteria would just run away). From what I learned during the early development cycles the story was YOU being one of the new researchers with the base Alteria founded after the character from the last game returned. A catastrophe occurs with you being the sole survivor and trying to survive in the frozen wastes till help arrives. I feel this might have been a better story.

The other half of the tale from Below Zero is the alien tech storyline, I found this far more fun and engaging than the 'lost sister' plot and some of the best moments of the game came from here.

Game World: A bunch of changes here as we go from the equator to the poles of the world of Subnautica, giving us new species, biomes, and resources. It helps keeping the return to 4546B fresh with enough from the first game to make it feel familiar. Two other big changes here, the game world is smaller and much of the events are more linear. This makes the story easier to follow, but reduces some of the exploration. The biomes themselves and most of the species are fantastic and fun to explore. The spot they tripped up was the larger predators, they are easily avoided mostly and sadly not very memorable, though to be fair it's hard to match the sheer horror of the reaper leviathan and ghost leviathan.

The other part Unknown worlds introduced in Below Zero is the land aspect of the tundra, some cool creatures here but it feels unpolished as most dangers are easily avoided and overcome early on. It was a novel idea, but I feel they needed to do some more work on it before they released it.

In Conclusion: The world and gameplay of Subnautica: Below Zero is still as great as the first game, if you don't compare it too much with the first game it holds up well. The story and characters were by far the weakest part with the second plot with the aliens far more exciting, giving us a great endgame and conclusion. As I said before, I like this game and enjoyed playing it and I do recommend it, though anyone who wants to play this should play the original Subnautica first, then decide how you feel about it.",1695665847,1695828326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will not say this game is better than the OG however, cause there is no way Unknown Worlds could top that, and I hate comparing the two for that reason.

Main griefs for me are the world layout and, because of the world layout, progression throughout the game.
In Subnautica you progressed by steadily going deeper and deeper, building small outposts in the new biomes. In Below Zero I found myself steadily going back and forth to the very 1st base I build. I only dove deeper to get some resources and went back. This is due to the world layout. The deeper biomes are merely pockets with no real space for a base and, unlike Subnautica, they only have one entrance/exit and don't lead to even more deeper biomes.
Another thing is that land takes up way too much space for my liking. If you could go under all that ice this would be another story but you sadly can't.

It's hard to believe this game was made by the same company as the original Subnautica. While there are  some quality of life improvements, there are several major design flaws in this game. 

For example, the story has this side plot that you can completely miss if you don't get lucky in your exploration, and even then you will also have to follow obscure hints. This side plot is actually the reason why the protagonist goes to that planet, so it's weird that you can finish the game without completing it. The main plot is strange too because sometimes it holds your hand, and sometimes it completely leaves you hanging, so it's really uneven. 

Many upgrades and equipment only spawn in ONE single place, so you can easily miss them. This is a game where you will absolutely need to use the Wiki to find your gear, which wasn't the case with the original.

The map is smaller and not as enjoyable to explore. The overland sections were also not very fun, I just wanted to go back underwater.

In terms of vehicle, I spent the whole game craving for a Seamoth. While the concept of the Seatruck seems good, in practice it just doesn't work too well. This thing feels clunky as soon as you start adding compartments, and most of them are just not very useful in practice, other than the storage one. It's useful to carry the Prawn around, but you rarely need it. It's useful to carry a Fabricator, but you will often miss components so you need to go back to your base anyways. Also, the Seatruck has no Sonar or Solar Charger upgrades, which were awesome with the Seamoth. The deeper levels are a confusing mess and that sonar would have made all the difference.

Anyways, if you want to have more fun, go play the original Subnautica.

edit: I've changed my review to positive, because despite its flaws, its a game I've enjoyed a lot and is totally worth playing.

Compared to first game, It certainly has some good improvements in terms of game mechanics and features, but it really loses out on the environment and story part. I'm not getting that same vibe of strandedness here.

In particular, I'd like to nag about the leviathans. First game's leviathans really looked and sounded like monsters and it added a lot of spice to the game. I especially liked their unique, unsettling roars and listened to them many times on Wiki later. Here they just have some very average sounds that are hardly distinguishable from other lifeforms and one of the leviathans just looks like a normal big fish that doesn't look threatening at all.

Edit: Another thing I really don't like is that the whole glacial area is a massive maze. There's a ridiculous amount of caves and pathways.

Like the first game, Below Zero carries over the beautiful sound design, interesting biomes, cool creature design, and the excitement of discovering a world yet to be explored.

Where it falls short for me the most is that it lacks the fluidity of the first game, which is such an essential component of satisfying plot progression and world exploration. The first Subnautica does an excellent job of progressing you through different biomes as a natural action in progressing the plot. When in doubt, go deeper! It lays out a framework for you to explore the world, leaving enough discretion to the player to keep exploration from feeling boxed in or formulaic, but with enough guidance that you don't get frustrated and become lost.

For me, Below Zero completely lacked this framework. I realized after beating it that it is easily possible to make it to the end and miss about 80% of the game. There are so many areas that you are never directed to, never even brought close to. This disconnect is exacerbated by the fact that there are a number of separate running plot lines, which lack connection to one another and are not at all necessary to actually 'beat' the game. You can even beat the game without even fulfilling the player character's original objective!

Aside from the choppy plot lines, the other thing I missed in Below Zero was the size of the world. The first Subnautica did an incredible job of capturing the terrifying vastness of an alien ocean - Below Zero missed this. The biomes are more condensed, less vast. A lot of the biomes in Below Zero give the same energy as the shallows - close to the surface, not a lot of empty space, tons of spots to hide. That's not to say the game design isn't beautiful, but for me it lacked a real 'ocean' feel at many times.

Overall, worth playing. Not the same as the first, but I enjoyed in nonetheless. Definitely take the time to explore all of the nooks and crannies of the world if you want to fully experience it.",1695504685,1695504685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Apparently Below Zero is such a disjointed mess because they scrapped the story part way through development. The OG writer left, and was replaced by a writer whose only real credit is having worked on Assassin's Creed games, which completely explains the nose dive in quality. 

The new writer started the story from scratch, while ignoring existing elements of the game. When you find yourself wondering why the bases & labs look the way they do, why certain activities are the way they are, why characters say things that don't make sense, why you keep falling into plot holes, the answer is ""because of the original story."" The new writer couldn't be bothered to account for the state the game was in, basically just slapped their steaming pile on top of the gutted corpse of the original, and called it good.

If I'd known about this, I would not have bought the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That many hours, yet not recommended? Yeah. Sort of. This is one of those ""I wish there was a neutral option"" reviews. Do not buy this at full price, like I did, thinking ""oh hey, more from the awesome devs of the first Subnautica! This'll be great!"" It's fun, kinda, but it's also a hot mess of bad writing, failure to communicate all the controls, failure to communicate objectives, a confusing map that's hard to navigate without beacons scattered everywhere, and a nonsensical anti-climatic ending. If you're hoping to re-experience the magic of the first Subnautica, go re-play the first Subnautica. If you just want to toodle about in a wintry ocean, build a few bases, and are fine with treating the story as something to do between material excursions and egg collecting, then you'll probably be happy. So, while I do think they completely biffed the beginning and the end, the middle has an enjoyable amount of exploration, just not enough for me personally to recommend paying full price.

I started out thinking I wasn't enjoying the game because I screwed up in the beginning, literally went north (towards visible content) when I was meant to have gone south (blindly swimming out into empty open water, with no real gear). I ended up playing a large chunk of mid-game material right in the beginning (which made it way more difficult than it's apparently intended to be) before I stumbled into what was supposed to be the beginning. The more I played, the more I realized I wasn't doing things wrong; I was following the ""path"" the devs laid out, but that path was poorly constructed resulting in it being easy to encounter the story out of order.

The story... it's like they got bored 30% of the way through writing it, cliff-notes the middle and wrote a bullet point or two for the end. You've journeyed to planet 4546B to find out the real reason behind your sister's death. You do that, learn who is responsible and why, and do... nothing. You say... nothing. There is literally no acknowledgement that you've ""solved the case"". I actually traveled all the way back to an ""area of significance"" thinking maybe this was more out-of-order wonkiness and that some dialog would trigger if I went back to the ""scene of the crime"". Nope. The end game doesn't stop here though. Oh no. It veers off into an irrational cliff hanger ending.

My head-cannon is that Robin didn't survive landing, and the entire game is just her dying brain grasping at wish fulfillment.",1694845177,1695337155,False,38,0,0.751540243625640869,0,True,False,False

I was hoping to be able to continue the trend of the original Subnautica, with deeper canyons, twistier tunnels, and scarier fish, but I didn't get any of that. The map is more cramped and just as difficult to navigate while being less satisfying than the former once mastered. There were a few good tunnels that messed with my sense of direction and gave me oxygen anxiety, but they weren't balanced out by any grand, underwater caverns I was able find. Others have talked about the land gameplay, (and I'm inclined to agree) but I guess the land gameplay was still necessary because the only creature that actually gave me any fear was a land animal. Everything in the water felt squishy and underwhelming. 

There were other things, too. For example: the PDA in the original felt sassy by virtue of being a machine that doesn't mince word. (ex. ""Your odds of survival have increased to unlikely, but plausible."") The PDA in this one feels like it runs on an early build of ChatGPT with custom instructions to try and be funny. (Ex. ""No bed, no storage, no place to put a fabricator module, no fun."") Then there were the PDAs you find of the researchers, which tried to tell a story but were too easy to grab out-of-order, and I'm not sure if the story was all that good anyway. I screeched when I went on that iceberg and [spoiler]got jumped by Maida...[/spoiler] And then that storyline got kinda squandered, too.

It really feels like they made an absolute banger in the original, then got started on the sequel and decided to backtrack on what made the first one awesome. Honestly, just go replay that and skip this one.",1695331145,1695331145,False,3,0,0.502730131149291992,0,True,False,False

For some reason, the developers created a plot in which there's as much land-traversal as there is diving. Just one of the worst and most confusing design directions I've ever seen.

With a minor change in my approach, I was able to enjoy this game much more than before, and I feel that the issues below zero has compared to the original subnautica boil down to a single element. [spoiler] His name is Al-An. [/spoiler]


Simply put, early in the game you will find a distress signal which seems to come from an alien source. Do not investigate this source. Explore the world as you see fit besides this; if you want a good benchmark when you finish doing what Sam originally came to the planet to do before exploring this signal. I found the experience of this game to be much closer to the original when played this way, even with the aid of online resources (namely maps) for when I was stuck. I've grown a lot fonder of below zero as a result of this playthrough, and would recommend this game to anyone interested on one condition: do not, and I CANNOT stress this enough, DO NOT interact or investigate the alien distress signal near the start of the game.

The reason? Once you investigate this signal, you will have most points of interest highlighted on your screen by waypoints, which take one out of the world, and discourage exploration, instead prompting the player to just beeline it to the mark on the map ignoring everything along the way as the game basically tells you where to go for progress, rather than relying on exploration, the primary driving force in subnautica. This is fine when one wants to just end the game. It is not fine for a normal play through, ESPECIALLY a first one. [spoiler] It also brings the worst character in the game to be glued to the player for the rest of the game, and very little of value is added with his presence. Many people wrongfully point to Sam for this, but in reality, it's entirely on Al-An, who has no narrative synergy with the protagonist unlike other characters, only interacts with the main character, and also actively makes the game worse for the player. He is the worst kind of companion. [/spoiler]


Do not interact with that cave. Do not investigate the alien signal until you are satisfied with what you have accomplished in a play through. Yes, it is technically required for some progression, but trust me, you want to pick it up at the very last possible moment.",1654411408,1695154091,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I loved the original Subnautica, it was scary, the environments felt unique compared to every other one, you grinded to go deeper and deeper, eventually going into the lava zone, it was perfect.  Then with Below Zero there are still different areas, but they never felt as unique as the original game.  I think the largest factor in this is the on-land gameplay.  While riding on a snowfox is tons of fun, a large portion of the map is just boring white land surrounded by cliffs.  

I wish there were more large hostile creatures as well.  When I think back to first game there was the Reaper, Ghost Leviathan, and Sea Dragon, but in Below Zero I can only recall the Shadow Leviathan.  A large part of what made the first game so exciting was the fear of not knowing what was below and then learning you could go deeper and deeper down, but that wasn't a part of this game.  I don't even think there was an area that went below 1k meters, and that's just kinda disappointing.

There are still good things to find here though.  The base building is much improved from the first game.  There is more variety  and the new base parts allow for a lot of creativity.  Though there is no seamoth in this game the seatruck is a fantastic alternative with a lot of customizability.  There is also a start-to-finish storyline that takes place through the game that I thought was handled pretty well.  I would still recommend Below Zero despite my problems with it because it did improve on the gameplay aspects of the game; I just wish that they would've kept the same level of atmosphere that the first game had.",1694945511,1694945511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most glaring issue is the story. The change in lead writers was painfully obvious. The new databank entries are lackluster compared to the entries recycled from [i] Subnautica [/i] , and the dialogue is plain awful. I felt like I was listening to half-baked stories from the creatively bankrupt ""Humans Fuck Yeah"" subreddit. I cannot think of a single moment from [i] Below Zero [/i] that is as memorable as the ham and cheese sandwich moment, much less anything else. It didn't help that the voice acting was atrocious either. The player character always sounded like she was reading Dr. Seuss to preschoolers. [spoiler] I liked Marguerit, but her role in this game undermines the theme of the first game. In [i] Subnautica [/i] she was supposed to criticize the bloodlust-filled attitude of many players, but now she's portrayed sympathetically. How she survived the Khaara infection also isn't explained. [/spoiler]

Dialogue and a voiced player character also removed the all-pervasive feeling of loneliness and isolation that was executed so well in the first game. The terror of the first game was also notably absent.

Gameplay wise, not much changed. Everything below the surface is functional (except for the absence of the stasis rifle). The on-land segments are tedious at best; the Snowfox is pointless because it's outclassed by the P.R.A.W.N. Suit in every way. The mech suit moves faster, can mine, and doesn't fling you out of it when hit by the Ice Worm.

In short, [i] Below Zero [/i] is worse than its predecessor in terms of story, atmosphere, and several gameplay aspects. I would just download mods for the original [i] Subnautica [/i] if I were you.",1622231460,1694846077,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Which is a shame as it seems to have lost something important in the pursuit of a more defined but somewhat dull story. This time it's a lot smoother with less getting stuck or relying on the grapple to pull you across rooms. I wish they had of finished the original off, as well as this. The game area I had heard was much smaller in this one but I have found it quite big enough and it's surprisingly easy to get lost in above sea areas. 

I like how you are guided around the map better in this one, although you are babied some what and a lot of the objectives are easy to reach straight off. I had also been concerned about the new Truck, but it isn't much different from the sea moth, at the start. At least it doesn't get pinched and dumped under ground like in the original game, but the snow fox can disappear under the ground when you place it.

They could have changed the environment a bit more as it seems the same as the first game, only with the surface being extremely cold. Why change the PDA voice as now 30 seconds of oxygen remaining gets very annoying and what is with all the female characters, that are hard to find any appeal with. The story is ok at best, and doesn't really go anywhere. It feels like an alternative remake of the original. the dangers from different life forms is very weak and you've got more chance of drowning, than having much of a problem with most of the sea life. It could have been a lot better but I view it as more of a remake than a progression. So it's good for those that haven't played the original or people that needed guides to find silver lol. 

So as a sequel it is disappointing as it is more of the same really without the mystery or much terror, so I can understand the negativity and I myself found that I lost interest fast. The survival mode works much better in this game... that's for sure but adds very little or nothing to the enjoyment.

848450,59076834,76561198167587862,215,17,3121,0,266,1682065554,"Its a great game with loving developers. it may only be single player, but the game would be a lot less fun with friends. The idea of isolation is a core concept to the Subnautica series. Its more relaxed in Below Zero, but the player continues to feel like the only human on the planet. The addition of a companion that talks to the character is a nice touch, acting as the guide to the game without ever introducing spoilers to the story and keeping the game's mechanics simple and easy to pick up.


The above review was from before the game fully released, and perfectly captures my joyous innocence and optimism for the Subnautica series moving past the first installment. Since Below Zero's full release, I have found myself to be disappointed time and time again with the narrative direction, dialogue and gameplay. It's like they took what made the first game so successful and charming, and purposefully ignored it in order to make Below Zero stand out. And stand out it does, because it completely threw me for a curve. First of all, there is NO feeling of isolation due to the constant, and I mean CONSTANT voice lines. The ""helpful"" companion previously mentioned started off fine enough, but quickly grew irritating as my HUD was cluttered with waypoints and my ears assaulted by inconstant writing. The characters are constantly contradictory or just plain stupid (who in their right mind takes two food bars and a few water bottles on an arctic expedition? No clothes, no building materials). I could go more in depth about how the map itself failed to be interesting or even cause a sense of danger, since everything was so cramped that nothing could hide from you. The only slightly interesting section was the land bit, but that quickly grew tedious, dull and irritating, since snowstorms were a common occurrence and the ""land"" vehicle almost never works as intended. 
While I still recommend this game to people, I do not recommend going in with high expectations. If you want a fulfilling game with a SOMEWHAT plausible story, pick up the first game and forget about this one. While the first game has its narrative problems, they are far less egregious than the ones present in Below Zero. Play this game if you want, but do not expect much from the gameplay itself. Find something you enjoy doing and stick to that, weather that be cataloging the new hostile creatures (90% of them are some form of shark btw) or filling your aquariums with the non-hostile variants (funny starfish spin :) ).

I bought it on discount and I regret it anyway. This game seems fun for a couple of hours maybe but if you take a closer look: the story isn’t mind-blowing, the map is short and feels empty, and there is only one enemy. If you enjoyed the first game, it might be better to stick with it instead of buying this one.

 3. Tried 2 years later, still too early, but somewhat playable. Got to 50% of the story and got bored.
 4. I Tried it now in 2023, almost a year since the last update and the game feels like a cash grab.

The story is boring and lacks depth and connection on why we do not have resources or blueprints. The pacing is terribly slow and there is no guidance on what to do. 

Do not make the same mistake of sinking 30 hours into an unpleasant, cash grab. They had so much potential when doing this one after they had so much success with the first. Unfortunately, modding community abandoned this game, since it was changed so much and most of them do not work.

has some good and poor points compared to the previous title.

the good
gathering resources are just way easier. I really appreciated the koppa mining site and early prawn, it lets you get alot of titanium pretty early on to do fun things like build a big base
speaking of bases, i like the new base parts (even though its not super useful most of the time) it's still awesome and rule of cool is a thing for a reason.
some people dislike the story. i dont think its that bad, i loved seeing marguerite again, sam's story, and alan/robin interactions are just plain funny. i def prefer bz's story over subog. dont even think robin is that annoying like others do lmao.

the bad
the vehicles range from meh to downright useless/unbalanced.
seatruck: for most of the game i used it in seamoth solo truckin mode because 1. i literally cannot find the modules, or rather didnt go out of my way too really, and 2. the modules you can add are pretty meh. maybe its because im a devout cyclops fanboy... i'll just say that i think the seatruck is not terrible, in fact its pretty ok considering the smaller and tighter map, but its just... boring compared to what we had, i guess.
prawn: its even more awesome, i think its better than og's because of the speedboost function and honestly it just felt way smoother to handle.
snowfox: oh god its just plain terrible. the controls are pretty bad. maybe its because i didnt try it out for more than 15 minutes, but the reason for that is because...

the ugly
oh god the pop in and bugs are atrocious. in both games, i lost a total of 3 vehicles. in og, i lost my prawn to hubris in lava zone. in bz, i lost a seatruck and a snowfox... not due to hubris, but entirely due to bugs. the seatruck was lost when i was making my way towards the mercury ii bow for further exploration, the beacon came up, I went ""damn, where is it?"" got out, and BAM, it popped in AROUND the seatruck and its now stuck in the bridge of the mercury ii, which is inescapable for the seatruck. the third vehicle was the snowfox, and i KID YOU NOT, 15 minutes after I got it, I picked it up, placed it back down, and it BURROWED INTO THE SNOW. LIKE AN ACTUAL SNOWFOX. which is why i decided to just do the entire land section in the prawn suit instead, which i dont think was intended. maybe if id gotten more than 15 minutes to play around with the snowfox i wouldve liked it. idk. never had these issues with glitches in og, so idk why its all happening in bz. settings are the same too.

tldr sub bz is a pretty good game if you liked sub og, just play it for fun, and be careful around the mercury ii bow. cheers.",1694536185,1694537317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When considering a story aspect I actually enjoyed this game much more than the prequel. I won't go into details, since I don't want to spoil but the ending has room for a lot of possibilities, if another game is planned to be released.

It was very fun to discover the different biomes! But if you're like me you'll need to search for safe routes for the more hostile biomes, because this game can very scary at some points. 

I don't know if it was shorter because I was not that afraid of the fauna, considering I already went through the first game and thus made much faster progress but I felt like it went by way quicker. Maybe I was enjoying it more which makes it seem like time is flying by.

The biggest downside for me compared to the previous game is the map. Its smaller and it feels way more claustrophobic and empty at times.

The level design isnt quite as good, there's much less depth and exploring as the first one. The land section is a bit of a maze and the ground vehicle handles very badly which makes it a bit difficult to bear.

The water sections are good but with the narrative driven story, I often found I was kind of rail-roaded, rather than exploring things as the first one.

The story is also not particularly engaging, its trying its best to not get in your way, so often your character is silent, but not in a good way like Gordon Freeman in HL, and there isnt quite enough story to keep me interested; I feel like they should have gone all-in one way or the other.

I took a big break from the game due to events happening in real life and when I came back a few months later, I really found very little motivation to play on, so I uninstalled it, which is a shame, because I really wanted to like it, but Unknown Worlds failed to capture the same spirit of the first game.",1694210468,1694210468,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you had asked me to reccomend the game before the writing of the story completely changed, I wouldve said 100% yes - as the game stands now, however, it is just a shell of how it began.

The protagonist is now constantly quipping in and talking throughout the game - and instead of the calm, mature and flawed scientist she was in the beginning of EA, she became a stereotypical action girl who can do no wrong.

The story makes absolutely no sense and is completely pointless. [spoiler] You fly to 4546B because you dont believe Alterra when they say your sister died due to negligence. But then at the end of the mystery you find out that it was true all along. Sam killed herself by mistake by setting off the bomb earlier than intended. Thats negligence. Then you just decide to... leave to an alien planet? Not only that but your conversations with the Architect are also frustrating. Before the massive writer change, Robin's conversations with Al-An felt like she was trying her best to reason with Al-An and find a middle ground at every situation; it truly felt like Robin was being mature about every topic, even when trying to explain how humanity works to Al-An. Now, all Robin does is reply with unfunny one liners, sarcasm and anger. [/spoiler]

The map and soundtrack are the only saving graces of this game. As a Subnautica experience, it still retains the fun exploration, crafting, base building and unique environments to discover. The land sections arent as bad as some people say they are, the movement out of water is just anky, which I wish they wouldve tuned.

Overall, if youre looking for a Subnautica experience, just go play the original. This one is not worth playing unless you can bear the pain of hearing an unfunny action girl and play through a pointless storyline.",1694120155,1694120155,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Graphics were improved in many ways. The world continues to look wonderful, the creatures, the flora, everything looks great and detailed. The weather system adds a lot of immersion with the storms, auroras, fog, etc.

Sound effects continue to be awesome and immersive. All the voice acting is great. And the music is excellent, also the jukebox tunes are great.

Gameplay was a bit of a step-down from the previous game. Starting the game on land, and having to spend a lot of time on land during important parts of the game, in a game named Subnautica, was very disappointing. Part of the magic that the first game had was the endless ocean all around you, and the feeling that you experienced is just lost in this one, when you are surrounded with land and icebergs full of friendly penguins.
Resource gathering and basic survival stays mostly the same, although this one felt more rushed. Some of the tools and upgrades that in the first game you had to do a lot of exploration to find, in this one you find pretty fast, making some of them unrewarding and even pointless.
The fauna continues to be interesting, with new fun additions, and for the most part not that aggressive or dangerous. The new leviathans are not that scary or dangerous as the ones in the previous game.
Resource availability in general is fine, with a few exceptions that you will notice pretty early. The distribution of resources on the biomes felt a bit off, I mean, finding almost endgame materials near the first biome was a bit disappointing.
The lack of a map in this game was even more painful than then first one, mainly on the land parts, but also underwater (the lack of the sonar was really painful). I still don't understand how an exploration game have no actual map (yeah, there is a map that is just a vague image of the land, and it's pretty much useless) to discover, add points of interest, rotate, zoom, etc.
Moving to the vehicles, losing the seamoth and cyclops was a heavy blow, I loved those. The replacements, are not so great. The sea truck pretends to be a mix of the two, offering the speed and versatility of the seamoth, and adding the ""customizable mobile base"" component of the cyclops with the modules. But in reality, it fails to deliver both. The size and shape of the sea truck makes it get stuck in all sort of places and is slower than the seamoth. The animation to get in and out is super annoying every time that you forget to park it tilted. And most of the modules are useless. Not only, they make the sea truck slower and less maneuverable, they offer little to no benefit. Only two of the six modules are really useful. If for some reason you still decide to build them all, you can't even park them in the sea truck dock, because every time you  leave, you have to manually detach the modules. The snowfox bike is just useless, weak annoying to drive, gets stuck on everything, can't ride over water, etc. Thankfully, we have our trusty prawn suit to save the day.
The building system continues to be great. There are a bunch of new tools, a TON of beds (seriously, how many beds can you build?), a lot of new buildable cosmetics, new cosmetic options for your base and a few new and redesigned machines.

The story has so much more focus this time, with a lot of voice acting, images of the characters that speak, characters background, etc. It was nice, not that interesting as the first one, but ok. Also, the order in which you find the PDA's hurt a lot the development of the plot, and maybe even leave you saying ""what? that can't be right, i'm surely missing something"".

Like the first game, there are a bunch of game modes to select when you start playing, depending on the experience you want to have. If you want more freedom to build and explore, or you want the survival elements as well, or you want to customize every aspect of it, there are modes for you.

In short, great and immersive game, it still has the core parts that made the first one so awesome, but is a bit of a step-down in many of the mechanics. If you enjoyed the first game, you probably will be a bit disappointed with this one, but you will enjoy it and have a lot of fun anyway.",1694117763,1694117763,True,63,2,0.856358528137207031,0,True,False,False

In the first, I found the game a lot more intuitive and interesting - as the world felt unexplored but rich in biodiversity, and risk! In this game, the linear story-line felt forced - and resulted in more of a tunnel-vision, where all that mattered was fulfilling the next objective, which left all the environment building as more of an obstacle rather than something worthy of a Subnautica game. I also found the more limited choice of fabricator recipes you start off with annoying. I can see some of the cool parts of the ecosystem in this game, but if I had to sum up this game in a word, it would be 'frustrating' - the caves and land is so difficult to navigate and where in the first game I was able to swim around in caves without the need for a pathfinder tool, its pretty much a necessity in this game, plus finding certain materials - even with a material detector - is so much more annoying, plus the navigation is not intuitive at all - I would be exploring and quickly come to the void without finding the entrance to any caves of interest and without seeing very many different biomes at all. After the first games' diversity in both biomes and their ecosystems, animals and flora, this game's diversity of ""surface water"" biomes feels like a lot more of a let down. The game doesn't even feel dangerous - like there's much on the line. In the first game, the reaper was an absolute nightmare and even stalkers at first seemed scary - but for me at least, the predators are just...underwhelming. The first time I saw the 'giant shrimp leviathan', it wasn't even scary - it was like 'what is this shimp thing' - it was more of an inconvenience than anything else and just seemed to add to the monotony of this game. This is just my experience(/rant) though, and if you're looking for a lore-based survival game which feels very linear, I reckon this would be a game you might enjoy.

With all due respect, you'd have a better time watching a review than actually playing the game. Its got a fair few issues that are partially remedied by the fact its still Subnautica. i'll list em here:

WARNING: SOME SPOILERS PRESENT

1: General difficulty is a bit of a mess. It is nowhere near as difficult as the original, which was already a fairly easy game. I'll try not to get into details outside the spoiler blocks, but you wont have any trouble playing it, aside from the storage, which is worse. [spoiler] The perimeter defense instantly stops all creatures from attacking your vessel, it doesnt go nearly as deep at the first, there are very few leviathans present, theres more stuff around. [/spoiler] 

2: The fear factor from Subnautica is mostly gone aside from some specific areas. You won't get scared nearly as often, and the devs instead decided to focus on the story, which im about to get into. [spoiler] The only area with any real scares left in it is the crystal caves, which are not required for the entirety of the game and are purely story based. There's more light everywhere, your seatruck and prawn suit are both tankier, nothing is really as big a threat anymore. [/spoiler] 

3: The story is... well, you can tell it was rewritten halfway through development. There are all sorts of odd things, weird shoehorned story bits, things that just dont make sense. Again, all of that is spoilers though. [spoiler] Al-An, your alien friend who lives rent-free in your head, is your stereotypical ""i dont understand humanity"" alien, despite being a biologist. Instead of attempting to explain it like Robin should be able to as a Xenologist, she just ends up in banter with him that gets old fast. You never really resolve your sister's storyarch, and the ending is nonsensical. Its just not my cup of tea, and really doesnt make sense. [/spoiler] 

4: Land. Yeah, the big thing this game has for it? Its... not the greatest. The hoverbike is a slog to use, to the point you are better off walking, and there arent any real threats aside from the ENTIRELY avoidable cold with some quick crafting. [spoiler] There is no reason to be on land aside from story bits, the land has no resources, the cold suit instantly invalidates the cold, and in general the land feels like a slog. [/spoiler] 

Now, at this point it seems like this is a pretty negative review to be labeled as a thumbs up, right? Well, one thing IS still present, and thats that it's subnautica, a master class in survival games. Even if you arent surviving quite as much as before, its still fairly fun, although you are going to be MUCH better off playing the original.  So go play that one, and if you are willing to deal with the quirks of this game, id imagine you will still have a fun time.",1571869715,1693862304,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

It also contains many features requested by players in early access Subnautica, that were added into this game but not Subnautica. It's obvious that there was some parallel development of both titles, and at some point they said ""All this stuff we were going to add to Subnautica - let's use it as content for another full priced game instead"".

All in all I like the changes that they made, and I feel like the devs have learnt a lot about game and map design that allow the game to run more smoothly. Unfortunately the game is not really big enough to fully utilise the tools. This applies particularly to the PRAWN suit, which I literally did not use the entire game, because the only thing I needed it for was extra lead, and it turns out they forgot to add mine-able lead deposits. 

If you don't own either game and are considering getting one, get Subnautica. It's far bigger and will keep you entertained a lot longer.

The OG Subnautica has my wholehearted recommendation, but something about the map and ""additions"" of this game just didn't do it for me this time around. There's some interesting ideas here, and I would like to say I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't played the first one... But sadly, some of the gameplay that was introduced (and is required to progress) isn't as solid. There's a lot of time spent out of the water in this one, and those sections are frustrating and tedious as opposed to the more invigorating ocean exploration. On top of this, the narrative (especially the characters) isn't as interesting as the first time around, and a large part of me wishes they had relied on the exquisite environmental storytelling and minimal dialogue of the first game. There's a lot of uninteresting people talking a lot, especially towards the end.

I'd love to see the devs try again with this series, but there needs to be some serious additions that focus on fun, a bigger and more interesting map, and a story that doesn't make me roll my eyes.",1693811195,1693811418,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The map's perhaps denser but a lot smaller and much shallower than the OG - there's not really any of the progressively ""going deeper"" to find more stuff of the first game. 
- The story's pretty weak - there's not much to it, it's kind of all over the place and at least one strand feels half finished. More generally, it lacks the sense of mystery of the first.
- There's less stuff to make, you need less resources to do it, and resources are much easier to come by so you never really needed to farm or even explore that much to find what you need. It's kind of handed to you.
To put that in context, my save was 28 hours to complete everything in SBZ, whereas it was 58 hours for the OG. Steam's numbers seem completely different but still about 1/2 - 44 hours compared to 88. 

If you get it on sale, you'll get your money's worth. It is after all - largely - more Subnautica. Some of the new biomes are pretty cool, there are some pretty impressive new beasties around and it's got at least one good wreck to trawl through. I say ""largely"" though because a big proportion of the game - far too much in my view - takes place on land. Slightly bizarrely, the devs played to their weakest suit, rather than their strongest. I mean, it's called Subnautica not Abovegroundia.

Overall, I enjoyed it and I'm glad I played it but, whereas at the end of the original, I wanted more and stuck around exploring, farming and building, when I finished the story in SBZ I was kind of done - ready to move on to something else. It made me want to play the original again but not really spend more time on 4546B. I missed the vibrant colours of the first game, its sense of scale, all the wrecks to explore, the lost river... And I really didn't want to spend more time trogging around on land that's basically, white, pretty barren and not that interesting.

I just revisited the game and finished it after playing many new and different games, and even going back to the original Subnautica to do another run through once or twice, and let me say, out of all of the games I've played from then to now, the only game that comes close is No Mans Sky, but this game is absolutely incredible.

The best part is it doesn't feel like a completely different game from Subnautica, but it feels like an extension, which is exactly what it is and should be. Many elements from Subnautica were brought into Below Zero, but they were all improved upon. Mechanics, base building is a drastic improvement, creatures, glitches, graphics, physics, all were made so much better but so subtly.

The story and side stories are also amazing, running two main story lines next to each other, making them cross often while remaining their own, so many more story elements too, and honestly a better story and ending from Subnautica.

I can only say two bad things about Below Zero. The SnowFox is really annoying to use, and honestly useless since a prawn suit is just better, and it's what I used instead of the SnowFox, and I miss the Cyclops. The Seatruck though is an amazing combination of the Seamoth and Cyclops, but I miss having a large vehicle to build inside and completely customize.

Also just glancing at the price again, for $30 this game is amazing.

Although, I will mention some of the bad too.

As good as the story is, some sections of it do lack, and feel anticlimactic, and the land sections are just mostly annoying, a bunch of twisty turns and messy tunnels and caves. However, they do have some interesting parts too.",1548990979,1693515904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly just not as good as Subnautica. The world is uglier and I'm less interested in exploring it. Exploring feels less rewarding, and the sense of progress and achievement I got from Subnautica is simply not present here.

It's fun enough to numb the mind for half an hour or so at a time, but I don't find it satisfying.

Some pet peeves:
-why is the PDA a sassy Indian woman? 
-i had to mute the game because the predator fish literally never shut the F up
-every cave is a claustrophobic labyrinth, unnecessarily difficult to explore (opposite of fun)

A pebble will make you come to a complete halt. The storytelling that was previously one of my favourite parts in the first game has now been reduced stale, uninspiring dialogue. Where's the mystery?

Pros

- Items & base building have been updated with alot of nice touches 
- Interesting location to set the game
- Visuals are often brilliant 
- audio is mostly excellent 

Cons

- story, characters & environment often made very little sense  
- Game location is never used to it's full advantage. You're always too safe  
- Transports are weirdly implemented (can't explain in short review)
- Once you get over the 1st time fear it never comes back, you will just drive past monsters knowing it's safe and saves time. 
- voiced protagonist, some will be ok with this some won't   
- Feels like someone else's story and your thoughts \ actions mean very little

VR is using a controller, not built in support for motion controls (although it is planned, but I prefer control pad for this one anyway).


To enable VR:

Install QMod manager
https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/1?tab=files 

then : Native VR Support for Subnautica Below Zero
https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/118?tab=files - Native VR Support for Subnautica Below Zero

And, not strictly VR but EasyCraft , just for the quality of life update: 
https://www.nexusmods.com/subnauticabelowzero/mods/10?tab=files

Various comfort options are built in , like snap turning etc and disabled Y axis on controller, put I prefer to turn them off .

Runs well on my rig with the following settings:

VR render rate (in game, not Steam VR options) 100%
SteamVR video options supersampling at 120%
Refresh rate in Index set to 90.

The above is my sweet spot and I've not had any feelings of nausea or reprojection.",1693229002,1693242788,True,8,1,0.587025165557861328,1,True,False,False

I guess we're done experiencing Subnautica for the first time though, which is probably what I really wanted, but this is a fun and characterfui survival game a hemisphere or so from Subnautica.

Getting lost on glaciers is not so great. About a third of the game doesn't worry about air or depth, so to keep it from being too easy we have to worry about going blind and freezing. It's weird to be able to name something that I dislike more than drowning, but here we are. Maybe even though a storm is inevitable, the randomness and loss of visibility makes it seem unfair, something to spoil my plans rather than part of the puzzle. If the storm above water was constant, and I could build something to cut through it and see further, that could solve it.

Pros:

- Same, but different. This game doesn't completely overhaul the original subnautica, keeping many mechanics the same meaning that after playing the first, transitioning over to the second will be smooth. But they did make changes that keep the game interesting - like the new temperature gauge and new suit types - alongside the Seatruck. There is enough to keep the game fresh whilst keeping it feeling like Subnautica.
- Fauna and Flora are overhauled. Some are the same, like the good old reliable Bladderfish - but there are new plants and animals such as the Stalker. It means that you arent just filling out the same PDA from the last game.
- New storyline. The storyline is different from the original game whilst referancing the events from the first - making for a nice throwback. The events of this game also explain why the first game happened in the first place. If you feel the first games story was left on a loose end then this game will tie up some of them - whilst providing more questions that you will want answered.

Cons:

- This game is more vague than the original. There is a lot of places to go that are essential to the story that you are never told about. Most of my time here was spent on the wiki trying to figure out where to go. F1 really helps with this.
- A personal issue with this game. Your character is no longer a blank slate to insert yourself over. They have a name, a backstory and objectives that you don't really understand or want to peruse. This game is definitely more story based than the original was instead of being surivival based.
- It is a bit shorter than the original. The original took 24hrs for me to complete whilst this one took 12hrs, over half the time. 
- I want the time capsule ability back.

Conclusion:

This game is good. Its a fun experience that faithfully continues the experience of the original Subnautica. However, it does not surpass the original. Only buy this game if you have played/like the original game. Otherwise - as a first introduction to the series it would be better to just play the original instead.",1693177284,1693177284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Subnautica: Below Zero takes players on a chilling and exhilarating sequel to the beloved original, inviting them to navigate an icy underwater world filled with beauty, danger, and the thrill of uncovering new mysteries. With its stunning Arctic visuals, immersive survival mechanics, and the allure of exploring uncharted depths, the game offers a captivating continuation of the Subnautica saga.

The visual design of Subnautica: Below Zero is a triumph, plunging players into the frigid beauty of a polar environment where ice and water merge seamlessly. The attention to detail in the Arctic marine life and the frozen landscapes creates an atmosphere that's both breathtaking and immersive.

At its core, Subnautica: Below Zero maintains the engaging blend of exploration, survival, and crafting mechanics that made its predecessor a hit. Players once again find themselves in the role of a survivor, navigating a new world teeming with unique challenges and mysteries to unravel.

The sense of discovery remains a standout feature, as players dive into the uncharted waters of the Arctic biome, encountering unfamiliar creatures, biomes, and secrets that beckon them to explore further.

The narrative of the game unfolds through the player's interactions, environmental cues, and audio logs, providing a more personal and intimate storytelling experience. The journey into the icy unknown reveals a compelling story that weaves the protagonist's fate with the enigmas of the frozen planet.

The game's survival and crafting mechanics continue to add depth to the gameplay, as players must gather resources, manage their hunger and oxygen, and construct equipment to brave the harsh environment.

However, the game's emphasis on exploration and survival might not resonate with players seeking a more action-focused experience. Subnautica: Below Zero prioritizes storytelling, immersion, and the thrill of discovery.

Some players might find moments of tension and danger to be intense, particularly when encountering the Arctic's unique and potentially hazardous creatures.

In conclusion, Subnautica: Below Zero delivers an exhilarating and chilling sequel that builds upon the foundation of its predecessor. Its stunning Arctic visuals, immersive mechanics, and the allure of exploring the frozen depths create an experience that is both captivating and emotionally engaging. While its focus on survival and exploration might not appeal to everyone, those who appreciate the beauty of the frozen frontier and the thrill of uncovering new enigmas will find themselves immersed in the icy world of Subnautica: Below Zero, where every dive is a plunge into the heart of a frozen mystery waiting to be unveiled.",1693031132,1693031132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was a fun and challenging game to play, and there is some streamlining as compared to the original Subnautica. Unfortunately the objective is not well defined. In the first game, cure yourself and leave the planet without getting blown up are very compelling objectives. In this game it revolves more around finding out what happened to your sister, and some alien ""precursor"" activity. The ending with the sister wasn't overly satisfying... or perhaps I didn't find it? The involvement of the Pengling Robot she worked on didn't have any payoff (despite searching endlessly in a frozen wasteland to find a payoff). 

The alien activity was more compelling... but i wasn't entirely sure why we were doing it. Besides... fuck it we're doing this. 

All in all I would say the first game was better. But this is still a worthy title in the Subnautica series. Get it on sale if you get it, the full £25 wasn't worth it in my view.

I definitely missed having the Cyclops submarine as well... a water-truck just doesn't have the same vibe.",1692957258,1692957258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[tr]
	[td] ✔️ Vastly improved base building; plenty of new rooms that work well within the much more densely designed biomes and offer decent support for above-water buildings as well.[/td]
	[td] ❌Despite each biome feeling more tightly designed, that design extends mostly into caves, which are an absolute pain to navigate. Both in a sense of trying to keep your direction as well as the feeling of being simply too tight to be comfortable for the games’ vehicles.[/td]

[tr]
	[td] ✔️ Arguably, the biggest issues from the previous games have been fixed. Leviathans ignoring map architecture as well as the horrendous pop-in. Leading to Below Zero being a much more immersive experience.[/td]
	[td] ❌ The game is shallow. Literally. Within the first few hours of starting the game, and even before the first major story events, I managed to finish the last depth modules for my Seatruck and explore the final areas of the game. Not because I was looking for them, but because my exploration just naturally went there.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td] ✔️ The game can look absolutely gorgeous; especially during the night, BZ literally shines through its fantastic use of bioluminescence to create incredibly memorable environments.[/td]
	[td] ❌ BZ’s story is notoriously bad. Its issues range from an overly chatty protagonist to vast inconsistencies between dialogues, an overall feeling of an unfinished story, and more.[/td]

	[td]I do think there is a place for land exploration in Subnautica. However, it seems dreadfully undercooked in Below Zero. Managing your temperature is extremely unengaging as a mechanic, and the game is still clearly not designed for movement outside of water, with the Snowfox being broadly considered by far the worst vehicle in the game.[/td]

[h3]Technical Issues and Performance[/h3]
Subnautica Below Zero ran perfectly fine during my twenty-hour playthrough. I experienced no stutters, glitches, or other performance problems. The biggest issue was the very occasional pop-in of some aspects of the environment, such as the ""legs"" of your base. Enemy A.I., while better than Subnautica, can still be a bit janky as well.

[h3]Graphics and Sound[/h3]
Graphically, Below Zero is fantastic. I mentioned the focus on bioluminescence already, which makes either the deeper parts of the ocean or the nighttime look absolutely stunning. Biomes in general are much more alien and distinct than in the previous game, even though the entire map shrank by quite a large margin. Sadly, often the game does not get to use this improvement in its visuals as BZ has a noticeable focus on tighter cave exploration, and the Glacier/Land parts are not comparable in quality either.

The sound design is decent but does not seem as impactful as Subnautica. There is something primal in the Reaper Leviathan screech that Below Zero just does not seem to be able to capture, be that through being used to the game or otherwise. Voice acting is rather bad, both through a mixture of a genuinely bad script and also through Robin, the main character, flip-flopping constantly in her delivery. In one instance, Robin repeated the same concern twice due to me hitting similar dialogue triggers back-to-back, but each time changing her intonation as if the context changed. It’s quite jarring and a constant issue throughout the story.

[h3]Story and Setting[/h3]
BZ’s story can largely be split into two arcs. You play Robin, a Xenologist who embarks on 4546B to find out the fate of her sister, who has been reported dead by the Literally-Satan company Alterra. This is the worse one. Largely because there is barely any active interaction between Robin and this story, as the only quest focused on it resolves by meeting Marguerit, another Survivor on the planet, and being broadly pointed to a research facility. From then on, the rest of this story plays out through a collection of absolutely atrocious data pads you may collect and an optional achievement, without reward, to finish her sisters’ work.

The second story and the actual story that needs to be completed to finish the game tie back into the Alien Precursor race from the first game and their involvement with local bacteria. Robin encounters one such Precursor alien and has to build him a new body to inhabit. You do exactly this. And then you leave. The rest of the story hinges on the badly written dialogue between Robin and Al-An.

It’s not the worst. And despite all the criticism of the genuinely bad writing and uninteresting setting, the player is still spared lengthy cutscenes and the like. It is bad, but it’s sparse enough to be bearable, and more so a symptom of the developers taking themselves a lot more seriously after their initial success on Subnautica. I can appreciate it for trying to be a little more ambitious, even though it made Below Zero worse in the end.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
Below Zero’s gameplay is largely identical to Subnautica, meaning a lot of your experience will carry over if you have played it. Otherwise, it is very typical survival gameplay; you’re stranded in an icy ocean, you have different crafting stations, and you need to progress through those crafting recipes, build a base, build vehicles, and dive ever deeper to try and achieve your objectives. Despite that, Below Zero feels a lot more linear precisely because the map has shrunk a lot; to put a number on that statement, while the original Subnautica bottomed out at ~1500m deep, Below Zero barely breaches 1000. The same is true horizontally, with large parts of the map being covered in actual land that will need to be traversed on foot. Sadly, there are no gameplay elements past a bike to aid in that part of exploration, leaving it woefully clunky. This has some side effects, such as Leviathans being even less threatening than in the original Subnautica, as there are only a handful of spots they even patrol and that are quite easy to memorize within hours of starting the game.

Predators are overall still not a threat, robbing Below Zero of much-needed tension. Regular enemies simply do not hit hard enough to kill you. Leviathans are still scripted to take a bite and then retreat long enough to repair any damage you may have sustained outside of one-shots when caught in the open. Vehicles are still as broken as before, even though piloting them got a lot more annoying through the sheer abundance of tight caves.

Basebuilding is vapid. More so than before, even though the interface and options have vastly expanded. While I did care to build a proper base in the original game, I got by perfectly fine with a single multipurpose room for storage, crafting, and battery recharge. If creative gamemodes are fun, there is some value here, but I don’t think that it is enough to save Below Zero.

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]
Originally, I called Subnautica fun through roleplaying. And the same holds true in Below Zero. It’s all a big game of pretending. If you can convince yourself that base building is fun and immersive and that it progresses your game, if you pretend that Leviathans are a threat and scary, if you pretend that anything you do actually matters, then Below Zero shines even more so through a lot of added detail. But it’s shallow. Figuratively and literally. Below Zero improved the looks. The stability. And the immersion but paid for it through an obnoxious story and a distinct misunderstanding of why the first Subnautica worked so well.",1692565948,1692565948,False,20,0,0.643343687057495117,1,True,False,False

I spent a few days playing through the original game and had a blast, but then I start this one and it's just some lightly disguised fetch quests, sub-par vehicles, and a flat story/characters. 

OG Subnautica had the Seamoth, which was fast and made me feel like an explorer in vast waters, and the Cyclops made me feel like a real futuristic submarine captain with all it's unique features. It had a story that kept throwing new things at you, and put the whole ""figuring this out"" thing in your hands and sent you on your way. It had characters that felt real, had real interactions with each other, and believable arcs. The lore of the game felt like it was necessary, and unavoidable since it was so intertwined with the sandbox aspect.

Subnautica Below-Zero has a glorified truck, with hugely inefficient modules and no real incentive to use any of the vehicles more than once except for the PRAWN, which is in the first game anyway. You get basically every tool within the first half hour, something that the original made you actually work up to over time. The game holds your hand from the start, sneaking inner monologue in everywhere, like ""hmm, I should make this tool to go do this thing."" All the characters are like that to some degree; only there to advance the progression and send you on that next mission. 
The lore, save a few parts, is almost entirely filler, designed to be plopped on some random platform with some boxes and forgotten. Where the first game had real drama and struggles in the characters, this feels more like the story was written solo, then the cast were added on top so there were actual people involved and not just ruins and random truck stops. Even the main objective of finding what happened to your sister is immediately forgotten, and replaced by a precursor AI that wants a body, so he sends you on some fetch quests with no exploration involved since you're just following a beacon. (No spoilers, this happens quite literally 10 minutes in.) All the objectives you're given either have what you need there near the finish line, or it tells you to go grab this thing and come back.

If I go on any longer I'll just end up repeating myself, so I'll end it with some notes.
This game isn't the worst I've played, and I'm certain I could get some enjoyment if I wasn't so hurt about it falling short of the original. If you have the money and you're debating between the two, the original Subnautica is the obvious choice. If you've already played the first and you're just itching for more, I advise waiting some time before jumping to this one. If you go straight from one to the next, you'll both burn yourself out and you won't be able to see past the differences, but given some rest time in between and this game has [i]potential[/i] to drag you in just like the first.",1692524485,1692524485,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed playing Subnautica again.

My favorite part in this was learning the story of one character ([spoiler]Marguerit Maida [/spoiler]) that appears in both games. 

The seatruck is a nice vehicle and the sea truck dock is such a great addition ! (but I missed my speedy seamoth)

I liked the new fauna and flora particularly the interactions with the sea monkeys even if it became a bit annoying when base building close to many of them but they can be useful. [spoiler]Try pinning a recipe, they might bring you exactly what you need[/spoiler]

It seems like the weather turns into a snow storm as soon as you spend more than a minute on the surface.

For some reason I didn't feel like building as much as I did in the main title game but I also didn't feel as compelled to progress the story in the first game. 

I think the story felt more organic in the first one, like you stumbled upon it while exploring aimlessly or resource gathering. In Below Zero there is more hand holding with the game guiding you to places of importance frequently.

Sadly I did not enjoy the ending that much. [spoiler]It is weird that you can finish the game without curing the disease[/spoiler]

Progression is too quick which loses that feeling of stacking accomplishments from the first game. Resources are too plentiful and energy management is too simple that many base elements like nuclear energy are just unnecessary. My other complaint is a severe issue with lighting transitions that don't make sense. You look down at a scary abyss only to drop 10m and find a cave awash with golden light. I mean, I'll take an eerily beautiful cave over a black abyss any day I'm just saying. Finally, the world is too small and too shallow that the new vehicle while cool is less practical compared to the prawn suit. It's overkill to drag a slow base of sorts around with you when it literally takes no more than a few minutes to travel home from anywhere. There is more than one way to use the new vehicle though so I did take advantage of it when it was useful.

But the game gets a lot right. It's stunningly beautiful. Hard to tell if it's more or less scary because I'm so hardened by the first game that I was systematically exterminating leviathans, but I was certainly creeped out an awful lot. I'm still so terrified by the ecological dead zone that I had to quit the game when a leviathan dragged me out there. The bottom line is this game does recapture a lot of the magic of the first game, and I would recommend it for all fans.",1692227179,1692227179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a great game, but some features feel missing after the first one and some new one are nice.

+ :
The story is great and the ending surprising.
The technology is the same and different. If you have played the first game, you will still discovered some new technologies.
The overall environment/scenery is visually great, colourful and well made.
The character's story and interaction with its environment is nice.
The new fauna/flora.
The 'above water' section.

- :
These negatives points are here because the first game exists BUT they don't make the game bad at all.

The main one that often come back is the size of everything. The map, the depth, the vehicles, the story. And it's true. 
The map is not so huge and not as deep as the first one but the depth is compensated with a new gameplay mechanic : land exploration which is ""strange/ironic"" for a ""SUBnautica"" but this part isn't a bad point for me.
Land movement feels slow and janky.
The vehicles size are made for the map and they are, in consequences, smaller, slower and a bit strange by their behaviour. The mech isn't useful because of such terrain configuration.
Some technologies are missing.
Not as terrifying. The bad fish aren't that big and scary.

It's a great game.
Play it for what it is, not for it being the little brother of the great Subnautica.

The game itself wasn't that bad, they just couldn't capture why people loved the first one. The game lacked the size of the original. The original felt immense when you first land and jump into the water and just keeps getting bigger as you travel deeper and deeper, this one felt....small....The map is about half the size and half as deep. Sure its very ""condensed"" but that's not exactly a good thing, as it just feels cluttered.

The seatruck is the stupidest vehicle, I understand why they wanted something like that, due to the map being smaller and there being mazes everywhere and small holes you want a smaller vehicle that's able to get into those areas....but they could have kept the seatruck and just provided empty modules of different lengths that let people customise what they wanted. Instead they had pre-defined modules and you can only determine order and they all kinda sucked and if you didn't want to play that way well...sucks to be you....Also the storage module, why are there about half the slots in something that's larger compared to the wall storage in my base.

The snowfox....ok I stand corrected on my comment above...this is the stupidest vehicle...Drives like crap...runs into a mine-able rock on the ground (how is that even possible its a hover vehicle) ok whatever, why does the rock do about 30% damage!? and doesn't even break open! Anyways had to build 3 of those just to finish the above ground area cuz every time I put it away and took it out again it fell through the world....

Also speaking of the above ground area....wow that place is annoying...90% of the time u get the severe storm warning. Always having to deal with the cold till u get cold suit which u'll use for about an hr and never touch again as any above surface area u'll never revisit. The spy pengling drives like crap, slow as hell and can't turn....its got tank treads and drive pretty quickly forward....why can't it turn on a dime faster than my 90 year old grandma trying to do the same turn on her cane.... Also WTF is with the camera feed....I get a clearer picture from a doorbell camera on my phone and the spy pengling uses a camera how many years in the future... Also only really need to use it for literally 30 secs to get 1 item in the whole game...useless....

Conclusion...would I recommend it...sure if you've played the first one and really like it and wanted a little more, but be prepared to be disappointed. If not then go play the first one, even with it's bugs I found it to be way more enjoyable.",1692009302,1692009419,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay, that's not what the game is called.  And okay, I started a sentence with okay, because all the dialog in this game has that sort of mediocre middle-Q English.  Sensa Wunda?  Sure, another exploration of biomes, a la the original Subnautica - and will there be anyone who plays Below Zero who didn't play the original?  I doubt it, and that's too bad, because they'll be disappointed.  The main character, a lady so dull I've forgotten her name, travels a long way to find her sister, and one of the first things that happens to her is a superior alien intelligence injects itself into her brain as a passenger.  The game's subdued sense of marvel at the wonders of an alien biome are drowned by this chick's - Robin, Google says her name is - Robin's tasteless insistence on proving her, and humanity's superiority to this dignified alien mind.  And when she finds out her sister has died, and the alien gently probes her grief, she starts talking about gooey caramel clusters.  She is, not to put too fine a point on it, an idiot; I've rarely hated the protagonist of a game so much.  And I've not even started on the asthmatic wheeze she makes when she runs, or the ridiculousness of half a game called ""Subnautica"" being set on land.  Perhaps ""Nautica:  Running in Swimfins"" would have been a better title.

The original game was good, verging on great in some places.  This sequel is what happens when you hand over a more-or-less finished game engine to a bunch of r/im14andthisisdeep modders.

Kinda makes me think they combined Subnautica with Soma the way they set up the map and logs. 3 different stories that all are less interesting than the first game's. Though, speaking of the first game, (Spoilers: a survivor from the first game made it to the map of the second, and their story is honestly the most interesting.) Best thing about this game is the base improvements but some dumbie decided not to give the seatruck dock any support so it looks super silly. This can be fixed by putting multi-purpose rooms under the dock. The map and game feel very short or fast to get through, and I don't know why. I made a base larger than I needed in the first game, but I didn't even need to use 4 lockers. In the first installment I used probably 20. To compensate, they made the seatruck so slow, and the prawn doesn't work well with the terrain imo. This makes the game painful when travelling. I don't even think it's the issue that I'm skilled or anything, because they switched up resources and I took more time to finish Subnautica 1 even on my 4th play. If they added some fun things that were mods in Subnautica like a resource changer for crafting or idk, maybe they could have gave this game some replayability. Not really disappointed, but wouldn't recommend to a friend. Despite my comment about the prawn earlier, it was indeed vastly improved - especially on land. Though the land at times was just pathetic, with invisible walls and whatnot. They don't want you to leave the map, I get it, but why surround some of the bases with invisible wall? If I get a prawn and climb up the wall of one of these areas and when I try to jump down I can't because dev doesn't want me to, the game loses alot of luster. If this happens to you, don't give up though, there are little holes in these invisible walls.",1691869928,1691870168,False,5,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Yes, It's a step down from the original Subnautica, but it's not in the visuals or game play.  Rather, they added too much in world-building and back story, and I say this as a writer.  Too much writing!  Some of the new biomes are amazing.  The twisty bridges, although a pain sometimes to navigate in the seatruck, are visually amazing.  I would rather an open-ended game instead of the storyline that you must follow in S:BZ (you'll see).  I hope with Subnautica 3 they find their holy grail, an open-ended game that can be played over and over, with room for much DLC.

The first Subnautica is a masterpiece in the survival horror scene, but that doesn't matter here. What we get with below zero is further exploration into the lore of the world, alterra and all the others who were unfortunate enough to crash on 4546B. Trading flat out horror with mystery and intrigue, this isn't something that holds the game back it enhances the experience and adds something different to the first game. Again i am not saying this game is better than the first because in my opinion it most certainly isn't, but does that mean not play this? Hell no get on here and enjoy it for what it is i promise you wont be disappointed as much as you think you will.

You will not mistake it for a SubNautica 2.   There are some tweaks and it did seem like it progressed faster, but I did turn off Eating/Drinking, which seriously slowed me down in the original until I used the cheat code (way too late).    In this one, after playing for hours and hours, I never found the builder tool, which I knew I should've found a long time ago.   I finally gave up and looked up that it was in Delta base, which I'd searched many times looking for that stupid tool.   Finally, I watched a Youtube video.  I walked by that tool probably 20 times and never saw it because it didn't really look like anything.   Ugh.  Probably for the best since I could start my remote base near the mid/late game hotspots.

PS: Hey UnknownWorlds, the popup ""tool-tips"" for the recipes is extremely annoying when it's blocking a bunch of the other items in the list.   Put it on the side or something out of the way.

The seatruck seems to be a strange attempt to combine to the seamoth and cyclops from the first game but just feels very clunky in practice, which is pretty annoying when it's your only real sea vehicle. Blueprints for critical items for it (i.e. power cell charger and moon pool) are fairly late game which is kind of annoying in terms of having to make a ton of power cells just to keep your vehicles running. I ended up with a locker full of dead power cells before having the chance to charge them, which is not really an issue I ran into in the first game.

The land portions feel very sloppy. The game was built to be underwater, and you can feel it every time you step onto land. I don't have a problem with the cold mechanic to prevent you from just camping on land all day, but movement feels just as clunky as the sparse land sections from the first game.

The story is... bad. The inclusion of AL-AN and the mech lady creates a serious atmospheric downgrade from the first game. Whereas in the first game the lack of information made sense because you were well and truly alone, in Below Zero it just feels like characters are intentionally ignoring you or withholding information. The dialogue is also grating, though it is relatively rare.

Overall not the worst game out there, but another sad case of failing to understand what made the first game so good. I worry that a third game would fall into many of the same issues this one did.

The World:
The world of the original Subnautica was vast, with a large number of unique biomes.  Below Zero’s world is smaller and feels less diverse.  I found the above-ground portions to be more annoying than fun.  I didn’t boot up Subnautica to run around in a frozen wasteland while freezing my ass off.  It’s a sea-based game where the land portions are best left as a fun change of pace, as in the original game.  The constant fear of exploring deeper is also not present.  The player of Below Zero quickly realizes that much of the world is simply not that dangerous, and most of the creatures present are not that much of a threat.  

The Vehicles:
The Prawn Suit is still here and still awesome.  The other vehicles from the original not so much.  The Cyclops and Seamoth have been replaced by the SeaTruck, which is kind of a combination of both depending on how you outfit it.  The problem is, it doesn’t perform the function of either the Cyclops or the Seamoth as well as the original did.  The SeaTruck is more prone to getting stuck on things exploring caves than the Seamoth, for example.  The way the SeaTruck interacts with the world, especially certain plants it can’t get around, was a recurring source of frustration.  It’s also too tanky.  I recall the first time it was grabbed by a leviathan, shaken around and released.  I looked at the damage it had taken afterwards.  ‘That’s it?’  Everyone remembers what it was like to be grabbed in the Seamoth by a Reaper Leviathan.  Exactly no one ever thought ‘that’s it?’ after that experience.  Which is how it should be when your little personal submarine gets grabbed by a massive predator.  Huge letdown.  

The new vehicle Below Zero introduces, the SnowFox, is a major disappointment.  It is a bit wonky to steer, but the real issue is that it is not the best option for traversing the arctic biome.  Those four-legged creatures from the trailer will chase you and cause you problems on the SnowFox, but if you just take the Prawn Suit on land, you can walk right up to them and murder them with impunity (which is quite satisfying).  The Snowfox isn't even worth the resources it takes to construct it.  

The Dialogue:
This is my biggest gripe with Below Zero.  Frankly, there is far too much talking.  In the original, the main character doesn’t say a single word.  I often wished the main character of Below Zero would take a page out of that book and shut the hell up.  Some of her conversations with the game's other main protagonist were okay, but that’s about it.  The various PDA logs are also a huge disappointment.  Most of the PDAs from the original game were relevant to the story and/or interesting to listen to.  The DeGassi logs in particular were a joy to discover, telling a tragic and fascinating story of a mismatched group of survivors trying to survive and learn the secrets of the world.  There is nothing comparable in Below Zero.  Most of the PDA logs concern inane topics such as the personal relationships of characters we’ll never meet, ‘strong female leaders’ whining about their employers and/or subordinates, or silly games the Alterra employees played with each other.  Worse still, they tend to ramble on, whereas the PDAs from the original game tended to be short and to the point.  Ultimately, I can’t help but feel that Below Zero’s PDAs are the way they are because the developers wanted to be able to say, ‘look, we have women in STEM and LGBTQ representation.  Aren’t we progressive?’  Yes, you are.  Unfortunately, you prioritized 'representation' over quality (which seems to be a recurring trend in media these days).  It is possible to do both, but if you can only do one, make sure it's quality!!!

The Ending:
The ending of the original Subnautica left you feeling immensely satisfied, like you accomplished something amazing.  The ending of Below Zero feels cheap and hollow by comparison.  Part of the problem is the ending sequence is filled with so much dialogue, which I found annoying.  Robin takes this snippy, entitled attitude with the other main character that rubs me the wrong way.  It’s awful.  

Overall, I was prepared to say that Below Zero wasn’t a bad game until the ending.  Now?  Screw it.  It is a bad game.  I’ll probably play again, but only because I’m a completionist (I played the first time on Freedom mode and feel compelled to play on Survival).  But after that I’ll never touch it again, and I will also be skipping significant portions of the game the second time.  I didn’t skip hardly anything during my second playthrough of the original game because I didn’t want to, and I fully expect to return for a third playthrough someday.  And that is perhaps the biggest difference between the two games for me.",1691208390,1691208390,False,204,6,0.790900230407714844,0,True,False,False

Like a mod to subnautica.
Wonderful world and pretty scenery, similar gameplay to subnautica. But I can't get over the fact that Alterra had no design changes in their bases or devices over a period of time. I found the story vague and lacking in any captivating power. Not because there was lack of a motivation; you literally crashed on a planet to find your sister. But more so because I didn't feel like that exact part of the story was well-rounded..
This game has an overlap of two main quests and I felt both of them fell short of telling a good individual story as well as them not being a satisfying story when combined.

It trades some of the original game's feeling of being completely lost on an alien planet and trying to survive, with a simple but well written mystery. A lot of love has definitely gone into this game, but I agree with what other reviews say about it feeling like a DLC. 

Pros: 
-I think the biomes are a lot more well thought out, and feel more ""full"" compared to the original. However some people may see this as a negative, as the emptiness in the original adds to the feeling of being lost.
-Cool new tools and habitat pieces.
-Cool and beautiful new creatures and biomes.
-Land biomes and a new survival mechanic adds variety
-Story is good, but cliche.

Cons: 
-Instead of figuring things out organically like in the original, this one does give you a lot more hints and markers to guide your exploration. So instead of searching out of curiosity you find yourself just going to a certain biome only because a marker has popped up in/near it.
-The seatruck is both shit and interesting. Overall it feels like a seamoth that drags a small habitat around. Cool in concept but compared to the awesome Cyclops it just kinda sucks. However I understand why it replaces the cyclops in this (see below).
-Smaller map. This is the main reason the Cyclops is replaced. The biomes are more cramped and so trying to navigate with a big sub would be impractical.
-Similar annoying glitches to the original. One all too familiar glitch for those that have played the first, was that on the rare occasion items/vehicles just phase out of the playable map and you couldn't get them back. This can also happen to creatures, leading to them either being launched out of the map, or ending up in places they arent supposed to be e.g. inside a habitat.

I would give this a solid 7/10. Buy this when on sale. If you enjoyed the first you'll have a good time playing this as well,",1691061522,1691061522,True,11,0,0.650159001350402832,0,True,False,False

-Story is nonsensical and reads like a bad fan-fiction short story, particularly the ending.
-New/Updated vehicles feel like downgrades in every way compared to the original.  Snowfox is pointless.
-Progression feels like it just doesn't exist but at least the game world feels so small that it doesn't really matter.
-Ocean area feels way smaller and far less ominous and land segments all feel and look the same, boring.
-Difficulty is significantly reduced and the experience feels far more game-y with the addition of conveniently placed oxygen/thermal plants virtually everywhere the player is expected to explore.
-Feeling of isolation, which I would consider to be a core pillar of the original, is completely gone from the experience.
-""The base building is better in Below Zero"" they say ... Um no, it's not.  The only noteworthy addition to building in Below Zero is a bunch of posters, some beds with different blankets and the control room.  Also noteworthy is that the developers decided to remove a bunch of cosmetic items available in the original such as the lab equipment like microscopes and vials.  These cosmetic items are still used as assets all over the game world of Below Zero.  You just can't scan or pickup or use them.

It wasn't an awful game.  It was kinda cool to explore even though it became clear pretty quickly that there weren't all that many places to go.  Unfortunately, as a player who just recently played Subnautica for the first time and loved it, Below Zero was an experience plagued by disappointment from beginning to absurdly bad end.",1691015022,1691015022,False,1,0,0.510204076766967773,0,True,False,False

If you just finished the first game and just NEED MORE SUBNAUTICA this is not it, just replay the first or figure out how to roll it back so you can play it again with mods (mods killed by 2.0, rip to the true GOATs).

It's a significant downgrade, the story is only fair (6/10 in comparison to first game's 10/10) in spite of the fact that this time they actually have actors. Way buggier than the original, in this playthrough I had two game-breaking can't-escape must-reload-and-lose-two-hour moments, in addition to the expected regular ""unstuck"" usage. The map sucks, overland segments are too big, underwater biomes are no diversified, and you know how you hated having to spelunk through the kelp forest caves in the first game, and was so happy when that hour was over and you had all those bps and materials? Get ready for tight, lost spelunking in hazy green environments through tiny, cramped honeycomb. The biomes and map in the original game gradually become one another in understandable ways tied to the ""ecology"" of 4546b in the first game. In the second you will simply feel lost for hours, you'll fall through a crack and be in a completely different biome with no visible way back. I feel like the mapmaker for the original game wanted to show me an alien world, and unique horizons on that world never seen by humanity before. In the second I feel like the mapmaker wanted to really take some time off and focus on they're newfound spelunking habit, wriggle through some rocks like a worm. New creatures are boring, and I don't understand why they didn't just unify the crafting trees, since they unified the blueprints.

Also I didn't mind the munching and crunching sounds of the first game, adding much more mouth-noise and a person moaning over half the eating was super uncomfortable. It's generous or you got lost a buuunch like me if this game gives you more than 20 hours. I won't buy part 3 if one eventually exists, until I've seen that it returns to the original form.

The biggest downgrade, imo, is that the Sports Car (Seamoth) and Luxury Sub (Cyclops) have been replaced with the Seatruck (a gd 18 wheeler). It has less storage than both vehicles, and the only way to make it useful is to craft separate modules that have to be attached to your truck, making it impossible to navigate the endemic tunnels in the map. The prawn suit does make it through, but it's had the jump pack forced into it, so if you (like me) enjoyed playing with the physics in the first game to make the prawn fly everywhere be assured, the fun has been patched out! Now the limitations of the prawn suit from the first game make some segments impossible (also, don't go deep diving until you have the jump jets or you're leaving that prawn in the depths, there are spots it cannot jump out without them). 

It's like some dev on the team had the exec's balls in a vice and got to make all the design decisions.

The story is also much better with the introduction of more characters and a pretty good protagonist. So why is it not as good as the first game? 3 reasons:
1 - Land. The land area in this game is very boring and a major part of the game. It is very obnoxious to travel and explore.
2 - It's a much easier game and less scary. You barely ever feel threatened in this game while exploring. The leviathans are mostly a disappointment and there are way fewer and less interesting enemies to deal with.
3 - Hand holding. The first game felt like dark souls/elden ring. It was very mysterious: you had to find things for yourself, there was more and better areas to explore and it was exciting finding all the new places.

Ignore my steam profile, I've played through the game on console already (plus watched a few playthroughs). It's just missing the magic that the first game had. Don't get me wrong, it's an okay game, but it's nowhere near as good as the original Subnautica.

Nowhere near as scary, the iconic PDA voice got changed and the protagonist is now spouting out obnoxious one-liners. Some resources are also really annoying to farm in this game since they removed certain big outcrops, which makes base building way more tedious.

The most annoying change for me was the Seamoth being replaced with a way worse and ugly vehicle, that almost reminds of a Seamoth/Cyclops merge. Now I get the Cyclops was removed, due to the map being way more shallow and narrow (which makes it less scary), but they could've at least kept the Seamoth.

All in all, Subnautica: Below Zero isn't quite a steaming pile of garbage, but it isn't great either. It has some cool aspects to it here and there, and the first bit of playing was fun since it was all new.

The beginning is dramatic and throws you right in immediately giving you a direction.

In terms of story, it has mystery that makes you curious to find out more, even risking life and limb to achieve that. The dangers you encounter definitely get progressively more scary, you might get Thalassophobia if you don’t have it already. The exploration possibilities are good, but lacks compared to Subnautica. You will spend more time exploring depth then horizontal exploration. However, the end is much more climactic than the Subnautica. Game time is average: about 32 hours if you put your mind to it.

Why is the spiral plant so small and nondescript? i could have finished this game 5 hours earlier if this critically important plant wasn't so drastically different from every other important resource, you did a great job making other resources either too big to miss, stand out because of the color contrast, the texture contrast, or making it literally glow, this makes it so darn counter intuitive to find the spiral plant, i went past it SEVERAL times without realizing it was a resource, in the end i had to watch a youtube video to understand where i could get the clippings.",1690788952,1690789717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even though the map is smaller, still feels like there's a lot of places to explore and things to do. Although keep in mind that after you beat the game there's not much replay value, so I recommend buying on a sale.

More detailed review below:

[b] Visuals [/b]: The game got a big graphics improvement since Subnautica. It just looks so gorgeous! My only complain is that some biomes are too dark and can't see almost nothing even with the light from the vehicles.

[b] Story [/b]: Not going to spoil here. But it's nice that they made some connections with the story of the first game. But is it necessary to play the first Subnautica to understand the story of Below Zero? Not really. Aside from some references, the story has pretty much no attachment to the story of the first Subnautica.

[b] Gameplay fun factor [/b]: 10/10 At the time of this review I had played 32 hours and still did not run out of things to do or to explore. So definitely recommend this game!

My only big con about Below Zero:

""Dangerous weather approaching seek shelter!"" - PDA 
The frequency of the ""dangerous weather"" while on the surface feels like is 24/7!
This weather ""events"" are so annoying in the early game, and it does not get any less annoying in the late game. 

The main difference in Below Zero is that it allows you explore the surface, and the addition of a ""temperature meter"". This temperature meter goes down when you are out of water so you eventually freeze to death. But the draining of this meter is so fast during the ""dangerous weather"" that can completely kill the joy of exploring the surface.",1690722508,1690722508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As for the snowfox and all the stuff you have to do on land, it's not as fun as I hoped. It felt kinda clunky.

The Good:
- More resources, lots more. I no longer found myself scrounging for copper every ten minutes, it's everywhere. Lead, lithium, everything is all over the place. There's even a handheld scanner to help find things.

- The sea truck is a nice upgrade over the sea moth, giving it more features in a still small package.

- Penguins.


The Bad:
- No more Cyclops! While the sea truck is nice,  it just doesn't feel the same as having a huge mobile base that you can build in to suit your needs. It would have been great to have the sea moth replaced while still having access to the clops.

- Very twisty, cavernous terrain. It's far easier to get lost in this game compared to its predecessor. Take advantage of the seaglide's map and beacons. I suppose this is why they removed the sub, too big to bang around the caves.

- Map is smaller than the first game. The world lost some of the awe and mystery by being so condensed, there's less curiosity about what you'll find as you dive deeper and deeper into the sea, and the creatures/biomes down there don't get quite as weird as they used to.

Personally i felt this second instalment was generally easier and less unnerving than some of the scary moments in the first one.
This game was an opportunity to have some new oceanic features like frozen brine fingers which were cool to see and introduce some new creatures even if they cant measure up to the sea dragon. 
The new vehicle had a decent concept, the sea truck is a customisable modular unit but comparatively i missed items like the Sea-moth and Cyclops.
Story wise had some good moments like finding the other (badass) survivor, and your hitchhiker pal is likeable but again they somehow fall just a leg behind the elements in the first game.

I will say the ending and cinematics for this game were really cool. It was nice to have an explanation and closure to the technologies found in the first game.

This game is very very cool and i love the series, just that its filled with problems and glitches.

I think that the reason that I enjoyed this game so much is because it's the first Subnautica game that I played which means that I didn't have anything to compare it to. Because of that, I enjoyed this game a lot and if you haven't played Subnautica and you plan to play both, play Below Zero first. Oh, one more thing, don't spoil yourself about anything when it comes to these two amazing games.

The main differences about Subnautica and Below Zero are that the leviathans aren't as scary and they're mostly annoying, you know exactly what I mean if you've played this game. The other main issue is the map size, this game doesn't go nearly as deep as Subnautica did, in Subnautica you went 1400 meters down whils't in Below Zero, you go down to 1000 meters. That's not even the main issue, all areas feel small, hence why you don't get the Cyclops in this game, it wouldn't fit in more than half of the biomes. Speaking of biomes, almost all of the biomes feel similar to eachother, you could put someone with 200 hours in this game in an area and there's a large chance that they wouldn't know where they were. Especially since most of the biomes are just differently colored caves except for some biomes that are just giant wastelands and the map is still tiny in comparison to Subnautica.

The giant land biomes are also big wastelands that have nothing in them, the vehicle (the Snowfox) that you get is also kinda shit, the Prawn Suit is better on land than the Snowfox, I've literally never used the Snowfox in my four playthroughs, that's how utterly useless it is (I've seen it on Youtube).

One more thing that I feel like I can complain about is the fact that you aren't alone this time around, Subnautica made the atmosphere of being completely alone in a wide ocean very apparent from the start. This game however feels the need to add two characters that actively talk to you. Great job Unknown Worlds!

So... I know that I've been complaining a lot in this review but the thing is, this game is still awesome, all of the new things they added make this game so fun, for example, all the new building things, posters, music, more customization and things like that. I especially love that they added fan music.

Just a reminder, this game isn't bad in the slightest, it's just that Sunbautica is so good that it feels unfair comparing the two. I'm gonna end this review like I did with the Subnautica review a.k.a a simple version:

Difficulty: 1/10
Subnautica had a few oxygen issues but here in Below Zero, you have oxygen plants which make it super easy, barely an inconvenience to breath IN THE UNDERWATER SURVIVAL GAME.

Grind: 6/10
I don't know why but Below Zero felt way less grindy than Subnautica.

Story/Worldbuilding: 8/10
The story just feels empty in some parts, good overall but, it's just not as good as Subnautica's story and/or worldbuilding.

Graphics: 9.5/10
This game's visuals are absolutely stunning if I'm gonna be completely honest.

Scary: 3/10
I already mentioned this I feel like.

Overall: Worse than Subnautica.",1622481830,1690580009,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

The 2 biggest downside for me are as follows:

The size of the map - it is much smaller. in a game about getting trapped in a vast alien world the vastness in majorly toned down.

the sea truck - while in theory it is cool, its modules and ability to shed them allows it to play the role of both a cyclops and a seamoth. but in practice it feels worse then those in both of the roles. It is much slower then the seamoth, presumably to hide the smaller map, and the modules feel less customizable then the cyclops, which enabled you to build inside of it. It was a necessary change to the seatruck due to how cramped the maps caves are but they could have just made the caves less cramped.

There are also some smaller gripes that I really cannot pass off as objective, like i do not care for the story of this one as much as the original, I find The original MC to be far more relatable due to him not stranding himself on an alien planet by choice and I also prefer the originals OST, this one is still good but I think nostalgia might be at play, but I cannot help what I feel. I also found the original PDA to be better written and funnier, I do not think I laughed at a single of this PDA's jokes. But these things are relatively minor and do not detract from the experience of exploring the alien world.


OVerall S:BZ is a good game, But I feel like it would have been better if it was a DLC for the original, and I do recommend it if you were desperate for more subnautica, but if you are new to the series I recommend playing the original first and only getting this one if you want more. While my review doesn't seem very positive for a reccomend I want to note that the only reason I have so many bad things to say about this one is because the original is just so good.

Developed and published by Unknown Worlds Entertainment, Below Zero takes players on a thrilling journey to an alien, frozen underwater world.

The game's storyline revolves around a researcher named Robin, who sets out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister on Planet 4546B. Unlike the lush tropical environment of the original Subnautica, Below Zero introduces us to an icy, harsh landscape filled with unique biomes and treacherous creatures. The attention to detail in the game world is outstanding, with stunning visuals and realistic water effects that enhance the sense of depth and immersion.

One of the standout features of Below Zero is the seamless integration of exploration and survival mechanics. Players must manage their oxygen levels, hunger, thirst, and body temperature while delving into the unknown. Crafting and building play a crucial role as players gather resources to create tools, vehicles, and shelters to survive the harsh environment. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenging gameplay and rewarding progression, keeping players engaged for hours on end.

The diverse marine life in Below Zero is both fascinating and terrifying. From adorable penguins to colossal leviathans, encounters with the various creatures evoke a sense of wonder and fear. The game cleverly uses sound design and atmospheric cues to heighten tension during encounters, making exploration an exhilarating experience.

The storyline unfolds through well-crafted audio logs and in-game dialogue, further immersing players into the protagonist's journey. As players uncover the truth behind the planet's secrets, they'll find themselves emotionally invested in Robin's quest for answers.

--CONS HIGHLIGHTS--
However, Below Zero is not without its minor flaws. Some players might find the pacing a bit slow at times, and occasional technical hiccups can briefly disrupt immersion. Such example would consist of the times where you find yourself without a specific material and be needed to explore different biomes in order to find what you require. Sometimes it may become repetitive, but it will make the player better consider what they need to craft an item. Moreover, some movement bugs should be taken into consideration by the developers, for example, entering a cave or a room can often be accompanied by an inadequate collider that slows down player's pace, as well as going up a stair case. Yet, the developers have consistently provided updates to address these issues, showcasing their dedication to the community.

--CONCLUSION--
In conclusion, Subnautica: Below Zero is a remarkable sequel that successfully expands upon the strengths of the original game. With its enthralling storyline, stunning visuals, and engaging gameplay mechanics, Below Zero offers an unforgettable underwater adventure that will keep players hooked from start to finish. Whether you're a fan of survival games, exploration, or simply seeking an immersive narrative-driven experience, Subnautica: Below Zero is a must-play.",1690479380,1690479380,True,1,0,0.513468027114868164,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- I LOVE the custuomizable modular nature of the new vehicle
- The land aspects are new and interesting
- The story takes a different approach and introduces a lot of new insights into the game's lore while tackling different themes that give it a different mood than the first game. I'm interested in learning more about this universe and how human society functions. Spoilers aside, this story does some New Stuff
- As others have pointed out the map is much smaller, but I think that's a plus because it's more navigable. I spend more time exploring and less time holding W in a submarine. Embarking on adventures is less stressful because I don't have to worry as much about overpacking or forgetting something because the travel times aren't huge

Cons:
- A lot of the wildlife feels too familiar. In a way the map can seem more like a DLC than a game of its own
- Game's progression feels rugged. It was fast and almost overwhelming at first with the amount of signals I had to go to explore--then that transitioned rather quickly to having very few new things to explore and feeling very limited
- Map exploration is less linear. I feel like the first game had a great setup where you progressively went deeper and deeper and could predict where endgame was taking you; you could see the next progression areas ahead of you and had to work towards it. This game feels like it throws you in random places and I'm going back and forth rather than linearly moving deeper. Progression is often found in random caves scattered across the map that you can coincidentally come across sooner. Many biomes are visited once and never again, leading to many recipes being missed because I never return to the area their fragments are found. I unlocked the Prawn Suite Depth upgrade before the Prawn Suite
- I feel like there was less attention to detail. For example, bullseye shrooms exist, can be farmed and the PDA says they're used in crafting, but afaik no recipe uses them and they're useless. They're just a remnant of the first game. There's a land plant whose PDA analysis says it can be harvested for food but it can't. The alien structures are small, scattered and less awe-inspiring.

All in all this game has a really great concept and setup but then I feel like it lost steam partway through development. I wouldn't be surprised if this was due to covid or other developmental issues. Nonetheless it's a unique experience with a great synopsis and I think it's more than worth the price for Subnautica fans",1689637608,1690423794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately it adds more bad than good. Part of what made Subnautica so special was the immersive experience of trying to survive an alien world. The player is driven by curiosity to progress the tech tree and uncover the story. In Below Zero your character is voiced, not silent, she is obnoxious, the dialogue is infantile.  Who thought it would improve the experience for the player character to have marvel style quips reacting to the world ""SO, THAT just happened."" ""Woah now this is... different!"" ""Umm, guys, you're gonna wanna see this"". The dialogue is cringe and there's too much of it. What happened to whoever wrote the lines for the PDA in the first game? The PDA used to be funny. In this game they give it a thick indian accent for some reason and the 2 jokes I heard it say were painfully unfunny.

Additionally the story itself is nonsensical and contradicts itself constantly, it simply makes no sense and it is really perplexing how such terrible dialogue and such a bad story shipped. In addition the land/snow portions of the game are boring, buggy and borderline unfinished. It's simply a huge missed opportunity and I cannot recommend it, instead I recommend playing the original Subnautica, and when you've beaten that, try the mods.

The underwater exploration is still great, but the huge portion of the game set above sea level is underwhelming and becomes tedious. This is due in part because the game is designed to be underwater and the above ground movement and feel is still clunky. The smooth, fluid control underwater instead feels like a poorly designed FPS when on land. 

Because of so much of the game being above sea level, there wasn't as much underwater, the best part of the game. The original Subnautica kept the land and ship exploration to relatively short, but important areas. Minimizing the game's weaknesses for dry land exploration. Making nearly half the game above the waves limited the game's core content, underwater exploration. Also, outside of a couple of areas, Below Zero didn't capture the wow factor of being in an incredibly deep, dangerous area. 

The vehicles also underwhelmed. The Seatruck, while being modular and utilitarian, was not exciting. If my job was to perform tasks underwater, I'd want a Seatruck. But it was far from fun to operate, and when at its largest size, clunky and slow. The impressive size and looks of the Cyclops or the speed and agility of the Seamoth is just not there. I ended up using the Seaglide most of the time, using the truck as an oxygen and storage stop. 

I hope the Subnautica returns to its underwater roots and keeps the exploration the ocean depths the main focus.

This game was so mid it's baffling. There was so much detail polish love and care in subnautica and below zero has precisely none of that. And looking up how much was cut from it the studio must have just gotten bored and gave up but decided to charge the same price as the first game. I've never played a sequel that somehow took everything from the first game and just did less in the way this one does. It was originally going to be dlc and BOY does it feel like it.

Almost every biome feels unfinished. Literally the only new assets were the sea truck, a few new fish, and literally only two new base components. 

When I beat subnautica 1 I felt triumphant. I was elated and wished I could have more. In Below Zero, I felt absolutely nothing. I finished it more out of obligation to my addiction to sunk cost fallacies.

If the game had fleshed out more about the architects I might have liked the ending but what they were obviously going for felt totally unearned. I thought the ending was so cool on paper but was executed so poorly. 

The whole game is a buggy mess. The entire ending where I'm supposed to be in awe I was distracted by the leviathan that clipped into the facility and was swimming in mid air trying to get back out. 

I spent an hour walking around a suspiciously flat frozen wasteland wondering what I was gonna see before the game world ended because the devs never anticipated that I’d use the prawn suit as a land vehicle and ended up where I wasn’t supposed to go. And the reason I was USING the prawn suit was because the hover bike they made look so cool is an absolute piece of junk that handles like it uses the same mechanics as a submarine but they just removed the ability to maneuver on a y axis. And I had to make two of them because the first time I tried to deploy it, it clipped through the terrain and fell through the world and I had to hide its map marker so it wouldn’t clutter the screen (had to do the same thing after my first sea truck got hopelessly stuck and I had to abandon it).

Oh and get this… the bugs were so bad that I had to look up console commands to trigger story beats toward the end that somehow didn’t and I had to spoil the ending by looking up walkthroughs to figure out why it wouldn’t progress. This meant I also stopped getting achievements since I had to use console commands to even finish my playthrough.

This game might have worked as DLC as originally intended. As a new game they owed us a renewed reason to come back. This game was the same price as the first one but it’s far less. When you consider the smaller environment, the very very few new assets and features, and the amount of stuff they cut out that was in the first game like the cyclops and sea moth, this game absolutely fails to justify its own existence let alone charge the same price as the first game that did so much more. 90% of the effort went into a very narrow sliver of this game. 

I’m genuinely sad that I was so let down. And since they’re moving on to the “next game in the subnautica universe” there won’t be any more substantial updates. And if they go in the direction I think they’re going to with what’s teased at the end of this game, I am permanently checked out on this franchise and this developer. I have no reason or desire to play Subnautica Below Zero again. 

Like the Star Wars prequels, the saddest thing about this is that it can never be undone. It will always exist to sully how good the original was by being adjacent to it.",1549223978,1690178857,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,True

Finding land to walk on was rare, easy, and had very important story driving aspects to them. The deeper you go in the water the bigger, scarier, and more dangerous the creatures are. The ending made me want to cry.

Below Zero took almost all of the depth out of the game, made the cave systems unnecessarily complex that all loop into themselves with little to no rewards for exploring, and land exploration is long and boring with too much fluff. Even getting onto the icebergs to explore is a pain. Even though they added a ton of creatures in this game, they only added one Leviathan because everything is too shallow to add more daunting mobs. The ending made me relieved that I finally finished Below Zero.

[b]Pros:[/b]
In short, it's more Subnautica goodness in terms of gameplay.  If you enjoyed the first game, you'll likely enjoy this one.  I particularly appreciate the ""Freedom"" game mode, where food & water requirements are removed - I've always found those annoying in games, so it's nice to be able to focus on other survival & exploration aspects!

Some people seem to hate the Seatruck, but I like that you can customize it for various roles.  And you have a ""quick disconnect"" option to drop the additional pods if you need speed & maneuverability.  Once you get the upgrades, I found the speed was suitable enough for the size of the map.

[b]Neutral:[/b]
The map is definitely smaller, though I didn't have a problem with that.

A lot of the creatures seem less ""alien"" than the first game.  Looking through pictures of the creatures, you can probably guess which are fairly harmless and which are a threat.  And most of those threats are minimized if you're in a vehicle (especially with the [spoiler]Seatruck Perimeter Defense Upgrade, which makes even leviathans back up off you[/spoiler]).

[b]Cons:[/b]
The main character is annoying, and makes me miss the ""silent protagonist"" of the first game.  Her sister died, and she's determined to find out what ""really"" happened.  I got a kick out of the reverse-twist (it was surprisingly a non-surprise), but the whole ""corrupt dystopian corporation"" thing seems forced.  I'd prefer in future titles if Alterra was actually a decent company, just dealing with events (and personnel) as best they can.  I was actually more interested in the story of [spoiler]the Mercury II's crew and their attempts to escape in the past[/spoiler].

I did *not* like how much land portions the game had, especially with the obnoxious Ice Worm.  As far as I could tell, there was no way to dodge it (at least with no modules on the Snow Fox).  Continually getting knocked off my vehicle made me want to get that part done ASAP, rather than exploring.  Fortunately that's a very small portion of the game.  I appreciate the devs were trying something different, but I feel there needs to be more tweaking of gameplay on land (since this isn't the game's core mechanic).

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
I'd give Below Zero a ""B+"" rating.  It has some unique differences from the original without breaking the core gameplay that made the first game so compelling.  There are some annoying parts of the game, but not so much that I didn't want to finish.  I recommend picking it up on sale; the full retail price is a bit steep compared to what you get in its predecessor.",1690009830,1690009830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Below zero is not inherently a bad game but it is a very sub par follow up to its predecessor. 
My main gripe with it is frustrating biome design (all are a form of windy narrow caves and passages) and the very ""gamey"" feeling of it. 
One of the cool aspects of the original was the fact that equipment and game progression was tied to exploring the crashed ship. It made logical sense and therefore was very immersive. Sadly in Below Zero you end up finding random bits everywhere seemingly without any logic why this piece of equipment would have ended up there. There is distinct lack of danger from the wildlife as well and consequently the need to properly prepare and be cautious is gone. 
There are some great QoF improvements but with a smaller map, frustrating biome design, lack of challenge and really poor story line it is a very inadequate follow up.

First of all, if you LOVED Subnautica from start to finish you may like Below Zero (anything's possible right?). But if you were starting to get worn out by the end, or if it ever felt tedious, do yourself a favor and skip Below Zero! Seriously, this could ruin both games for you!

Everything that made Subnautica a slog just seems worse in Below Zero, and that despite obvious attempts to streamline this second chapter. If you love swimming around in disorientating caves searching for blueprints that may, or may not, have spawned so you can get the gear that you (think) you need to proceed in the game, then -look no further-! This is the game for you, you can waste countless hours wandering in circles while fretting over you o2, thirst and hunger levels! Yes, all the things that make your daily life a frustrating challenge without any of the reward (sorry, as much as it's reassuring to hear the player take that big gasp of air after nearly drowning, or crunch crunch crunch on some salted fish, I am not vicariously enjoying any of these experiences).

But that's not the best of it. The best is that Below Zero is buggy! Yup, get off your hoverbike and fall -through- the glacier into the ocean below. Did I mention that this is a very large glacier? Good luck swimming to the edge before you drown... dummy, why didn't you plan for that? Okay, you used the ""unstuck"" feature to survive that death trap... now you're in the middle of the glacial ice fields, and the only way you can survive is by using your hoverbike to stay warm. Now there are ice worms that knock you off your bike periodically, no problem, but whoops, meant to get back on your bike but you picked it up and put it in your inventory instead. No problem, I'll redeploy this vehicle and escape this frozen hellscape lickity split... except the hoverbike just clipped through the glacier to the ocean below... okay, how are you gunna survive that one dummy? To be fair, I didn't notice a lot of penalties to dying, actually got me back to my seatruck faster... maybe I missed a valuable game mechanic... just get the components I need, then die... voila! Like free teleportation. Gotta love it.

Another gripe, and I'll lose some of you here. But I think this game might be woke... No seriously, I read comments about the new player character being a BIPOC female, but that didn’t throw me, she’s completely normal throughout the game. But the new PDA voice has a thick Indian accent (google it, I’m not the only one scratching their head)? Okay, that's a little off putting (and difficult to understand sometimes), but the commentary is bizarre. “In the control room, you can change base lighting and colors, rename your base, and see information about power and structural integrity. But not the integrity of societal power structures.” Wait, what?! That one stuck with me, but there are some other strange “jokes.” Then there’s this alien database where they’re talking about their “replication,” because they can “copy themselves as many times as they want,” and “perpetuate themselves forever,” or something like that, but “that would be shameful, and any architect inclined to do that should just delete themselves.” Wait, what?!?! I’m taking it these guys aren’t pro-life…

Okay, obviously I didn’t like that game. Below is the review I wrote for Subnautica, if you’ve played Subnautica you’ll probably get an idea from it as to whether you will agree with me about Below Zero.

Okay, nevermind... My review is too long, Steam won't let me post it. You can probably find my review for Subnautica if you look for it. My guess is that no one will care enough to do so (my guess is very few people are still reading now, but if you are, thank you. You are very patient, you might actually like this game). I will try to clip the part about Below Zero from the other review and paste it here (please excuse the repeated story):

""It got way worse in Below Zero though. They added a bit more ""quest prompts"" and some other characters to interact with too, but the game is way buggier than the original subnautica. And now we have freezing to add to the survival mix (I turned hunger and thirst off, no way I was going to play through that again). So on one occasion I deploy my hoverbike (which keeps you warm) and whoops... it just fell through the earth. I don't have a hoverbike anymore... Please excuse me while I run around wildly and freeze to death. Or the blueprints for the quest item that don't appear Margeurite's desk after she tells you to pick them up. I didn't know anything was wrong until I spent 3 hours wandering the world trying to figure out what I missed. Then I googled it, found out this was a common bug, submitted a bug report, then went back to Margeurite's and... okay, they're on the table now? They weren't there before, and that's not the desk where she told me to pick them up... but cool... I guess? At least I finished the quest. 

Then I started searching for the leviathan cure. Spent a few hours wandering around the glacier with a map that looked like it was drawn by a child (in the future everyone is far less competent than they are today... I didn't know that was possible...) and finally I got so bored I just looked it up on youtube, Oh... I have to swim under the glacier... Well THAT wasn't on the map. After that I got fed up and looked the rest of the quests up on youtube. 20 hours was WAY TOO MUCH time to give that game.

What a waste. I wouldn't call this a game. But if you don't have a real life that needs attending to I suppose you can engage with a very frustrating ""alien planet survival simulator.""",1689913376,1689913376,False,2,1,0.498997241258621216,0,True,False,False

PROS:
Addictive survival-ish (far too easy to be termed 'survival') game play with excellent base building, finding the right place for your primary base is a joy. The environment and creatures this time are somewhat improved over an already very good approach in the first game.

Great voice acting, particularly with Alan and a decent approach to having other characters in game though it was a bit confusing (see below).

Graphics are OK for the game's purpose, but its a curious thing that pop in is so bad which breaks immersion.

CONS:
Being essentially an add-on to the first game I am very confused why this game went into early release. Bugs and issues still exist to this day going on being a decade old. Either this team does not care about quality or is unable to code their own game remains to be seen. The story is just nonsense, with Sam's demise remaining confusing and Robin being 100% OK with an lien who misled her and was largely to blame for the catastrophic events, her response was well I make mistakes too.

Most players of the first game complained the map was too small and yet this map is five times smaller, great listening from the developers here. The map this time uses even more maze like architecture to try and create a false sense of difficulty, miss one turn or cave entrance and you will be lost until you re-orientate. The player can construct a nuclear reactor, yet struggles with an O2 tank to last longer than some can hold their breath while also dying from starvation or thirst in twenty some odd minutes. Creating false difficulty is a sure sign of weak game mechanics.

The writing and 'science' behind the game world feel like they were written by a twelve year old and are  not passable by any standards. The addition of temperature being a prime example. Cold? jump in the frozen waters or use the heat plant that grows for no reason along your exact line of travel. Rudimentary writing and science are completely abandoned.

CONCLUSION:
The game just feels like the team was lazy, not listening to feedback and certainly not addressing something like 50 bugs/issues still present in game. I hope they actually try for the third attempt. If the third game goes to early release that will be a pass for me. As it is I got both games for a steal and would never pay full price for what is essentially an incomplete poorly designed and written game.

I am giving it a thumb's down as it receives far too much praise and we are stuck with Steam's binary rating, but I would give this game a 5 out of 10 mostly because of the team's laziness and lack of integrity in putting out a decent game based on an excellent framework of base building and resource gathering.

[spoiler]Subnautica: Below Zero (or, more accurately, Subnautica: Part II) is not, and will never be Subnautica, the original. But, I'd argue that was never really the point. Any attempts to copy the original would've resulted in a game I believe I would've enjoyed far less. Where Subnautica laid the foundations for an exceptional and stunning universe: a technocratic, corporatist dystopia unlike any other games, where corporations on the scales of whole governmental bodies exist, where the Human race is a space-faring species with the power of teleportation and nano-construction, but one that restrains their autonomy by the use of the corporate straitjacket, Below Zero expands it. To not expand upon this universe in Subnautica: Part II would've been a disservice.

The tales of Subnautica are, to me, a love letter to the indomitable Human spirit. The highs and lows of human perseverance, ingenuity, compassion, morality, sorrows, our hopes and dreams. To realize our ambitions of exploring the final frontier and the tragedies that inevitably follow. This game explores this dream universe turned into a nightmare, and the power behind our actions. Our power of curiosity. Of justice. Of individuality and of our freedom.

Consider my review of Subnautica: Below Zero to be incomplete. This review really depends on what happens in Part III. I and many others will be awaiting the release of this trilogy with the anticipation and curiousness that makes our whole species. I will be waiting for the return to this intriguing, complex, technological marvel of a world they have created, hungry for the next course.[/spoiler]

TLDR: No excuse for you not to get it. Stop looking at the reviews and play it. Expect not the same as Subnautica I, expect it instead like a spin-off. You're going to have a lot of fun.

Below zero, a squeal to possibly one of the best survival games, turns to be a flop.

The graphics in this game do show a lot of creativity (even surpassing the first games design) even looking beautiful making it a enjoyable experience if your new to the genre.

The issue is unlike the first subnautica, this game is heavily focused on story. Sadly this story takes away from the whole mystery of the game. 

With the story, the game basically tells you where you need to be going, in theory this will save you time in long haul, but feature such as base building become so irrelevant to the game play it almost feels like you can just go to point to point.

personally, this game failed to capture the true charm of subnautica, but in the end its still a game worth trying out. I would recommend buying this game when on sale.",1623458854,1689810114,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: if you thoroughly enjoyed the first, you will also enjoy this one and like it for its own qualities.

Pros:
- the underwater biomes are absolutely stunning and feel more unique compared to the first
- the creatures are more detailed and seem far more diverse
- the caves are far more ""twisty"" so it feels like deeper exploration instead of just...go under rock, big open room under rock, which the first was like.
- resources feel more abundant and crafting feels slightly more streamlined but more or less the same as first

Cons:
- map is smaller than the first, so the extent of exploration feels smaller, however there arent repeated biomes so you dont travel through kelp forest in 5 different areas like in the first or 2 mushroom forests etc.
- progression of the game is not very straight forward compared to the first and often feels random going back and forth
- above water missions didnt really add much to the experience for me with a couple exceptions, and I would've preferred more ocean to explore.
- story is more narrated which isnt bad, however the story just isnt as interesting as the first in my opinion.

For me its hard to say which is better, because where one of the games lack, the other does it better. so I have them tied for different reasons. I lean more towards the original mainly just due to the progression feeling better with gradually going to deeper and deeper locations that were quite large etc. and the story was more interesting.

I really enjoyed exploring the ocean in below zero much more than the first. the creature designs were very well made. the cave systems were awesome to go through. exploration was just a lot more interesting. However progression felt super weird and non linear. it felt like there was much less of a clear path of progression compared to the first. also, although the below zero biomes are beautiful, i often felt like there was not much to discover in them.

the story was fine/meh in below zero, and the above water stuff was pretty average.",1689795272,1689795272,True,1,0,0.504470944404602051,0,True,False,False

The first few hours were extremely fun and scary, but then, as it progressed, it lost that factor. Many things that were implemented for you early game became useless. For example, the Snow Fox and whatever suit upgrade you get for the cold, are rather useless. While the SF is fast and the suit maybe handy, you could negate their necessity with the PRAWN suit. It keeps you warm, and much safer, and even a threat unlike the SF as well. The Ice worms are disappointing. I was able to hop away from them in my PRAWN in all encounters, in effect, making thumpers useless. The leviathans aren't scary and I found myself being annoyed with more than anything. I actually chased one down (again in the PRAWN suit) because I got so pissed at it. Leviathans are not scary, only 1 that I encountered looked cool and even then was just in the way. The other Leviathan, the Chellirate (idc enough to spell it right) was far from a threat. I had to approach it and bump into it to make it attack me, it dealt little damage and then ran away. The sea truck is slow, annoying, and vastly inferior to the Sea Moth and Cyclops from the original game, however the map design makes me more understanding, however it still makes me loath using it. Fauna is very limited, the standard preyfish, some leviathans, but very little in between like Subnautica 1 had (sand sharks, bone sharks, stalkers, etc). The travel is boring cuz distances between important locations are so far apart and the sea truck is so slow. The sea truck is easy to damage and destroy unintentionally. Biomes seem more limited, and it overall seems more barren and empty (granted its in the arctic of 4546B). The story is less compelling, and I found myself trying to force myself to finish the game. I looked it up and the amount of travel back and forth I'd have to do to finish the game just hurts to think about so I've quit. Maybe I'll be back just to say I've finished it. Its not a bad game despite my rant, but having played the original Subnautica, it just feels like a worse game. It lacks the mystery and intrigue of the first game in my opinion and it just feels meh. It feels bland, and like a less content filled reskin with a few tasks. I want to finish this game. I have forced my self for a few days now prior to this review, and I can't. I won't. It just bores me to tears. All I have left is the grinding and the travelling. I know where everything is, but even thinking about having to sit through nothingness filled travel. This game is not bad, but its overpriced in my opinion when its not on sale. I'm very happy I didn't spend 40$ on this game. It's not bad, it's just that Subnautica 1 is better in every aspect. I'll being going back to Subnautica 1 and mod it. It has most of the fun or interesting content that BZ has in it's 2.0 update anyways. BZ, not a bad game.

This game isn't BAD persay, but it's far inferior to it's predecessor. 
They decided to have it occur on the same planet, which sure can work... but there just isn't anything that catches me eye.
The character interactions is what kills it. I cannot get over how much the main character talks too much and needlessly. She's needlessly quirky and chatty.
Sea truck is better than the Seamoth sure, but... I miss the Cyclops, even if it was horrible to guide through later areas.
Progression in this game is stalled awfully. My game may have just RNGed badly but I'm missing 1 module for around 14 hours for the sleeper module. Resource gathering is go to here, go back to base, go back here and then do this... and then just constantly doing that is not enjoyable.
Game wasn't playtested enough. I've ran into complete skips of dialog just because I didn't play the ""intended"" way. You're supposed to have stuff stolen by the Sea monkeys, but it never happened to me, so when I ran into one later and they gave me stuff my character made a comment for no reason and wrote in the PDA about it, and I was really confused.

My only complaint about Sub Zero, compare to first subnautica, is the lack of map size, and biome diversity.
I also hoped for there to be deeper areas to explore, with the first game having areas below 1500m deep (And also missing the Cyclops, though I get why they didnt include it this time around, as its way too cramped to use.)

Overall, very fun game and I would recommend if you enjoyed the first Subnautica, Im now pretty interested in this series, and hope to see a Subnautica 3 one day!

Overall, it definitely feels more like a DLC to the first game and not a standalone sequel. It is much shorter, smaller, and worse in basically every way. They made a couple attempts to innovate on the first game. None of those attempts went well, and universally hurt the experience.

The best thing I can say about the game is that if you liked the first game and really, REALLY want more then this is more. It has the same basic structure where you explore to find things to craft gear to help you explore.

As for the bad, first and foremost the protagonist talks! They made an attempt to shoe horn in a more direct narrative, which completely missed how the first game worked. Subnautica OG took a dogshit barely existent story and stretched it out masterfully. You were constantly alone with your thoughts, and the drip of story was just enough to remind you of what was happening but never distracted from the game. Sub BZ's protagonist comments on everything. Once you have Alan in your head you have constant ""banter"". There are several instances where you're exploring and trying to listen to audio logs and the protagonist and Alan CONSTANTLY interrupt to quip about what is happening. It is maddening how badly they misunderstood what made OG great.

The biome design is just pathetic compared to OG as well. There are far fewer biomes and they are less differentiated. It is nuts to see the same resources just randomly copy pasted across half the biomes when OG had such consistent theming for the biomes. The biomes are visually uninteresting, mechanically uninteresting, they're just dead inside. This causes the entire game to falter, since the whole game is about exploring cool shit. OG also felt very intentionally designed. It felt like it guided you to certain locations very naturally, to the point where I felt manipulated when I realized what the game was doing. BZ feels hacked together. Tons of paths have dead ends, and none of them naturally lead you to the next area. You just bumble around until you accidentally advance. Many important areas also only have 1 or 2 entrances, and because they aren't very well designed it can sometimes be easy to miss them. It made exploration feel like a chore.

It's beautiful, exploration is compelling, and it feels like a nice extension and expansion of the first game.  When you're getting into new areas and seeing new things, this game can be exhilarating.  And while a lot of the items and mechanics are similar to the first game, it changes up enough that it doesn't just feel like a rehash.  Also, I appreciate that I don't feel blind 80% of the time walking around in the prawn suit like I did in the first game.  I don't know if that's because the headlamp on the prawn suit are better, or if the lighting in general is friendlier, but I like it.

As for the negatives:  This won't be a surprise if you've played the first game, but it can be incredibly frustrating when you're lost and looking for something specific.  This is especially true in the large above ground section which has multiple important locations, but they're separated by sections that look almost identical.  It is so easy to get turned around and go in circles.

Also, the plot stuff is a little too hands-off at times, despite the game having a more active plot than the first game.  There were a few times while playing where I had something I needed to do, and for every other situation there would be a signal to follow that would nudge me in the right direction, but for whatever reason I had no signal or no guidance to get me there, so I ended up looking it up.

And that's the thing.  I get the design choice to not have a map or minimap in these games.  But ultimately it ends up sending me to wikis and guides to try to find things after spending hours searching and getting frustrated.  I think I'd like it more if the game had internal ways to track this sort of thing.

All that being said, this game, along with the original, were a really fun time.  Very engrossing.  And I very much look forward to any follow-up on this series.",1689424647,1689424647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To start with the good, the base building is improved with several new set pieces and quality of life features. It's still as fun as ever to build out your base and I spent my fair share of time doing so. The vehicles are good (except for the Snowfox), and I actually found the Seatruck to be a comfortable medium between Seamoth and Cyclops, even though Cyclops is still cooler. New tools like the mineral detector are a lifesaver and are appreciated. Some of the new creatures are cool, like the sea monkeys who find stuff for you.

Unfortunately, nearly every other aspect of the game is a step backward. The main story they tried to tell in this game is an interesting concept, but is just not told in an interesting way whatsoever, and the plot is full of more glaring holes than Swiss cheese. None of the characters introduced are very compelling at all, and half of the main characters' dialogue is extremely eye-rolling and cringey. What made the first game so great was the simple concept - you crash on an alien planet, now survive and escape somehow. You played as a faceless, mute protagonist (I know he does have a name/face, but it is barely mentioned in-game), which allowed it to feel like your own fully immersive survival story.

Most people point out that the world is much smaller in this game, and it's true. There are plenty of areas in the game that look amazing, however the biome variety and individual identity of each just feels lacking overall. A good portion of the map is on land areas, which are frankly a slog to get through. After finishing the game, I felt no desire to go and further explore any areas I felt I hadn't fully seen yet, which is the opposite of how it was for me in the first game. Also, the game spoon feeds you too many way points throughout the story, which eliminates a lot of the experience of organically finding something cool, or analyzing a clue to figure out where you need to go. That aspect is still present at several points, but about half the time it seems the game just wants to throw way points at you to say ""go here next"". 

Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have played the first and really want to scratch that Subnautica itch again. Just know you will not be getting the exact same experience that made the first game so special.",1689399365,1689399365,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

4.1/10

Cons: The new vehicles we're very dull and just felt the same (I'm looking at you sea truck) and the map is so small, it even feels like there is more land than water. Subnautica was good because it was what it said, a game about exploring the deep sea, however below zero is a game about ""finding out what happened here"" as stated in the trailer. The story is just Subnautica but worse and the creatures feel the exact same. The game actually kind of looks worse then the first one. 

Pro's: Some of the new extra's for building things looks pretty cool and the Antarctica vibe is pretty cool.

TL;DR: Overpriced Subnautica DLC with more land than water.

Still a very fun experience, and I think it gets a bad rep because of how good the first game was. It doesn't feel as lonely as the first game which can be viewed as a bad thing or a good thing, but for me it really doesn't matter. One issue I have is that the leviathans aren't as scary as they were in the first game, and instead are just kinda annoying. Another issue I have is that it's hard to see where you are on the non existent map. In the first Subnautica, you could see where you were by going to the surface and looking at how far away or what direction the Aurora was. In Below Zero there is none of that. Instead, when you peak your head out of the water, you see mist, and unfortunately nothing else. My last issue with the game so far is the Sea Truck. Now I actually quite like the Sea Truck itself, and was very excited to see how you could attach modules to it, and that it was basically a mix of the first games Cyclops and Sea moth. The problem comes when you realize it's the ONLY vehicle in the game that goes under water, and i'm not counting the prawn suit. You also get the Sea Truck very early on which made me think there would be another vehicle, but no. The Sea Truck is still very cool, but it could've been handled better in that regard. With all that been said, this game is still very fun and has some great moments. However if the 3rd Subnautica game follows the same route Below Zero did, I don't think the franchise will last long.

It has a few nice new additions to craft but just lacks behind the first game in almost everything else (except music and graphics)

Worst thing first: The land exploration. 
I didnt buy a Subnautica game to run around on land and getting lost. The small islands are fine like delta station or the zero one. But the last island is just way to big. i would not have found a single thing on it if i hadnt looked up a guide. And even after finding it, i spent almost 2 hours getting lost there cause its build like a maze. Add weather and night, 2 phases where you cant see shti and its just awful. I would throw frost in there too, but the snowfox saves you from it.

Map: Its smaller and somehow still worse to navigate through. 

Vehicles: Seatrunk is an interesting idea but in the end worse than everything from the first game. Prawn Suit still rocks tho.

Story: Worse than the first game IMO but the architect part was interesting atleast. 

i respect the developers for trying out new things to expand the game but for me, most of them just made the game slightly worse than the first. 

All in all, its still a decent game and i could recommend it, if its on sale but i just finished it and im still very tilted from running around Phil station for way too long.

Gameplay-wise, the game expands the original Subanutica with more mechanics, a large amount of quality of life improvements and additions and a different yet somewhat similar overall feeling.
The gameplay is really well executed and polished and the amount of features is great without being overwhelming. I really enjoy that they have expanded on features that are useful when playing on land.
Graphically, the game is quite similar to the first game although I would say much more polished and with less rendering issues.
The story is the strongest part of the game I'd say. It goes in depth about a lot of things and has a lot of worldbuilding. It blends perfectly with the gameplay and the ending is really satisfying.

I really like being back in Subnautica, and universe is always nice to see more of and exploring new zones in the water, loved seeing more of the architects, and then it pretty much ends there. 

The sea truck is an horrible thing, u would think that something called a truck would be at least good transporting stuff, but this is the most inefficient  thing ever at that, barely any storage, bulky and terrible driving, and just boring to use, no fun at all. Like, the massive cyclops in the first was bulky, but at least u felt u had some omf driving it, u felt like a badass, also just way better at transporting stuff. 

Most of the land stuff is really tedious, and is really boring to be honest, to much land stuff with relative poor mechanics for it and transports, Snowfox is just as bad as the seatruck, clunky and unwieldy

Also the MC is annoying, trying to make her like some badass that just drops in and find her even more smarter and badasser sister, like....  

Mister nobody from first game did this, with no prep and nothing to his name, it kinda feels hard to feel badass being this new girl, when u have played the first one. (would be hilarious if he got sent back to work of his debt or something and shit hit the fan). 
crazy mercenary lady from first one was a nice touch, seeing how she survived from the first one. 

overall I really struggle to enjoy this game, I find it more tedious then fun, first one was also like that at times, but it always had something new or something else drove u to explore and keep working despite it being tedious at times. 


Spoiler: also that the sister/humans was able to make a cure out of the blue when the OP architects couldn't kinda lessens them. also feel like made up just to make her look cool.

The original Subnautica was an absolute masterpiece and I loved every moment of it. The map on the original was so vast and mysterious and had so much to explore. But sadly this next installment did not fall through in those regards. The map is so much smaller and does not carry that excitement that I had with the first. Below Zero also really lacks in horror aspect of exploration. Exploring into the deeper and darker parts of the ocean should carry higher risks with higher rewards but yet it feels like it was missing something. I missed the chills of hearing reapers in the background and having the feeling like I am in real danger. But with Below Zero I felt like there was no real danger's throughout my entire playthrough. Also, the vehicles in this one are god awful. Why would they take a step back and remove the seamoth and cyclops?! I was so turned off after realizing that both of them were never brought over. The sea truck is by far the worst vehicle I have ever used in a survival game.

The player will find out more about what is going on on the planet, about the Architects and about the story of the main character (who this time is not being belittled by his colleagues).
The only this i was missing was the Seamoth from the first game, but the Seatruck is a great addition when it comes to versatility. Only small glitches, which CAN cost you a vehicle or two when exploring areas, you are maybe not supposed to explore in the game.

But that doesn't mean that this game is stunningly beautiful, fun to play, and terrifying in the best way possible. This game adds so much onto the original, while still be good old Subnautica. New base parts, new creatures, new vehicles, and new lore. Not to mention quality of life changes.

A main complaint about this game, is that it looses some of the charm that the first had. This game feels less isolated, something the first one did great. But personally, I'm glad they took a different approach on this one. I like the interactions between Al-An and Robin, and learning more about architects first hand. The game does spoon feed you occasionally, but if you're the type to explore a lot (like me), you will often find stuff before they're marked by Al-An. 

Building is back, and better than ever with the new large rooms, Multipurpose/large room roofs, control room, and so much more. Will you build solely for survival or will you decorate. Perhaps a bit of both? There are so many customization options, and parts to find. My favorite new edition is the large room, so much space for activities!

The theme for life and biomes is this game is pretty.... self explanatory. The first game had a more tropical theme, being on a volcano and all. But despite that, this game just feels more lively to me. There's more fish to catch and eat, new creatures that are vastly different than the ones encountered in the first, and deadly new threats. Of course, some fish from the first are still here, like the peeper and bladderfish, but all of the larger creatures have been replaced. Keep an eye out for the Chelicerates, the reapers of this game.

Yes this game is supposed to be underwater for the most part, but I also enjoyed land travel in this as well. The added aspect of keeping your temperature in check is annoying, yes, but it is still a good survival aspect to the game. A well prepared adventurer can easily bypass this issue by bringing coffee, warm fruits, or a certain salad that can be unlocked through Marguerit (the snow suit also helps). The ice worms are horrifying, no matter how many times you encounter them. 

There are two stories occurring in this game. The first one introduced is about your sister, Sam. Sam has disappeared, and Robin not trusting what Alterra says about her disappearance, goes to 4546B in order to uncover some secrets. Through this, you learn a little bit about the people who worked/studied in this cold environment, and a little bit about Alterra's schemes. The second one, which is the one I looked forward to the most, has to do with precursors/architects. This story line can be initiated at anytime, but it is required to reach the ending. Through this, you learn a little more about how the architects lived and interacted with each other, as well as how some of their technology worked and a little bit more about the Kahraa bacterium. I have not personally reached the ending, but I will here soon.

There's a lot more I could talk about, but I feel as if I hit some of the major ones. This game is awesome, and definitely worth buying, especially for it's price! I hope Unknown Worlds keeps up the amazing work.",1621734954,1689138990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The terror aspect in the original Subnautica was bascily non-existant and i think thats why alot of people said its a downgrade from the first game, because in the original Subnautica there was the Reaper, Ghost and Sea Dragon leviathans and they were wayy more on the map which made it alot more likely you would run into one. The leviathans in this game were very few and not that scary, I think thats because they didnt have those screams/noises comparing to the Reaper or other leviathans in the first game which kind of made them less scary.
I think this game is well summarised by a youtuber (he was talking about Halo 4): It looks like Halo, It plays like Halo but it doesnt feel like Halo (he was talking about the switch in studios between Bungie and 343 (Halo: Reach and Halo 4)

As a standalone game, it's not worth it. The first one is miles better. As an expansion to the first, it's decent.

Reasons why:
- Dialogue is awful. Detailed character backstory is awful. In the first game you could truly immerse yourself in the experience without having to worry about a mouthy protagonist instructing you how to feel. To add insult to injury, the protagonist is written like an annoying teenage girl misquoting plato. Dialogue removes mystique and grandeur from what should be mysterious and grand. Cliché physical presences prevent you from being on your own, surviving, like in the first game. All this ruins the mood of the game and reduces it to a treasure hunt instead of an experience.
- The ice worms are annoying as hell. The ghost reapers are annoying as hell. It's scary if you see it once and it instantly kills you. If you know you can survive it and you just have to step out and repair your gear each of the few hundred times you see one, it becomes a chore. In the first game, you were able to avoid the big monsters. In this one you are forced to face them again, and again, and again, until, again, the mood is thoroughly ruined.
- While this sequel does have some nice areas, the design overall doesn't feel as thought out as the original. It feels like the design team took half of the first game, half assed the rest, and got lucky one or two times. Maybe overconfidence, maybe an attempt to cash in on the success of the original, maybe both.",1689029015,1689029015,False,1,0,0.523121416568756104,0,True,False,False

Wow.
Wow, the visuals and especially cutscenes are amazing. The animations of Al-An and Marguerit give a whole new immersion to the game, not to mention the insane detail and quality of the cutscenes, especially at the end. I loved the way the game looked!
But also, Wow, another cliffhanger? All this time since playing subnautica for the first time years ago I wondered if the Precursor race survived Kharaa... And we STILL don't get to know?
For the gameplay, I think it is generally better than Subnautica. Some stuff is less overpriced to match the available resources (for example titanium ingots getting cheaper, since unlike Subnautica there is not millions of metal scrap laying around), and new stuff like the seatruck being an actual portable base and the deconstructor/recycler allowing for us to undo accidents are great additions. What bothered me about it though was the lack of novelty, but I guess thats almost inevitable when you make a sequel to a game. A lot of stuff just felt familiar, and while the balance between new and familiar in a sequel is hard to find I think it didn't go very well in below zero. I missed the handholding; In subnautica, you didnt always have a quest running, but once in a while you got stuff happening like other pods or the sunbeam to nudge you into the right direction, while i spent a full 5 hours of gameplay with no new beacons like alien artifacts, so I ended up just using the wiki to find locations of seatruck fragments just to have SOMETHING to do. I also felt like the terrain was less interesting. The variety of biomes in subnautica felt stronger and more interesting.

Overall, the game is great, but for me it would probably have been more enjoyable if that balance between novelty and familiarity I mentioned would be better. I doubt we're getting another subnautica game, and I probably don't want one either. A prequel would be interesting, but then again we already know what happened; A sequel wouldn't really work since, how are they gonna make a full game on the alien planet that still resembles subnauticas unique feel?

If you're a subnautica fan however, the game is a must have. The storyline is very tightly connected to the one of the first game which is really cool.
If you're new, I do still recommend playing the first game though otherwise you'll meet a lot of spoilers in Below Zero.",1689009107,1689009107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Brace yourself for an awe-inspiring adventure set in the icy depths of Planet 4546B, where every corner holds secrets waiting to be unraveled.

From the moment I submerged into the crystal-clear waters, I was instantly captivated by the game's stunning visuals. The developers have outdone themselves, delivering a breathtaking underwater world filled with vibrant biomes and awe-inspiring creatures. The attention to detail is simply mind-blowing, making each dive feel like a journey into an alien wonderland.

One of the game's strongest aspects is its narrative. The storyline, accompanied by exceptional voice acting, hooks you from the very beginning. As the protagonist, you find yourself entangled in a web of mystery surrounding your sister's disappearance. The carefully crafted plot unveils itself through environmental cues, audio logs, and encounters with other survivors. The emotional depth and sense of urgency to uncover the truth kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.

Exploration remains the heart of Subnautica: Below Zero. The vast underwater world is teeming with life, and every dive offers a unique and thrilling experience. Whether you're marveling at the luminescent flora or carefully evading the deadly predators, the sense of wonder and danger never wanes. The addition of new biomes, such as the hauntingly beautiful Glacial Basin and the treacherous Twisty Bridges, keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.

To aid your survival, the game introduces a range of new tools and vehicles. Crafting and upgrading equipment is as engaging as ever, adding a satisfying layer of progression. The Snowfox hoverbike, in particular, injects a thrilling sense of speed and freedom into underwater traversal. Seamlessly blending exploration and survival mechanics, Subnautica: Below Zero strikes a perfect balance that will captivate both new players and veterans of the series.

The sound design deserves special mention, as it amplifies the game's immersive experience to new heights. The haunting melodies and underwater ambience envelop you, evoking a palpable sense of isolation and discovery. The attention to detail in every soundscape is impeccable, enhancing the overall immersion and making each encounter feel alive and authentic.

Furthermore, the developers have exhibited a commendable dedication to post-release support and updates. They have actively listened to the community's feedback, addressing issues promptly and providing regular content additions. This commitment to quality has further solidified Subnautica: Below Zero as a shining example of how to nurture and evolve a game post-launch.

In conclusion, Subnautica: Below Zero is an absolute triumph, pushing the boundaries of what a survival-exploration game can achieve. It combines breathtaking visuals, a compelling narrative, and enthralling gameplay to deliver an experience that will leave you in awe. Without a doubt, it deserves recognition as a must-play title on Steam. Dive into the frozen depths and prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey!

On first glance, the game looks pretty great. The ocean is still beautiful as ever, and your expectations are high at this point. 

1.  The Story

The first thing that slaps you in the face is the writing and dialogue. They are some of the blandest, generic and cheesiest scifi-nonsense I ever ever had the misfortune of hearing. In my opion, this is by far, the biggest problem in this game.  In the first game, you only got very brief snippets of dialogue and the story was mostly told via journal entries you could read at your own pace. However, in Below Zero, the story is constantly showed in your face, making the replayability extremely poor.  

2. The Map Size

To have a game about exploration, it feels almost criminal to have substantially reduced map size. The ocean
biomes are laughably small, and a big portion of the map is wasted on the land areas. It was easy to get lost in the vast sea of the original game, yet after 30 minutes of Below Zero, the world already feels cramped.

3. The Land Gameplay

It's terrible. The land areas are just nothing but vast empty fields of ice and snow, without any interesting terrains feature. They are horrible to walk trough, not only because of the annoying freezing mechanic that constantly slows you down, but also you get a fun ""mini-game"" of avoiding the Ice Worm creatures that just randomly pop-up. They are pretty scary when you first encounter them, but become a regular nuisance afterwards. You can construct a janky hover vehicle, but with horrible controls, it doesn't help much.

4. The Endgame

Remember how awesome it was visiting the alien facilities in the first Subnautica? How you descended down to the Lost River with Ghost Leviathans and then to the lava area each with very different ecosystems? Well congratulations because this game has none of that. There are two biomes you must traverse to get to the 'final base', which by the way is the only big alien base in the game. And guess what? Apart from the color, the biomes are EXACTLY the same thing, with the same Leviathan creature in both of them. 


5. The Submarine

One of the best parts in the original game was finally constructing the Cyclops after finding the required blueprints. It was so awesome to have this huge submarine with you could descent into the deepest areas of the game. Well the devs apparently decided that it was too fun, and removed the whole thing. Now you get this Sea Truck vehicle, that even by name sounds ridiculous.  The modules you get are almost useless, and it is extremely slow and cumbersome to drive, considering it's basically a glorified Seamoth.

First off, the map is much smaller. It would not be as much of an issue if it were also denser, with richer and more interesting biomes, yet the opposite is true. Some of the new creatures are genuinely interesting, such as penglings and sea monkeys, but they are a minority compared to the reused assets from the base game, and can't make you really feel like you're exploring a new environment. The Leviathans feel all the same, and represent no credible threat because you see them so often (for real, the end game zone is crowded by them). You'll get used to avoid them by driving straight. At worst they'll take a bite out of your sea truck and leave you alone.

Talking about the sea truck, it is now your main and really only means of transportation. While I enjoy the concept of a more ""utilitarian"" sub, it's attachments do not reflect it's function as a logistics vehicle, with almost no cargo space forcing you to multiply resource gathering trips while building a base. It's resilience on the other hand, nullifies any threat leviathans would pose to your character. There goes the fear element...

All of those issues compound with another HUGE letdown of BZ: the promised new survival mechanics. Indeed, the game is set in the arctic region of the planet, and thus a temperature system was added. Well, it already existed in the original. But this time instead of the burning heat of the Lava Zone, you'll have to deal with the freezing cold of the Arctic... Or will you? Because FOR SOME REASON cold is only a problem on the surface, leading to some incredibly stupid situations when you will dive in the water to avoid dying of hypothermia... Indeed, the cold only serves as a replacement for your oxygen meter when exploring the surface, and only up until you acquire the Cold Suit which solves it entirely.

And why bother? The surface is a chore that you will have to endure, with the worst vehicle I've seen in a game for a long time: the Snowfox. An Unwieldy land speeder with a tendency to clip through the ground and disappear below the map when you deploy it. So what is the reason to use it? Simple, it is the only way to progress the story, if like me you make the mistake of trying to complete it.

BZ was advertised as a step towards more direct story elements, the protagonist is now voiced (don't worry, the dialogues are awful) and you encounter NPCs. Two of them, and together they'll manage to be less impactful and way more annoying than the Emperor in the first game. The original reason of your presence in Sector Zero will end up as an optional objective, meaning the protagonist can leave the planet without ever learning about her sister's fate. And honestly I can't blame her considering how boring and anti climactic this whole plot was...

Below Zero was a full downgrade when compared to Subnautica, and I don't recommend anyone, including new players to buy it. Play the original, it does everything much better, and for the same price.",1688975423,1688975423,False,2,0,0.540678560733795166,0,True,False,False

Not the worst sequel I've ever played but to summarize, the biomes are overly cramped and lit way too well so there's approximately zero spookiness, plus they overdid it with the gas sacks making it effectively impossible to suffocate so why even bother with an o2 system? Just say Alan reprogrammed your lungs to breathe underwater. It would fit pretty well with the rest of the 3rd grade writing.  

The seatruck is mid, and there's no cyclops although I can see why, there's basically nowhere to go with it. The snowfox is an actual joke. It has to be. Why would I use a vehicle that just...ejects me every time an ice worm appears? I truly, unironically thought this was a bug. I haven't been this baffled by a gameplay design choice since the legendary Peter Molyneux.

I do have  critiques with the shallow story, the music that isnt as good as the original, and overall small map and lack of actual deep biomes to explore underwater. It did seem like this game was less horror-inducing than the first, but that could also be due to vast majority of areas feeling less open and claustrophobic. The game also felt like the difficulty was waayyy tuned down compared to the first. Not only are there significantly fewer dangerous leviathans but even the freezing part seems really hard to die from as long as you build a snowfox or a snow suit or salads. Additionally, i found resources much easier to find (with the exception of magnetite) but that could also be because the map is smaller.

That being said I actually enjoyed the idea of the Sea Truck and found the base building better in many ways than the original with the possibility of complex hybrid sea-land bases. Additionally, I also also enjoyed the increased land masses, although i felt there were some underutilized mechanics attached to land exploration.

I found the gameplay still fun albeit this game felt more like an expansion or DLC, rather than a true sequel. Buy it on a discount.

Pros: Fish
         Better graphics
         It is still scary and i kinda shat my pants sometimes
         There is way more interactions then in the first game
         Tons of new gadgets
         MUSIC

Cons: Little playtime. ( I have completed it in 20 hours and got 100 %)
          Ground ""parkour"" is very clunky
          Stain in my pants after i shat
          Some minor bugs but they are rather harmless and not gamebreaking


Conclusion: It is worth buying it if you are a fan of this genre and the tighter environment makes this game more lively.

I wish I could give this a more granular review than a thumbs down.  The game is not bad by any means; the main problem is that it exists alongside the original, and it does everything just a little bit worse.

The main loop of the game is the same as in Subnautica: explore, gather resources, find clues to the mystery, craft upgrades to be able to get to deeper, more dangerous areas, repeat.  It's still a beautiful world and accomplishing your next goal is still satisfying.

The problems:

- The map.  It's smaller, more cramped, full of distinct caves and small twisty areas that lead to the next milestone, and those milestones are often marked by HUD waypoints.  I admit this was probably to address the original game's problem of not knowing where to go next at times, but the result felt less like I was exploring and more like I was completing a series of video game levels.

- Land: The overland areas were not engaging in the least.  The temperature mechanic was a non factor due to the abundance of heat sources, the creatures were never threatening, and the movement out of the water was clunky whether you were on foot or in a vehicle.

- The Vehicles: This has been run into the ground, but the Sea Truck was all the downsides of the original vehicles with none of the upsides.  In the original, the Seamoth zips you around faster than anything, and getting the Cyclops for the first time is a major milestone - it gives you such an amazing feeling (even if piloting it wasn't the easiest thing to do).  In BZ, you get the seatruck early, and that's what you have to use to make progress past a certain point, and if you have to travel across the map, bring something to read.  In the original, there's a choice depending on what you want to do.

Let's not forget the snowfox, which controls like you're drunk and adds nothing except the ability to ignore the temperature mechanics entirely (more than you already were, I mean).

You still get the Prawn Suit.  It's the same Prawn Suit.  You arguably don't need it as much as in the original.

- Tools.  A minor point, but the tools are a bit worse in this game.  Notably, they removed ultra glide fins for some reason.  If you want to go fast, you have to use the Seaglide, the end.  The mineral scanner is a nice addition, but the range is extremely short - if you're looking for a particular mineral you're going to be swapping between it and the seaglide constantly, which is, again, clunky.  The rest of the tools are extremely optional and none of them are particularly interesting.

- Story and Characters.  In both games you are solving a mystery, they're both somewhat interesting but nothing amazing.  The first game had very few characters, as you are a silent protagonist and collect the occasional audio log or transmission.  This game, you have a voice and there are other voiced characters you can interact with in real time.  There are no dialogue options - not inherently a bad thing, but all of the real time (non audio log) dialogue is completely inane.  The ""banter"" between the two main characters is awful, and about as subtle as a brick through a window. It's by far the worst part of the game.  I don't need a silent protagonist in my atmospheric exploration game, I just wish the dialogue that is there had been revised a couple more times.

But it fails to bring back any of the charm of the first game. In Subnautica you were stranded and the goal was to get off the planet, the alien subplot was just part of your journey. 

Now you come to the planet to find out what happend to your sister and get an alien stuck in your head wich becomes the main plot. You dont have to find out any of the sister stuff to finish the game its maybe just for NPC feelings.

And what i really dislike about the game, its to bright. In subnautica you had to use sonar to navigate the dark caverns and it was moody and scary. Now there is glowing everywhere no matter how deep you go. In completely ruins the scary vibe. The monsters in the caverns are scary the first time you meet them but they almost do no damage to your vehicle wich doesnt even need to be fully upgraded to get to the lowest point.

And like others said: If you can't get enough of the formula: go and play this as well, but be prepared for some disappointments and frustrations.

Why is that? 
First of all: When I play a game ike this, being subnautic is what I crave. Not getting lost in some mad freezing and overwhelmingly huge landscape. So far, the above see level parts are something to suffer through for me.

Second: Maybe I am mistaken, but I think in the first part I never missed a crucial blueprint, because you either had multiple opportunities to find them or they were scattered along some story related locations anyway. Not so in the second part. Here I gave up after 20+ hours and looked up the coordinates for the first O2 tank upgrade. Because there is just the one place to find it. And nothing important nearby.

Also the story here doesn't catch me nearly as much as the first one. The bits and pieces of what happened at the locations (PDA messages) are a little bit too long and uninteresting for my taste.
On top of that, this one lacks the subtle guidance that helped decide on where to go next.  Here it is a clutter of possibilities across the screen, while I am not even motivated to visit most of them.

Lastly: moth and cyclops :,( 
Having no storage on the truck by default is such a pain. Being a loot monster and not a fan of prawns is not a good combination...

---

This is still a well made game and I will continue to play the heck out of it. But the first one drew some deep lines in the sand and compared to that this part falls short in a few important aspects imo.

So go and play the first one =)

The TL;DR is that I have 600 hours in the original game, but only 150 hours in this mess. I have played through the original multiple times, I never even played this all the way through... although my wife has. This game just feels like the wish.com version of the original.

1) Sequels should be bigger, more elaborate in some way. They should expand the universe. This does not. The world feels much smaller. Some say the map is actually smaller, I don't know for sure. But it doesn't encourage you to explore. The game might as well take place in a hallway. You go from here to there, then yonder. You never get that ""what's over there?"" feeling.
2)  It feels like there's more of a time crunch than the original. Subnautica definitely had a ticking clock. But this feels like you've been given a hard deadline from your boss.
3) There's too much talking!!!! The number one thing that I hate about this game is that they decided to add chatty, canned dialog. This completely destroys the vibe of the game. It makes it more like an interactive cartoon than the immersive experience of the original.
4) Related to #1, too much rehashed content. Basically, slap the word ""arctic"" in front of the name of creatures from the original. The whole game feels copy/paste.

What it boils down to is that the devs thought they knew what we wanted from a sequel, but they were completely out of sync with the fans. There was real tension and uncertainty in the original. You actually felt like you were trapped in an alien ocean. This has none of that. Instead, it feels like pandering. ""Here's that cute fish we know you liked from the first one"". ""Hey, remember that character?""

I don't know if they're planning a third game. If so, I hope they bring back the aura of the original. No talking, no confining plot... just plop me in the ocean and let me find my way.",1688490470,1688490470,False,25,1,0.657187700271606445,0,True,False,False

The game is more of the same regarding to the building mechanics, scanning the environment, following a story. I liked that the protagonist had a voice actor. The juke box music you can find made my habitat on 4546B the first nightclub.

I found it harder to navigate the world more in this game. I already found the first Subnautica pretty confusing! The dangerous weather was really annoying to deal with since it seemed constant. It made exploring above the water tedious since you literally cannot see a thing, and then the next minute you're dead to hypothermia.

(I have since edited this review to reflect the excellent changes from updates including being able to triple the danger and aggression from predators...as well as darken the game)

I'd rather there wasn't a voice for my avatar.  I don't mind playing a female character at all.  But there was a sense of self being stranded in the first that is missing here.  Also, sometimes Robin's thoughts spoken aloud can be a bit jarring, taking me out of the immersion.  It's not as bad as some make it out, and isn't all the time however.

I love the jukebox.  I love the UI tweaks and character portraits.  The music you find for the jukebox in game is not so great though.  Downloaded some free Celtic harp music for peaceful times in my base or sleeper cabin in the truck.  



***edited to endorse after update.  Having options now to make the game darker, more dangerous, and more of a scary challenge in general is game changing.  I can now make predators do more damage and behave more aggressively while also playing with the spawn rates modestly.  This makes all the difference since the regular game before the major update was far too easy and not very frightening.  Now it is scary again.

AI obviously stands for artificial intelligence. Oxford Dictionary claims that Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

Below Zero is Subnautica, but worse. Worse in most of the aspects that made the original Subnautica such a masterpiece. (The following contains mild spoilers for the predecessor but I try to keep them minimal. Go play that instead if you haven't yet!)

[list]
  [*] [b]The map is TINY.[/b]
Because Subnautica is about being lost in a vast open ocean - you don't get that here. (It's about a third of the size and you can feel every missing square meter.)
  [*] [b]Low creature variety.[/b]
Meaning the few biomes this game has are even less distinct from each other.
  [*] [b]Precursor sites are insultingly barebones.[/b]
I spent hours looking for the greenhouse location because I couldn't believe that what I had already found was supposed to be all there was.
  [*] [b]Bad story.[/b]
It is nonsensical and collapses in on itself after the first third of playtime / the beginning of the supposed 'story arc'. The dialogue is without choices and feels very sterile. Most of the potentially interesting aspects end up abandoned, unexplained and unresolved.
  [*] [b]Poor atmosphere.[/b]
The horror elements don't work properly for lack of open water. And because you're walking around Alterra sites, you're not exploring anymore - only ""re-exploring"".
  [*] [b]Bad vehicle.[/b]
I loved the Seamoth. I liked the Cyclops. The Seatruck is an unholy amalgamation that manages to combine the worst features of both without tangible benefit. Slow, loud, unwieldy and with no noteworthy storage or food/drink capacities. (The seatruck dock at least looks cool, though.)
  [*] [b]The land section is pure pain.[/b]
It is big, it is empty, it is bland and only exists to annoy you with unavoidable, random iceworm encounters while the jittery snowfox ""glide"" makes you nauseous.
  [*] [b]It's the same price as the original?!?[/b]
Really, that's not just rubbing salt into the wound, that's pouring gasoline over it and setting it ablaze.
[/list]

You can skip the next list if you want because those are much smaller problems by comparison, but I still wanted to write them down:

[list]
  [*] The music and sound design are uninspired and much less unique. It's hard to keep BZ's generic roars apart while the looping, biome-specific soundtrack quickly becomes obvious.
  [*] You can not stop sea monkeys from stealing your tools (until spoiler stuff happens, but by then you've already murdered most of them, let's be honest). Also, for some reason they don't rotate when diving diagonally which looks really weird.
  [*] Lots of reused fish swarms. This one boggles my mind because BZ actually has a bunch of new fish designs, you just rarely see them and especially the swarms which are the most prominent form in which you're going to see fish are mostly the ones you already know from the original. Just ... why?
  [*] The new build options are cool but the small map size strongly discourages base building.
  [*] The creature attacks are directly copy-pasted from the original, drawing unfavorable comparisons instead of bringing something new to the aquarium. Furthermore, this might be a weird thing to note but many critters feel much less ... alien than the original designs do. The shark-things look too much like a shark, the shrimp-things too much like a shrimp etc.
[/list]

It pains me to write this because there have been some good QoL changes that were thankfully backported. But this only reinforces my conclusion: What started as a DLC, should have stayed a DLC. I would have loved / would still love to see all of BZ's building options in the original game.",1688097559,1688101090,False,303,5,0.813525259494781494,17,True,False,False

And you are now on this planet to learn about your sister having a gay relationship that was unknown to anyone. None of that was part of the story before the game was officially released. But because this game was released during the height of the woke madness, they shoehorned in as much as they could before release. They even changed the voice of the PDA which used to be the same as from Subnautica to give it a woman of color accent. It just screams ""lazy and unoriginal"" at me. The pre-release alpha and beta versions were legit and are the true colors of the developers. If they had stuck with the original intent they had, it would be a 8.5/10 game for me.   Not everything has to be woke just to be woke. Imagine watching a woke Tarantino film. It would make even the best concept trash on its face. Which is what happened here.

-[strike] you can pin blueprint recipes [/strike] they added it to the original subnautica
cons:
-awful, awful story, especially compared to the story of the original game, the reasoning behind this is, of course, that they prioritized diversity over actual storytelling, and this is evident everywhere in the game, from the pda having an extremely deep and sometimes incomprehensible indian accent to the original writer for subnautica not working on this game
-voiced protagonist greatly removes the immersion that the original game had
-you play as a black woman
-the map is only 1/6th of the original game's area and it's also nowhere near as deep, the map is also much less detailed and the biomes suck
-there is no feeling of tension as the entire map is illuminated at all times and you never really feel like you're in the actual deep expanse of the ocean
-they removed the cyclops and seamoth and replaced it with a shitty hybrid while at the same time they made the prawn suit even more overpowered with upgrades
-you spend too much time on land for a subnautica game
-alterra went from a somewhat questionable corporate entity to ""muh evil corporation has to be evil because capitalism bad!""

Is it completely awful? Not really. Is it good? Not really. Does it live up to the previous game? Absolutely not. The original Subnautica is an amazing game and it feels like they intentionally tried to take out everything that made it good to make Below Zero. I guess I could recommend if you're really itching for more Subnautica game play but I was that way and now I regret it.

For this one, story takes a huge focus. That can work if you actually write a good story. Apparently somewhere in the games development the story went through a huge rewrite and it really shows. It really reads like poorly written young adult novel. A presumed dead character returns and is a ""huge kewl badass"", your incredibly dumb protagonist gets a quirky alien in her head who acts as a foil to her personality, and (this one bugs me the most) where did everyone else go? They just left I guess? It's literally never explained. It ruins the atmosphere and feel that really helped carry Subnautica, the loneliness of being trapped in an alien ocean is just not there when you're not alone at any point.

The map is so much smaller and focuses much more on small caverns that are not fun to navigate. You never really need to go to different places to find basic resources because its just everywhere. I never had actual fun exploring. Then the arguably worst part of the first game, the land sections, are heavily expanded upon. And they're way longer and worse! I was close to giving up on the game while exploring the bland and frustrating tundra. 

This point is more personal opinion to be fair but I found a vast majority of the sea life much less interesting, especially the hostile leviathans. The Reaper was this hulking, threatening beast while whatever the Below Zero one was called is just a big shrimp with a vagina face. The Shadow leviathan was kinda cool but by the time I ran into them they were not a threat at all, just one click with the shock module I got for free and he'd let go.

Missing the Cyclops kinda sucks but it makes sense given the tiny map. There felt like no reason to exclude the Seamoth. I will concede the Sea Truck is great though.

Why do we have to play as a character that relates to nobody nor is interesting to be around. If the first game was paid 30$, this one would be 7$. It is only worth bare-bones. Half the game is on land, most of the ocean is void of life and incomplete. There's just a small chunk of biomes that are awesome, even could be better than anything in the first game.

Hearing the development, they paid more attention to how the playable character was meant to be a black bitchy female protagonist with a lesbian sister instead of finishing the base game. Why does Unknown Worlds never bother to finish games before moving on to the next project?

If you liked Subnautica, you'll have some fun with this but you probably want to wait for it to go on sale. It's not quite as strong as the original.

The later part of the game drags a bit, though, and moves above water. This was an interesting concept but ultimately felt a little boring. The Snowfox is an awesome idea for a vehicle and I was really looking forward to speeding across the glacier on it, but driving it is annoying and frustrating, and it comes at a time when the game itself gets a little annoying.

What truly holds this game back, though, is the story and how ""chatty"" it is. Al-an talks at you ... a lot, and it takes away from that feeling of ""I'm alone on this planet and I need to figure out what I'm doing"" that made the first game so great.

HENCE I DID NOT GET THE ACHIEVEMENTS BUT FINISHED THE GAME USING ANOTHER SAVE FILE AND USING CONSOLE COMMANDS. (84% Achievement Completion, Lost 2 Story Achievements coz of the bug)  - Update - I got the last two achievments after playing it again.

Here is my unbiased spoiler free review: 

Gameplay - Same as the predecessor.. Really cool exploring the snow regions and new biomes, we got new creatures, new variations of some recipes, new vehicle etc. The gameplay is the same, but now you got temperature added into the mix as well, so.. that's something you would have to worry about only on land. It plays out decent, and in the beginning, there are markers, but later, there is nothing.. So exploration is key.  I feel that this game was just.. not captivating enough like the first game. The first game was intense! This game? Not so much. Also gonna point out that you can literally completely skip certain areas and also skip many items in the game, making this game not even close to the first game. But ok, I will keep this like a standalone experience. I felt less threatened in this game. I want to feel scared when I am exploring the ocean. The ocean is scary! And also given the fact that the places just do not feel good at times. I think when I first beat the game I was actively seeking out areas and all and even then I missed a few areas. The 2nd time, I basically, again! Missed those areas AND found out that you can completely skip certain aspects of the game which just makes this so bland of an experience. 

Soundtrack - Pretty good. You can build a jukebox and look for discs for soundtracks of the game, or import your own custom music into the game and play it through the jukebox and blast it throughout your base.

Story - The story is bleh at best. It makes 0 sense in the subnautica universe and I feel that there was more potential. Not as good as the first game's story but I'd be fine with this. I feel this story had 0 purpose and was just there for the sake of being there. Plus add in the voiced protagonist with a bleh storyline, it just makes this a boring game (in terms of story).

Now for the worst part of my experience (THIS IS NOT GONNA MAKE ME NOT RECOMMEND THE GAME COZ IT'S JUST 1 THING WHICH MESSED THE WHOLE GAME UP AT THE END, IDK IF OTHERS ENCOUNTERED THIS OR NOT, BUT THIS IS MY PERSPECTIVE)

BUGS - The game.. literally is underwater exploration.. right? Yes, you say.. but guess what? SOME PLACES HAD NO WATER. I didn't use cheats on my original save file, I swear it. The water would just disappear, which made me literally walk on the ocean floor.. I couldn't get into my sea truck, I couldn't parkour to get into my seatruck, I reloaded the save, nothing happened, restarted the game, nothing happened.. Then I restarted the game after an hr and it was fixed. Next, I made it to the end game stuff (I won't say where, but REALLY DEEP for the story stuff) and my game broke once again, this time, literally not letting me progress in the story. I couldn't interact with what I had to interact with to progress in the story, which pissed me off.. Nothing worked.. I couldn't do anything and that caused me to not get my achievement. I couldn't reload my save coz it was already saved when  I bugged out. So, I went and started another save file and enabled cheats, and warped to the locations and finished the story.. And it was literally the final 30 mins of the game!! I can't restart the game for getting back to where I was just to get the achievements and all, which were disabled coz I used console commands on my other save file. I finished the game using cheats on my other save profile and I feel bad that I couldn't do it without cheats. The game was broken which forced me to use cheats and it hampered my achievements. It is so sad that a really good game can be completely destroyed by 1 or 2 bugs. I still will not place a negative review because this game was good. This section will affect the game's score.. Sorry Subnautica Below Zero. 

If the bugs didn't hamper my progress, it would have gotten a 7/10 - GOOD

FINAL SCORE - 6/10 - GOOD

I had high hopes for this game but honestly, it fell flat. This should have been a DLC. If you really want more Subnautica, then yea I recommend this game to you. Does this feel like a good sequel to the previous game? No..

Despite being a standalone story that takes place parallel to the events of the first game, Below Zero still stays true to the core of the original and offers players a rich and immersive experience.

One outstanding feature of Below Zero is undoubtedly the breathtaking game world. The underwater landscapes are beautifully designed and filled with vibrant fauna and flora. The developers managed to create an icy and mysterious atmosphere that will make players feel like they are in a completely different world. The visual effects and creature design are impressive and add to the immersive nature of the game.

The story of Below Zero is gripping and full of surprises. As a player, you slip into the role of a scientist who investigates the mysterious occurrences on an icy alien water world. The characters are well written and the dialogue is engaging. The game creates ongoing excitement and curiosity as you uncover the mysteries of the environment while fighting for survival.

Below Zero's gameplay mechanics are solid and offer a variety of activities. From exploring the underwater world to gathering resources and building new gear, there's plenty to do. The crafting system allows players to upgrade their equipment and base to better withstand the harsh environment. There are also a number of missions and tasks that advance the gameplay and give the player clear goals.

However, despite all the positive aspects, there are some minor criticisms. Game loading times could be faster, especially considering that it sometimes takes multiple loads to get to different areas of the map. Performance on certain platforms could also be improved to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

Overall, Subnautica: Below Zero is a remarkable expansion on the original game. With its compelling story, immersive game world, and diverse gameplay options, it offers a rewarding experience for fans of the underwater survival genre. While there are some minor flaws, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Dive into the depths of Below Zero and be enchanted by its fascinating world.",1669834818,1687375527,True,3,0,0.555410683155059814,0,True,False,False

The first game is vast and has no map boundaries so it's inherently scary to travel further and further from your life pod. This game has walls on 3/4 sides, so you don't feel that same endless expanse pulling at your sense of scale. I think many areas of the game are less dark and less murky too. These aren't necessarily bad changes, it just means that Below Zero feels more like an adventure/story game than a tense ""one mistake and you die"" survival game. Part of this may also be due to the Sea Truck being very durable and making for a good battering ram to take out leviathans. It's quite an early vehicle and you feel very safe in it. More safe than I did in the last game's cyclops even. This game does have more complex cave systems though, so oxygen management is more of a concern in this game than it was in the original. The oxygen plants placed throughout the cave systems seem to make it a more enjoyable experience. Instead of exploring a bit and then making sure you get back to the surface in plenty time, you can push ahead and swim between oxygen plants to buy time and explore without feeling like you're on a short leash. 

The story is very different to the last game too. Instead of finding hints and uncovering stories an audio log at a time, this game has characters that talk. None of that is really an issue though as the characters themselves aren't bad. It does make you feel much less alone though, which again removes a bit from the ""stranded and desperate"" feel the first game had. In that game you'd be left swimming through dark waters with a thudding heartbeat-like track being the only sound. In this one there are rarely moments like that and the frequent chatting with other characters means there isn't time enough for that feeling of isolation to set in. 

Besides the characters, I feel like the story itself is torn in two, and neither is really finished. On the one hand you have Sam's story, where you're trying to find out what happened to her, the whole initial driving plot of the game. This seems to be quickly forgotten though once you discover an alien ruin. You can still kinda follow that story line and finish the work Sam was doing but you never actually find Sam... Or find out what happened to her, I'm pretty sure. Your main character seems to forget about her sister though when she meets a new character relatively early in the game (usually, since it's in the area right next to the life pod location). 
At that point the game becomes more about the ancient civilisation again. Exploring and trying to find their ruins, put together pieces of what happened and find alien blueprints needed to access the end of the game. At which point it's implied that our player character joins the archaeologist character on exploring alien ruins across the universe, apparently having completely forgotten about her sister by that point. 
Of course, I'm leaving out key details and being a bit cryptic to avoid spoilers but personally I feel like the game would have been better off focusing on one of the two stories. Your character could have been sent as a rival corp agent to discover what's going on with Altera's new research outpost, since they seem to be streaking ahead of the competition all of a sudden, for example. Or perhaps they could be a rebel journalist, intent on finding out what secrets Altera is hiding. Or they could be just searching for their sister who's mysteriously gone missing/radio silent after taking work with Altera and being sent to a strange alien planet. Each of the stories is individually compelling but they're not linked in the game. Sam was never involved with the alien ruins, for example. And the alien ruins never had anything to do with Sam's research/work that we end up finishing. Which means you can't have a complete ending since one will have to be a 'soft' ending to that story and the other a hard ending to the whole game. You can't do a climactic ""the story lines come together and there's a big epic ending"" because the story lines can't come together. 

Anyway, I'm going on too much about the stories, which are honestly a relatively minor part of the game, much like in the first game. The setting is good and it's a lot of fun to explore. Even though the story is weaker and the atmosphere is more ""exploration"" than ""survival"" I'd put this game pretty much on par with the original Subnautica. Plus there's a lot more 'on land' parts now. Which not everyone likes but I think it adds something to the game.",1687343827,1687343827,True,1,0,0.512743651866912842,0,True,False,False

Another huge negative to the game is the woke bull**** by being forced to play as a non-Caucasian female is extremely woke and offensive which diminishes the enjoyment massively.  Even the AI is non-Caucasian (Indian) &  female, the main antagonist is also female, seriously!  Thankfully you can get a mod to revert the AI voice to the original ""computer"" voice (still female but not so in your face misandry).

This feels like really phenomenal DLC rather than a standalone game. Its size and scope are much more limited than the first, so I don't really feel they should have put it at the same price point. And like the first one, it's better if you go in blind (but I'm going to leave my thoughts anyway).

I will start off saying that overall, I really enjoyed the game. There were some aspects I even found to be an improvement over the original. The story in particular was far superior in my opinion, and I liked the voice acting (though I've seen other reviews saying the opposite, so YMMV). I also loved the seatruck, though a couple of the modules felt fairly useless. It was also nice having more land-based exploration, though that probably could have been implemented better. The new base buildings and the new wetsuit were welcome additions as well. Finally, some of the new creature designs were excellent. I especially loved [spoiler]the shadow leviathans and vent gardens, and the... puffin things with lots of legs[/spoiler].

So the biggest problem, to me, was how limited everything was. There's just a whole lot less to explore, and a whole lot less to find. I mentioned that there's more to explore above ground now, but there's not much variety to the landscape up there. A lot of the surface just felt like filler. The [spoiler]spy pengling[/spoiler] also felt under-utilized. And then underwater, the map has a tendency to just stop. I don't think it's actually the case, but It [i]felt[/i] maybe half the size of the original's map, both in diameter and depth (though perhaps not if you include the surface areas). Further, there was quite a bit of technology I just never used. There were three seatruck modules I never built, and I never used the propulsion cannon. There was also a lot less on which to use the laser cutter. In the original game, my hub base was expansive and had an absolutely huge storeroom full of all sorts of resources, and it always felt like there was some reason to use them. In this game, none of my bases grew very large, and I never felt a need to stockpile resources. I don't know why they even included large kyanite crystals, except maybe to look pretty? There also wasn't as much of a sense of dread in this game. I never really felt like I was in major danger, though I did get spooked a couple of times, of course. [spoiler]I also found it odd that they actually included another living character in this game, and then proceeded to do practically nothing with her.[/spoiler]

The other major problem was progression. They did not balance technological progression well at all in this game, so I often found myself way ahead of where I was supposed to be, and unlocking tech way too early. This on its own didn't cause too many issues, it just made some things redundant, or sometimes I'd have to go back and find some scraps I missed in an earlier area. However, this totally threw off the story. Like I said, I enjoyed the story, but I unraveled it all out of order. And what was meant to be the climax of my sister's story (which I found halfway through the chronology of the story) felt oddly... hollow? Weightless? It had very little impact. The other story was done much better, I felt, and the ending was very satisfying.

Again, I really enjoyed this game, and I hope they continue the series (especially given the ending of this one). But in some ways, it just felt unfinished and unbalanced when compared with the first game. And although I love the seatruck, I still really miss my cyclops ;_;",1687058411,1687058411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

one thing i will say, is that this game holds your hand even less than the previous. what i mean by this is that there were a couple times i straight up skipped past and would have struggled to find a couple key items without looking them up online. dont remember having the same experience in the original. it doesnt do the best job of leading you to find the answer yourself, instead hoping you find what you need mostly by luck.

I declared my profound love for the original Subnautica game a while back. Subnautica, the original, is a superb game. And this one, Below Zero, just did not hit the same for me. All the things that made the original game sooooo good were literally eliminated in this one: the utter lack of dialogue and other characters which gave you that deep sense of loneliness, the amazing diversity in biomes -not one looking like the other-, the fun with a seamoth and a submarine which you could turn into a floating home away from home, playing the overall majority of the game under water, the amazing and diverse sea creatures, fun base building....no more.  I did not enjoy base building as much in this one because it was a PAIN to find areas where you could easily build a large base.  There was a clear lack of diversity between the biomes and sea creatures, everything looked alike. The twisted roots quickly became old and annoying, same for the horror that is your new underwater ship. You cannot play with it as you could with your submarine, it is hugely impractical and the parts are annoying to connect. The ice areas and worms...nah...totally unnecessary and destroying what set the original game so apart: the skill do make a good underwater game. And the dialogue...oh my ...it completely killed the entire Subnautica vibe. Completely. As much as I am in love with the original one, this one...no...it felt rushed and incomplete and the devs tried too hard to make it maybe more accessible and easier to play but it destroyed the heart and soul of the base game. But ...again....it is still a great game and if you have not played Subnautica 1 you will enjoy this for sure.

Rating: 5/5

Subnautica Below Zero, the highly anticipated sequel to the original Subnautica, takes players on another thrilling underwater adventure. Developed by Unknown Worlds Entertainment, this open-world survival game offers a captivating and immersive experience that builds upon the success of its predecessor. While it retains the core gameplay elements that made the original game so beloved, Below Zero introduces new features and an intriguing storyline that keep players engaged from start to finish.

One of the standout aspects of Subnautica Below Zero is its stunning visual design. The underwater environments are beautifully rendered, with vibrant colors, detailed textures, and a sense of depth that truly makes players feel like they are exploring an alien world. From the shimmering depths of the ocean to the icy landscapes of the arctic biome, the game excels in creating diverse and visually appealing environments.

The gameplay mechanics in Below Zero are similar to the first game, focusing on exploration, crafting, and survival. Players must scavenge for resources, construct tools and equipment, and manage their oxygen levels as they navigate the vast underwater world. The addition of new biomes, creatures, and resources adds depth and variety to the gameplay, encouraging players to further explore and discover the secrets that lie beneath the surface.

One of the significant improvements in Below Zero is the introduction of a more engaging narrative. Players assume the role of a scientist investigating an alien planet, uncovering the truth behind a mysterious corporation and their activities. The story unfolds through voice logs, data terminals, and encounters with NPCs, creating a sense of intrigue and discovery. The characters are well-written, and their interactions provide emotional depth to the overall experience.

The survival mechanics in Below Zero strike a good balance between challenge and accessibility. While the game presents threats and dangers, such as hostile creatures and changing weather conditions, it never feels overly punishing. This allows players to focus on exploration and the gradual progression of their equipment and base building without becoming overwhelmed by constant threats to their survival.

One aspect that some players may find lacking in Subnautica Below Zero is the overall length of the game. Compared to its predecessor, the main story is relatively shorter, taking around 15-20 hours to complete. However, the game makes up for this with its high replayability value, offering multiple endings, side quests, and hidden secrets that encourage players to revisit the game and uncover everything it has to offer.

In terms of performance, Subnautica Below Zero generally runs well, but it's worth noting that there have been occasional reports of minor bugs and optimization issues. However, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing these concerns through regular updates and patches, ensuring that players have the best possible experience.

In conclusion, Subnautica Below Zero is a worthy successor to the original game, building upon its strengths while introducing new elements that enhance the overall experience. With its stunning visuals, engaging narrative, and immersive gameplay, it offers a captivating journey into the depths of an alien world. Despite its shorter main story, the game's replayability and attention to detail make it a must-play for fans of the survival genre and underwater exploration.",1584032621,1686510453,True,0,0,0.473729550838470459,0,True,False,True

As far as story goes, it felt very short and lacking. Not to say that I didn't have fun on the journey to the end but it definitely felt less emotional than the first did for me. During parts that should have been emotional, it felt very rushed and just like ""Okay, that happened. Moving on!"" so that was kind of a bummer. 

As far as gameplay goes, it was as to be expected from a Subnautica game. There were plenty quality of life improvements that I enjoyed more in this one than in the first (although they did update the first one to add some stuff from the 2nd game into the 1st so that's awesome!) but overall, if you played the first one, this one is super easy to figure out and learn right out the door. 

The ocean felt smaller. It also felt emptier but not in that scary way that the first one felt where you felt alone. This one felt more like we needed more fauna to populate the ocean. Speaking of population, there IS one specific enemy in the game that you meet pretty early on and without spoiling anything, I truly feel that they should have taken the ""less is more"" approach with those ones specifically because you end up seeing them so often that they no longer really become scary.   

Overall, I still think I enjoyed Subnautica better than Subnautica: Below Zero but it was still a fun experience overall.  I'd say if you're on the fence with this one, wait for a good sale. I got mine for $13.99 I believe? To me, that was worth the price. If you're a bit iffy, you may want to hold off until it is a bit cheaper.

This game would be pretty good if the original Subnautica didn't exist. Unfortunately for this game, the bar has already been set and this game seems incapable of finding a single category where it outperforms it's predecessor.

It's important to know that Below Zero isn't identical to the first game. They're set in the same world, but the experience is quite different. Below Zero is more story-driven and less focused on scares compared to the first game.

That doesn't mean Below Zero doesn't have scary moments - it does, but there are fewer than in the first game. Also, the map in Below Zero is smaller. This isn't a drawback though, as it allows for more details to be included. And in Below Zero, there are a lot of details.

In short, Below Zero is very different from the first game. If you enjoyed the underwater fears and surprise elements in the first game, you might not feel the same about Below Zero.

I actually really liked the smaller map since it had more meaningful exploration, it was easier to get lost in the first game which ultimately just wasted time. I also like that the main materials are easier to find when needed, the addition of mineral detector was insanely beneficial early game too.

That being said, the starting experience such as being thrown in the world forcibly (not by choice like in BZ) and seeing the destroyed starship in the distance was definitely better in the first game, but in BZ it was exciting throughout the game until the very end.

Let me start with some of the good parts:
-Story, engaging 
-Soundtrack, good
-Exploration, great (maybe even more fun than in the first game)
-land segment, nice to explore
-Visually, amazing
-No bugs on my playtrough

But it is not all good news sadly. 
The story, while engaging, I found to be lesser then the first game. The ending was a bit boring and the motivation of exploring is questionable at best form a story perspective. 
It is also much shorter. This could be because I know the gameplay loop now, but it took me about 15 hours less than the first game.
The base building is good, but because of the shorter nature of this game, I didn't find myself needing the base so much. 
The seatruck is nice. It is a mix between seemoth and cyclopes. You can have a mobile submarine, or a big one. Up to you. Modules however were very difficult to find, and not really needed. Outside of the debt module, I beat the game with no additional help.
The game seems easier, I died less. More sources for air were around and animals were not that dangerous.

Other thing to note:
This is not a bad thing, but the game is not scary (just like the first game). I have no idea why others find it scary. I often punched big fishies because they were nibbling on my seatruck (which is not cool :p).",1686219409,1686219409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hope the fact that the protagonists are all strong women has nothing to do with this...

The world itself is smaller, and exploring for the sake of it less enticing than the original, so in the end it's a shorter game. However, the twist of having large land areas with actual gameplay is great. Temperature adds another survival layer to these parts, although there are so many ways to deal with it that it becomes less relevant than it could be. Nevertheless, running around looking for shelter and avoiding threats, I had the only moments in Subnautica where it feels like a true survival game.

I played it just after finishing the first game, and the game loop still felt interesting.

But as I wrapped up my final session of Subnautica: Below Zero and watched the credits, I just didn't feel like it gave anywhere near the same energy and thrill the original game did. I've read many reviews saying that while it wasn't as good as the original game, it was still good. And for the first few hours, I'd agree with that statement. But progressing through and putting more time in, it felt like an entirely different [i]game[/i].

Let's start with the land exploration. The original Subnautica had a bit of exploration out of the sea - it was a  nice change of scenery from the underwater portions, but a miniscule part of the player's overall journey. Below Zero implements its 'temperature' mechanic this way. Being on land will tick away at a temperature gauge, and if it drops to zero, you die of hypothermia. It's understandable to have a mechanic related to heat in this game, but here's the kicker - there's A LOT of land to traverse. I have some qualms about the temperature mechanic itself but what's so irritating is that the land segments seem to overstay their welcome long before you're finished with them. If you built the Prawn Suit for these sections, you're all good, these segments can be traversed without much worry of temperature or injury. But if you're a player like me and traverse these areas without one, the cracks begin to show in the land-based traversal. Your character gets hung up on multiple things, whether they be tiny ankle-high obstacles, scattered materials, or perhaps most confounding, elevation changes. I found myself on multiple occasions leaping around trying to find the spot that would allow me to progress, and this was especially frustrating when I was simply trying to climb a snowy hill or walk towards a vent to warm myself back up. This is interspersed with multiple PDA warnings that hazard 'dangerous weather' and to 'seek shelter'. Thing is, dangerous weather almost seems to be the standard - I'd hear one of these warnings every few minutes when navigating on foot and it made it irritating to navigate the areas where shelter wasn't an option or I'd just left a safe space, although the weather changes themselves didn't seem to alter much. Walking isn't this game's strong suit and as I navigated these areas I found myself desperately wishing to be back in the water.

And while I thrived in Below Zero's initial routine, I found that being in the water here wasn't what it was in the past. Environments seem to have no semblance of connecting with one another - I navigated from a lush green environment full of seaweed and fish to a barren landscape devoid of life, then continued on to find [i]another[/i] flourishing landscape full of lilypads and moss. It's even worse in the late-game areas - what awaits you below are long mazes cramped full of environmental hazards that damage vehicles and lend no semblance of where you are going. Getting lost almost seemed to be part of the game at this point - there are multiple areas that appear to be ways to climb upwards or descend downwards that instead lead the player into a dent in the landscape instead of a tunnel. Why make navigating these areas so irritating to accomplish and so dull to be in when the endgame areas from the last game [spoiler]like the Lost River and the Lava Zone[/spoiler] were so thrilling to find and explore?

This frustration is compounded by one creature[spoiler]- the Shadow Leviathan[/spoiler]. These pricks are found weaving through the tight narrow areas deep under the water's surface, and they take every opportunity to engage the player. Once it makes visual contact, it lets out a roar and weaving and diving through the environment or trying to find a hiding spot is useless at that point - it will find you and it will engage you. They lock you in a grapple animation if you're in a vehicle, and you have to tediously wait as it takes its time munching on whatever you're piloting until it gets bored and spits it out in an entirely random direction. What's worse, by the time you repair your vehicle or heal up and point towards the direction you were initially headed, you could very well get spotted and have to go through the same process all over again. I spent 30 minutes and 2 batteries on an endzone run making my way to where I needed to go between repairing my Seatruck and moving a few feet before it stuck me into yet another attack animation. Remember the Reaper Leviathan animation from the first game? It was horrifying, specifically [i]because[/i] I remember it locking my Seamoth in its maw. From what I recall this happened only once to me but it established it as a major threat, and even though it never happened again I knew to steer clear of the Reapers. And the other threats, like the Ghost Leviathans, had no animations that I experienced at all - they'd glide by you mouth agape and deal their damage in passing, establishing them as dangerous without having to push the concept in your face. Instead, this creature comes out annoying and tedious to deal with after 10 minutes in the landscape they occupy because you can expect to get grappled frequently - AND THEY'RE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID. The fact that this enemy takes so much time away from the player and insists on being so aggressive pulls a lot of the wonder away from exploring the late-game environments since the longer you spend down there the better chance you have of getting attacked again.

I couldn't complete a review without bringing up the game's lack of direction, either. When you start, the game highlights a few areas of importance and... that's basically it, that's all the guidance you get. From a few highlighted areas on your map, you have to navigate without so much as a map to help guide you to where you're supposed to be going. I don't need handholding, I managed to get through the original game just fine, but in some of the objectives [spoiler]like finding Al-An's body pieces[/spoiler] you are given such little direction on where to go you may not know how to progress. I resorted to using a light walkthrough with little guiding hints instead of outright step-by-step directions and I cannot emphasize how much it made the experience more enjoyable simply because it finally felt like I knew what I was doing again. But that job shouldn't fall on fans - if the game is done right, a walkthrough shouldn't be needed at all.

There are so many other things I could comment on - the reduced vehicle count (the Cyclops and Seamoth are removed, replaced with the Seatruck), the multiple useless blueprints (the pathfinder tool, the repulsion cannon, the thumper and multiple vehicle upgrades all felt like more trouble than they were worth investing in), stockpiling of materials that meant nothing (I had over 10 ion cubes stored in my locker since I found only one blueprint that utilized them in any meaningful way), lack of direction on where to find different materials (I didn't know where to find root pustules, for example), one of the late-game materials being nigh-invisible compared to the rest of the environment... (looking at you, Nickel - and yes, I used the mineral detector) I won't deny that I had fun playing Subnautica: Below Zero, but I would be doing a disservice if I didn't also say that by the very end I was also dying in frustration to complete the game and finish it so I could uninstall it. If you're looking for more Subnautica, I recommend modding the original with content the fans have released instead of trying to relive it playing this, as by the end all I could feel was relief that I could finally stop exploring this game centered on the concept of exploration.",1685999054,1685999054,False,130,2,0.853450298309326172,0,True,False,False

Strange. Without being a vassal for [insert famous YouTuber's name here] opinion, here's my review.

I abandoned the first Subnautica due to the grind and poor guidance on 'where to go next' but enjoyed elements of it. Unfortunately, in what could have been a huge improvement over the original, they improved little, and even worse: the dev team outsourced the voice of the adviser! Cheapskates.

The problems I have with both Subnauticas:
- Little guidance on game mechanics. Tips at the beginning would be handy.
- Poor or no guidance on progression and where to go next.
- Resource management can be a pain
- Grind
- The base-building mechanic is a little dodgy: they take considerable effort to build, which wouldn't be so bad if the game hinted at where to place them.
- Annoyances. Do creature attacks and traps really do anything other than annoy the player?

How they can improve:
- Solid guidance
- Get rid of the base-building - it's not necessary
- The player's submarine is the base! The player should get a submarine from the start or early on.
- There should be a scanner on the submarine, which would help to locate tech and story progression.
- A 3d map, showing all areas the player has seen
- Beacons should be able to be placed on the 3d map.
These are but a few, but even implementing these would massively improve Subnautica.

I very much believe that only the sweatiest of sweats can complete the Subnauticas. They really are frustrating games and I doubt I'm alone in saying this. It's as though they created the game for co-op play but the guy/gal/thing responsible for the netcode secretly spent all his/her/its time watching cat videos, so they released it for single-player instead.

One more thing: I could only find 2/3 parts of the laser cutter in Below Zero and even went back to search the site with better tech later. It's a bit silly that it's hard to find the parts for a (presumably) important item such as this, especially considering there's lots of areas that you can only access with the laser cutter.",1685777796,1685777796,False,2,1,0.389861464500427246,0,True,False,False

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

Subnautica: Below Zero takes players on a captivating and immersive journey into the depths of an alien underwater world. With its stunning visuals, atmospheric soundtrack, and a sense of exploration and discovery, Below Zero offers a unique and chilling experience that builds upon the success of its predecessor.

One of the standout features of Subnautica: Below Zero is its breathtaking underwater environment. The game presents players with a frozen, otherworldly landscape, filled with vibrant marine life, mesmerizing biomes, and haunting depths. The attention to detail in the game's visuals, from the shimmering ice formations to the unique flora and fauna, creates an atmosphere that is both beautiful and foreboding. The underwater setting truly feels alive, offering a sense of wonder and mystery that drives players to explore further.

The storyline in Subnautica: Below Zero adds depth and intrigue to the gameplay. Players take on the role of a scientist investigating the disappearance of a research team on an alien planet. The narrative unfolds gradually, revealing secrets and unveiling the truth behind the mysteries of the planet. The engaging characters and well-paced storytelling keep players invested in the journey, while the addition of audio logs and environmental storytelling adds layers of immersion to the overall experience.

Exploration is at the core of Below Zero, as players navigate the treacherous underwater world and uncover its secrets. The game offers a variety of biomes, each with its own unique challenges and resources. From the frozen tundra to the eerie depths of dark caves, there is always something new to discover. The inclusion of new vehicles and equipment expands the player's abilities, allowing for deeper dives and more efficient exploration.

The survival mechanics in Subnautica: Below Zero add an extra layer of challenge and immersion. Players must manage their oxygen, food, and water supplies while fending off dangerous creatures and navigating hazardous environments. The sense of vulnerability and the constant need to gather resources and craft essential tools create a compelling gameplay loop that keeps players engaged and motivated to explore further.

The game's audio design is exceptional, contributing to the overall atmosphere and immersion. The haunting and atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the underwater setting, enhancing the sense of isolation and mystery. The sound effects, from the eerie calls of distant creatures to the gushing of water currents, further immerse players in the alien world, creating a sense of tension and wonder.

However, Subnautica: Below Zero does have a few minor drawbacks. The game's performance can be inconsistent at times, with occasional frame rate drops and glitches. The survival mechanics, while adding depth, may feel repetitive or grindy to some players. Additionally, the game's early access nature during the review may mean that some features and optimizations are still being developed and refined.

In summary, Subnautica: Below Zero offers a chilling and captivating dive into an alien underwater world. Its stunning visuals, immersive atmosphere, and engaging storytelling make it a worthy successor to the original Subnautica. Whether you're drawn to the game for its beautiful underwater vistas, the thrill of exploration, or the intrigue of its narrative, Below Zero offers a unique and compelling experience that will keep you hooked from beginning to end. Dive into the unknown and uncover the secrets that lie beneath the icy depths.",1685555364,1685555364,True,2,0,0.522171556949615479,0,True,False,False

It's worth mentioning that while the second game didn't diminish my enjoyment of the first game at all, there were a few spoilers about it.

Gameplay and controls are just as solid as its predecessor and the new frozen setting is graphically appealing and fun to explore (bonus points for having the devs use area designs in this game that were scrapped in subnautica, like the twisty bridges). Below Zero also introduces quality of life features which are overall nice to have. What bugs me however, are the new vehicles. The snowfox is cool but basically just a seaglide on land. The cyclops and seamoth have been removed in favour of the seatruck, which is a good way of integrating the ""mobile base function"" in a smaller map, however the iconic status of those 2 makes the loss a bit bitter. While the new fauna is uniquely designed and interesting to scan and learn about, what i am missing is the scare aspect of fear. The new leviathan designs are intimidating but there arent enough of them. There are also less deep dark zones like the bulb zone or the lost river. Everything is brighter and less intimidating.

- The design of the creatures and fauna are well put together,
- Lots of dialog in this one game than in the first game,
- I mentioned in the review in Subnautica - This takes patience and time and effort instead of using some sort of teleportation to get here and there easily and beat the game quicker (once you discovered the area you go to),
- I like how I can design my base and decorate the interior though having a pet that isn't stuck in a aquarium  or outside in the ocean but can move around the base would be a great addition to Subnautica and Subnautica Below Zero, but the Trivalve pet will have to do - You can have multiple with is great (2 Yellow & 4 Blue), better then having one in the first game or a chance to get another in a time capsule.
- Sea monkeys are my favourite since they bring you items.

- DO NOT GO IN THE DEAD ZONE!, it isn't like the first one where you have time to escape, no, the Void Chelicerate will be right on your trail without time to think,

  - SPOILER -

If there will be a third Subnautica, which I hope that there is, I hope that they will continue the story of Robin and AL-AN on his home planet on his search of any survivors of his kind and get to explore the planet that I saw in the ending cut-scene, Because to be honest the whole game-play and story-line felt like an intro to something bigger and more greater.

and also being able to going to the void where you see nothing but darkness and just a guide to maybe to scan some items for your base or PDAs to discover or even to discover a new part of the map that other researchers or survivors have discovered before your character got arrived - it would be a great addition to the game since it would increase the scare factor & all.

It would also be cool if you go deeper than 2000 meters with more deadly leviathan class creatures.

 - END OF SPOILER - 

I have nothing to dislike about this game apart from the fact that there wasn't much in the scare factor apart from going into the dead zone, unlike the first game but like I mentioned, the Dialog that this game has makes up for it in plenty.",1684118761,1685302385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The experience of the game is very much the first trailer. Not exactly afraid, just mostly mildly annoyed that you keep getting attacked by different sea monsters.  It's not like the first game, at all. The plot feels super shallow, and I completed the game in a quarter of the time it took me to complete Subnautica. The above ground sections were annoying because of the cold meter and how large the areas were, but all of that goes away the instant you find the snowfox, and then the areas are over in 2 seconds. The normal map is super small, with every 200m or so being a new biome with just a large ravine that goes super deep inside it. At only one point did it feel like Subnautica, and that was exploring the underwater Altera mining site, and that was very brief. There's nothing really to the story, you sort of arrive, find some alien stuff, find some more, and leave. Honestly the main point you're on the planet, your sister's death, feels like a subplot. The main character really doesn't do anything significant at all, except optionally finish what their sister was trying to do. If someone else was trapped on the planet, it would change absolutely nothing about what happens.

If you are going to show us what you are capable of then you are going to have to follow up. If they keep all the same game mechanics then they should have plant of time and resources to blow the original map out of the water, But no. The map feels like a petri dish compared to the original. There are like 5 biomes and your at the world edge before you even have your base built. the main character is terrible. The story was so uninteresting. I didn't even know what was going on after about the 10th PDA i was supposed to read.

Please someone tell me why the developer who struck gold with a unique underwater based game, in an industry where literally every other company is making survival games on land. Thought what ""SUBNAUTICA"" needed was a labyrinth of a small, monochromatic, boring, ice, wasteland. One that you have to go around checking useless cave after useless cave untill you find something meaningful.

I also liked that the game didn't just revolve around being on the waters all the time like the last game. In this game you get to be on land too where you explore caves made of ice. The best part of the game though is the ocean animals and the large monsters hidden in the depth of the waters.

Everything besides the graphics is just a Subnautica downgrade, below zeros creatures and biomes are very forgettable and i feel like that there is no real sense of danger in the game. There are no warpers to teleport you out of your seatruck or sea dragon leviathan to launch fireballs at you. Most, if not all, the leviathans are pretty basic and don't really have any uniqueness to them other than their design.

The map is disappointing because its way smaller than the original and shallower, meaning there is no real use for the prawn suit besides lore...

Temperature is also in my opinion kinda dumb, if you were gonna add a whole new bar, maybe have it be affected when being in certain water biomes instead of just above land. I know there is some lore aspects that explains why temp isn't an issue underwater, but non the less, its still just there...

Gonna cut it short here and say it's not a bad at all game, but compared to the original its pretty meh. If you have not played the original Subnautica, then don't get this game and if you have the original, then i would only recommend if you have spare change and a weekend of doing nothing.

848450,138588254,76561198044199281,0,1,2015,0,2015,1684552797,"Having played through the first game multiple times, I decided to return to Below Zero again. I had remembered fans of the first game having disliked Below Zero and didn't really understand all the hate the first time I played the game through. After finishing (not completing, but decidedly not returning to) my second play through, I can safely say that I get it now.

Here's everything wrong with the game:

1. Progression - Progression in Below Zero is completely uneven. Maybe twenty minutes into my run, I had found Outpost Zero and scanned several blueprints that would be considered mid-late game in the original Subnautica. I don't think I even had a Seaglide yet, let alone a builder tool. This phenomenon continued throughout the game, and I often felt simultaneously over and under geared.

The depth mechanic that facilitated progression in the first game is pretty much non-existent in Below Zero; you can comfortably navigate about 80% of the (meaningful) map with a basic Seatruck, Seaglide, and Oxygen plants. As a result, there's no real order in which you gather blueprints and experience events, and it makes the whole experience very disjointed.

2. Characters - one of the biggest changes from the original is greater focus on characters and dialogue. This wouldn't be an issue if the characters weren't all unlikable, childish, one-dimensional caricatures. The writing is absolutely awful, and I felt embarrassed for the voice actors every time I listened to a recording. I completely understand Alterra's decision to stick all of these people together out in the middle of icy nowhere.

Robin is a whiny, jaded know-it-all, and her conversations with Alan sound like something out of an undergrad philosophy dormitory common room. I don't even know the name of the protagonist from the original game, but after a few of these conversations I thank him wholeheartedly for keeping his mouth shut throughout the first adventure. Love that guy!

3. Large Areas - While many of the new biomes are great (Twisty Bridges, Lily Pads), there are some infuriatingly large, empty areas that the game forces you to slog through. The two overland areas essentially serve to be as annoying as possible to get all the way through, just to grab the one thing you need and never return. They are large seemingly for the sole purpose of being time-consuming and confusing to navigate; that's the challenge. There is an alien gateway shortcut in one of these overland sections that literally takes longer to utilize than just walking to the end destination - what?!

Don't worry though - large, useless areas aren't just limited to the land. The end-game deep biomes are just as huge and empty as the overland areas. Subnautica's Lost River was undeniably huge, but despite it's name I never remember actually getting lost. The tunnel does a good job of guiding you to the end of the game. The deep areas in Below Zero are twisting networks of interconnected caverns that all look the same, and I found myself going around in circles until I managed to get lucky and find the tiny little area the game had me looking for.

4. Boring, Annoying Leviathans - the Reaper put Subnautica on the map, I don't care what anyone says. There are areas in the first game I still haven't been to after maybe a dozen playthroughs because those things are so terrifying (although pretty manageable in the end). Leviathans in Below Zero are the opposite. Save for the Vent Garden (that thing is awesome, maybe the best five minutes of the game), the new Leviathans are all unintimidating and incredibly frustrating to manage.

Remember what I said about the huge, empty deep zones? I forgot to mention that, while cruising around in circles looking for the next place to go, you're going to get grabbed by the Shadow Leviathan roughly every thirty seconds, spend the next thirty seconds repairing your ship, travel maybe 100 meters, then rinse and repeat. ALL THE WAY DOWN! Unlike the Ghost Leviathans, the Shadow Leviathans can pull you out of any tiny crevice; there is no escape.

In the end, this is what killed my playthrough. I got to the last area deep down at the bottom of the map, only for the game to inform me that I needed to turn around and brave the onslaught of Shadow Leviathans again to collect the wide variety of resources I'd need to complete the game. It was at that point, having re-experienced Below Zero to my (dis)satisfaction, that I decided to power down and call it quits. I can only pray that Robin stays in that deep dark cave at the bottom of the sea and never has a chance to run a power drill between another player's ears ever again.",1684556100,1684556100,False,133,4,0.873941600322723389,14,True,False,False

The game introduces new mechanics, creatures, and an enthralling storyline that is sure to keep players hooked from start to finish.

One of the best features of the game is the high level of immersion it provides. The game's graphics are stunning, and the icy underwater world is full of surprises and dangers that make it a real joy to explore. The game's attention to detail and its unique sense of atmosphere makes it a truly captivating experience.

Another great aspect of Subnautica Below Zero is the integration of new gameplay mechanics, such as the ability to ride on some of the game's creatures and the introduction of new vehicles. These mechanics add even more fun and variety to the already enjoyable gameplay.

The game's storyline is also a highlight, featuring a thrilling narrative that has multiple surprises in store for the players. Each new discovery and revelation is a testament to the game's excellent writing and fantastic world-building.

Moreover, the game's sound design is truly superb, with ambient noises and sound effects that perfectly capture the atmosphere of the icy underwater world. The game complements this with a mesmerising soundtrack that will leave you impressed.

In conclusion, Subnautica Below Zero is an excellent expansion to the original game that offers a challenging and enthralling underwater adventure with breathtaking graphics and an immersive atmosphere.

(+) Below Zero improves in some areas relative to the original game: better overall visuals, less glitches, way more varied environments.
(/) It preserves the stressful aspect of discovering new biomes while not being sure where danger may lurk, though the effect will likely not last as long if you already played the previous game.
(-) It overall has a much smaller variety of underwater obstacles (including enemies) and a story that often feels like an afterthought and may be hard to follow (specifically what is expected of the player).

In general, while the world is significantly smaller than in the original game, it is also more focused while attempting new things (more importantly, a few new building blocks for bases, and a new exploration feature which sees the player surviving the cold on land). After spending almost 30 hours in the game to finish all the ""quests"" at a relatively rushed pace, it doesn't feel like a DLC at all, although the first few hours may give such an impression considering how the game's foundational mechanics remain similar.

Accessibility-wise, the difficulty settings let you customize a preferred experience properly. Not necessarily being a big survival-game player myself, I chose the Freedom difficulty setting, which removes the thirst and hunger mechanics, and at the very least, I can say I didn't feel like I missed much of the game. I'd recommend the setting to people who prefer exploration over survival anytime. 

On the other hand, not unlike the previous game, the way forward is not always clear, especially during the last third of the game, where clues only appear when you happen to get very close to where you are supposed to go. The lack of a conventional mapping system, a tendency of vagueness within dialogues and logs, some specific items being surprisingly easy to miss (nickel ore for example) as well as a tendency to design very labyrinthine biomes can make progression difficult without a guide. You might at least want to follow one on the side if you absolutely don't want to do backtracking: the game has a mildly frustrating habit of halting progress by having you suddenly need to build something using resources you probably didn't think of bringing with you, considering the limited inventory space.

In summary, it expands very well on the original game, offering a more limited in size but a much more visually appealing world. In fact, if you are more into exploration games than survival/horror games, you might even prefer Below Zero. Don't be ashamed to look at a guide occasionally if you're lost, don't want to miss out on important stuff, or want to limit backtracking.

Многие пишут, что, мол, да, игра хуже, но если понравилась оригинальная Subnautica, то все равно стоит сыграть в Below Zero.
Нет, я бы сказала, что нет, оно того не стоит, и я даже жалею, что купила игру.

Я наиграла 16 получается часов, чтобы в итоге дойти до предпоследнего глубоководного биома, который в ней есть, и понять, что больше чем, что, я уже видела, я больше в игре не увижу. И это был момент глубочайшего разочарования, потому что я надеялась что вот-вот игра все-таки чем-то меня удивит.

Имхо, они разрушили все, что делало притягательной Subnautica. 
* Несмотря на то, что многие говорят, что игра стала красивее, я бы поспорила, что большинство подповерхностных биомов выглядят особенно блекло и скучно. Игра улучшила освещение, стала выглядеть чуточку ""реалистичнее"", но потеряла в в какой-то красочной стилизации. Есть, конечно, несколько биомов, штуки может быть 4-5, которые действительно выглядят сочно, но в целом игра никакая.

* Карта невероятно тесная. Я так и не нашла привлекательное место для построения большой базы. Абсолютно отсутсвует ощущение масштаба, как в оригинальной игре.

* Новый введенный транспорт - отвратительно ужасный. Seatruck, который пытается быть и Мотыльком и Циклопом с треском проваливается быть и тем и другим. Медленнее и менее маневленный, чем Мотылек, и менее функциональный и кастомизируемый, чем Циклоп. И еще он уродливый. (вы только сравните его дизайн с транспортом первой игры!). Snowfox имеет абсолютно неотзывчивое инерционное управление, и  с ним так колбасит камеру, что вообще вызывает укачивание. В итоге из юзабельного только Prawn Suite, которому еще и улучшили вертикальный подъем.

* Главная героиня - неприятная личность, которая умудряется проигрывать в харизме немому протагонисту первой игры (браво!). Типичная сильная независимая женщина без каких-либо запоминающихся черт или мотиваций, а ее разговоры с компаньоном лишь заставляют побиться головой об стол от их тупости.

* Из предыдущего пункта вытекает проблема с сюжетом, который заслуживает звание максимум функционального, но точно ничем не захватывает и не вызывает интереса. Говорить про сюжетные дыры даже не хочется.

* Атмосфера страха неизветстного - основная фишка оригинальной игры - порушена на корню и тут полностью отсутствует.

Скажу игре в плюс, что Unknown Worlds подтянули техническое состяние игры и я вроде бы не натыкалась за свои 16 наигранных часов на что-то вопиющее. Оптимизирована она тоже лучше, чем оригинальная Subnautica. Хотя проблема с подгзрузкой на глазах кажется была решена уменьшением дальности видимости, что не есть гуд и прибавляет к ощущению тесноты игры.
Итого, я не вижу реально причин тратить время и деньги на Below Zero. Лучше просто еще раз пройти Subnautica.",1684437234,1684437335,False,4,0,0.53230893611907959,0,True,False,False

Below Zero is pretty much classic Subnautica with some QoL improvements, a new story and my two least favorite elements -- setting the entire game in an arctic area, and requiring the player to spend a substantial amount of time out of the water.

Underwater gameplay is Subnautica's hallmark and it does oceanic exploration better than any game I've played. It's the primary strength of the franchise. While the Snowfox is pretty cool, surface gameplay just isn't as much fun.

Mostly you'll spend time zipping through mostly featureless arctic landscapes and trying to negotiate tight caves, which the delicate Snowfox is not well suited for. There's also an incredibly annoying bug that has the Snowfox sinking into the map, much like the Seamoth did in the original Subnautica. If you pack up your Snowfox, save the game before you redeploy it, otherwise you're going to find yourself trekking back a long distance on foot, hopping between thermal vents to stave off hypothermia.

Then there's the Cyclops, or lack of it.

While the Seatruck does have some good utility, it lacks the wow factor of the Cyclops, you can't customize the interior and two of the modules are pretty much entirely aesthetic. (The sleeper module and the aquarium, which gathers fish for your base aquariums. The sleeper does offer a small amount of additional storage space, but it's negligible.)

By removing the Cyclops the devs took away a fan favorite toy, and they also made the map more compact with a greater focus on vertical exploration instead of horizontal. While I do like some of what they've done, much of it is claustrophobic and the biomes lack the wow factor of areas like the Lost River from the first game.

If you're a Subnautica fan, you'll probably like Below Zero despite its flaws. I find I'm losing interest in the extended time spent on the surface. Here's to hoping a third game gives us a huge ocean without snow or ice, a proper submarine (perhaps the Atlas?) and the kind of biome, plant and fauna variety of the first game.",1684316197,1684316197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is so much reference to the first you need to play it.  Don't play this game and get lost.  You can get through this but the first will give you the skill you need to successfully reach the end without aiminglessly wondering.  You been warned.

The Dev's didn't give you a Subnatica sequel (Freeguy Referrence).  If I understood the story this appears to take place after the alien gun is shut down.  I found 2 or 3 wrecks which offered back story, immersion and great places to explore.  If you were expecting the game to hand everything over like it did in the first.  Your going to be disappointed.  Its hunting season.

I enjoyed the game.  I played the first and jumped instantly into this game.  I think world, challenges and change in approach kept the game feeling new.  I didn't feel like it was a remix of Subnatica.  So fear one can be removed from the list.  Lets tackle the next fear.  Did they remove the underwater aspect for land?  Yes and No.  I would say there is a bit more land mass (possibly, it was hard to judge the same) than the first but it was not a place I spent the most time.  I spent hours in my seatruck exploring unlocking, following the story.  They added new challenges I felt were fitting for changes in the game.  The flow was different but fitting.  The map size I (not positive) was smaller but they didn't waste any space which really made adventuring super fun.

I had no crashes in the game.  Adventuring was great.  Biomes were interesting and fun to explore.  They added way more stuff to make (I didn't use half of it).  Since this was not subnatica they continues on their tradition of building a world and filling it with life / history.  Just like the first exploring was really rewarding and you can see the foot prints of Alterra.  I love the fact they build off alien experience from the first.

Thank you Dev's for delivering a really cool experience.  If the rumor are true and you are in production of the next game and releasing it on unreal.  I really look forward to what you give us.

Let's just say I hope this game doesn't kill the series - Subnautica 1 was brilliant but just about every change made in this game is a downgrade. They are building on their past success but the design decisions were bad. I have replayed the first game a few times, want a third game to be made, but I will never replay this one. Issues:

-The zippy transport and strong sub you had before is replaced with a slow, clunky long vehicle which is basically a moving base instead of an exploration vehicle. Takes too long to move around, can't evade anything, gets stuck. Jack of all trades, master of nothing. I swear, I might even have liked this game if I had a seaglide, but they just deleted the damn thing.

-Huge portions of the map are on land, and there is less underwater area to explore than before. The land section is a big gimmick and has nothing to do with the rest of the game. Hey devs: this is a game about being in the ocean. 

-Scary biomes are replaced with bright and colourful biomes. They look nice, but I no longer get the same feeling of dread/terror from the first game. There are also too many parts where you enter a linear cave system with a completely different look to everything else and it feels way too 'designed'. Like I just swam into a piece of concept art instead of a natural cave system.

-Characters and voice logs are dull. No one is stranded and so everyone is just talking about penguins and shit. I hate everyone in this game, and I don't care about anything they are talking about, even if the penguins are cute.

-The story is a patchwork mess, no longer a fight for survival it is a quest to find your sister and then talk to an alien or something. The simple and primal motivation of survival works so much better in a survival game.

I enjoy the base building, which is mostly the same as before, and it is still fun to explore new places. Only worth it if you replayed the first game and just want a bit more to explore.",1683935608,1683935608,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Subnautica Below Zero is a great game in itself but can look bad when compared to its predecessor 'Subnautica' which is arguably one of the best survival games of all time. This is because it goes on a different approach in the survival genre to subnautica, where instead of having a lonely scary vibe it feels more bright and happy. This is mainly because both you and other characters in the game talk (unlike subnautica where the only character in the whole game doesnt even talk). 
I would highly reccomend this game to any past subnautica fans who would like a bit more from the series or new fans of the series who would like a (slighty) less terrifying version of the original.

Set in a frozen alien world, this standalone expansion to the original Subnautica offers a fresh and thrilling experience that builds upon its predecessor's success.

The game's visuals are breathtaking, with stunning environments that beautifully portray the icy depths and diverse marine life. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the shimmering ice formations to the intricate designs of the underwater flora and fauna. Exploring the vast and mysterious underwater biomes is a visual treat that never fails to impress.

The storyline of Subnautica: Below Zero is engaging, introducing you to an intriguing narrative filled with mysteries waiting to be unraveled. As you navigate through the chilling waters, you'll encounter a range of memorable characters and uncover the secrets of the alien world. The progression feels natural, and the game strikes a good balance between providing guidance and allowing for personal exploration.

Gameplay mechanics are solid, offering a mix of survival elements, resource gathering, crafting, and exploration. The underwater setting introduces unique challenges, such as managing oxygen levels and dealing with dangerous sea creatures. The addition of new vehicles and equipment expands the gameplay possibilities and enhances the sense of discovery.

One of the standout features of Subnautica: Below Zero is the sense of atmosphere it creates. The ambient sound design, coupled with the haunting music, immerses you in the depths of this frozen world. The moments of tension and awe blend seamlessly, leaving you with an unforgettable experience.

While the game does a fantastic job of captivating players, it is not without a few minor drawbacks. Some players may find the pacing a bit slow at times, and certain areas might feel repetitive. However, these issues are overshadowed by the overall excellence of the game and its ability to keep you engaged throughout the adventure.

Don’t let bad reviews discourage you. I found Below Zero even better than the first.
A chiller, and yet more story-driven take on the franchise. There is literally no element mentioned in the bad reviews that prevented me to have all the fun in the world.

Still plenty to explore, better QoL, interesting pace between land and sea, great ending.
At this price tag (and it’s often on sale), truly a no brainer if you enjoyed the first one and are looking for something less stressful and/or more dynamic.

Also, penguins.

Better in that you get more tech to play with and that there's new, more interesting environments to explore, worst in that the progression seems kind of... off. For example, in the whole game, there's only one Rebreather piece of tech. If you miss it, the rest of the game gets exponentially harder because you can't spend more than a few seconds outside when you go to depths below 100m. You also had more clues on where to find bases and alien facilities in the first game. In this one, the clues are very vague even when they give you a map. Then, there's the boring surface section where there's a weather event that forces you to seek shelter every 2 minutes. It is nuts!

All in all, it is an okay game and if you liked the first Subnautica and want more of the same with some questionable design decisions, then get this.

Maze-like map design that you have to go through with almost no vision due to constant storms and without any kind of guidance except your crappy compass that doesn't really do much.

They removed the original vehicles that in my opinion were the best thing about Subnautica. They were replaced by the Seatruck, a modular vehicle that again... doesn't give you any sort of guidance. The only tool you can use for underwater navigation is your Pathfinder tool or Seaglider and for that you need to keep exiting your vehicle in order to check your position. 

So yea... if you enjoyed Subnautica 1 expect a lot of disappointment from this one. It's still fun but mostly annoying.

[hr][/hr]
I enjoyed playing this game thoroughly. From the very beginning to the very end, it was just like diving into the known gameplay of Subnautica enriched by new environments and things to do! It really sucked me right in and I could not stop thinking about this game [i](to my boo's annoyance lol!)[/i].

I did however find certain bits of the game frustrating. (TL:DR – There are annoying bits in the game, but it’s still FLIPPIN GOOD, and you better go get it and cherish it <3)

Cons:

[spoiler]- Operating Snowfox was difficult. I think I would've enjoyed the on-land bits of the game more if Snowfox was easier to manage.

- No Cyclops broke my heart. I loooved operating Cyclops in the first Subnautica game and sneaking around with the silent mode running and freaking out because it was draining my power cells like crazy, but I had to get past this leviathan in the cavern! Seatruck was excellent idea with the mix-and-match solutions, but I found operating it a bit more annoying and it did not leave any possibility really to sneak past all the aggressive fauna. Just running through everything on high speed because there is no other way for one to do it was certainly less enjoyable to me. I missed the planning, the sneaking...

- I think the aggressive fauna sounds were a bit overdone. Every time I was out the sounds the varied sharks made were [i]freaky[/i], but... At some point, and quite soon at that, they became too much. I got used to them to the point when an actual leviathan was nearby screaming, I would just ignore it because I got so used to the freaky sounds of much more common aggressive creatures. Imho having too much freaky sounds in the game diminished the very specific fright of encountering one of the truly scary things out there.

- Sometimes I was feeling very lost in the game and what am I supposed to do. It might be me missing some important bits and clues in the gameplay, but I think the first game had much more guidance to let you know where to go next if you want to progress the story. In Below Zero sometimes I would sit in my base and just google things on my phone because I had no clue what to do next. But again, that could just be me, I'm not the sharpest bulb in the shed.[/spoiler]

[i]And yet...[/i]

[spoiler]- I was absolutely captivated by the story. Learning what happened to my sis, learning the dealio with the frozen leviathan, learning all the corp bullshit! Putting all the pieces together was awesome! <3

- Spy Pengling will forever have a place in my heart <3 And its lil dialogs <3

- Al-An! OMG Al-An! I'll forever be simping for Al-An, especially after learning their story and their vulnerability, their desire to put things right. My babe <3

- Marguerit! When I first time heard her voice, I was simply gobsmacked, and then when I actually met her out there, I was squeeling like a teenage fangirl! I loved her from the PDA recordings in the first game, and I loved her in Below Zero <3

- Jukebox <3

- New plants <3

- Playing a character that actually talks <3

- Freaky alien shit <3

- Sea monkeys <3[/spoiler]",1683623616,1683623616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It seemed to be taking things in a slightly new direction but still had elements from the first game that make it so fun. Slowly as you keep playing though, the problems start to seep in. The story is the biggest downfall of this game. There are so many contradictions in the story it isn't even funny. Not only that but the motivations and logic behind the actions of the characters in this game are slightly silly at best and laughably bad for the worst examples. One of biggest missteps this game takes is being way to hand-holdy. I want to explore and see what the game has to offer but it feels like every time I reach a new biome I'm told ""There is something important here go look!"". It totally ruins the feeling of uncovering something and just turns into a guided tour that it really didn't have to be. Initially I appreciated some of the dialog but quickly it got old how often it would pop up and tell me something that I could have figured out on my own. I'm glad they added some cool new base parts and tried out some new vehicles. However apart from a few new things,  some basic quality of life problems still remain in the game. The palpable tension and atmosphere from the first game are greatly diminished. If you are coming into this game fresh, and haven't played the first one, it will probably be a decent experience as it is still better then many survival games out there. However, I would generally say give it a pass and just play the first game. It is a much better game in so many ways. They both have problems but in Below Zero almost every new addition feels like 1 step forward and 3 steps back. It hurts to write this because Subnautica is so close to my heart.

Having a smaller map and more populated world in both fauna and flora reduced the grinding that it took to build up a base I could feel very happy returning to time and time again. It made hopping on for a few short hours very rewarding because I could progress a significant amount forward without feeling like it was being handed to me. I enjoyed the new cold mechanic too, if you want to play the old game, its still on steam no one is stopping you from returning to it. I hope the team continue trying new things on future installments and building upon this rich universe. 

Personally I loved the story! The architect design and animation was absolutely stunning and made for a very satisfying progression. I say this by allowing Below Zero to be it's own enjoyable experience and not comparing it to the first game. If you are limited on time and want a concentrated version of Subnautica this is for you! if not the original continues to be updated and the game is a phenomenal experience.",1683484392,1683484392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After playing Subnautica 1 for more than 50+ hours, I wanted to give a go. Still, I have waited for 2 years, before buying so that bugfixes could be made, etc.

And after playing it a bit, I just wanted to end it. I don't think I will ever finish it, because well it's just not fun to me anymore.

Let's starts with some pros:

-There were some visual updates compared to Subnautica 1, the materials look better, the Prawn Suit sounds nice, some quality of life improvements as well. 
-At it's core, it's a Subnautica game, so if you enjoyed harversting resources to build ultimate base, you will find it here as well.
-Sound design is splendid, they really made it work, though some things sound worse in my opinion (PDA especially).

Now for the cons:

-It's small, like really really small all things considered. Half of the map are glaciers that you can barely explore and in fact, you don't want to explore anyway. There is almost nothing on them anyway.
-Seatruck is the worst qualities of Seamoth and Cyclops combined. It's slow, slugish, cumbersome to use, limited space. The devs wanted to push the player into making 5 different bases in different areas of the game, it seems. It didn't work. In fact, I just traversed everywhere with Prawn Suit, never used the snowfox thing and did fine. I made one base just to have space for my stuff. 
-There are too many crevices, tunnels and such. The devs wanted the game to feel claustrophobic, but it really doesn't fit with the game. I could understand some areas being like that, but more than 90% of the game is limited visibility, tunnels, crewices, etc. 
-The plot is... bad. I have heard there were troubles during development, but I wasn't really interested in either Alan, Robin or her sister. It feels inorganic and the constant talking quickly starts grating on the ears. You are supposed to feel alone and afraid, that's what made the orginal good. Not having some conversations with alien that lead to nowhere.
-I simply didn't find it fun. 

TLDR:

If you have never played Subnautica before, you could start with it. Otherwise, you just play the original.",1683390690,1683390690,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Some of the story elements were very interesting, but one story route was extremely disappointing, and the other, while alright, was extremely frustrating to finish. Allow me to elaborate.

This game's map compared to the first game is much less coherent in design; almost every biome feels like a spiderweb of caves that all look fairly uniform. Trying to find a single story-crucial element when you are given no clues to some of their locations is infuriating. Wound up looking up guides to 2 of the 3 required scans for completing the story. It basically comes down to whether or not you were lucky enough to notice fairly well-hidden entrances to caves nestled in certain biomes.

Non-leviathan wildlife is very vibrant and beautiful; definitely some cooler designs than the first. That said, the leviathans are far less unnerving than they were in the first game. I found them to be less terrifying and more mildly annoying to deal with.

Prawn is back which is nice, and it moves a little faster. Seamoth has been traded in for the Seatruck. It seems like a cool idea at first until you feel how slow and clunky it is. Even with the horsepower mod, it feels so sluggish. Not to mention it's large size paired with the tight cave map design makes navigation a patience-testing headache.

If you enjoyed the first game, I'd still say this is worth a play. Just don't be ashamed to look up a guide for storyline item locations.",1683334649,1683334649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It only really falls behind when compared to the first. The storytelling is also much more blatant and creates weird contradictions to lore that was set up in the first game. No shade on the voice actors though, they do an excellent job with what they've been given but it's clear the story was patched together from disparate ideas without stepping back to see what the whole looks like. 

As it stands it's a good game but just make sure you play the original first.

I would give ""Subnautica Below Zero"" a strong 4.5 out of 5. While the game has some minor performance issues and a steep learning curve, its stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and intriguing storyline make it a standout title in the survival adventure genre.

The sense of awe and beauty when you first step out of the lifepod has stuck with me even some years since I last played it, given, that feeling is hard to replicate. 

Below Zero also just seemed so much duller in color than the original, maybe because it was set in an arctic region, rather than coastal/equatorial region like the first one. Exploration also felt like I was just trying to find objectives and that's that, there were almost no other reward for exploring, not even the beauty in the landscape and the few jukebox songs don't make up for it.

Vehicle-wise, the seatruck is just the seamoth, and I loved the seamoth, with the ability to add compartments to it. The Snowfox was never used except for as I was finishing the game and used it to get the achievement and nearly destroyed it with how bad it handles. Prawnsuit is prawnsuit, not really any changes there. Luckily, there wasn't anything like the cyclops in the first game, for one there is very few areas that it would be useful in, and two, I just didn't like the cyclops.

There were also a few times where I wasted hours trying to find a single item to progress the story, at least there's always YouTube. Never did find all the Seatruck's fabricator or storage module parts though, i didn't find any storage module blueprints come to think of it...

BUT Protagonist can be iritating, also way how story is delivered is just lacking mistery stuff you had in first one. In first Subnautica you had point to survive, and remove virus. Here you get heroic quest to save sister. Considering that story has been redone from middle of development... they really coud do better job.
Also I really can not understand why they had to change PDA voice one in first one was on spot.
Map is smaller then first Subnautica plus you get solid ammount of doing stuff on land where you have to take care of getting cold.
Which in my opinion loses point on being ""sub"" (under) ""nautica"" (sea / ocean) 

In general if you loved first one get this one on discount.
If you are entering in subnautica world first time..... 
Get first one it is much bigger, better and MUCH more immersive and atmospheric.
I do not get it how game developers that games are played for escapism most popular games are ones where main character is mute or barely say a thing (doom guy, dark souls loads of other games with mute characters) When main character does speak he really has to have good charisma and personality and here that is not the case.",1621540237,1683058936,True,0,0,0.451127827167510986,0,True,False,False

Story is nice, voice acting while kinda ruins game-play a bit is done pretty well, and the biomes are thought with the twisty bridges apparently being a scrapped one for the original game.

It's really unfortunate, because a lot of the game is fun; but I just absolutely cannot bring myself to complete it. 

The early game is pretty good, maybe not quite as good as the original, but still fun. If you're coming from Subnautica, you'll be swimming, scanning, and constructing in no time (I guess even if you haven't played the first game you'll be doing those things pretty quickly because that's basically the game). There are some QoL upgrades, as well as some original items that were cut that I hope they bring back in the 3rd game (I loved the med kit fabricator. If you don't give us one to start with, please let us build one. Pretty please with a cherry on top).

The map is smaller than the first game, both in terms of lateral area and depth. I have two main grievances with this: first, there are some sections of the map that are barren. Unfortunately, the map feels too small (IMO) for any area to be so sparse. Secondly, and my chief complaint with the game in general, is the amount of time I have to spend on land.

In the first Subnautica I thought this was handled pretty well. Even though it was perhaps a bit clunky to be on foot, you did so in smaller, bite-sized chunks. In Below Zero, not only do you spend longer periods on land, but you also have to contend with a temperature gauge. If you get too cold you'll have to find shelter, bring (specifically) warm food or a thermos, or find heat plants. I don't really care for that mechanic, but it would be tolerable if the above ground areas weren't mazes where you can just get lost for 30 minutes or so. To end this section, I will add that in 4 or so attempted play throughs, I never acquired enough material to make the cold suit. I don't know if that's my fault or not.

The Seatruck feels a bit like a missed opportunity. It was fun to have a bunch of modules on it, but those slow it down considerably and the upgrade to help offset that penalty doesn't help enough. By the end of my last game, I had disconnected all the modules and was driving around with just the cockpit.

The base building is a lot of fun. I don't know if I just understood it better this time around, or if the mechanics themselves were refined since the first game, but it seemed less finicky in BZ. There were also some nice glass dome/roof additions, as well as a jukebox.

Most of the biomes look really good, and the story seemed pretty interesting, unfortunately I just can't bring myself to complete the land-based portion of the game.",1665615297,1683044248,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are certainly different elements, as some other reviews have mentioned, such as increased character dialogue and story beats being delivered narratively rather than through PDAs that you might just happen upon.  I don't really consider these changes good or bad, as every player has different preferences for story consumption. I personally like the way the story is delivered in both games.  

Overall, I think if you're brand new to Subnautica, play the first one first. If you're a returning fan, this is a fun and nostalgic romp through the underwater chasms and (now) above ground icy terrain of plant 4546b.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!

Prior to release of ""new"" story (2020ish?) this game was better than the first. The new story for below zero is bland, and feels like a rehash of the first game, compared to the story line before the change. Prior to the story change, which in fairness was not finished yet, dialogue was missing, etc, i truly felt this game was better than the first. 

You start in the base, avalanche wipes out the base, and you communicate with the space station. You can watch as the space station shoots down supply caches, watch them parachute down, then you find Allen, have to send DNA sample to station and hide his presence, while communicating with your sister. The station ends up blowing up, and its been long enough i no longer recall the rest of the story, if it went any farther at the time.

I bought this game the day it came out. And looking back, ive got about 40 hours, and it's kinda lame compared to the first.

Does the story really matter that much? i dunno, not really. But after playing the orignal story, all i think of when i launch this is how much better it was, and i end up playing the first one.

It's a messed up mix of good and bad, and doesn't really hit the marks what made the first game one of the best games ever.

Cohesion is missing, instead it's a mixed bag from the start:

- Resource availability is not enough of a problem, and they're not limited enough to certain 
  biomes. On the other hand finding certain blueprints is oddly specific.

- Map is too small which leads to cramped overly detailed biomes, and makes searching them time consuming because every monkey nest surrounding looks just like the last one.

^ Both of these combined leads to not even thinking about building multiple bases, because base is always short drive back without any real threat and is less time consuming.

- There are new toys, but they're mostly iteration which tend to make older things obsolete 
  (truck>rest, salad>rest, large_room>multipurpose).

- Enemies might make noises but they don't really pack the punch to care about them, which 
  is of course sad more than anything. 

There's way more things to list, but let's just say things just don't align right.

So I took a look what happened. It started as a DLC. Main writer dropped out, and three more came along. Story was written over and over again. Main director apparently took off to another project as well at some point. It makes sense why the game is what it is.

It's okay I guess, but at a same time disappointing. Subnautica seemed to have a clear design goal all along, but for this one it didn't work out so well. They started with something smaller, which couldn't be made to more than what it is with limited time schedule. That's why I feel like they did their best anyway with what they had in their hands, it was just kind of cursed from the get-go to be regarded as a whole new game in the series.

I hope next Subnautica goes back to it's core what made it great, and all of the unnecessary story/character-driven dialogue nonsense what happened here is left to history. Clean slate, back to the roots, and make it even greater than it was.",1665761760,1682606385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the moment you enter the frigid waters of this alien world, you are immediately drawn into its icy embrace and the mysteries that lie within.

One of the most impressive aspects of Below Zero is the attention to detail in the game's environment. The underwater world is teeming with life, from the adorable penguins and majestic sea creatures to the dangerous predators that lurk in the shadows. The game's graphics are truly breathtaking, and the sound design is equally impressive, with the eerie sounds of the ocean and the creaking ice adding an extra layer of tension and atmosphere to the game.

The gameplay itself is both challenging and rewarding. The crafting system has been expanded, allowing players to create new tools and vehicles to aid in their exploration. The survival mechanics have also been refined, with new dangers such as hypothermia and blizzards adding an extra layer of challenge to the game. However, the sense of progression is incredibly satisfying, and as you unlock new technologies and explore deeper into the icy depths, you feel a sense of accomplishment that is hard to match.

But perhaps the best aspect of Below Zero is its story. The game slowly reveals the secrets of the frozen world and the reasons for the player's presence there, and the plot twists and turns in unexpected and satisfying ways. The characters you encounter are well-written and memorable, and the emotional moments in the game are incredibly powerful.

Overall, Subnautica: Below Zero is a true masterpiece that deserves all the awards it has received and more. It's a must-play for anyone who loves exploration, crafting, and storytelling in their games, and it's sure to keep you hooked for hours on end.

i completed subnut in about 45 hrs. it lacked some polish but was totally sick. i love ocean horror but its a rare setting (dagon/cthulhu dont count in the way a hotdog isnt a sandwich).

in below zero, polish and QOL improvements and cool new creatures and biomes are added, and more story is good.

yet it manages to feel smaller and lacks the creepy survival horror aspect of the original. base building is still underwhelming from a ""do it for fun"" perspective and multiple bases feel less necessary than in 1. also, mc is insufferable and never shuts her mouth. i wish we were playing her sister instead or were silent. on land segments seemed cool at first but became a slog.

I enjoyed the story more than the original but was constantly getting lost on what to do next because I would be told to go somewhere that is in an approximate area.

I am usually not the kind of person that really cares all that much about plot holes. So when I saw most complain about that, I was still open minded and gave it a try.

The plot holes are pretty big though and get annoying fast. The characters are not likeable at all. You play as Robin who goes to 4546B to find out more about her sister, and she brings.... nothing. Not even the blueprint for better water? What? The sister jumps to conclusions and the other two characters are narcissist, which for one of them is very odd. In the end, you're left with the same questions you had midway through, none of them answered.

The game kind of feels empty, even though it's cramped because it's so much smaller. But to me it feels like the bulb biome. There was life there, but you only had to be there for like 3 things, a lifepod, a wreck and a cave. And the whole game is kind of like that, there is just not enough to do there to go on a full exploration. Everything is bountiful and pretty easy to find, which also makes it pretty boring. The animals have to look arctic, and thus look boring as well. Even predators don't do as much damage, so I actually laughed at one when it attacked me outside of the Seatruck and did like 30 damage to the player.

The worst thing is though, bugs are pretty plentiful, especially around the vehicles. The snow fox deploys under the snow all the time, if you even manage to drive the thing. The Seatruck has weird hit boxes, but thankfully, a wholly unrealistic turning circle. I don't think it's as bad as some reviews state though, it's not my precious Seamoth, but I am sort of fond of it now. Except the storage capabilities.

But those above ground areas with snow? Oh man, boring mazes you never seem to get around in normally. Pretty awful. The game also switches between holding your hand tight to guide you, to figure it out on your own! Nothing in between. From go here, coordinates; to go a km east to an iceberg, in a sea of icebergs that each take an in-game day to search. I have not looked up anything for progression of the first game, and for Below Zero I had to look up several locations just because the instructions are so unclear. There's something below here.... really? There's apparently 3, but I didn't go looking for the other 2 after I had found the first!

So play it, but buy it on sale. Not that it's not worth the price compared to other games, it's just not worth it compared to the first. I managed to put 150+ hours into the first one without too much frustration (only couldn't find those juvenile sea emperors after hatching which led to frustration), whereas Below Zero, I managed to get to almost 50 hours, but was annoyed for like 10 of them.

When I was playing the game, I was telling literally every single person ""don't buy this game"" ""this shit sucks"" ""i hate this game"" and other such comments.

However, I've replayed this game 4 separate times and beaten it 3 times on Hardcore. I still sometimes find myself staring at it's steam page wanting to dive back in. 

I think it's because Below Zero has so much potential on the outside. This game is gorgeous and in many ways trumps the original product in terms of interesting biomes. The environments are fresh, ever-engaging, and constantly pushing you to explore the numerous hand-crafted nooks and crannies which may hold some artifacts left behind by the precursors. At the same time, the enemies look ferocious and upon first glance inspire fear in the player. They can't ever re-capture the same feeling as the Reaper from the first game, but when I first played I was pretty scared of the Reaper equivalent in this one.

The biggest draw is the sound design. I hate the sound on the predators. The roars are repetitive, annoying, and don't inspire any fear. The cryptosuchus (the most annoying enemy in the game) runs at you like a flailing puppy, with no grace or elegance. To top it off, they don't actually kill you in any situation at full health: not even the gargantuan leviathans will one-shot you if you are at max health. The enemies in this game do not feel scary enough to warrant complete avoidance. The same could be said for Subnautica, but it feels especially worse in this version: the Reaper and Sea Dragon leviathans respectively were imposing and terrifying, but all sea leviathans in this game pale in comparison to these threats. 

The redeeming factor for me is the surface section. This area is surprisingly well-designed for what I expected and the two separate areas feel distinct even with similar surroundings. Like dipping your toes into a pool, the game encourages exploring the less dangerous surface areas to get an understanding (and preparation) for the scariest and most dangerous section in the game: the Arctic Spires. [spoiler] The Ice Worm is terrifying. The music, the sound design, the inability to actually see the threat and the unknown attack patterns make venturing into this area absolutely horrifying. To top it all off, they are able to one-shot your character: which in hardcore mode spells a restart.[/spoiler] For non-spoiler folk, the Arctic Spires is the most dangeous section in the game and made me feel truly in danger when I was playing. I played in hardcore on both games and this section is probably the only area that I still get creeped out in. It's pretty much the tipping point for why I can recommend this game, and it's something I highly recommend you go in blind. 

Below Zero's story is pathetic and its because they rushed it out. There was a lot of potential here but it's never going to find the light of day and thats that. Do go in for the micro-stories: they put a great deal of effort into the VA for many of the characters and if you ignore the two protagonists really one-sided banter on human life, you will find some truly interesting dialogue in the abandoned sector zero.

Is this game good? I guess. Should you buy it? No, not at full price. Is it worth your time? If you're afraid of the sea and willing to restart in hardcore mode, absolutely. Survival mode siphons a massive amount of tension and fear which Subnautica thrives off of. The game feels richer, more alive and more terrifying when you understand one false turn can spell death and a permanent game over. If you play Subnautica, even the base game, please consider trying it on hardcore. You'll spend significantly more time playing the game, but the experience is well worth it.",1682019632,1682270318,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Subnautica stood apart from other survival games by serving up a vast and myriad, alien environment to explore. A no-brainer for the genre!  Biomes were memorable. Everything was just a little bit scary (and very rarely a lot scary). Climbing the tech tree was empowering. The plot was sparse, but effective at driving curiosity.

In Below Zero, Unknown Worlds doubles down on the plot & characters, which is bad, because they are boring. Even worse, it doubles down on above-ground areas, which remain janky. I have never had less fun piloting a hover bike in a videogame. The tech tree is virtually identical to the first game’s, so that avenue of discovery is gone.

There’s some cool new content. Most significantly, almost every creature is brand-new. And, your late-game chariot, the Seatruck, is fun to pilot, though it still feels like a poor substitute for the first game’s Cyclops.

The ideal player will have played Subnautica years ago, and will remember it fondly but hazily. That’s how I went into this, and I enjoyed it well enough. But really, there’s not much new here. This game isn’t bad, but suffers a lot for having come after the first. You’re still collecting hella rocks. By the time I reached the disappointing conclusion, I wasn’t willing to bag another copper to save my life. I’m still eager to see what Unknown Worlds does next, but if it’s another Subnautica, I’ll pass.",1682047332,1682047332,False,16,0,0.623260259628295898,0,True,False,False

I should note that the creativity of the design team always amazes me! There are many interesting flora and fauna in this game just as in its predecessor plus some nice alien visual design.

They way they balanced resource collection in this one is a little more bizarre and leads to major stagnation a little over halfway through the game. Whether you care about finishing the main quest or not heavily dictates your enjoyment of this game. 
The story itself seems to be based on a problem that was already solved in the other game though which is... interesting. Then it moves on while teasing a twist and then not delivering a surprise.

Much of the design philosophy of this game seems to be ""Let us do a complete 180 from the other game!"". Unknown worlds do this at their own detriment as the story becomes flawed, the map and pacing of player movement becomes unsatisfying, the progression is bizarre, and the atmosphere is ruined. 

If you want a quick gist of this game you just need to look at the substantial LAND segment of this game called Subnautica. The game wasn't built for it (uncanny animation and movement), the vehicles feel wrong or are literally wrong (broken or unnaturally slow), the map is either too sparse and big or too cramped ultimately amounting to a noticeably small amount of content (which they tried to cover up by making vehicles slow and sluggish to control) and the land leviathan is handled so poorly atmospherically and gameplay wise they manage to make it an annoyance instead of an alien horror.

If you just want to build bases and collect resources this game is fine. But, it's not innovative, nor does it have the same amazing scale AND map design of the first.

Big tip if you do buy this game: just use the Prawn Suit everywhere. On land (while using grappling hook w/ jumping) it can travel 5x faster than the Space Balls speeder bike while completely circumventing the annoying-ass leviathan showing up every 20 seconds. In the ocean it feels better to control than the truck and moves the same speed or faster with skilled movement.",1682026332,1682045323,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have to give it a thumbs down because the game froze while saving and I lost 30 hours of progress (damaged save file).  For some reason, steam cloud saves are disabled for S:BZ and there's no option to have multiple save slots for a single character.  Why not allow this simple feature that almost all games have??

I also greatly enjoyed the increased options to make your base feel lived in with posters, pictures, items, and even bed spreads

Some nitpicks I have are:
   - Prawn suit wasn't as essential and did not use it.
   - Less leviathan encounters (at least that's how my run went)
   - Because the game has a set character and a clear storyline, it may take away from the personal self 
      immersion and the fear of being alone, stranded, and isolated
   - Others may not like the reduced size of the map & inclusion of more on-land exploration than the 
      previous game.
   - There are a lot of tight areas to navigate making exploration with the sea truck very challenging at times.
   - Stumbled upon a lot of the blueprints and structures really quickly.

Regardless of my negative review, I still played through all of it, though that might simply have been me hoping that things would improve at some point in the game.

It's a shame that Below Zero needs to be held up to a standard that the original Subnautica set, as it falls short.

Below Zero is a lighthearted take on the atmosphere created in the original.  Exposition is mostly posited through cheesy, mostly forgettable dialog (I listened to every dialog entry but if you asked me, I couldn't tell you what actually happened to Sam).  

The lightheartedness impacts the difficulty of the game as well.  When you come across a hazardous creature, even the leviathans, you're not really too bothered by them, you'll likely find yourself turning to face them just to get the encounter over with.

Instead, the difficulty now comes in the form of inconvenience.  Everything outside of exploring is boring and frustrating to deal with.  Everything you do takes up unnecessary time and requires absurd amounts of clicking:
- Inventory management?  Lots of clicking.
- Need to find food?  Let's play fishy-clicker.
- Crafting something?  Click through the clunky crafting menu.

Lastly, let's not forget this is ""Subnautica"" but a large part of (and the most frustrating part of) exploration occurs above ground on a frozen wasteland where you can more often than not see anything due to a snowstorm so it's likely you've been walking in circles because there are no recognisable landmarks that you can see, and the few you can see look alike.

In short, I can't recommend this to anyone.
If you've played the original and are hoping to revisit the magic that it sparked, this won't do it.
If you haven't played the original, I recommend that instead.",1681676370,1681676409,False,17,1,0.60022890567779541,0,True,False,False

1) Красивая. Как и первая часть, игра изобилует красивыми видами подводной жизни, различными биомами с красочной растительностью, игрой света в воде и т.п. Лично я получал огромное удовольствие просто плавая бесцельно и рассматривая окружающий подводный мир.
2) Интересный сюжет. И хотя обычно я не большой любитель сюжетов, длинных детальных историй и простыней текстов. Но в данном случае сюжет был действительно неплохим. И хотелось узнать, чем история закончится.
3) Крафт и количество предметов для крафта как-будто бы стали лучше и богаче. Или мне так показалось по крайней мере. Появились предметы для улучшения качества игрового процесса, вроде телепорта, например. 
4) Атмосферная. Окружение, звуки, дизайн игры - все это создает приятную атмосферу моря и sci-fi.
5) Относительно нетребовательная к ресурсам ПК

Теперь о минусах, которых хватает.
1) Игра глючная. Но не критически. Играбельность, как правило, не нарушается, но периодически сильно бесит. Рыбы могут ""вплыть"" на базу сквозь стену. Звуки воды иногда не сразу пропадают после всплытия персонажа над поверхностью воды. Но самые раздражающие баги, которые возникают при перемещении пешком. Я несколько раз застрял намертво на стыке двух модулей транспорта Seatruck. А при беготне по суше такие проблемы будут преследовать вас постоянно. Куст, неудачно лежащий камень или кусок ресурса, раздвижной мост, мебель, двери или даже тупо какие-нибудь стыки склонов - все это места, где можно застрять причем наглухо. Разработчики настолько забили на какое-то системное решение этой проблемы, что подобное встречается вообще везде, на любых поверхностях, любых локациях, включая модули вашей родной базы. Причем с застреванием все настолько порой плохо, что разработчики вынесли функцию unstuck в главное меню игры (!!!). Насколько я помню, такие проблемы были и в оригинальной части игры, но там это не так бросалось в глаза, как тут поскольку там перемещение по поверхности было довольно редким явлением (не считая базы). А в этой части ходить ногами надо настолько много, что это стало в моем списке минусов отдельным пунктом 
2) Количество суши и необходимость перемещаться по ней. Вообще, покупая игру с названием Subnautica ожидаешь, что ключевой механикой игры будет плавание. И так и было в первой части, но не в этой. Тут несколько островов, причем один из них настолько большой и с настолько запутанной системой лабиринтов, локаций, пещер и коридоров, что это довольно быстро начинает утомлять, а потом и бесить. Добавьте к этому классическое для серии отсутствие карты у персонажа, а также застревания из пункта 1, и получите примерное представление о проблеме. Причем суша, как правило, неинтересная, однообразная, ее не хочется исследовать, а наоборот побыстрее закончить тут все дела и свалить обратно в воду. Непонятно зачем разработчики сделали такие огромные расстояния по суше с такими запутанными переходами, но в какой-то момент они, видимо, решили, что не помешает транспорт для суши и добавили в игру Snow Fox. Но у данного транспорта крайне неудобное управление и довольно странная реакция транспорта на это самое управление. Плюс к этому на него распространяются и проблемы с застреванием. А еще разнообразные торчащие кусты, камни и ресурсы повреждают этот транспорт и приходится периодически (слишком, слишком часто) слезать с него и чинить. Могу сказать также, что транспорт получился настолько неудачным, что я предпочитал в итоге бегать пешком по этим огромным просторам, чем пользоваться им
3) Отсутствие карты. В первой части игры это тоже раздражало, но там можно было списать это на атмосферность игры или какую-то особую фишку. И в целом в первой части это не особо мешало жить. Но в Below Zero имеется огромное количество суши, где отсутствие карты уже создает проблемы. И возникает странность, что у главного героя есть разнообразные футуристические штуки вроде фабрикатора, дронов-строителей или телепорта, но нет банальной карты с GPS.
4) Левиафан и разные глубоководные твари обмельчали. В первой части страшные воющие звуки из темных глубин наводили ужас. После доброжелательного и уютного мелководья с разноцветными рыбками, жуткие звуки глубин пугали и интриговали одновременно. Здесь же эти обитатели воды расставлены на каждом шагу и скорее раздражают, а не пугают. А глубины и вовсе уже не темные и не пугающие и совсем уже и не глубины. 
5) Сам игровой мир уменьшился и глубины стали мельче. Причем довольно заметно. Максимальная глубина, на которую я опускался в процессе игры что-то вроде 850 метров. Сама карта явно стала сильно меньше. Вплоть до того, что в какой-то момент начинаешь ощущать тесноту, а не безбрежность планеты-океана.
6) Из-за меньших глубин и меньшей карты из игры пропала подводная лодка. Ей на замену пришел подводный грузовик, который на свое усмотрение можно собрать из нужных модулей. Идея в целом неплохая с таким модульным транспортом, но лучше было бы иметь и подводную лодку тоже. В первой части игры немалую долю от ощущения игрового процесса у меня занимали путешествия на этой подводной лодке, периодические заплывы в опасные неизведаные глубины из нее и потом возвращение из опасности обратно на борт уютной и родной уже лодки. А подводный грузовик в силу своих небольших размеров не дает такого ощущения уюта плавучей большой безопасной базы, как подводная лодка из первой части игры.

Вообще по совокупности ощущений и фактов, это вовсе не вторая часть игры, а скорее DLC. Тут не так много новых механик и фишек по сравнению с оригинальной частью, а общий объем контента не тянет на полноценную часть.

Надеюсь, что разработчики в итоге решатся на новую часть игры, учтут свои ошибки и недоработки, сделают новую часть с намного большей картой, намного большими глубинами и еще большим разнообразием флоры и фауны. У игровой серии имеется отличный потенциал и, будем надеяться, разработчики его не упустят.

Если подводить итог, то я скажу, что игра все же несмотря на свои минусы, мне скорее понравилась, чем нет. Да, было много моментов, когда игра начинала раздражать, но бросить ее и удалить желания не возникало. Если же оценивать по 10-балльной шкале, то игра с трудом, но набирает 7 из 10. Однако я могу точно сказать, что возвращаться еще раз к Below Zero я не буду. В отличие от оригинальной части, которую с удовольствием перепройду еще не раз.",1681674231,1681674231,True,0,0,0.480436235666275024,0,True,False,False

There's many things I dislike but also many good ideas thrown around. Whether their execution was good will depend on what YOU like the most about Subnautica. Definitely recomend it for anyone who liked how the first one played and wouldn't mind trying a somewhat scaled-down sequel. Just go in knowing one thing: the fear factor is mostly gone.

Long ramble, here we go:
I loved the first Subnautica to bits. It's one of my favorite games and an experience I'll never forget.
Before starting this game I heard somewhat mixed opinions on it, so I came to it cautiously optimistic.
The formula is the same as the first game, which is to be expected, so I still had a good time with it. However, something in this game didn't feel right.

Below Zero was... tame. Exploring new interesting-looking places was still fun and had many visually stunning locations, but... that's it. The places were cool, but the sense of apprehension before going out in the open it's completely gone. I know that feeling kind of dissipated after a bit even in the first game, but my mild thalassophobia kept things fresh 'till the very end in there. Here this feeling disappeared after the first 30m and only ever came back at the very end because of a specific big boy.

The vast open areas that unnerved me so much in the first game also disappeared in favor of more compact locations, fitting for the smaller scale of the map and the new Seatruck. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed at that, since it got rid of the fear factor almost completely for me, which was a bummer, I loved that.
Also, I like the Seatruck, but it doesn't replace the Seamoth for me and I really wish they kept it in.

The leviathans, quite honestly, suck. I still fear the Reaper even after finishing the first game, but nothing in this game comes even close, they're really underwhelming even on your first encounter. The last one you'll most likely meet is the only one that felt right and I genuinely liked, but alas, didn't hang around for too long. Leviathan placement also seems really bad for some reason. In the first game they were positioned strategically so you would end up finding one around points of interest, while here I only saw a Chelicerate, for example, twice in the whole game. Both times being the same one and purely by accident since I deviated from the direction I needed to go. Never saw it again since I never had a reason to go to that place. It's funny since in a biome close-by there were Squidsharks (not leviathans but big boys nonetheless) smacked around everywhere and I couldn't stand seeing them anymore. Any hostile creature is also one easily-obtainable upgrade away from being stripped of any threat, which is a bummer. 

And lastly, the land portions were horrendous, which I was already expecting in a game focused on underwater exploration, but the Arctic Spires was... something else entirely. I hated every single moment I had to spend in that incredibly bland-looking place and had the worst time possible, and while some appreciated the challenge, that's not the kind of challenge I play Subnautica for. Also, the Ice Worms look cool but are just a terrible gimmicky annoyance at best and a waste of potential.

After so many complains my view of the game may seem quite negative, but alas, not really. I still enjoyed the game. It's just a shame how inferior it was when compared to the first one. However it was still fun, the biomes had cool visuals you could always enjoy since there was no constant feeling of danger (minus the land parts), the progression has little to no handholding, which is quite rewarding and one of the reasons I love Subnautica, the many quality-of-life implementations were a big plus and overall, it was still a good experience, it just didn't focus on the things that I, personally, would like to see in a sequel.
I would still recommend it for anyone who liked how the first one played and wouldn't mind trying a somewhat scaled-down sequel, since the things that bummed me out on this one may not affect your experience at all and, honestly, I would love for people to have a great time with this game, as it's still Subnautica.",1677462726,1681656959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

a) YES, ENJOYED IT >>> You will probably enjoy Below Zero.
b) YES, DID NOT ENJOY IT >>> You will probably not enjoy Below Zero.
c) NO >>> Go play Subnautica first.

*VERY MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW*

For those who enjoyed the first Subnautica and are wondering if Below Zero is worth playing, the underwater sections and overall survival/exploration/crafting gameplay loop are very similar to the first game, and still very fun. Here are the main points of difference:
THE GOOD
+ More story, tighter character focus, expanded lore.
+ New base components allow for larger rooms (which have now also been back-ported into the first game).
+ New soundtrack, music still great.
+ Even more spectacular weather effects and sky than the first game.
+ You can build a snowman.

THE NEUTRAL
* The protagonist now talks, and has a backstory and relationships with other characters. She's a pretty well-drawn character, but could also understand if people preferred the silent blank slate that was the first game's protagonist.
* Smaller game world, though honestly I wasn't too bothered by this. Still felt big enough for the story with plenty to see and explore. I'm a bit of a dawdler and it took me 53 hours to finish on the first run-through (built two full bases), so still good value.
* The Seamoth and Cyclops have been replaced by the modular Seatruck. I think this was actually a good move for balance, since being able to build within the Cyclops in the first game made it somewhat overpowered. It may annoy you, though.
* Not as scary as the first game. Up to you whether that's a good thing, though I missed the tension.

THE BAD
- Greatly expanded on-land sections. I guess it's nice the devs tried something different but it does not play to the strengths of the rest of the game either visually or gameplay-wise. Navigating through large expanses of snowy canyons is just not as fun or pretty as the underwater environment. The speeder bike-esque Snowfox looks cool, but it's buggy and doesn't feel quite right to drive. You're better off using the Prawn Suit on land. Hot tip: strafing while moving forward in the Prawn makes you go faster a la GoldenEye.
- Some little decorations from the first game are not longer buildable/findable. There are some new ones, though, like the toilet, shower and clicky desk toy.
- Mining with the Prawn Suit is still boring.",1681625904,1681625904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The soundscapes created by Unknown Worlds for this series are truly amazing. I could sit and listen to the sounds of the alien ocean for so long. Unfortunately, in Below Zero, the ambiance is frequently undercut with the rambling of forgettable side characters. You are no longer alone on the alien world, instead, an entire corporate HR department has set up shop nearby, and you have to suffer through their inane, pointless dialogue for a large portion of the game. I DON'T CARE ABOUT TED FROM ACCOUNTING! PLEASE SHUT UP! I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT SOME FISH OK??!?!? Sorry, just had to vent for a second.

That being said, I do want to say that I really liked the writing and acting for the main character and one other character, a friend you meet early on your journey. I genuinely enjoyed their conversations and developing relationship. I can't say more because there are a lot of spoilers here. It's a shame the rest of the writing and acting wasn't up to par.


The vehicles in this game left a lot to be desired. Fans of Subnautica will be appalled to learn that the Cyclops and Seamoth submarines aren't in this game. Instead, we get the Seatruck, an abomination that is slower than the Seamoth and lacks the mobile-base capabilities of the Cyclops. It's an incredibly crappy vehicle and its only upside is that when a massive leviathan chomps it in two, you won't be sad. Fortunately, the Prawn Suit survived the Great Purging of Fun Vehicles. Apparently they nerfed it a bit, but I could barely tell the difference. Running around in a mech suit punching fish is fun as always. The new Snowfox snowmobile is cool, but you basically only get to use it in one area of the map, and then never again.


The level design in Below Zero is a bit wonky. In Subnautica, you could go exploring anywhere and find something cool and new - Below Zero has a clear ""main story path"" and leaves other parts of the world sparse. Many biomes in this game are drab and gray, pretty much telling you 'there's nothing here'. Some areas are so overpopulated with one creature type that it seems like a joke, as if someone got access to level editing tools for the first time and just spawned as many SharkMonster4 as they could. Now, I like SharkMonster4 as much as the next ocean explorer, but there is no way they could all coexist and find food there.

I had to do a ton of back-and-forth trips on my playthrough, taking the same route over and over as I found one more item I needed. With prior experience, you could definitely save a lot of time, getting items in advance. But on a blind first playthrough, you're going to be Seatrucking along the same path quite often.


With all of that out of the way, let's talk about the good. Regardless of the gameplay issues, there's still an amazing alien world to explore. The audio and visuals are stunning. In the moment, marveling at whatever incredible thing you have just discovered, you won't be bothered that Jim from Finance is annoying and the Seatruck sucks. To put it simply, if you liked Subnautica, well, Below Zero is more Subnautica. It's the epitome of an average sequel- it doesn't quite capture the magic of the original but it is more of the same material from the same people. At the very least, this game is worth picking up on sale.

The game's storyline is confusing and lacks coherence, making it difficult for players to stay invested in the game. The game starts with the player crash-landing on an alien planet, and the story unfolds in a disjointed manner that fails to engage the player.

The graphics and sound design are lackluster, with uninspired character models and mediocre animations. The sound effects and music fail to create any sense of immersion, leaving players feeling disconnected from the game's world.

One of the game's biggest flaws is its crafting system, which is tedious and uninteresting. Players must gather resources to build tools and equipment that are necessary for survival, but the process is repetitive and lacks depth. The game fails to provide any meaningful challenge, and players can easily progress through the game without ever feeling challenged.

In conclusion, Subnautica is a lackluster game that fails to provide an engaging and immersive experience.

I feel like the next game. Needs to have the good stuff/points from both games. For example the first game had an awesome sub. This game has the truck stuff.

Objectively speaking the first game had a bigger scale and higher stakes. Compared to this one. It just lays the ground work for more to come. Also the ""scary"" creatures in this game. Weren't really as threatening or as foreboding.

PROS:
1) Massive improvement in graphics over the original
2) Plenty of quality of life improvements in UI and controls etc
3) Further improvement on options to build your base even on land

CONS:
1) Story is a big miss here..literally. Not only it's not as interesting as the original but the core of the story is actually missable. I'm not kidding. U can finish the game without ever learning what happened to ur sister as this is optional
2) Voice acting and lines are horrendous. I like the change to the female protagonist for a change but the lines are cringe worthy and instead of immersing you into this experience it actually takes you out of it.
3) Better graphics taken  too far. It's one thing to make everything look more beautiful. It's another thing to ""light"" the world up non stop. Unlike the 1rst game where there was scary sense of delving into the ""unknown"" into the darkness...here everything has lights even at night and all that dread that existed in the first game is lost. I could forgive this being only in the starting area but its everywhere in the game. This feels more like a ride in an amusement park and less like diving into the unknown.
4) Bugs..lots and LOTS of bugs..tired of seeing veins and mats stuck into the ground that I should be able to mine but cannot (and many many others). They have fixed some but I swear that parts of this map were randomly generated and the algorithm failed miserably.
5) My BIGGEST problem with this game is map design. In the first one you could see vast expanses that were empty and that felt more real. In this one they tried to fill the map to the brink to the point that it loses immersion. That would not be as much of a problem if they also did not fail in other ways:
    a) Narrow neverending caves. The cave systems in this game are absolute nightmare fuel. Not only they don't feel natural at all, but you end up feeling like a hamster in a maze that is suffocating and can't find your way back for TOO long in this game. That is even worse made by the fact that your vehicles can't fit in half those caves or get stuck and cannot even get unstuck. Tools like the pathfinder tool etc can be useful here but they still took it way too far here.
    b) Exploration on land is mandatory for a LONG PORTION of the game and its boring and worse than the cave systems. I originally was excited to see some land exploration too but this is by far even worse. I was lost for hours trying to find my way around the land with blizzards and maze like structures that you need to comprehend in order to fully finish the story. Unless you stumble upon the next clue by accident, then you are truly lost. Dear devs please dont add both blizzard AND maze like structures..this can be enjoyed by some but has nothing to do with what subnautica was supposed to be about.
 
6) Finally the hints...this is the kind of game that in order to progress the story, you only get hints to where to go and search. Some hints are kinda ez to figure out (you get actual beacon locations or a map that somewhat tells you where to go). In other cases the hints are TERRIBLE. Finding a certain npc's garden area is extremely frustrating since you won't know where it is until you are on top of it (view distance). Even worse when it comes to finding big ship salvages or propper peng cave for actual story quest (missable). In the first game finding pods made you discover things naturally as they were on ur way to those pods. Here it's more like ""keep searching till u get bored"".

Overall I hope they take the updated graphics/qol improvements and implement them on the 3rd game..but they should really focus more on what made the first game great. The atmosphere..delving into the unkown..building big ass submarine :D A little better map design and hints and less focus on going up but more focus on going down.",1681178689,1681178689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like many others have already said, the game by itself is good. But when compared to the original subnautica, it feels a little lackluster. 
To sum up the comparsion between the OG and the below zero, it's a less memorable experience.  
One of the few problems that this game has, is that it's far less scary than it's first counterpart. The monsters are less scary and generally smaller and weaker. The sound design of the monsters (the roars and other sounds), is not good. The scariest sound makes an enemy that can be dealt with easily (few knife hits and it's dead) and there is overabundance of them. On the other side, this game's leviathan is scary only the first time he gets you. Otherwise it's a joke. It's not memorable nor does it sound scary in any way. Remember the reaper leviathan? How he roared and how much anxiety that brought up? 

But the problem with ""being scary"" does not concern only the enemies (albeit it's the main problem that I see), getting into the deeper parts of the ocean is also less scary and mysterious. Why? Well. Depends on the vehicle you use. There are three vehicles available, the seatruck, the first vehicle you get your grabby hands on. It sucks. It's like a worse seamoth and a worse cyclops combined. And you also have the prawn suit, a bit modified movement from the first game, but essentially the same vehicle. The third one is the snowfox. It's only use is on land. 

Both of these vehicles served me mostly no purpose apart from getting achievements. Otherwise, the prawn suit wins because given the map's crammed nature and a lot of caves and alike, the prawn suit excels at it. It has a lot of health and can hit pretty strong. And oh, it can also venture on land, covering you from the weather or the beasts that roam it. (The  snowfox does not do such thing, it will not provide insulation unlike the prawn suit)

Back to the ""why getting deeper is less scary than in the OG subnautica"", you basically have this overpowered prawn suit and so have little to no reason to be afraid of venturing deeper. Even if the enemies there will try to take a bite out of you, you hide for a bit, fix prawn suit and you can go right back. Given you can craft rechargeable fins, you don't need to really recharge your items. 
The game, giving you the prawn suit, taught you that you are on top of the food chain. And you get it ""fairly"" early in the gameplay and the resources are easy to obtain. I remember how anxious it was to try to gather some resources from the likes of the lost river in the OG subnautica. Here it can be done quite easily. The game has TOO much resources available.
This is also tied to the fact that the map is smaller in size than the OG game.

The story - it was good BUT again, not memorable. I distinctly remember how the first game ended. Here I had to rewatch some let's plays to even recall it. And again to add to the point ""this game is significantly less scary than the first subnautica"", the protagonist speaks and you get a companion welded right into your head. And you also find another survivor (npc). In the first game you had no one, just broken escape pods with no survivors but you. 
The lore is also odd and does not feel satisfying to learn what happened. Let's just leave it at that.

So. With all this said, why did I leave the ""I would recommend this game""? What are the positives about it? 
The game is fun to play, and at a first glance, it scratched the itch of ""I want to play more subnautica"" without replaying the original game. But it obviously uncovered some problems with this game. I had a good time playing it, I loved some of the mechanics but I feel like they were a tad bit too limited or quirky to be more useful in the longterm. Again, like the seatruck and snowfox. On paper these two sound fun, in the game though, they are kind of the lesser option when compared to the prawn suit. 

I'll leave this review at that, the game is worth getting if you'd want more subnautica, but don't expect wanting to play this game again. It's an fun experience that lasts around 15-20 hours. If you are unsure about it, wait for sale.

It lacks for me some of that *drive* that makes Subnautica so different from most survival crafting games: You have a goal, and the clues and resources that further that goal feed into one another, right up until the end.  And the end rules.  When has that ever happened for a survival sim?
Below Zero is doing something different, in tone and narrative.  I'm not sure all of it works, but the bones of the game are still here, with new and interesting problems to solve, and QoL improvements to the crafting and construction compared to the original.  Exploration is still rewarding, it's just less elegant than Subnautica in pointing where to go next.  

Because of that, I can't recommend it OVER the original, but as a Standalone DLC for people who have already mastered Subnautica, it still has a lot to offer.  There are enough original and interesting scenarios to scratch that novel exploration itch.  Honestly, they could just make new maps and new framing stories in this vein several more times and I'd be eager to play more.

Maybe it's better now, I don't know. If so, I can also highly recommend that game, I loved it. Also, I'm sure it's better on PC for that reason.

Anyways, in THIS game I have so far not found any bugs, yay! The graphics in general are beautiful, I like that it's a female protagonist and that you have voice actors and get to actually see the character's face this time, compared to Subnautica that makes it all feel way more alive and relatable. The music is epic as well.

Not much to complain about here, apart from the following:

---MILD SPOILER ALERT---

I'll try not to say too much, but there are certain land creatures that I find pretty annoying, there are just too many of them, and that island in general feels (to me) impossible to navigate, I keep getting lost, and the terrible weather and said creatures are not helping at all. Might be fun for others, for me it's mainly a reason not to go there again unless I really have to. I won't even mention the second kind of creature you encounter there. So I guess for new players I personally would recommend: always save before you enter that island, be well prepared against the cold, and bring a lot of health packs ;)
And general tip: I now carry several beacons with me every time I venture out. Otherwise I will find a new location once - and never again :P

Subnautica: Below Zero, in my opinion, has a lot of new and improved gameplay and QOL features.

However, having the seatruck meet the cyclops and seamoth in the middle was kind of a let down. I think that it would have been cool to have something similar to the cyclops, or just the cyclops, in Below Zero.

Lots of fun exploring but it just didn't have that mystery and going into the unknown draw the original had.  This is basically because you play as a character that talks and communicate with NPCs throughout the story.  Really draws away from the immersion and discovery the first game had.  Also the setting was strange as you were on an arctic place of the same planet from the first game but it was somehow fairly inhabited in the past with structures and research bases throughout.  You also spend a significant time above the surface on icebergs instead of exploring the ocean depths.  Most of the exploration in the ocean occurs in low depth too, which is a shame since you never really have to go deep until the end.

While ultimately a pretty decent game, Subnautica: Below Zero completely fails to both understand and capture the initial appeal of the first game, for which a letting go of the original sound designer and the leaving of the original writer are to blame.

Below Zero tries to fill the strong sense of isolation on an uncaring alien planet, which was part of what made the original game feel so harrowing, with as much noise as possible. The writing itself varies between decently entertaining or engaging, and borderline attrocious. The world and creature designs too vary between pretty interesting ideas and things that make early concept art blush. Everything in the world is atleast partially lit too, and that to an excessive degree. It is like they tried to get the core of what makes the original Subnautica so memorable backwards.

To give you an idea, half of the exploration in this game takes part on land. Yes, you heard me correctly. A Subnautica game. On dry land. It's not hard to see why it fails to be engaging.

Some people take issue with the smaller map. I don't. I take issue with how cramped it is, and how that crampedness was used as an excuse to get rid of the Cyclops, a vehicle that had a bit of a skill curve in its piloting mechanics. The Seatruck isn't a bad Seamoth replacement, but the lack of a submarine that requires me to use my brain while piloting is seriously disappointing. You clearly could have just made a smaller, yet open map. Now you don't have any vehicles with any depth to their mechanics whatsoever, pun not intended. You just look around and press W on your Seatruck.

Some people say the biomes aren't interesting. I disagree. Subnautica was never about cool-looking biomes, it was about the big fish in them. I also found this game to be lacking in that department. The Chelicerate isn't nearly as interesting as a Ghost Leviathan or a Reaper Leviathan, and it replaces both. Yeah, it literally has one fish to make up for two that were lost. It would be cool if this thing was interesting, but again, it isn't. It's actually even smaller than a Ghost Leviathan, which is funny, considering this thing spawns in the void to keep you from going to the map edge.

It's not about numbers, it's about the fact that we lost two perfectly nice things in exchange for a boring one. If this thing was super cool and well thought-out, I'd call it a win, but that's sadly not the case. The Shadow Leaviathan? Uuuh. It exists, I suppose. But there are 3 of them in the entire game, and they can't even take off 50% of your vehicle's health in one hit. They're literally a non-threat (and also smaller than a Ghost Leviathan).

Also, the whole thing with Robin, Al-an? Pass. Hard pass. I don't even care if it's ""woke"" or whatever (it really isn't), but the dialogue exchanges between them border on The Last Jedi levels of bad writing. Yes, it's really that bad, and no, it never gets any better throughout the game.

The side plot with Robin's sister? Irrelevant. You can finish the entire game without ever interacting with it (truly a ""lmao"" moment), even though that's the entire reason Robin sent herself to this hellhole of a planet to begin with.

Basebuilding? Same as last game. They managed to not screw this one up, which is good, because I've always liked how Subnautica handled base building. But it's also fair to mention that, aside from adding a large room, they never made any real improvements. It's just the same system. And also the large room was added to the last game in an update so this stops being something noteworthy entirely.

Graphics? It's Unity. While the artstyle is beautiful as always, the game has an optimization issue that's just part of the grind with Unity at this point. The engine can have excellent performance, but it doesn't do so out-of-the-box like, say, Unreal.

The takeaway from this review is this: Oceans are scary because they're big, and have big things in them. That also makes them engaging. UWE made this game smaller both on a metaphorical and literal sense in a misguided attempt to make it accessible to more people, thus making it less like an ocean and more like a saltwater lake. Remember, it was never about the horror. It was about the majesty, about the breath-taking nature of everything. Once you got over your anxiety, the game opened up, and fear was replaced with wonder.

Now your fear is replaced with bad dialogue.",1680600224,1680600224,False,2,1,0.526404738426208496,0,True,False,False

Playing through that game was an absolute joy, heavily bolstered by its open-endedness, sheer terror, and the oddly compelling, dangerous curiousity to swim even deeper, and deeper, and deeper into the abyss than ever before. The brightest moment of that game for me was, ironically, exploring the deepest, darkest parts of the map, expertly crafted by Unknown Worlds, all by myself. The isolation was the cornerstone of Subnautica. It's part of what makes it so freaking good. I struggled to go even deeper than even 50m for the first 10 hours because of the sheer terror I felt exploring, but I forced myself to do it anyways because it's just so much fun.

I have nothing but fond memories from the original Subnautica. I still play it to this day. Very few games have the honor to be replayed by me regularly. And even fewer games have mastered the feeling that the fear of the oceans gives you, the fear of the unknown.

So, you would think that the sequel to such a well-beloved game would be just as good, if not better, right?

Well, you thought wrong.

 Subnautica: Below Zero is nowhere as bright as the shining star that was the original Subnautica.

What's the quote again? ""Wide as an ocean, but deep as a puddle""?

The world is about 1/5th the size of the original's world. So, with that in mind, you would expect for Below Zero's world to go even deeper than the original, and be the exact opposite of that quote?

Small as a puddle, but deep as an ocean. 

Ha, you would think, right?

Below Zero's world is as wide as a puddle and shallow as one. The world doesn't get very deep at all compared to the original Subnautica. and there's not anywhere near as many places to dive in. There's not very much underwater biome variety as well. In fact, about a 1/3 of the world is covered up with walkable terrain. And guess what? The walking is awful. Everywhere you walk, even in your bases above and below the sea, being stuck on a random object isn't an uncommon ocurrence. A massive shame such a large portion of an underwater survival game is spent exploring above the sea level, and you can't even have a bug-free time doing so, eh?

Speaking of going underwater, Below Zero is nowhere near as scary as the original. The devs just brightened everything, took away all the cool leviathans from the first game and replaced them with gimmicky creatures and plants designed to piss you off (cough cough Sea Monkey) or make the game boring as crap (oxygen bubble plants. the inclusion of these actually takes away all incentive to use vehicles.).

All that brilliantly paced tension: Gone. A major tool for Subnautica's succes: Gone.

Below Zero has a prewritten, voiced protagonist, a woman named Robin, as well, but the story is very poorly written, illogical, and very handholdy to the point where it makes Mass Effect Andromeda's story look enticing, taking away one of the best aspects of the original: The freedom to do whatever you want, to go wherever you want, whenever you want as whoever you wish to be. 

The original Subnautica also had a prewritten protagonist as well (a man named Riley, I believe), but that protagonist was silent, so it makes the game even more impressionable as you become more and more immersed in the world. You start playing as Riley, but by the end of the game, you are playing as yourself. 

A quick explanation of what I mean:
The original Subnautica was about your personal journey. Your adventures. Every action you take is your own. 

Below Zero is about Robin's journey, not yours. It can't even tell Robin's story well, unfortunately. Robin's story is entirely made from her and her sister's negligence, how the hell is that compelling, Unknown Worlds?

And now, the soundtrack. 

The soundtrack of Subnautica has morphed, from tense, but futuristic electronic music, absolutely dripping with atmosphere with every sound, every note. A perfect blend between technologically mystifying ocean exploration and bone chilling horror.

Simon Chylinski knew what he was doing, man. (I'll post links for both Subnautica and Below Zero for comparison.)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOJVtMtSLpw

 ..to generic underwater exploration music that sounds like something from Spore. The new composer, Ben Prunty thought a national geographic album would be more appropiate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyNiDh7fEYE&list=PLDisKgcnAC4Te0v8NH5Ddy-tcBKBtryhR&index=5

A travesty, really. 


So, because of these shortcomings (and more I haven't mentioned), Below Zero absolutely destroys every aspect that made the original game so compelling:

To see what's beyond the murky, pitch black depths.

To go where no man has gone before.

To recognize and overcome the primal terror of looking directly at the abyss and having it staring back at you with malicious intent.

To explore an alien world as if you personally inhabited it yourself, as if you were the protagonist.

That was what the original Subnautica stood for. That was what made it so successful in the first place.

So, why the sudden change in direction for the series after such a massive success?

Look at Unknown Worlds, what do the devs have to say about this?

UW actually fired the OG Subnautica's composer and sound director, Simon Chylinski, (which explains why the sound design is this game is so bland) over making a mild joke about an Attack Helicopter (shortly before Subnautica's release, I believe.)

I've also noticed that during the early access period for Below Zero, the story was remade about 6-8 times. The game was fundementally changed several times throughout the early access period. The original voice actor for Robin was changed as well.

I've never, ever seen any early access game pull changes that drastically in my 15+ years of gaming, so that leaves me a few questions:

Did Unknown Worlds have any sort of solid plan for Below Zero? 

Was there any sort of infighting going on between the dev team at Unknown Worlds?

Why were they having such a hard time deciding on one idea and sticking with it?


I sense [i] somebody [/i] (gestures directly towards Unknown Worlds) is having a Bioware moment and throwing away all sorts of talent foolishly and trying to recapture lightning in a bottle without the capabilities to do so.

Because of these actions that the devs have been doing a lot as of recently, and because of the bad product they've shipped out as Subnautica: Below Zero, I really can't recommend this game in any good faith.

In fact, dare I say, I don't have any faith that Unknown Worlds' next project is going to turn out well. I expect Subnautica 3 to be a disaster.

Subnautica: Below Zero, for me, is a 4/10. Below Zero is a major dissappointment for me personally, which really depresses me since I was a massive fan of the original Subnautica. That game changed me, made reconsider what kinds of games I should play.

If you want to venture into the wondrous, aquatic alien world of Planet 4546B, I highly recommend playing the original Subnautica and completely ignore Below Zero entirely so you don't soil the memories you get from playing the original.


TL;DR: 

Subpar: Below Average isn't worth your time.


Man, this game made me sad. :(

848450,91564300,76561198064488597,0,23,1038,0,945,1621233439,"Below Zero lacks the charm and engagement of the original game on just about every level save one.

First, the map. The original's map was expansive and interesting. The one here feels kind of samey, being in some areas too mixed and without the same degree of layered exploration. In the original exploration felt very layered. Like every time you went deeper you were moving into a new world with a sense of fear and wonder which magnified as you found new strange locations such as the Lost River and below. Below Zero it lacks that. Instead they all just kind of merge together and the layout just comes off as bland. The closest they have is the surface exploration which, while not bad, is feels divorced from the core game play loop and is set up into this mess of canyons that just adds artificial challenge.

Second, the vehicle progression. In the original you work your way up from the Seamoth to the Cyclops. There was a sense of progression. In Below Zero you build the Sea Truck and just bolt new pods to the back and give it upgrade upon upgrade. And using the Cyclops vs. the Seamoth felt like a trade off in places. The cyclops was a mobile base, but it moved like a pregnant cow. The Seamoth was speedy and agile but weak and limited. You could bring both (at least until you got to the lava chamber) but that would mean leaving the Prawn behind. There were trade offs. 

Third is the plot. In the original you were a simple survivor and the plot is discovered largely by vague hints and stumbling around blindly. You discovered it for yourself. It wasn't handed to you, you had to discover and explore and figure out what was going on for yourself. In Below Zero you immediately start with an annoying generic 'strong female protagonist' (not that anything is wrong with female protagonists, as long as being 'strong', 'female', and 'the protagonist' aren't the only memorable aspects of the character, like some soulless, self-propelled inclusivity checklist) who basically skydived naked onto an alien death world for 'reasons'. The plot is driven by an endless stream of poorly written exposition that manage to be memorable in only how annoyingly it can kill your immersion and coupled to 'helpful' way points that remove much of the impetus to explore.

One thing to note about the plot is that it was completely scrapped and rewritten halfway through development. It's one of the reasons the story comes off as so disjointed. The reason that everyone mysteriously vanished from the planet was because in the original plot the planet was abandoned after a meteor storm caused everyone to evac to an orbital station but Robin was left behind, but the station was severely damaged meaning that they couldn't go back down for her and it went from there. The current plot was shoe-horned into existing map assets, like a DLC of a DLC, and it shows. You can see this because the game has two stories that are not only completely disconnected, but one of them which was the reason you came there to begin with seems to drop off the map 30 minutes into the game and it's almost too easy to miss it due to the second feeding you a series of breadcrumbs that leads to the endgame.

In general, they missed the simple factor that made the first game great. It wasn't Ryley the Protagonist's story. It was my story. It was your story. It was the players story. The voiceless  blank slate character was simply a vessel for the player's experience. Below Zero is Robin's story, not the players, and frankly, she really ain't that interesting.

Then you have the creature designs which compared to the original are largely uninspired, drawing far too much from earth lifeforms to the point they seem less like strange and exotic alien lifeforms from a distant planet and more just strange and exotic prehistoric earth creatures. For example, you have the alternative to the Reaper Leviathan, the Chelicerate. It doesn't feel like as alien, instead its just kind of a giant death shrimp. Then you have the penguins. I mean 'pengwings'. Which are penguins.

Even most insulting is the fact that they actually had plans to add some well designed creatures to the game but chose not to because they cut a biome and thought that people didn't need excess creatures. The Ice Dragon Leviathan (check the wiki) would have been infinitely more interesting than the mega-shrimp we got.

The only improvement over the original is base design, which is largely due to the addition of some additional rooms and decorative elements. A very welcome addition but it kind of falls flat when combined with the everything else. 

In general, this is an all around inferior product that shouldn't be bought for full price. If you find it for half off, loved the original, and don't mind being lead around the nose by Lady Generica and her boring sidekick, go for it... but don't pay full price. It's not worth the money.

Update: The game being finished does nothing to change my opinion.

Note: Having thought about it, I'd almost like to say the theatrical trailer manages to be both a case of gross missadvertisement and the game they should have made. No bland voiced protagonist, just some poor sap trying to survive on a planet that seems hellbent to making them suffer. Wouldn't even have had to of replace the character model as I find absolutely nothing wrong with the idea of an everywoman protagonist...",1620355298,1680476328,False,2782,55,0.813122689723968506,157,True,False,False

The Sea Truck is slow, janky and gets hooked on everything causing you to be disorientated. No other underwater vehicle option except the prawn suit which is rendered useless as the truck can go almost as deep as the prawn. On land sections are vast and empty with nothing of interest except running around for HOURS trying to find one alien base. The story is strange that you are searching information on your sister's death yet for the 20 hours I played this game, Sam (the sister) was almost never mentioned. The monsters of the game lack scare factor and the ocean is not as terrifying as the original.

The positives are that the most of biomes are bright, alien and resources are mostly plentiful. Equipment progression is relatively easy compared to the original.

It's 50 % as good as the first game, which is great ! But a bit disappointing. 

Pros
- The underwater parts are fun. 
- The new base building things are cool too. ++ Jukebox
- Cute critters.
- Your ""Buddy"" is sassy and adorable.
- Fred is a marvel and there is not enough voice logs of him.
- Some fun throwback to the first game.
- Emmanuel can go suck a lemon, it's a good thing.
- The cold mechanics are cool.

Cons
- none of the leviathan will feels as grand, beautiful or deadly as the ones in the first game. (except one)
- The last underwater part is tedious, but ok. 
- The land parts are boring, slow going and tedious. Everything is white. Ya know, the reason you like subnautica, everything monochrome. But seriously, it was horrible. 
- The lack of pointers toward the end game, made it feels drawn out. 
- The story ending is not really satisfying. I may be missing something, but I still have questions about the events that bring our character there.
- I liked Robin better in the alpha, was sassier.
- Like the premise in the alpha better too. Kinda disappointed of the direction the story took. Missed Sam.

much better now,, still dont like the truck

original is great, as for this one im not sure.
if they get rid of the sea monkeys it would be ok.
im not going to sit there and try and scan the same object 5 times only to have these fish steel your scanner.
after the 5th time i gave up and shut the game off.
if i want to be robbed i would walk out the the door and walk 2 blocks, i DONT need it in a video game.

EDIT:

played a few more hrs and found the cannon which gets rid of the thieving sea monkeys, however, still maintaining my review.
the sea truck sucks, as it cant get into certian areas unless you detach everything. even the cyclops would not help here. HINT : bring back the sea moth.
the suit sucks as it only has a depth range of 400m, and no upgrades, (that i can find).
the moon pool wont line up the way you want.
too much time spent on land, yes the hoverbike is cool, but i thought this was an underwater game, my mistake.
the original voice actor for the main character was great, this new one has no attachment to the story, seems like there not even interested in the script while reading it.

so far i like the story, this game has potential.

but i would wait untill more updates b4 purchace.",1575161646,1680269418,True,0,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,True

I just finished Below Zero and while I feel like it was not quite at the same level as the first one it is still worth playing through.  The game environments (mostly) are again beautifully done along with all the details of each biome, however, i have a few critiques...  

First off the overall size this time seemed much smaller, maybe its because there is more top side land in this one to navigate, but with all the great things they did underwater the top side just felt uninteresting.  I only ventured on the surface just long enough to accomplish a few mandatory tasks before returning to the depths to never again set foot topside until the end of the game.  Oh and the ""snowfox"" was more like ""snowFAIL"", absolute garbage vehicle and the ice worms were just annoying!  I will give props to the dynamic weather this time, though, annoying sometimes... i do enjoy a good weather system in play.  Secondly, what is the deal with the no maps thing!? Again with trying to navigate around with nothing more than a compass and beacon's... I can make all this cool shit but i can't plot out a map? seriously? ugh...

The story was cool, the alien tag along was a new and different experience.  Some folks found it poorly done but i thought it was a nice touch overall.  I was wondering exactly how the game would end but I didn't think it would go the direction it did.  

Lastly i thought the base building was more constricted due to the size of the map, i didn't feel motivated much at all really to expand out for a 2nd base and i only utilized the pop-up scanner base a couple of times...  I was disappointed to see it would not pick up on wrecks or alien sites considering the navigation difficulty.  I accomplished everything i needed with a fairly small base and i never had the need to use a nuclear reactor or a thermal gen...  Between 1 solar panel and the bio-reactor i never had a want for more power.

Overall it was a pretty good play through and is a must if you have played the first one already.  I definitely got my money's worth out of it.  Great game!",1679974206,1679974206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My play time is a bit fragmented, I got really close to finishing it, but got stuck for whatever reason and quit without finishing it.  After getting back into the original game, I tried to give this another shot.

There's a bunch of design decisions that are different from the original game, mostly because BZ is a standalone expansion rather than a full fledged sequel.  Some of these decisions were great, others I think stemmed from a misrepresentation of what players liked.

Let's start with the good.  The developers are masters of creating underwater alien landscapes.  Glowing purple rocks that regularly ""pop"" into flame jets.  Lily pads that are attached to chunks of rock at their base.  Massive icebergs with caverns inside.  Deep underwater mushrooms that spit out spores that float in the water.  All of it feels alien and you'll always be amazed at the environment.

The progression system does two things: it allows you to slowly acclimate to the environments around you while letting you grind out some resources for your next project, and there's always at least one or two resources that will force you to go out of your comfort zone to search for new materials.  For example, to make a certain material, you need mushrooms from a deep cave.  Your vehicle likely won't be able to reach all the way, so you'll be forced to do at least 100 meters or so outside the safety of your seateuck.  You'll also rarely feel like you need to grind.  The system from the OG Subnautica was changed so that each outcropping now has 1 special resource, or titanium (a general crafting resource for most things and base building) instead of having nodes carry 1 of 3 different resources that was completely random.

As for the bad, the story just isn't as intriguing.  S1 had a story of a mysterious crash landing, and you slowly put the pieces together of what happened, and how you'll escape the alien planet.  You're also a silent protagonist, so you're alone with your thoughts and the occasional informational and sometimes snarky PDA.  SZ has a voice protagonist and eventually an alien in your head.  I don't hate this, but it creates a very different vibe than the original.  The game also gives you your objectives almost straight away (find 3 specific blueprints, craft them, then bring them to a certain place, and also find out what happened to your sister).  S1 didn't, you just survived and slowly got introduced to the gravity of the situation you were in.  The character animations for people are also just... Weird, like they couldn't do stop motion so they all feel like cheap canned animations from the early GameCube era.

Land areas are too much and Subnauticas engine leaves a lot to be desired.  There are a few neat moments, but for the most part they just feel like a slog.

Lastly, I don't like the Seateuck and it's modular design.  I get why the Cyclops from S1 wasn't included, because of the map size, but there's no point to getting all the Seateuck mods.  Half of them are useless (sleeping quarters and aquarium), and the more modules you add, the slower you get.  The Seamoth was a perfect early exploration vessel and there was no need to remove it from BZ.  The Prawn suit is back because I'm sure the fan base would've rioted if they scrapped it.

Overall I think it's still a fine game and if you liked the exploraion of S1, you'll find something you liked in SBZ.",1679969627,1679969627,True,1,0,0.513116061687469482,0,True,False,False

The game for me was overall shorter with less in it as a whole, but its still a worth it play for subnautica lovers. I did notice less bugs than the first game, but a few non gamebreaking glitches were found in my casual playthrough, just menial stuff like hail falling through the ceilings of a cave, nothing like getting flung around at mach speeds in a prawn suit that I experienced during my playthrough. I do wish the game was longer, my first subnautica playthrough lasted 48 hours with this one lasting only 18. I had tons of fun playing, but it really leaves something to be desired. One downside is the map construction felt almost constricted. In the first subnautica there was a vast and open ocean in all directions, except this time around theres shallow waters with small biomes and often times ""Deep"" versions of them, which are mildly different. Do be careful, though, as if you avoid going deep in some places you'll miss a whole new biome, so just be on the lookout. I would have liked a more vast and open map similar to the first game, as an example of what I'm talking about, I found the seatruck hard to maneuver in most areas with anything more than 2 ""trailers"".  I can say, however, that the story was very comprehensive and it was easy to find out what to do next without the use of a guide, unless you missed something. With that being said, a bit of advice would be that if you get a major piece of information, and then find nothing important, and the story grinds to a hault aside from small things, you may need to revisit some places if you don't want to look at a guide to see what you missed. 

I recommend buying this game if you catch it on sale.

TL;DR: the first game was longer and had tons more content, but this game adds tons onto the lore and was still an enjoyable gameplay experience. It felt lacking in terms of the whole map, and didn't deliver as much as I would have liked. 6.5/10",1679948817,1679948817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The worst part of this game is the story. The story is very cliche, and Rail-roady. The mystery that was offered in the first game was interesting and mysterious. In this game, it's very annoying and tedious. The characters have very little depth and the story doesn't change much at all from the beginning. It's a big corporation exploiting the khraa, again, and they even demystified the Architects. In the first game the story made you want to explore more Biomes and go deeper into the sea. In this game, most resources are 0-450m deep. There's really no reason to go deep except for curiosity or because the game forces you to. There aren't many benefits to going deep like there was in the original game. Also, the Arctic Biome was, barren. Not just literally but also of content. And the Worms? kind of a rip off of Dune without much story to them as well. I don't mean to get attacked by SJW's but all of the important characters were female. That's fine, but it feels forced and obvious, like the storyteller was trying to make a point.

Exploration was fun, if not short-lived. I was excited to see the new Biomes and Build my bases, but the fun quickly faded. There wasn't a lot of new content in the new Biomes, maybe about the standard amount for Biomes less than 450m deep, less that standard at deeper levels, and almost none than absolutely necessary in the arctic areas. What's with base building as well? just put in a Bio-reactor and an Alien Containment (although this was hard to find), using too much energy? Build two Bio-Reactors or build a Nuclear Reactor. There wasn't much motivation for going any other way, like Thermal or Solar. Maybe Bio Reactors and urananaite should be harder to access, or there should be another way to incentivise toher power methods. 

Lastly, I liked having the SeaTruck, but I hated only having the seatruck. The Submarine in the previous game was  awesome and it would have been nice to at least have that option again, if not even more options.

Did a pacifist make this one? In the first game you needed teeth for enameled glass and now you don't need to harm any predators to finish the game at all, why not instead offer some amount of combat and creative awards for fending off squidsharks and leviathans? Rewards could be crafting material or even a guardian you need to beat to get access to an area. Oh and maybe add a skin ability to leviathans to shake off grappling arms if you do implement combat. Killing Leviathans is too easy with the old grapple and drill method.  

Lastly, but least likely to be implemented, if the game were at larger and included multiplayer, that would expand the player base a lot, but would probably require a much larger budget.

TL;DR This game is limited compared to the first, the story was much tedious rather than mysterious. The combat was even less than the first game (essentially only defensive). The exploration was slightly less than the original in terms of depth, and base-building was about the same, minus a few new, small changes. This game was also a lot easier than an original.

I honestly just cannot agree… really at all. I think this game was a fine successor to Subnautica 1 in most every way. The environment, base building, creatures, terror, etc. were recaptured very well in Subnautica 2. The story is not all that bad in my opinion and I liked the interaction between Robin and Al-An. I was expecting throughout for Al-An to turn on Robin and become evil but I was pleasantly surprised in a subversion of expectations way when Al-An never did and he and Robin finally made it to his home world in search of his people.
