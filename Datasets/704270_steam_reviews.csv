So this game practically depends on you knowing what to do on a looter shooter from the get go, there´s no ""traditional tutorial"" neither and in-context one, so depending on your on know-how you could get back on your feet pretty easy or just get lost in the opening sequence.

On the first 5 mins of creating a save file you get a PowerPoint of story introduction, with very little to no info about who the **** you are, you´re just a teenager that went on a fishing trip and got blasted to shore, also the fact that the swedish got armed to the teeth and instructed everyone to just be armed and prepared for anything after WW2.

                                                    [h1] SPOILER FOR THE 1st HOUR  [/h1]

You get to shore, see a house, get closer, see a bloodied robot dog on the front door, get inside, see a gnarled corpse of a policeman, no ***** given (great another mute bcuz yes protagonist, there´s not even grunts apart from dmg), get his gun, the house is littered whith ammo and explosive material, see note that´s explains that´s this a elderly couple´s house, they have a grandaughter, she´s probably on the church, go to church, lil encounter with 2 robot dogs, get to church, 3 more robot dogs, kill them, get inside, lady screams for help, she´s literally bleedin out from the leg, wants help and aid kit (tfw an npc wants meds and i got a pharmacy on my backpack but wants me to craft one anyways), get her patched, get shotgun from bell tower.

Storm outside because the animations for the characters are so stiff that they could probably use their mouths to open a soda can, spawn a bicycle from thin air from a table because why not, DO NOT SWERVE OFF THE MAIN ROAD, the bicycle is made out of rubber and it will bounce and lose its speed on the jumps, go to nearby barn, 4 robot dogs on the barn (the ante of more dogs per location is killing me), cheese them in one go why explosive canister, check the building, headcrab like robots plus all houses littered with so much ammo, explosive mats, and medkits, girl gets scared because the´re not there, find out that the ppl went to bomb shelter, and that the robots may have taken the broadcast down, girl gets ""better"" AND MAKES TRIP FROM CHURCH TO BARN ON FOOT, gets parts to make field radio, both the girl and radio are invisible because this game was starting to get coherent.

Try to get to nearby town, find blown up tank, think that maybe stealth is the way to go, 1 robot dog plus the metal loader from alien, there´s graffiti in almost every building about how to take it down, try to lure it and get on it´s back, doesn´t cooperate, makes DASHING MOVES, **** it mag dump his face and the robot dog, get off the game.


This game does not look good, it looks like a game for ps3 on it´s late days, maybe it´s bcuz i have an underpowered pc, but it does not justify the ui, the explanations, it´s controls, the stroy even THE SETTINGS, to find mouse smoothing you go to game, not keyboard and mouse, also this game is hell bent on coop gameplay, and it´s not even subtle, we get referred as player constantly not even like ""survivor"", it feels like a mix between a full online rust type of game but the interactions on far cry 5, if anything the ui is almost identical to that of horizon zero dawn or god of war 2018, okay nothing needs to be original, but it´s so scattered, since there´s no explanation of how it works you just have to check it up by yourself.

Overall the game is........fine it´s not worst thing but i did have some expectations for it and took the opportunity that it was on sale, but still the game is pretty bad on various departments, and after 5 years still has some problems mentioned on launch?, i don´t even wanna know how it was back then.

If you wanna buy it fine, but have a good pc that can do the recomended specs, its not good on the minimum.",1709062403,1709062403,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

A chequered history. Plagued with bugs, some rather underwhelming DLC and some odd design choices (as far as I'm concerned) but it's just about getting there.
There must be something in the game as I've over 900 hours but I think i'm about done.
Patches mostly fix LONG standing bugs and issues and introduce new ones..  Nothing has really improved gameplay or quality for anyone and it still crashes FAR too often.   Most of the vets will have moved on or worked around the issues.

It's evolved away from it's survival/FPS roots into a looter shooter;  with looting and crafting dumbed down for the lowest player IQ.

When you relax and take it for what it is rather than expecting some grand vision of gaming excellence you'll feel better about it.  The first 20-30 hours you'll find a solo campaign then when you've finished the story the vast majority of you play will be multiplayer.
Multiplayer is still a bit of a lottery, too. There's no matchmaking, modders can ruin the balance of combat and there are a fair share of arsewipes that you can't block.  Considering the amount of time you'll be playing MP (if you bother to stick around) group play has been neglected badly and doesn't appear to be on any roadmap for improvement.

Stealth is a bit average and the alert indicator makes getting around unnoticed way too easy. Turn it off, you'll be fine.
There's difficulty scaling but it's more like a thicker sponge than any AI improvement.

I still recommend buying the base game as cheaply as you can. I'd avoid any DLC other than Alpine Unrest, (particularly weapon packs (as the base game experimentals are far better than any of the paid for stuff and the motorbike DLC is STILL pretty dreadful and practically obsolete since the trike dlc release) .

Buy it as cheap as you can.  Once the solo story is over get some mates you can trust for MP.",1636204757,1708954982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The mechanics are perfect (besides some bugs that seem to get more rare with each update). You can complete the campaign in around 15-20 hours, and DLC adds another 15-20 hours. I've enjoyed the game enough that I was willing to, on multiple occasions, start from scratch so I could play it with friends. The weapons are realistic to an extent and none is too powerful to use. If you do end up wanting to collect collectable, expect to add another 10 hours to your normal gameplay and that's if you're also using a map to find it all, because things are very well hidden.

For what I achieved - playing through the main campaign, the DLC, lightly dabbling in the endgame, and a HELL of a lot of exploration and side quests - 110 hours all up is pretty good.

Firstly, how do you describe this game? It's an open-world FPS similar to ones you may have played in the past, but goes for a fairly unique combination of existing mechanics & tropes. I personally feel like it lifts elements and touchpoints from series like Far Cry, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Dead Island pretty well.

You're presented with the vast Scandinavian landscapes of rural Swedish archipelagos to explore, where you loot for survival resources and weapons. All the meanwhile, being mercilessly stalked by a ruthless robot army hivemind whilst trying to find survivors and discover the origin of the machines.

The game is fairly oppressive with its difficulty to start - resources are scarce and your weaponry limited, so your foes are truly pretty terrifying. You're often sneaking around trying to avoid putting yourself in sticky situations (or having to tackle them tactfully when you do inevitably get dragged into combat with a horde of killer robots).

As your arsenal expands, the game also ramps up the difficulty by introducing more and more intimidating robots to face, but it does feel as though you wind up accruing enough power and knowledge to start turning the tides in your favour. You'll especially see this if you come across an endgame player in co-op - they're often running circles around the biggest of foes, unloading all sorts of devastating munitions into them and just generally trivialising the content.

If I'd wanted to sink my teeth into the endgame, or clear the entire (utterly enormous) map from corner to corner, then I could have probably sunk many more hours into the game. But honestly, I just didn't have the drive. With the regular updates being dropped by the live-ops dev team, it sort of has a faux-live-service feeling to it. Especially when the endgame is just a huge RNG grind for the best weapons so you can... keep grinding I guess?

It's certainly not bad in that respect, but I just don't have the patience for too many of those types of gaming experiences - especially with the inconsistency resulting from a dwindling playerbase. And for the largely singleplayer experience I DID have, consisting of primarily of campaign & exploration, I honestly did have a good time with Generation Zero. A little buggy and jank, but consistently engaging and tense.

The heavy robots take thousands of rounds of ammo to take down.. hundreds of explosives.. I am using level 5 weapons.. my dream was to get an experimental weapon and now I'm just giving up. Once you get to level 5, you need 280000 points to reach the next level.. and get another skill point. I find myself taking a hour or more to try and take down one robot.. waste all my ammo... all my health... oh then the game crashes.. when you get back into the game all the ammo you shot is gone, the health you used is gone, but oh wait the robot you were trying to take down is back to full health.

It's shameful. This game could have been better. All that being said, yes, I would recommend this game. My hope is that some coder will come along and fix the stability, maybe suggest..

This objective never cleared no matter how many kits I made. It pains me to have to abandon the game since I really enjoyed the foreboding atmosphere. The threat from the bots is made palpable by often HEARING them before seeing them. I also enjoyed the simple stealthy mechanics as I tried to evade the bots while traveling between locations. Hopefully the developer fixes the bugs (and the atrocious UI*) as I would love to give it another opportunity.

Not the least problematic is the fact that YOU CANNOT PAUSE THIS GAME. Get a phone call in the middle of a firefight and you're dead.
Objectives disappear off the map, rendering missions unfinishable FOREVER. Objectives you are meant to destroy are invulnerable until you somehow retrigger the mission or reboot the game.
Inventory GUIs bug out until you reboot the game.
Enemies flying 300m in the air detect you when you're 200m below the surface of the earth in a bunker.
Enemies one shot you from half a km away with no warning even when you're crawling on your stomach in dense foliage.
The balance of encounters is inconceivably brutal, making you wonder how sadomasochistic the beta testers were (if there were beta testers AT ALL)
Field radios disappear if you need to exit the game and come back.
It purports to be a sandbox but its very much on strict rails, so much so that if you explore too far before triggering a mission, that story mission can be UNFINISHABLE. 
It doesn't know if it wants to be a looter/shooter/rpg or a base building game, leaving you to mostly gather resources and manage your inventory 95% of the time if you want to even slightly progress.

At the start, it had a lovely eerie quality about it as you tried to figure out what happened to all the people.

Sadly, over the many updates and changes that this game has had, it has become more of a regular Player versus Everything first person 'kill everything that moves' style straightforward shooter.


Updated below:

So, it still has some strange quirks:

1) The Reaper - occasionally goes into a kind of 'trance'. Shield goes up permanently and lights are yellow (searching), but seems oblivious to your presence and doesn't react. In this state, you can't kill it. 


2) The companion - IMO, the Devs made it too much like some disobedient bandy-legged puppy, and strategically it has little value in its current state. You can't really do stealth when it is staring at you lighting you up with whatever colour you chose (because there is no option for 'None' in its 'appearance' configuration settings) instead of looking in the direction you are watching. At night-time, its strong light will fog your scope view.

It clatters about noisily with all its flashy lights and ""Woo-Woo"" sound effects, and ignores its surroundings until it is attacked. It won't take evasive action when being fired upon (the Lynx machines do), and a lot of the time it faces the opposite direction while looking for the aggressor. 

I find the noises it makes are far too loud, and makes it impossible to listen for audio cues in your surroundings - it all just gets drowned out, so you can't tell where your enemies are.

It's like being followed around by a walking arcade machine.

You can't control it once it is deployed. You have no ability to set a target for it (binocular target tagging doesn't work with it), nor recall it once it starts chasing after something. 

It seems to prioritise targets in the distance rather than the immediate dangers close to you, and will attack machines that may have been previously unaware of your presence. It kind of creates more trouble than it solves because of this.

When it is in one of its 'frenzied' states attacking distant targets, I imagine some hysterically laughing child running around and throwing stones at strangers seemingly oblivious to the consequences of its actions.

The game periodically relocates the companions position to allow it to keep up with you if it is unable to traverse the terrain. Problem is that it relocates to the position you are standing at, and I have been launched into the air many times because of this, and even got thrown off a cliff on two occasions.

Its rocket launcher weaponry seems to behave strangely too. The rockets are affected by gravity, and this limits the effective range as the rockets will frequently fall short of the mark. In contrast, the FNIX runners using the same launchers don't appear to have this problem, and have a far greater range.

I admit that there were quite a few times when I wished it would go play ""Fetch"" with a live grenade.

Overall, the companion is a nice concept, but really poorly executed. Its AI (Artificial Idiot??) needs some serious work to make it a decent advantage.


3) Disappearances - randomly, machines (including the companion) will just vanish. Seems to happen mostly in the Farmlands region, but I have had it happen elsewhere.
When it happens to the companion, its corresponding option becomes 'greyed out' on the equipment wheel, and cannot be reinstated until you get to a companion station. - A serious disadvantage if you were in a fight at the time it disappeared.


4) Positional glitching - just occasionally, the machines will instantaneously flip to another location. Appears to be totally random, but definitely more noticeable after recent updates.


5) Machines spawn underground. Quite often, I'll get some rival or other that you have seen from afar somehow disappears underground by the time you have reached its position. It shows as right next to you on the map, but nowhere to be seen in the world.


6) Occasionally, stuff disappears from the PLUNDRA storage box. I thought for a while it was just me, but its happened too often to be a mistake.


Sadly it is still [i]very[/i] unstable. 

I don't think it is worth buying right now. The constant bugs seem to be breaking more stuff than they fix. Do yourself a favour and avoid the stress.

Cons:  Not enough key rebind availability.  There are keys you will not be able to change but are the most important ones to need to change.  The game crashes outright at least once per session.

The main issue turned out to be the same reason why I'm revisiting many of the games I didn't like.
I started playing it in multiplayer coop with people who simply don't play the same way as me, and keep rushing forward.
Therefore, I missed on a ton of stuff that makes this game far, far more enjoyable for me.

I've reinstalled it and deleted old character, starting from scratch. Actually watching intro sequence, reading the quest logs, reading goddamn two sentence descriptions on items and ammo, and paying attention to the environment.
Turns out - it is all spelled out how to play the game better.

There are weakpoints - you see them as graffiti on the wall, with drawings of what's armoured, what's weak.
Different ammo types say pretty clearly what are they good at.
When you crank up the difficulty to difficult, items have an actual use because you can die quite easily, and adrenaline shots don't come for cheap. Also, medkits melt away pretty quickly.

Crafting received an overhaul (or I didn't notice it before), but now you have multiple levels and you get to reinforce your clothing - so you can pick what you wanna wear and then add bonuses to it, and these bonuses eventually do make a difference.
Plus - stuff like weapon augments cost a lot so scavenging for loot and recycling what you don't need really becomes a necessity.

I don't know how much of this due to game changing over time, and how much is it because I didn't have a chance to learn how to play properly before - but its worth the money and worth the time.

Plus its still fucking gorgeous.



Original review:
I keep waiting for something to happen in the game, that'll push it above the 'meh', but I don't think it'll happen.

The graphics are out of this world! I don't recall seeing a better looking game in a VERY long time!
But the gameplay?
You run, you gun, you loot.
The sad thing is, running (ie. riding your bicycle) around is the most fun thing because, again, graphics and environment are fucking gorgeous!

Robots just aren't interesting to fight. To begin with you don't know what ammo are you supposed to be using. You get typical HP/AP ammo, and you'd think - well I'm shooting metal, so AP for everything but not the case - HP is better to shoot weakpoints. Thing is  its not very clear what the weakspots are! You get to unlock skills to see enemies highlighted with binoculars but even with full upgrades - you don't get to see what the weakpoints are. Terminator: Resistance does this WAY better.

Second, guns are interesting - but kind of don't matter. Robots move fast and shoot hard. Since you either don't know or can't see what the weakpoints are, all strategy falls flat so you just empty ammo as much as you can.

You have helper items, but most require you to get fairly close to the enemies. Sure you could be stealthing around but why? You can just start shooting and win the gunfight without much problem anyway. You have plenty of ammo and health to keep going. PLENTY!

And now the weakest issue.
Crafting and looting everything seems to have been a _crucial_ aspect of the game because you can find stuff lying EVERYWHERE so exploration pays off - or at least it pays off in getting everything.
But what do you do with all those items?
Well, nothing.
I have no idea why this game even has crafting. For 3 hours I found 2 recipes and they're both useless. 80% recipes go to armour/clothes crafting, the rest 20% is ammo and 3 types of medikits. Clothes crafting is, btw, useless because bonuses are +1% and +2% - so it is basically cosmetics.
The ammo and health? Lets just say that I have so much ammo that I'm voluntarily rushing to the robots with the baseball bat, out of boredom. Is it dangerous you ask? No not really. I also have over 40 medikits. In rare case that I ""die"", I am just going to use one of my 20 adrenaline shots to revive myself, right there on the spot, run behind nearby cover, heal, and keep going.

I got more guns than I have time to experiment and find what works, and none is really interesting. Shotgun + running up close is still the favorite tactic.

It is so, so sad, how much potential this game has/had, and I just feel it all ended up being 'meh' because it seems they couldn't figure out what kind of game are they building, a shooter or a survival game.

IMO, you're way better off going with Terminator Resistance, but if you have extra money, its sort of worth to see just how effin gorgeous the game is, and how poor the gameplay is.",1617145958,1708119048,True,0,0,0.480616152286529541,0,True,False,False

[h2] Pros [/h2]
- unique and exciting enemy designs
- beautiful graphics
- fantastic and diverse environmental storytelling
- sound design (especially for machines!) is very well made
- works solo & co-op
- huge arsenal of weapons with lots of customization
- multiple different enemy types, each with their own variations in difficulty and loadout
- simple but enjoyable light survival elements
- big open world


[h2] Cons [/h2]
- random crashes despite patches
- nieche gameplay loop (some may find it boring and repetetive)
- bloated/fragmented with DLC, much of which should be basegame content
- quests feel unimportant
- lategame leaves not much room for weapon variety
- water immobilizes you and teleports you back instead of letting you swim or float
- game advertises itself as a stealth experience when in mid- to lategame (majority of playtime) you run around guns blazing, yielding rocket launchers and other loud aggresive weaponry


[h2] Verdict [/h2]
I've been playing GZ since late 2021 when it was on steam sale for just a few bucks. Looking back this was one of the best purchases I've ever made and occasionally I even feel bad for having bought it so cheap instead of full price considering how great the game can be. Environments are desolate, abandoned, conquered by machines and left behind for the dead. Environmental storytelling is suggesting a family was hiding here, trying to flee when they were caught. In panic they left their things behind. Not far away dead bodies scatter the streets. They didn't make it. Just like other families in other locations. You're on your own. Early game is tense, sometimes even frightening. Guns sound raw, aggressive, they're loud, echoing through the woods. Machines wandering through the foliage, scouting in the open fields, announcing their presence with engine sounds and synthesized noises and observing the place with their lamps and scanners. This game is a treat. 


[h2] Wishes for the future [/h2]
- a dense city, more than just a hand full of blocks and houses
- nerf Firebirds (their crit spots are so tiny and their damage output is so huge)
- less DLC milking (i know they gotta make money somehow but y'know)
- complete remake of the game, the code is spaghetti beyond belief and fixes introduce new issues seemingly everywhere. remaking it from the ground up with the knowledge of what goes where in terms of programming would surely not only help performance but also troubleshooting and bugfixing, thus resulting in a easier experience for both players and developers
- open up the other islands

I switched this to I would recommend this game because the devs have made improvements to several of my main issues with the game. It's not really the game for me anymore but I downloaded it again and played an hour, it was much more enjoyable than my initial time with the game. Combat felt better, inventory is worked out much better, and seems like a game I would have enjoyed when I had more time on my hands.

As a single player experience this game lacks enough substance to keep you interested in playing it.

The scenery is beautiful. Visually, it's a treat. The way robots move and respond to being shot and destroyed is really incredible. Unfortunately, that's all there really is to this game. After a few hours I found myself equally drawn to and bored with the game which is a bizarre feeling. I would get excited to fire it up only to be incredibly bored within 5-10 minutes of traveling the bleak countryside.

I feel the following would drastically improve this game:
- Melee attack, even a kick.
- Better inventory system, remember when something is quick slotted so you don't have to constantly map med kits.
- Decide what you are and do one of those things well. Survival? Action? RPG? This current mashup doesn't work.
- Balance combat encounters. No reason to have waves and waves of bots in single player.
- Reward non-combat actions like sneaking with XP.
- More realistic weight. Shouldn't be able to carry all these guns and stuff and somehow be under 40 lbs of weight. If it's a survival game, have people make hard choices.

And the biggest one:
- ADD NPCS. This world feels incredibly hollow. Imagine Pub G with no players, just (literally) bots. I understand this is supposed to be a bleak game. But there needs to be a larger variety of encounters other than meeting the same couple of robots and looting houses. The whole thing looks nice but has little substance.

I feel like better encounters could add a lot. 

Example: you're traveling this insanely large countryside on foot and come across a shootout on the road. Civilians vs. some robots. You should be able to help people fight off robots. Or choose not to and loot their corpses when they lose to the robots. Maybe you see the military in a firefight. Or the cops. But you only ever see dead bodies and the aftermath. 

There's just nothing going on here other than a sandbox like environment with some ""occasionally"" enjoyable shootouts.

The visuals, sounds and ""vibe"" this game has are really special. I want to be there, running around shooting robots. But the game mechanics and underlying foundation are just too weak. There's not enough reward to rationalize the time commitment. I'm going to monitor how this game evolves and will update the review if I give it another try.",1586518003,1707643924,True,0,0,0.511784493923187256,0,True,False,False

DO NOT get this game if you're planning on playing co-op with friends. The missions ONLY GIVE EXP TO HOST so when the host is like level 7, you'll be level 4 and you will have to participate in all the fights to get exp. I think it's pretty standard for co-op games to share EXP and progression for everyone in the playthrough. In order to catch up with the host, you literally just have to play by yourself and finish the pre-requisites for the mission. After some digging, apparently after the New Dawn update on 2022-06-23, they fucked the co-op exp system and haven't bothered to fix it then. There's no fucking way the game is still updating with a lunar new year update on 2-10-2024 and they haven't fixed this co-op shit.

I haven't gotten far with my friends but this 'co-op' game is really just a single player game where your friends are there to shoot with you. All the loot is instanced and nothing is shared, you can't delegate someone to specialize towards crafting a specific thing.

Sound design was pretty decent, the enemies were cool, the robots moved in cool ways put up some challenge.

The vehicle starting bike was fucking dogshit and only does well on roads. There's the buggiest interactions when you're off road and you're bumping into nothing.

Graphics were decent, everything looked smooth, no crashes.

Shooting was alright, nothing bad or janky about it.

The gameplay is generally pretty alright. The lore and general gamefeel, as well as the graphics, are pretty good and generally serve their functions. The weapons feel pretty good and the combat is overall challenging without too much frustration (to a point). 

However, the post-story (DLCs included or not) content is lackluster. It's more than likely that your options are going to be mostly Base Assault/Defense missions or trying to spawn a Reaper Tank, both of which are time-intensive and even then aren't guaranteed to yield you what you want, especially seeing as killing a Reaper means being able to kill it fast enough (easier said than done) for a CHANCE at an Experimental Sledgehammer, which might not necessarily be worthwhile. If you're particularly committed, you might find yourself hunting for collectibles and trying (emphasis on trying) to get most of the weapons at 5 crowns, but even then I can't personally guarantee you will succeed without spending longer than I did before I gave up. So if anything, the endgame is monotonous and your mileage will vary depending on your pace.

Replayability is... dodgy. There are achievements in place for making more than one character, but the only way I imagine playing this again after so much time sank into it is with another friend, which is part of why I was able to stomach the next topic for as long as I did (which was fairly frequently).

The most frustrating and the major dealbreaker is the amount of crashes the game is prone to - and especially how these crashes happen. 

Namely that you can't tell what it is that causes said crash. 

It could be you deploying your Runner companion.

It could've been the death of a nearby machine.

It just might be you walking into a random spot in a DLC because... reasons. Looking at you, FNIX Rising. 

Or it could be you interacting with a box or container. 

Literally ANYTHING could set off a crash. The only mercy is that the game is quick to save progress, but if the game crashes, say, mid-Base Defense mission, you get punished for the janky code by having to reclaim your base and spending hard-earned Command Tokens. 

Oh right, and did you know the crash reports don't necessarily always work? That when your crashes just randomly happen, the crash reports crash too! 

H o w ? W h y?

TL;DR: Fun little RPG-style FPS experience of Swedish Terminator without the time travel, but it being prone to crashes, bugs and unreliable RNG (for even the RNG can be glitched, go figure) to recommend for everyone. Not sure if the devs will/can fix their code without having to sacrifice a can of surströmming, three freshly-made dalahästs and a Swedish pop music mixtape to Lord Baphomet, but here's to hoping.",1706831472,1707332615,False,33,1,0.670929491519927979,5,True,False,False

I will mark my revised review with *** so you know when my original (negative) review ends and my new (positive) review begins.

I bought and installed GZ day 1. I played with a buddy of mine from day 1 too, so the issues I experienced are not because I played solo.

I miss Generation Zero 1.0. It was quirky and unbalanced, and for a lot of people it was rife with some pretty extreme gamebreaking bugs (though not for me fortunately). But when it worked... it WORKED. It had a stunning aesthetic, fantastic sound design, varied weapons, tactics, and a deep xp calculation system dependent on the number, type, and grade of enemies as well as the result of the engagement. It was a fun hybrid teamplay/party game. You could be super strategic and stealthy and use traps, or you could goof off and chuck fireworks and boomboxes while dancing. It was great.

I played generation Zero with my buddy for about a month straight, we each had about 50 hours logged in. But the bugs got so bad that he uninstalled and said he'd wait until it got fixed. I played about another 50 hours solo and life was good.

Two updates killed the fun for me: the May update and the June-July update. 

The may update significantly nerfed the frequency of adrenaline drops. You need adrenaline to revive yourself AND anyone you're playing with. Yes, it was a little insane to loot like 2 houses and have 15+ adrenaline, but it compensated for the game's punishing enemies and fights would drag out and you'd be on low health and realize ""oh poop i have no adrenaline left"". Was it balanced? Probably not, but it was FUN. 

The June-July updates did two things. First, it changed the XP system to only reward flat amounts for enemies killed. This was done in response to an leveling exploit. Rather than fixing it, avalanche just removed one of the more interesting aspects of the game. Before, taking on big fights was gratifying, even without adrenaline, because even if you lost you'd still get a ton of experience for even fighting in the first place. It encouraged you to endure failure. That incentive is gone now. Was it balanced? Probably not, but it was FUN

The second thing this update did was all physical objects that weren't in boxes or lootables could only be picked up once. This was because there were a few key places in the game where you could snag legendary weapons or tons of gear, ammo, and meds super quickly and super early on. You could literally loot a location, fast travel away, and fast travel back to all the gear respawning. You could do this at key locations like Borokugan or Stenhaga Farm and get like 30 standard medkits. This compensated for the now impossibly rare adrenaline drops and the unbalanced enemies, ESPECIALLY when solo. It also felt like you were raiding caches other fighters left for you. This was 100% an exploit of the game's mechanics, but the devs didn't compensate for the overall reduction. Was it balanced? Probably not, but it was- okay, you sensing a pattern here?

Remember that buddy I mentioned? I finally got him to play again. We did one session last week.

We died all the time and finding useful materials other than ammo was frustrating. I fully searched two command bunkers and only found 8 medkits that healed 25 health each. Robots deal 50-90 damage with each shot, and almost all of them fire automatic weapons. It got so bad that we had to lure a pack of robots to a safehouse and just kept peeking corners and dying and respawning a dozen times over until the enemies were finally destroyed. 

He was cool about it, but I won't be playing this game with him again, maybe ever. I may jump back in after this review for the nostalgia, but the most fun I've had playing Generation Zero is over. 

If you want a good coop shooter, love yourself and buy Deep Rock Galactic instead.

***

The main reason why I left a negative review for generation zero so long ago was for two reasons: polish and balance. The game was not very stable (and still isn't, but we'll get to that), and the game was made more difficult (through eliminating sources for medkits yet machines remaining deadly). The game is significantly more balanced, particularly around mobility and aim. Targeting robotic components is now especially rewarding and medkits appear just often enough where you don't feel starved of them yet still wish you had more. And hey, if you want more, you can always craft them. 

So many extremely fun (free) features have been introduced. I will address (most) of them one by one.

1. Base building. Probably my favorite feature, what I would consider the endgame of generation zero. When first introduced you could only build one base and I found it highly contrived and lore-breaking (we have to stay on the run and hide out in bunkers, why on earth are we building a base in the open?) Now you can build bases everywhere in the form of control points which can be lost and retaken. It feels much more like a proper push and pull now. There are many buildable structures and defenses. The system is a bit bare bones but you can sink a lot of time building the fortress of your dreams. 

2. Experimental weapons: my favorite feature in moment-to-moment gameplay. I just wish there were more variants. Just be warned, nearly every high level player in public matchmaking will be using the experimental 50-cal. Get used to the constant humming sound the weapon makes due to the experimental electronics. I won't spoil the special properties of each experimental, you'll have to find them yourself (my only complaint because the drop system for how you can various experimentals sucks, its totally random and you can get duplicates).

3. Weapon upgrades: another fantastic change - it makes your regular weapons competitive with experimental ones. I recommend an EMP detonation LMG. 

4. Crafting: a change that frankly should have been in the game at launch. It could be better or more fleshed out with special animations like in The Forest. But it does the job. 

5. Paid weapon packs: your milage will vary. It's good that every weapon pack comes with three weapons, so you're likely to get something you want in each of them (The Soviet pack has a sniper rifle, an assault rifle, and an RPG so that's a pretty wide spread). Most offer trade-offs that make them effective side-grades to the vanilla weapons. For example, the AS VAL has a lower magazine capacity and cant mount scopes, but it has a high rate of fire and an integrated suppressor. The RPG has good damage and faster reload, but it has proprietary ammunition and no option for EMP rockets. 

WARNING: the first US weapon pack and the resistance weapon pack are trash. Particularly, the first US weapon pack is especially low quality. The M60 has no rear sight, the bow is silent but with pitiful range. Don't bother with them. 

6: Story DLC packs: both good. Obviously FNIX rising is very unstable at the moment and I haven't bought it. But as I understand it's very heavily story based which I like, and Alpine Unrest is a great endgame DLC. Fun snow environment, one or two cool story moments. I hope they continue making more.

All in all, Generation Zero's post launch support is actually awesome and the game started well and it going well, with an admittedly rough patch in the middle. 

Deep Rock Galactic is still better but maybe that's an unfair comparison.   ",1585766203,1707080915,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,3,True,False,False

There are unexpected crashes at any time for no apparent reason, then they ask you to send a crash report, but I feel like it doesn't help much. The only 2 characters that appear, 1 was invisible until recently they made him appear. It's a shame for a game that gives such good expectations but has so many playability problems.

-The story, albeit I havent finished it, is great.
-The Swedish voice acting makes you feel really immersed with the game.
-The open world is visually stunning. Im willing to compare it to the Elder Scrolls (mainly 4 and 5) and the Fallout series.
-10/10 sound design. Not even a question.
-AAA game visual style.
-Great variety of enemies, guns, perks, clothing and modifications.
-Gun play, enemy weakspots, and deadly enemies equals to an amazing combat system.
-Giant killer robots. 
-Companion robot doggo. 10/10.
-(Possible) funny robot ragdolls and physics.
-Autosave feature. A true lifesaver to be honest.

Cons:
-Bugs. They exist. I havent encountered many, but they do exist.
-Achievements. I outright didnt even get some achievements, like the ""Not today, FNIX"" achievement. I've killed countless Rivals, yet, to the game, it seems like...I didnt even kill one?
-The frame rate. When going around in the world, everything is fine. Entering a giant radioactive crater: immediate 15 fps and below. Yucky.
-Game crashes. Sometimes just fast traveling somewhere crashes the game. 
-The privacy policy controversy. An instant turn off and refund for most people. I heard they take pretty much all your data. I myself couldnt care less about this, but it definitely is a major issue. 
-Unfair balancing for DLC weapons. I dont own any paid DLCs for this game, but Ive heard some weapons take the challenge aspect away from the game.
-Lack of vehicles, and their balancing. I feel like an open world game like this should have more vehicle options, other than a bike (which is pretty nice) and a motorcycle (which is pretty ass). The motorcycle is only 8kph faster than the bike on road, which is seriously dissapointing. Instead, maybe we could have a small car, or better yet, a Swedish tank of any kind we could unlock through the story or someway else (balancing would probably be hell, but it would still be awesome, overpowered or not).
-""Unused"" structures. A lot of structures, mainly FNIX ones, are just there as decorations. Im saying supercomputers, and research facilities. While there is some loot, its really dissapointing they dont have an actual function.

Seeing as this is an almost 5 year old game, it is pretty unfinished. Putting aside the bad parts about the game, you can definitely see that the developers put love and care into it, and continue to do so. In time, I believe this game can make it really big. It has AAA qualities, but in terms of all the bad things about it, it still has a long way of fixes and balancing it needs. I love it to death, and will be buying all the DLCs and copleting the game. I see a bright future for it, and I hope Im right. 
Definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys massive robots, a great story, great gunplay and an overall unique game.
Generation Zero is a hidden gem, but definitely dont buy it at full price.

P.S.
Just to clarify, Im not hating on the developers for all the cons about the game. Making a video game, let alone one with a size like this, is probably really damn hard. I praise them for continuing to improve their game, and fix issues about it. Im happy they didnt give up on this game, and keep updating it 'till this day.

(Might update my review after completing the game, or they make great changes about it.)

Or you can just, roam around and shoot robots, find houses and loot them, fight bigger robots for 10 minutes, then loot them and the houses around you, then you get completely circled and camp inside a house for 25 minutes trying to kill the 600 robots just running around the house (cause they cannot get inside houses you can just chill there till they forget about you, riveting gameplay i know)

And they are not gonna work on the stuff they have to improve, but they are going to add like 20 more DLCs and maybe make a plushie cause why not.

So yeah a lot of potential but it's buggy and after a few hours unbearably repetitive, if you want to buy it wait for a sale.

The main story revolves around trying to find out what happened while you were gone away on a boat trip, where suddenly there are lots of hostile robots everywhere and almost all people have evacuated. 

There are a couple of side missions that can keep you playing for many hours and plenty of areas to discover on the map. However, I felt that the loot/stuff you can discover, and the houses was too similar after a while, so it wasn’t as fun anymore. It’s perhaps one of those games that you are supposed to play a little bit every now and then so you don’t get bored. 

The main missions had a decent story, but it became repetitive after a while: go to this area, shoot all the robots and/or press this button and so on.  The most fun was all the Swedish voices - audio recordings that you can find in the game, and looking at the shops and remember how cheap things were back then.

Apart from the missions, you can customize your weapons and clothing to give you an extra boost in damage, defense and things like that. In order to customize things, you need to find collectibles or do side-missions, and I felt that this part was very unbalanced and too time consuming. The boost wasn’t really worth it.

The co-op gameplay had no issues, and the only bugs I encountered was that in some cramped places you could get stuck – so always carry around some explosives to blast you away.

This is a tech demo with an open world attached. They didn't even have the stones to actually license the artist whose work they based this entire game on, Simon Stalenhag. Maybe with his art direction this would've been worthwhile, but no.

The gunplay and combat is actually fantastic, and the soundtrack is damn good synth, but the Game Itself is just not here. This is 60+ hours of agonizingly slow travel and maybe 3-4 hours of combat.

Maybe they wanted the players to feel the sense of alienation and wonder that Stalenhag's works evoke, but this world is just dead. Not alien, not even robotic, just dead.
I'm going to keep playing it to see if anything changes, but I'm not hopeful.

Either this game is lazy and cynical, or a depressingly unfinished overambitious game.
There are better disappointments to be had. Spend your money elsewhere.

After Playing this for a while I have realised there are many bugs and problems in this game which are frustrating
1: If you are looking to 100% collecting all things in town such as missions and weapons  you'll find your self quite frustrated as such some Side missions I've picked up doesn't register on the map as being picked up.
2: I can't unlock for me anyway, all final tiers of bullet proof clothing schematics.
3: wondering into new named area's sometimes they won't put the icon onto the map.
4: there is a glitch in the terrain in a specific place in a bunker which can cause you to glitch out of the map.
5: Items placement which looks cool for Eg. a Medikit placed above an oven but makes it hard or impossible to collect due to weird let say oven hit box hovering over the item, most times I have to jump on top of the oven or other house object to collect said Item even though I am clearly close enough. ;(
6: getting stuck in the terrain.
7: This is a funny one, I have seen giant mechanised corpses fly randomly FAR off into the distance or clipping into the terrain and dancing.
8: Sound glitches recently far into my playtime, and sounds at certain places like there are large robots nearby but aren't at all.
9: Plenty of Crashes as of 26/01/24

There are many good points to this game as well.
1: Very challenging and death is almost certain in this game if you are not careful
2: Can often be very large amount of Machine enemies fighting you making it fun and challenging fights (sometimes frustrating)
3: Variety of Machines and tiers of machines which make it more difficult and interesting with two factions
4: HUGE map with Loads of areas to explore and find.
5: Many fun and interesting tiered weapons and items to find
6: Plenty of Missions, side missions, collectable's to find
7: You can deal with the enemy in a variety of ways
8: Explosions ;)
9: Levels, specific skill classes, Challenges, Daily missions which keep it interesting and fun
10: Fun and playable even for Single players like myself even though it is mainly a co-op game
11: Lot's of Ammo if you search and collect a lot.
12: crafting a variety of stuff such as Equipment and ammo, improving your clothing.
13: Various DLC to make the Game more interesting and support the devs doing it.",1575111416,1706244194,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit:
The developers fixed the problem.  It is good to see that they listened and took the time to fix it.

Edit 2:
The game is fun to play when it works.
But, it crashes frequently.

SUPER UNBALANCED: Not enough health or ammo to fight the robots that i know will never be fixed so what the point.

What the point of this stupid written game every one is dead and all i'm doing is cleaning up the mess for who the ghost of the dead.   This could of been a cool game with a huge war going on and i would be the hero fighting in the middle of this huge war saving life's.  All this awesome looking maps with nothing but left over is what this is.  {What am i,} ""JOHNNY COME LATELY!  
  I my self did not even finish the game but my son did and when i seen how poor of an ending this game had i wonder how anything else is going to really matter to this point they add in the game.  Well it's not the real ending but sure seem like it and that just after it is just the same game of who is left too save.
""Why we have no vehicles to drive""!
I really like the game idea but i had to use cheats just to play this game and most of my friends that played quit due to the poor unbalanced issue.   
 I acknowledge i don't have the acquired skills, time, money and people to make a better game but that doesn't mean i can't point out flaws.  I genuinely want to see this game improve and making comments detailing bugs, flaws in game play, and whatever else you find significant that needs to be changed so that the game dev's can get a clearer perspective on what they should fix.
WHEN LISTED ISSUE ARE FIXED I WILL CHANGE MY REVIEW TO THUMBS UP!

That aside, being a primarily single player and only cooperative game, they have you tied to their servers constantly.

They also don't allow mods, which is a shame because mods would really elevate the game if you could turn it into something like STALKER with robots, which it already almost is.

As to the game and gameplay itself, it's fine. The ballistics is laughable, like a .380 is supposed to damage steel plating, but for the common European it's fine.

After all this time GZ is so much fun to play.

Updated Review after latest patch:

It has taken them a couple of years but this game is shaping up. I was able to play a few hours, no crashes, looting worked fine, fighting was fun and intense. In solo play you are better off moving slowing, using  the terrain for cover to take out the robots or avoiding the fight all together. So those saying it is hard single player, l2p.

Dev's you can do so much more with this crafting and skill system. How about more specialized skill paths to be the groups medic, or pistoleer, sniper, and what about being able to rebuild one of the runners as a pet, to be that second gun in single player? Use the crafting system to mod out your pet with different guns you find. Also Dev team, the xp rate is crazy slow, I mean sincerely... making the game a level grind for skills does not make it fun. Most players want to feel they are progressing and only getting half way to level 2 by the time you reach the sports field is crazy crazy slow after all the encounters and finishing up to 5 mission objectives by that point. Please do something about that... You make this game a fun progression game with really cool cosmetic content and maybe the pet system mentioned, you'd have a true gem.

I'm saying thumbs up right now Feb 2022. I look forward to seeing what else is coming.




Review at release:

I wanted to love this game so bad, I watched most every live dev stream on Twitch. I was in their Discord, I pre-ordered, got several friends to pre-order. 

The game is broken, it should have remained in beta with some open beta weekends for at least 3-4 more months. I kept crashing every 15-20min. I didn't so much mind that every house was almost the exact same and the action was par at best and all the character models looked like hot garbage up close.

I still have total faith the company will have this game top notch in time. For now though just from my experience it was unplayable and just not ready for release. Don't waste your money people.

This is the last game I'll ever pre-order. This game was the last straw to push me over the edge on buying crowdfunded or pre-ordering games. The industry is declining, game companies just throw out half finished games to meet the investors demands and not the demands of the gaming community. Between perpetual early access, loot boxes, constant DLCs to buy etc. Maybe after 40ish years of gaming I'm just burnt out, maybe I'm just hanging on to the glory days of gaming when you could beta for free, or play a demo or shareware, maybe I just don't get that this is acceptable to this generation of gamers... I just know that as long as gamers continue to buy into and support junk being throw out here on us the game industry will just keep doing it. Maybe there should be laws in place to force the industry to truly deliver what they promise on release. Whatever needs to be done because at this rate we are in for another game crash like the one that happened in the mid-80s with Atari carts.

I usually don't do reviews, but due to the devs not fixing bugs, which crash your game and essentially softlocking you, it forces me to leave this negative review. The review will stay until they finally fix the bugs.

In some missions (for me, it's the Ringfort mission), the game always crashes. For me, it crashes almost immediatly, so no way of just running away to work around that problem. This essentially softlocks me and I'm unable to play.

To be clear, the game is pretty good (so far, I'm obviously not done yet). But these crashes really are not only annoying, but game breaking. It would be nice if the devs would finally fix these bugs and maybe, idk, don't release another overpriced DLC with a bike or something.[/strike]

Edit: They finally fixed alot of bugs/crashes in the latest hotfix, including the one I was stuck at. Therefore, I change this review to positive as promised. I'm not done yet, but so far it is a pretty good game. But I also recommend to read or watch a detailed review about this game.

There are only two major issues I have with this game:
[olist]
    [*]It operates with checkpoints, instead of normal superior save games (auto-save and manual saves). To be fair, the checkpoints work quite well, but normal save game systems are still superior.
    [*]The pause menu does not pause the game. So if you just quickly need to go open the door, go to the toilet, answer a call, you better not be in the middle of a fight or else you will die.

1 - There are bugs, glitches, and texture pop ins. Nothing unheard of, but same are game-breaking (like quests not finishing or spawning the machines needed to beat it) to absolutely benign (getting clicked thru the floor/stuck on environment) and sometimes NPCs will 'poof' outta existence but still trigger - no clue why. Your 'profile' avatar will likely disappear after playing for awhile but again - easily fixed by relogging back in.

2 - Can be played solo or co-op'd but personally I'd recommend this be ran as a multiplayer game. Co-op makes the game, especially on harder difficulties, because you'll have that extra pair of hands and eyes watching your back because I can't begin to count how many times I took a cheap-shot to my back or not detect a machine quick enough. 

3 - The weapon DLC's are a mixed bag, but I'd say if you want to expand your arsenal and have the variety, go ahead, but its not needed. 

The landscapes had me walking through the woodland areas, open fields, and country-side despite the robotic threat because the game has it's moments where its beautiful - even mid-fire fight its still like easy to see the detail work put into nature. 

Not being able to swim is an odd choice but there's no penalty for flying off into deep water. Vehicle speeds over off-road terrain make me not want to drive vehicles.

It's rough around the edges, and sometimes it can be a little too janky for its own good but overall, it's a solid enough game to enjoy with a partner or some mates over a weekend, or, you can dedicate more time than that because I believe the game is still being worked on.",1705309147,1705309147,True,1,0,0.507672667503356934,0,True,False,False

Items you'd think would be added as something to unlock, like the bike with the crafting stuff and whatnot, are instead paid dlc.

The main thing about missions is just going to places, killing robots, and interacting with stuff. Which will eventually make you burn out.

Can you have fun with friends? Yes. When the game doesn't crash. The further in the game you get, the more it will crash.

I don't recommend buying this game unless it is less then 10 dollars and you plan on playing it with friends. Even then, you might be tempted to buy some of the DLC to improve your experience. So think about it before you do so.

Friends cannot use the DLC weaponry if they don't own the DLC but you do; They can however interact with the crafting stuff on the bike.

The first island is great but things completely change as you enter the main island, the base building is weird and doesn't fit imo. Shooting is okay but It does feel a bit clunky, everything seems to have been designed around a controller for some reason? menu's are weird and the ui gets taking used to. The AI of the bots is atrocious, most fights come down to getting them stuck on terrain where they can't hurt you and the ability to hit you even with no direct line of sight is annoying. 

BUT the sound design is some of the best I've heard, guns are deafening. Firing a shotgun indoors sounds like a jump scare in itself. enemies sound amazing, absolutely terrifying, especially the tank, i just wish the AI could keep up with that level of fear. Nothing quite puts the fear of god into you like hearing a tank run toward you at full tilt for the first time, hunters match that as well, even the dogs are pretty effective when you first encounter them at the start.

This game had a lot of potential but It feels like the idea changed half way through. With your only interaction of ai being the bots, the actual ai itself is very important. And it's probably the weakest part of the game, i don't envy trying to make it competent as you would either need to make it possible to destroy bases (The none player made ones) or work overtime on something that can traverse the terrain and maybe work with the smaller bots more effectively. Some sort of synergy where they send out dogs/hunters and don't just sit still waiting for you to peak out. Idk, a lot of work would need to be done to make the AI as threatening, or at least as engaging as you would expect it to be, but I still enjoy the atmosphere and satisfaction of hunting these giant robots

The game's negatives outweigh the positives, but I commend them on one thing. Modern games for some reason don't like to make guns sound good, or explosives for that matter.

Pros  - 
Good sound design. Everything feels impactful, and immediately catches your attention. Shooting guns feels good.
Killing big stompy robots feels good. Killing robots in general feels satisfying.

Neutral -
Game is in Sweden, and foreign languages are used for the voice acting with English subtitles. I'm not completely 100% certain on the story because I had a hard time paying attention. Granted, this is neutral instead of a positive because it's creative. There was too many block of texts for me to read all of it, but the story was okay.

Cons -
Suffers from generic Open World syndrome. I have 30 hours but how many of that was spent running, traveling and etc. was too damn high.

Story quests devolved to find bunker, find mission board, do mostly the same quests for 10 zones. I found myself running from area to area, only doing the main missions. On top of that, the main game had a lackluster ending. The bulk of the game that is fun is fighting robots, not the story itself.

Inventory sorting/management was... very taxing. No way to keep certain items in your inventory from being dismantled/put into the storage made a good chunk of the game turn into dismantling simulator. When I got to near max capacity in weight, I would always scrap everything I wasn't using. The weight system also made me default to one gun, but that was also for other reasons.

Enemies later on are way too god damn health spongey, and despite the good sound feedback, it's difficult to gauge if the damage numbers on a gun matter or not. A .50 cal felt less useful than my LMG because 10 shots wasn't enough to kill most things, and I was constantly reloading. Meanwhile my LMG has 250 rounds, I can fire for quite a while, and it kills both giants/small enemies. Explosives felt satisfying to use but I eventually went back to my LMG for the same reason. Less time spent reloading, more time shooting. Part of this is probably because of no health bar, but going with the no health bar strategy makes it feel like I don't know if I'm doing damage or not towards the robot until it falls down.

I suppose their way of making you try to swap guns is by giving such little ammo I couldn't keep up with one gun the entire time. Going back to earlier, I had to dismantle all of the ammo I had from every other source to keep my main gun fed since I was using a LMG. Even still, if I wanted to do content outside of normal giant robots/little robots, I needed to bum ammo off my friend that already has a lot of time in the game because I easily went through 40k+ rounds on rivals/bosses. Still, the weight system discourages you to have more than one weapon. This also was why I stopped using explosives after a while, since their ammo was 1 pound per ammo, and I could either have 4k rounds for my LMG or 40 rockets.

Many small gripes also added up. Terrain makes driving shit. DLC is overpowered compared to the base game. Game advertises as stealth but enemies find you so easily you are constantly in action. The damage system is ridiculous, I spent a good amount of resources on medpacks/adrenaline shots because even with around 50% DR there are still things that hit me for 95% of my HP. The dog companion frequently pushed me out of the map, flung something into me that killed me, or generally found its way to inconvenience me. Resources such as wood and cement are hard to find but required for so many things (also wood is a resource and you can't chop trees despite them being everywhere, you have to take saplings to get 1 wood, but an upgrade would take 250 wood. Guess how many trees you'd have to cut down for that.)

If I didn't buy the game as cheap as I did, and didn't have friends to play with, this game would be negative and I would have never bought it. But since it was 5 dollars for the base game, yeah that's pretty alright for the price.",1704628030,1704628030,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've over 120 hours on this game and STILL haven't been able to get 3 of the best experimental weapons. Who's bright idea was it to make the best weapons RNG drop based??  FFS, after a hundred hours in any game, all weapons should become available.  If I wanted to grind for a year, I'd play Star Citizen or something. 
""Just kill more Reapers"" you say?  Yeah, well now this game has decided that I can no longer do that because it CRASHES every single time I fight a Reaper now.  Using a Ryzen 7 3700x a Strix 2060 Super, and 32g of RAM on LOW settings. Ran Malewarebytes, checked integrity of files, made the game priority for memory, and even re-installed. It doesn't matter. The game will crash.  
This bug has been known to the developers for FOUR YEARS NOW and rather than fix it so people can actually play, they decide to release DLC's for clothing and weapon skins...so I can look pretty every time this game crashes. 
Besides that, sometimes NPC's are there, and sometimes they're not.  I had a whole conversation with a chick in a wheelchair, that wasn't even in the damned wheelchair.  
Hit reg is a complete joke as well. Sometimes, a harvester or tank will eat 20+ shots from a 5 star .50 and sometimes it'll take 10 shots. No rhyme or reason to it. 
In a nutshell, this game forces you to run around aimlessly, killing machine after machine, just so you can make a Reaper appear, so you have a chance to kill a Rival...for a very small chance to actually get something useful for your 6,000 rounds of ammo...but you'll never get the experimental .50 cal after dozens of tries...until the game decides to crash every time you try. 
There's so much going on, and the story seems written by a 5 year old so you never actually give one flying ""F"" about the characters OR what happened.  You just run and shoot the same machines over and over again...for nothing you can't loot from the trunk of a car. 
The schematic system is so grindy that it takes all the fun out of the game too. Want 7.62 shock ammo?  Well be prepared to do about 25 base defense missions...which also punishes you by lowering the regions ability to actually spawn the Reaper...to get better weapons...only to crash every time. 
I wouldn't buy this game for my worst enemy.  It's disjointed, doesn't know what genre its supposed to be, and punishes you relentlessly for playing. 
This game also has an irrelevant multi-player side which boggles my mind.  The game is moderately fun alone, but why on earth would anyone want to play this garbage with a friend lol?  Single player shooters should NOT take over 100 hours to complete or to finally get rewarded with top tier weapons ffs.

Old areas have kinda been left untouched it feels like so they are kinda bland and boring. Newer areas for add on story content that was added has some care put into it so its nice to go do some of the newer missions. Also kinda buggy still, don't remember any from before but I definitely have found new ones I do not remember. Combat is still fun, ai feel more dumb though. Its alright but it should be far better, not sure why they are updating this in a strange half baked way....

This game is clearly an early access game in denial. Its clearly incomplete and they keep updating it like its not a finished product. Adding new content and such. So like if your worried about it being a finished product that wont get updated anymore, I would say it seems like that is not the case. I hope they continue to work on it, but we'll see of course.

Intro:
Generation Zero is a mid game its kinda fun and bad its all about fighting robots in sweden in the 80s its kinda cool Idea but
Some of the gameplay is fun but it can get boring overtime  

Cons:
Ok the cons is going to be terrible some people might not agree me but thats ok .  I like the game but the base game is kind of empty with the weapons and vehicles all of them are kinda stuck in a paywall which are the DLCS and they are the main isssue with this game because they are pay to win because when you meet the safehouse with a storage you can literally play this game like a click and point adventure I bought one of the dlcs and it annoyed me but at least I got the dlc on sale and the base game 

Pros:
The pros is the style and everything else I like some of the things in this game like the vehicles they match the time of year like the motorbikes and bikes there like in the 80s and the cosmetics match with the 80s setting and weapons theres no futurist guns or anything but also I forget tell you about the camps there like a safehouse you have to build and protect its scattered around the map to get the camps you need to attack it because robots make it their Reproduction center and make more robots so you destroy you can only do this by doing some random quest I forgot.

Conclusion:
I think this game should get more updates and add more weapons and vehicles not for DLCS for the base game 
Because the devs are literally milking the DLCS for money all they need to do is fix the game a bit and update it more overall I give the game 7/10 its good but has some issues just get the game when its on sale its worth it",1704569387,1704569387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They vary in all manner of shapes and sizes and every last one of them wants to eat your lunch. GZ provides you with a large open world to do as you please if you want to stray from the primary and secondary missions. Plenty to explore, plenty of base building if you choose to do so, and lots of stuff to collect as you can craft your own ammo, deployables, first aid kits, etc. There are also vehicles in the form of bicycles, motorcycles, and mopeds, with several variations of each type, I prefer the armored moped myself.

I work in IT and understand crash dump analysis, but without symbol files or source there's not much I can do beside endure the crashes. After each reloading of the game, it takes 5 or so minutes to get back to where we are when another crash hits, then in the middle of a fight or travel, another crash. So tonight, we played Game Crash Simulator with the Gather Items and Progress but Lose It Quickly DLC.

We are running the game on two systems, one on Windows 10 and the other on 11, with 11 being reformatted while playing to try to fix the issue but it did not. No other games crash this frequently on either system. Some quests are very buggy, like for instance the current quest we are on (Tidal Wave) no enemies spawn so it cannot be completed. After each crash, we lose the equipment we were using (turrets, land mines, etc.) so we just stopped trying to use them.

The best feature they have IMO is how to combat them tactically such as disarming their weapons or other components that make up their kit and when you explore, keep an eye out for collectibles that give excellent intel on enemies when using Tech View with the binoculars for learning the weak-points and the status of its integrity.

Game currently suffers from numerous bugs ranging from mild to infuriating. I was almost soft-locked by a bug that caused the game to crash almost immediately on loading. I was only able to avoid needing to start a whole new game by selecting a fast-travel location before the crash happened. Doors don't open, missions fail to load, and characters disappear. The devs have promised polish to correct this, but call me old-fashioned for wanting to be able to SEE who I'm talking to.

The AI is also very iffy. Sometimes enemies will stand in the open and do nothing while you shoot them. Sometimes they will 1-hit KO you through walls or terrain. Sometimes your robot dog spawns in front of your motorbike so you hit them and go flying. Sometimes it stands in fire until it dies. Sometimes you can sit under a robot and stab it to death. Sometimes hunters play tennis with you as the ball. Sometimes the ticks get stuck in terrain.

DLC weapons and general game balance are also very bad. Using the .50 cal or recoilless rifle on large enemies means you spend more time trying to kill them and attract more enemies to you than just crouching up under them and dumping suppressed shots into them. Also, virtually every weapon in the game is useless compared to the COM-10 and PM-71, both of which are DLC. COM is suppressed bullet hose and 9mm FMJ is common enough that you can use it nigh constantly. The PM-71 shreds almost anything in half a mag and 7.62 is also fairly common. Only bases present any obstacle to these two weapons and those are also rendered effectively helpless by the remote controlled tick, also a DLC. 15 ticks will guarantee you a successful raid on a top-tier base, with zero risk.

The gameplay suffers from balance issues as well as having little incentive to keep going past a certain point. You go from place to place and kill robots, loot, and then maybe have enough comps to add a mod or XP to buy a skill. Hacking is basically the only worthwhile top tier skill and many passives are effectively useless. Throwing accuracy? Totally unnecessary when you can just hack one bot to attack others, for free, every 10sec. Also completely pointless since a flare anywhere within 20m of a robot will have its full attention. This closest you have to 'balance' is having the robots be bullet sponges and your character be spun glass. Extra health? Die in 4 hits instead of 3, when you're getting pummeled by 15 rockets. And all the fighting robots gets you the chance to fight the same robots, but in grey paint scheme and with more HP.

Mild early-game story spoilers below;
[spoiler]Story-wise, the game has an interesting premise that it fails to flesh out while also putting truck-sized holes in it's own plot. There are hints of interesting and sympathetic characters, but they are basically all already dead by the time you arrive. The few people you do meet are all but cardboard and while they are just [i]so distraught[/i] at what is happening, they nevertheless will bravely kick back in a bunker while telling you what to do. They do this despite the game taking pains to show that the bunkers are unreliable at best and actively targeted at worst, but not, apparently, once they move in.[/spoiler]

The dealbreaker for me was the lack of crossplay. The developer lists this game as being crossplay compatible, however it is not. I got the game and set up a linked account to play with friends who are on Gamepass, but that is not possible. The only crossplay is between Xbox and Gamepass PC versions, and the developer has stated that they do not anticipate that they will link the Steam version. If you want to play with friends, they MUST have the Steam PC version.

I wanted to like this game, but the crossplay issue on top of everything else has soured me on it. I also have reservations about it being a frustrating experience designed to sell DLC. I played enough with DLC to see the glimmer of fun to be had, but it was ultimately buried under the myriad issues. If these issues are addressed I may come back and change my review, but for now I would only recommend buying this game heavily discounted and understand that the DLC is sort of needed to make the experience less frustrating.",1704250466,1704250466,False,6,0,0.557106077671051025,0,True,False,False

0/10 beards mean 0/10 stars.

Edit: Old review below. Was a bit harsh but I still think the DLC should be cheaper, and i would get it when it goes on sale. A lot of stuff feels hashed together and basic features and QOL stuff is missing that would really make it super solid. I ended up starting my game over due to a mistake but I'm still having fun. Would recommend it more if there were beards and beers. 

Crafting economy is terrible. Enemies quickly become bullet sponges. Basic storyline elements are only hinted at/resolved/continued in DLC. All the DLC should have been released with the main game, or for a dollar at most. Some of it only adds like 3 items for 5 bucks. Difficulty ramps up considerably, combined with the method of upgrading what's effectively your armor a complete slog and you'll be fighting end-game enemies with barely upgraded gear, for hours at a time. It doesn't feel very rewarding to dump 20 rockets and a couple hundred rounds of ammunition into a 2nd rank FNIX Tank Rival just to pick up one clothing schematic and a couple pieces of tungsten- and you'll be fighting that pretty early on.

Playing with a friend feels a *little* better, but not by much. Again, the crafting economy screws you a lot, and if you want to start working around that, surprise, the DLC offers some of the best farming areas for basic components.

Worth a play over a couple weekends, if you can get a really cheap bundle. I certainly wouldn't pay full price at this point.",1704010056,1704247162,False,2,1,0.530386745929718018,0,True,False,False

Welp its been a bit since I've played this. But you can see my hours. I recently reinstalled the game and found I had lost literally all my progress. 333.9 hours gone. All my experimental weapons, all my gold weapons, All the DLC equipment crafting components and my maximum level character. I don't know how this happened but be warned, I guess theres just a bug and honestly I wanna lie down and cry cause holy shit that was a lot of grinding. Back up your save.

Generation Zero is a simple game with complex elements stuck on. A lot of people have been critical about the game and all of its bugs and issues those of which I have not encountered in the short time I've been playing. This game has obviously had a lot of work put into it and a lot of people seem to be ignoring it. The game doesn't tell you anything about the robots only that there are robots when you first spawn into the world, the only background you get is delivered through an opening black screen text introduction and everything else is delivered through you having to go out and hunt everything down by looking through various military bunkers and completing quests to figure out whats happened to all the now missing people on the island just off of the Swedish mainland. 

The games premise isn't new by any means, Big Robot is a developer that released ""Sir, You are Being Hunted"" and ""The Light Keeps Us Safe,"" both game that take place in a robotic apocalypse where you're stuck ducking and dodging robots by any means possible, both games have their own quirks but ""Sir, You are Being Hunted"" is the game most like Generation Zero, you can play it as a stealth game, as a shooter or a combination of both, and that might seem good on paper Generation Zero doesn't have your end goal shoved into your face at the beginning. I think Generation Zero is best described as ""Vietnam only you're playing the Vietcong and the Americans are Robots"" because thats what it feels like, the best this game gets is when you (and up to three other players) are stalking through a forest to avoid some of the nastier robots or while your scouting out a position covered with robots ready to make your assault. 

Generation Zeros combat is insanely organic, robots have variants, and those robots have variants, for example the basic Runner enemy can be Prototype, Military or Finx but those can also have variants, they can be a drone that charges you and hits you with a concussive blast knocking you down and shooting you with a shotgun or they can be armed with missile launchers and machine guns that tear you up. This section is marked spoiler because combat against robots is kind of the main focus of the game. [spoiler]There are only 6 enemies in game but they have special versions listed above as Prototype, Military and Finx. The Robots also unlock new abilities as you encounter the tougher ones, Finx Runners have rocket launchers and the prototype and military don't, the large but dumb Harvesters spew toxic gas at Finx class as well as the terrifying Tank enemy.[/spoiler] and to top it all off you have to learn the weaknesses and new abilities of the enemies as you go, 

I can't say much on the story because I have yet to finish it but it seems good so far, you have to hunt down answers [spoiler] by hunting down a regional bunker and finding codes to enter and check out what is called a ""War Board.""[/spoiler]
because they aren't just thrown at you. Literally they aren't if a quest says go find something it really means go find it. Hunting down houses can be a pain because they don't have any world indicators to show where they are, no addresses on homes or street names so if you want to find a particular house it can be a struggle. Locations aren't the same. If you want to find a bunker or a military base look at your map and start walking.

The world building is great. People might complain about floating objects, objects stuck inside other objects and other things but this did little to hinder my exploration and enjoyment of the game, I can't say they broke my immersion because it happened so infrequently. A lot of the buildings especially random houses is copy pasted but I can see why, its better to copy paste a whole load of houses with the same thing inside then to leave the houses inaccessible husks populating a town. The game world is massive and many people have said that lack of vehicles is an issue but if there were vehicles the game would loose a substantial amount of the game would be lost due to just driving to new areas instead of taking the slow quiet walk to locations avoiding robots, that being said vehicles would be nice for traversing areas that have already been traveled because despite there being fast travel and safe houses liberally placed around the map a lot of these safe houses are kinda far from target locations and walking through areas that have been walked a million times over is exceedingly boring.

I might add to this review as the game progresses in development continues but for now I'm rushing through making this because the game has been blasted for the bad released. 

I recommend this game but only if you have friends to get lost in the world in and enjoy the exploration side of games because despite this games lack of content it looks like the developers put lots of time and effort into making an interesting world.


ALPINE UNREST UPDATE:
I did pick up Alpine Unrest, I enjoy it. The new map is chalk full of goodies to the point where my inventory is more often full then its not. I do have some complaints though it may be because Im playing this solo, 

Tanks are a massive step up in difficulty, it feels like when fighting one you have to take out every single component of it for it to go down, best bet is spamming out rockets but even then it takes too many MPHE to destroy one. To use the tanks as a jumping off point Ticks have become the most annoying thing in this DLC. The new robots are all in some way poisonous but the ticks, since basically all robots come with a tick pod they are absolutely spammed out and if you get hit by one your health bar just stops existing, poison damage also stacks so if you get hit by two ticks your dead. 
I would think people would have strong opinions about the tank being able to use what are effectively scatter bombs except mines but I'm more annoyed by the hunters ability, hes got the same thing except the bombs are impact flechette bombs. So if you are caught in one your dead without being able to do anything. 

This game is still very much multiplayer oriented and it is still the best way to play and in Alpine Unrest it is even more so.

PHOENIX RISING UPDATE:
This game has run out of steam for me but I still went in to do Phoenix rising. The DLC is the base game revamped. They changed a lot of areas and I think the content is supposed to be for the early game.

If you are in to PVP this is not the game you are looking for. There is only co-op in it and i hope it stays that way. It still needs a lot on max difficulty to bring the machines down. Still looks like a PC game but in a stunning way.  You have a match making system in there for Invite only or anybody up to 4 players at least i did not get more in my games you can join or host. Personally i did buy all the dlc and the new one really helps if you go on longer trips in to the Swedish landscape the setting of the settlements is in late 80 style. The story is ok and you can find all kind of infos on your way trough. Also the many fast travel points you can get makes it easier to move around ofc you have to unlock them.

The good:
* Beautiful scenery and decent atmosphere
* Huge map/area
* Story line is immersive (I'm only 7 hours in)
* I have seen some negatives about this. The dynamics - when it gets harder, you get an increase in numbers of the same robots.  I don't think that could be any other way - robots are manufactured in number not by personality.

Bad:
* Continuously getting a message saying ""You've lost contact with Steam, this might effect multiplayer"" - and I was playing solo.
* Interface.  The controls etc are OK, I struggled with the quests and understanding where I was/needed to do/needed to go. 
* Very linear - I did the clearing before the church at the start and then was told after the church I now needed to go to the clearing. 
*  It does seem to fully occupy the resources of my laptop, unlike any other game - especially bandwidth.

One of the most commendable aspects is the seamless integration of co-op play. Exploring this vast world with friends adds a whole new dimension of excitement and teamwork, making each encounter even more thrilling.

Although challenging, the sense of accomplishment when overcoming obstacles is incredibly rewarding. The developers' ongoing support and updates further enhance the experience, showing a true commitment to their player community.

Generation Zero has lots to do: from finding safehouses, killing robots, looking for new weapons, and collecting collectibles. The gunplay is top-notch with satisfying shooting and hit mechanics and detailed firearms. My favorite feature is the ability to switch between different types of rounds; such as switching from hollow points to full metal jacket ammo.

Very creative way of using the open world format, allowing 4 players to join you in your open world game enables you to have a balanced experience between immersive and interactive. As an avid open world game enjoyer, I can say that most open world games face is that after a while you tend to get lonely and want to play something where things are more interactive and this game eliminates that issue. Though this game does have enemy level system, it certainly isn't overdone there are 4 levels for the FNIX enemies and 3 levels for the Russian enemies which keeps things both interesting and simple.

It is however pretty darn buggy. 
if it ran better and its ideas where a bit more fleshed out, id be happy paying $40. 
but it doesn't and they are not, so even 20 bucks for this would be a bit much. 

i hope they take another whack at this though because there are some truly great things in here.
it looks really good, its a hoot to run around with friends, and shooting pieces off robots feels great.

strange limitations hold it back though. not being able to put certain scopes on weapons bothers me. let me put a 12x scope on my pistol and a red dot on my 50 cal sniper. it'd be fun!

speaking of scopes, the aim sensitivity isn't reduced as you zoom in with scopes making high magnification less helpful than it could be.

Positives:
- The enemies are well done
- The world is quite large and there are missions/side missions everywhere. It does not feel empty.

Negatives:
- Some parts of the UI feel very unintuitive. For example, while do I change my characters clothes in the ""Profile"" menu? How would I even know that's where you put on the gas mask?
- While the large world is not empty, it is not very diverse. All missions kind of play the same way. The enemies are the same everywhere. It does not feel very rewarding to take on the large robots.
- Enemies are bullet sponges, even on lower difficulties, and especially the elite robots.
- After the tutorial island, you will be overwhelmed by robots. It's quite frequent that there are 3-4 large robots, 4-6 medium robots and a bunch of smaller robots that are trying to kill you. And since it takes so many shots to kill the large robots, it feels very tedious.
- You have barely any stamina for longer sprints and all vehicles that I have seen control very awkwardly, plus they are quite slow themselves. Togther with the large world, this makes traveling extremely tedious.
- What made me ultimately quit it are repeated out-of-bound errors, where I fell through the bunkers. It means you need to fast travel to a nearby location and the run back.

It's also takes place in Sweden during the cold war where it was incredibly antigonized by the soviet union and the populus had to do frequent drills. During that time the military expanded rapidly and Soviet U-Boats were in Swedish territory. Not a single swedish person under that time was content. If that horror was a game it would be this game. This is a must-play, multiplayer is also very fun, but at the cost of the horror and stealth section.

Drivable vehicles get stuck in the ground often and can then not be used anymore.

Enemies are only different by their paintjobs so not too much variety here.

When I first started playing the game it was quite fun.  The music is OUTSTANDING!  80's vibe to the max!  Sound effects are good.  Visuals when the game came out were really good.  It's not aging incredibly well now on the cusp of 2024.  

The biggest problem and the reason why I give it thumbs down, is there is a LOT of DLC (22), and almost ALL of it costs money.  It's not an insignificant amount like $0.99, as the cheapest one is $2.99.  Some of them are $7 and only add 1 feature (motorbikes).  The motorbikes make getting around the map much faster and easier, but only if you ignore fast travel.  Fast travel is by far the best way to get around.  So you pay $7 for an alternative to fast travel.  No thank you.

The point here is there is WAY too much DLC that is WAY too expensive compared to the base game.  More than 5 years in development the DLC is closing in on 4 times more expensive than the game.  Excuse me, WHAT??  The base game is $24.99.  If you add all the DLC, it becomes $111.82!!  This game still isn't finished!!!!  Just how expensive will Generation Zero be to get the full experience?  For a game that's been in development for more than 5 years?????  The base game and a bunch of the DLC are on sale right now (20Dec23) so you can grab it all for about half that $111.82 price tag, but for a game that isn't officially complete with an official release, there's no telling how much you'll actually pay for it in the end.  I'm done purchasing DLC for this game.  It's too much for too little return.  

The game is also very, I mean VERY, repetitive.  The AI enemies only have a few variations and fights ALWAYS go down the same way.  The large flying robot is extremely frustrating to fight if it catches you in the open.  Enemies with explosive weapons will send you either flying or rolling on the ground when you are close to the explosion, which half the time will cause you do die from fall damage.  Some fights are EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to engage in.  I'm sad about the game, I loved it early on but it doesn't innovate enough, there isn't enough substance.  The story is told primarily through notes or recordings you find.  It's taken too long to hold my interest with no end game objective.  I roamed all over the map and felt like it was an open world sandbox with no story objective.  You don't any real impact on the world other than building small bases.  It feels like the developers sat around and came up with cool idea concepts for the game but the guy that was in charge of story line called out sick, EVERY DAY SINCE RELEASE! :(",1703109343,1703109343,False,2,0,0.504220128059387207,0,True,False,False

The graphics are definitely superior to DL. Mobs are tough and take lots of planning to deal with. It has under ground areas, but they are all man-made bunkers. So far I haven't found any natural cave systems. After 40 hours, I have only seen about 10% of the map so there may be more surprises ahead. The plot is very thin. When you finally meet up with NPCs, they are about as animated as a store clothes mannikin. I enjoyed the Swedish language, nice to hear that again. DL specialises in melee combat with hand weapons. GZ is the opposite, you almost never engage at close range. Even if you want to, the mobs will leap away to prep for another run. Finding and managing your firearm and bullet inventory is important. 
This game is definitely worth buying as is, although it won't be satisfying for many people. It's really a showcase for their open world technology. It could be absolutely tremendous if they invested some time in fleshing out the NPCs, plot, and melee combat. Skyrim redone with this engine would be beyond belief. I hope to see more from this company.

Update at 110 hours:

I would like to see an option to operate a Swedish  Stridsvagn 103 tank.  The general mobility, high speed, and  Bofors 105 mm L74 gun should be devastating against the larger bots. The game has lots of burned out Strv 103s laying about but I would assume they were taken out by smaller, specialized anti-tank bots, not the big bots. This game has enormous potential, with a little imagination.

Here's a big criticism. Most of the NPCs are 'people of color' rather than actual Swedes from the 1980's. It's jarring to hear strongly accented Swedish being spoken by somebody who looks like they just came off the boat from Africa.  I just don't understand the rationale for this kind of mass cultural appropriation. The game is supposed to be about Sweden in the 1980's.",1602897676,1703041342,False,0,0,0.56679689884185791,0,True,False,False

Slowly you will gain access to more powerful weapons and ammo, but with some skill and strategy, you can take most of them out without too much trouble.

I don't know if it is intended but the game feels too empty at the times, mostly you will just be going around same houses, churches etc, at the same time enemies are not spawning much too and if they are it's just mostly dog one, scanner and the bigger one with two guns.

You grow better, get new stuff, you can kill the initial troublemakers. But by that time, you'll have been dealing with mediocre enemies for quite a while. But oh hey, it's getting better, isn't it?

... well, during endgame, you got the best weapons you can find, but every boss will still take hundreds of (fairly well placed) rounds, and your regular boss-sized, but not (quite) boss-like every-day-foe will take a few dozen of VERY well placed rounds. 

In the meantime, enemies spot you over hundreds of meters through dense forests and lob rocket salvos at you before you even noticed they're there, f***ing up about half of your health. Oh, and the explosion knocks you down, so until you recover, you only have a couple of seconds before the next rocket salvo bounces in.

MAIN POINTS:
- The game has crafting of multiple sorts
- The game does not involve hunger or thirst aspects but does have stamina and medical (Which i like and it works)
- You do need to loot cars, boxes, bodies and houses
- The world is HUGE and there is plenty to do
- The developer is actively updating the game
- you are able to use motorbikes or push bikes so far (I presume more vehicles coming soon
- Elite robots are a great challenge
- Gen Zero has Auto Save
- You can play with your friends or load in on another players world with the same loot you had in your single player experience
- The graphics are absolutely stunning
- Day/Night transitions and Weather systems

Then, two rivals arrived at the church where Isvus was hiding at the same time, and continued to stand there at the exits without moving. Isvus, having collected thousands of rounds of ammunition with the scavenger perk and wondering if now would be the time to use them. kicked the front door open and came out swinging. Except he didn't swing, because he had left the bat in his storage.
Unfortunately, the automatic gunfire, explosive detonations, and earsplitting shotgun blasts attracted the attention of the faraway titan, and everything and everyone else within two kilometers. Seeing the giant approaching, Isvus went for his last resort-- the man-portable armor piercing rocket launcher he had recently picked up.

Isvus did not realize that rockets are even louder than landmines, grenades, and gunfire. Now he had the attention of every animate being in the archipelago region. ""No matter,"" he thought as he listened to the avalanche of heavy caliber rounds pounding the outside of the church. ""I have enough ammunition.""

The legendary battle lasted for an entire night as waves of machines assailed the place of worship. As the battle reached its climax, a second titan arrived on the field and joined the furious assault. But despite dying twice to the incessant barrages of missiles and nerve gas, Isvus simply refused to yield the church doors and after expending fully half of his accumulated munitions and all of his rockets, the world finally fell silent.

Like a groundhog emerging after hibernation, Isvus blinked in the dawn light and stared around at the church grounds as he left the building. The burning husks of dozens of war machines laid scattered around the consecrated ground. And finally, he realized.

for the full price i don't think so

I had fun with the game, probably cause i was playing with a friend. The environment (expect most building are copy paste) is pretty good. graphics are pretty decent too despite minor clipping. The story in the beginning got me invested but i have the feeling after you find Pontus and need to find the bunkers, they kinda abandoned the story... I expected at least for Pontus and Therese to talk at the end of the game after the last main mission. I want my zexy mustache man more... It was fun at the beginning being scared of some of the big robots, but after the hacking ability they just weren't scary anymore(its so op but hella fun to see big bois attack each other).I wish there was a better indicator that robots have been hacked like if you go over with binoculars it would say ""already hacked"". The game crashed quite a lot. almost always when i try to go from fullscreen to borderless window. The game also had a memory leak(which is like is not properly deleting unused memory. it has to do with bad coding) at one point making my game crash after 10 min (prob the FNIX bases who were piling up at least thats what i read). But the next day it was just fixed. speaking of FNIX it would be nice if it could be mentioned that the walls can be broken cause the first time we had to do it we just couldn't find out how to get in(maybe it was mentioned but we didn't listen?) the rocket launcher wasn't a good indication, i didnt want to waste ammo. Had to search up a tutorial.
the mission are mid at the beginning they were fun but at the end they were just copy paste. It was exciting when i saw a new bunker design but i wish we had more different designs of bunkers. Also sometimes the robot spam at FNIX bases level 3 and some mission was just too insane like how are you suppose to survive that. Also it says its a stealth-action shooter yet nowhere did i ever get to use stealth i wonder if the silencers even do anything. I must give props to the robots AI, I like, since they aren't human they don't taken cover and run towards you also they go near the noises of shooting of their allied robots and they even know were you last went and go there if they lost you. I find the AI the best part of the game. i do wish they fix the game instead of adding more DLC. especially the crashes...

 However, I can not support the developers anymore and refuse to purchase anything else from them. Not only do they not actively fix any of the bugs thousands of player report, they are shilling out so called ""DLC"" that adds a handful of firearms, a small island that should have been part of the main storytelling and instead are using this DLC to flush and finish their rushed story ending, extreme overuse of a handful of assets that shows lack of creativity and attention to detail, shady business practices from the developers other games, lack of enemy diversity. 

I could go on and on with what I have seen over the course of 150 hours and to the game and developers credit the concept is amazing. They have a wonderful base idea as well as the strong foundation for what could have been an even better game and absolutely worth what they charge for the base game... But as it stands in December of 2023... I have gotten more fun, more quality, more laughs, more than double the hours in a game that is 10 years older and has worse graphics and was only 15 dollars base game. 

Long story short I do not recommend this game or any games from this developer and highly recommend that you save your money and find something else that won't try to rip you off and run away with your money",1702574944,1702574944,False,25,0,0.719323396682739258,0,True,False,False

Bright side of the game:
1. Beautifull world 
2. Variety of weapons (pistols, auto pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, RPG)
3. Multiple ammo types to weapons from simple hollow buckshots to armor penetration bullets. 
4. Weapon modifications - scopes, barrels, mag extends, night vision
5. Character customization - lot of players likes it so its nice to have it. its simple and will not overwhelm you.
6. 6 types of enemies... maybe not too much but as its 1980s and those are military invaders I got it, 6 types is a lot of types to be build and send to enemy teritory. Of course each type have its purpose which is nice.
7. This first thrill when you see tank coming your way and the ground is shaking. -I loved it
8. lvl ups with skill points -everyone loves to lvl up and develope skill tree
9. Crafting system - its very basic so far and I hope it will be developed more.. and not limited to clothes only
10. Decoys, EMP/sound traps - there is a lot of options to distract your enemies
11. Explosions - enemy destruction efects are awesom, especially tanks as they are the biggest.
12. Ammo type switch - finally added...

Dark side - things that will make you irritate and probably the reasons you will stop playing Gen Z:
1. Inventory management - its so... disordered, items are stored in order you put them in inventorywhich means that if you have standard ammo to rifle, then you found some other ammo to different guns and now you have armore piercing bullets to rifle, you will have to scroll up and down to found them.
3. Weapon switch - better make sure that your current setup is good enough before starting a fight as in order to change weapon setup you will have to go via Inventory screen
4. Bugs - There are moments when I'm tired... while trying to pick up an item from ground, shelf, open a box or enter/exit tide spaces. Those are small things but when you know that you should be able to pick up something but you can't... untill you stand at 42degree from east side of the item with one leg over your head and gun in your mouth you simply can't pick it up.
5. Health - your only option to regenerate it are medpacks that you can found.
6. Moving enemies hitbox - shoting at moving enemies leads mainly to failure, bullets are missing targets, rockets are flying through the enemies exploading far behind them
7. Greed - it looks like creators are more focus on adding $$ DLC $$ than fixing bugs that are in game since the beginning (pay for new content and play with tons of bugs... we have a plan to fix them... probably never ever... but hey!... we have the plan)
8. Asigning item to quick slot - no fast option, you need to go through inventory & assigning slot screen
9. Limit to Character level 31... why? - to force playing with friends? if this game would have less bugs maybe they would want to play it... right?
10. RPG suck - rockets are heavy and not so common to find, rocket damage is so low that it's hard to use RPG against hunters/tanks... on higher difficulty level its just pointless to even keep it in inventory
11. Stamina/Running - running range even with maxed skills is so short that I don't even want to talk about it.


I'm glad that I bought this game with 60% discount as with normal price and current game mechanic I would not spend money on Gen Z and I can't recomend it to others at this point.

I personally do not understand the complaints I see about optimization. The first impression I had when getting into the game was how optimized it felt, and how smooth it was. This game runs very well. I have only crashed once, and I may have been partly to blame because I got all out of sorts in a battle and may have hit some weird keys. I also saw a review that said the ""servers would be going offline""... Whaaa? What servers? This is a solo game that you don't actually need an internet connection for. Only thing that would need internet would be the daily reward missions, but I can't imagine that being a big deal to anyone. 

This is a very fun game that can humble you and make you feel powerful all in the span of a few hour play period. The fighting is fun and rewarding. Looting is very satisfying. The sound development of the game is exceptional. The only critique I can agree with from a review I've seen was the asset reuse. It is very repetitive. However, it is easily overlooked. There is enough variation in the mobs and the way you battle that any similarity between one and another is moot, and the structure assets are so tertiary that I can't bring myself to care about the repetitive nature of them. 

The DLC weapons are actually not as great as everyone makes them out to be. It's a great way for a non-serious gamer to get into the game without being on the struggle bus for a long time, but for others that do game, the struggle is part of the charm of this game. There is actually a point in the game where you don't appreciate the variety in the added weapons because you are looking for parts to upgrade your halo weapons, but the loot table is muddy from the add ins. That said, I can't hate on the variety, nor the devs releasing a DLC to offer them. A few dollars for weapons not previously in the game isn't an outlandish thing. Especially when the game stands on its own without that DLC. With all of the verified trash in the gaming world, this is not included in that trash. 

Go out and blow some things up. Sneak around the map using stealth and picking bots off from afar, set up some traps and lure the largest machines into a minefield, or charge in, kick open the front door and cause absolute mayhem. There are plenty of ways to play and change it up over time. The fighting and visceral feel of the carnage is extremely fun.

Unfortunately the engine behaves really poorly when I move the mouse.

What a shame, because the story is great so far and the main idea plot is just fascinating. The world is well desinged and the AI inteligence is just right. Only if the graphics werent so glitchy.

The core mechanic of it stays the same , but it creates this unique gameplay style for me and my friends where it is both challenging and rewarding at the same time. A lot reviews here the game is a repetetive boring mess, yet they didn't even try to engage in it for more than 20 minutes.

While yes, some of the DLCs could be implemented into the core game, they set up that you can in a server without needing them, atleast some of them. I think the prices are fair-ish, for how many people will actually use them and how much effort and time it took to make them. People hating the DLCs in this game will rather get ripped off by Activisions Deluxe Edition on COD games and pay 20-something bucks for completly ugly skin pack.

I wish there were more of these Open World Survival Co-op games that look beatiful, sound nice, are action based and have unique enemies and allies, instead of these military hollywood shooters every company is pumping out.

As for the bugs and glitches, every game has them, every game is trying to fix them - I don't get why people are getting mad about something that IS and WAS a standard in a game development. In this case of game, I am willing to go far as to defend the bugs and glitches in this game, cuz they make it so much fun (ex.: using canisters to launch yourself across the map, using vehicles to stun the enemies, stacking a portable turret on a Tick, etc...). If you cannot use the bugs to your advantage, you have never played sandbox-type of game.

Giving this game 10/10, no doubt. It does have it's fair share negatives, but they are outshadowed by the positive gameplay. (Also using Second Extinction's cancelling to rate another game is like eating cheese, not liking it and saying all cheese types are bad - get some perspective before writing a review. Also to to all who got the game for free, you have no right to critise the game, when you haven't even spend money on it to feel dissapointed or like ""it's not worth the money"".

The world and atmosphere is terrific, sound design is impeccable, RPG elements are decent, the game looks great and (I have not finished it) has a good amount of content and a large map to explore.

So the game has a lot, and I mean A LOT, going for it, and with my 39 hours played I can see myself put in many more, so why am I not recommending it?

I will preface this with saying that if you find this game on sale (Like I did) I would strongly recommend picking it up because it's a great experience.. for the most part.

But the game has been out for a couple of years, and as much as it has going for it, some majorish bugs still exist. And as much as I love the game, I also realize that for at least non-gamebreaking bugs I might have a better tolerance for than others. And also considering the age of the game, I feel some ire is reasonable considering the bugs still exist.

Minor bugs (Slightly annoying):
One thing you end up coming across is that after a while in a session when looking at apparel items all you see are your giant feet in the preview, and in the Profile / Clothing menu you can no longer see your character, so you would have to restart the session if you want to know how your character would end up looking.

Some achievements don't work, or at least don't always work.

If you are riding your bicycle and fly headfirst into a wall or something, it may end up landing on you and magically crush you for all your health. (Minor because there's very few instances, if any at all, where this would happen without it being deliberate by the player)

Some doors exist that if you open them on the wrong side you effectively get yourself stuck, so far however I have always been able to just close the door again and opening it from the other side, not really a bug I suppose, but something that is overlooked.


Medium bugs (Carries some frustration):
Hunters armed with the big shoulder cannon are sometimes able to aim at you from several hundred meters away which isn't anything strange really, the annoying part is when they do it through structures and sometimes several obstacles, and ALSO hit you with it taking nearly all your health.

Lynxes engaged in combat with other robots sometimes spot you from literal kilometers away, even if you are prone / crawling and behind a small elevation in the ground, makes it a bigger problem when everything starts aiming for you instead.

Crashes, I only put this in Medium because in 39+ hours it has only happened 3 times that I can recall, and thankfully it has never been a big deal (The game is good at updating and saving, the most I lost from a crash was a claimed safehouse, no items or other progress has been lost so far).


So there, sorry for being long winded but I wanted to be thorough to explain my thoughts and my expectations for any other players. If the devs end up reading this, please know that I adore this game so far to at least 70% of it, with just a little bit of polish, I'd switch my recommendation immediately and give it a strong 8/10 at least.


TL;DR:
If you have some friends interested in this game and find it on sale, pick it up ASAP, provided you don't have any hinderance in terms of hardware, you will have a wonderful experience. It's even good as a solo experience, but Co-op is king. Without sale however, I would recommend putting it on your wishlist and give the devs some time to do a bit of fixing.

EDIT:
So this is a quick comment added after the latest ""Major Update"" announcement, I think it is problematic that most, if not all, new additions end up locked behind DLC you need to purchase which has seemed to be a tradition in regards of this game.

Aside from my mentioned bugs maybe not everyone have reported them too adamantly but the only thing that I had experienced that seems to be addressed is crashes, which would be the biggest part so that is good, but with all that in mind I will keep my review as ""Not recommended"" until I feel the polish and ethics I want to see end up in place, so as stated above, if you find the game on a good sale, go for it and enjoy yourself, but I don't think the standard price tag reflects the quality and ethics that exist behind the scenes.",1701885962,1702392237,False,9,0,0.57000809907913208,2,True,False,False

The game has a decent opening and a very interesting setting / scenario. Early on, there is a story to follow.

...however, past the first few hours (out of the tutorial area) the story just kind of stops. it's open world, meaning you're doing the same things over and over again. The quests are simple: go into yet another bunker (all typically smaller than the one in the opening section), turn on the power, get main missions. the main missions are just going to X location, killing more enemies you've already been killing hundreds of, for the reward of a text blurb or a brief, not exactly revealing voiced message. A lot of houses etc. are copypasted, with there being a lack of story or NPC's each location just ends up "" a place to loot"", and most loot is randomly generated and becomes completely forgettable. 

Side activities like base attack / defense are just plain unfun and barely functional; the attacks involve infinitely, fast respawning hordes of enemies while you're supposed to try and actually break the base and you get zero cover.

Essentially, there's story content for a 5-10 hour game but i played 36 hours and didn't get to the end, i just got finally got bored and opted to stop playing. The game has a lot potential that's untapped, the developers apparently preferred to just make new (stronger) weapons to sell as pricy DLC.

That said... i paid very little for in deep steam sale and the first few hours were really good. As such, if you can get it cheap, play it for a bit but don't bother deep diving into the open world / long term game because there's really just not much there.",1702312190,1702312190,True,112,1,0.880648434162139893,3,True,False,False

[h1] IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE DEVELOPERS CREATING EXPENSIVE DLCS. FUTURE UPDATES ARE LOCKED BEHIND $8 PAYWALLS AND THE GAME IS LIFELESS WITHOUT THEM. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT THESE DEVELOPERS [/h1]





[b]Pros:[/b]
- Phenomenal graphics
- Great combat ensures for intense fights
- Playing with friends creates a positive bonding experience
- The map is HUGE and allots for hours of exploration
- Mob mechanics are realistic and at times difficult
- The addition of bicycles allows the player to traverse the terrain much faster than on foot
- The interface is simple and easy to use
- A skill tree offering useful upgrades to your character
- Character customization offers a variety of clothing options for all types of clothing [u] but you must find the clothing in game. [/u]
- There isn't a specific play style that is favored. You do you.

[b]Cons:[/b]

[u]Note: This game is in early access and things are subject to change and improvement:[/u]
- Story Spoiler: [spoiler]Once you start and finish the introduction missions, the story is self explanatory and you'll know the entire plot.[/spoiler]
- This game is graphics intensive
- This game can be dull without friend(s)
- Weapon Spoiler: [spoiler]Once you defeat Rivals and get the 6 crown/star weapons, the battles become repetitive and easy.[/spoiler]
- GZ can crash regularly dependent on your computer specs.
- Some players' characters are known to corrupt. There is a fix at [url=https://forum.generationzero.com/t/40-hours-lost-corrupted-savegame-fixed/17099/4]this website[/url]
I am a large fan of open world survival games and Generation Zero hits every point in my book. The intense combat and desire to understand mob mechanics attracts me to this game daily.

As said before, the story [spoiler] is predictable. [/spoiler]
My only gripe with combat is that some enemies become stuck on a non existent target and become fixated on it for a period between 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
The graphics are phenomenal even on medium settings, take time to look around and admire the beauty.

After a while, playing mostly in co-op, we found however no satisfying way to deal with larger groups of enemy robots and especially bosses.

It seems you have a lot of options, from luring them to radios to stunning them with fireworks, but it just wasn't satisfying any of it.
To me it feels like a huge missed chance: the idea is great, the world is great, the enemies look great, scenery and sound is great, but we were left spending our time looting every car (all doors and the hood, mind you) and house and shed and box we encountered and either winning battles easily, either being beaten the crap out of us by a gigantic über-robotic-overlord-death machine (or several of them) that knows where you are before you do and sends an array of rockets your way that the Pentagon would have some difficulty dealing with - and you're supposed to be a teenager on a bike.",1702141606,1702141606,False,3,0,0.532022356986999512,0,True,False,False

Honest devs would rather produce one or two dlcs with more content (e.g. one weapons pack) rather than release dlcs for only 4 weapons of which usually only one or two are useful.

Enemies can shoot you through concrete walls like they were made of cheese. The player does not have that option. Instead, the player often hits door or window frames (or other things), although scope or sights show a clear line of fire. 
Game physics are broken. If a small machine collides with a multi ton giant, the giant gets pushed out of the way like a paper ball. The player, on the other hand, can get stuck anywhere at any time, occasionally leaving the player totally exposed and unable to defend. 
The looting appears to be bugged, so if you buy the dlcs, be prepared to never get the strongest version of these weapons you bought, causing the dlcs to be a total waste of money mid to end game.

The player`s actions in this game make no difference whatsoever in terms of feedback from the game environment. This is obvious, since the game does not have any real NPCs to interact with either. So if you are looking for any kind of story or anything that goes beyond being sent from A to B, look somewhere else. You will not find it in Generation Zero.

I could write more, but it would be as much wasted time for writing as it would be wasted time for reading. The game is an average looter shooter at best, with a complexity that is even lower than the Far Cry games.

Buy it on sale if you are into a shooter for simpletons, but avoid the dlcs. Otherwise you will probably regret that you have wasted your money.",1702132050,1702132050,False,2,0,0.511228322982788086,0,True,False,False

""Generation Zero"" delivers a hauntingly beautiful open-world experience that combines atmospheric exploration with intense combat against robotic invaders. The core gameplay, marked by immersive survival elements and cooperative play, sets the stage for an engaging adventure. However, the game's potential is tainted by a divisive issue that threatens to overshadow its merits: the persistent introduction of micro DLCs.

At its heart, ""Generation Zero"" captivates players with a gripping narrative set in an alternate 1980s Sweden overrun by hostile machines. The abandoned landscapes tell a silent story, and the cooperative multiplayer option enhances the sense of camaraderie and shared struggle against the relentless mechanical foes.

The gunplay in ""Generation Zero"" is undeniably a highlight. The weapons feel satisfying, with a visceral impact that adds weight to each encounter. The machines, initially formidable adversaries, provide a fun and challenging experience. However, as the game progresses, the once-formidable foes become somewhat predictable and easier to dispatch, diluting the challenge that made early encounters so exhilarating.

Regrettably, the game's reputation takes a hit due to the incessant release of micro DLCs. While additional content can breathe new life into a game, the perception of these DLCs as a money-grabbing tactic has sparked discontent among the player base. Many view these microtransactions as a desperate attempt to milk every possible penny from the player community, detracting from the game's overall appeal.

It's a shame to witness a title with such potential succumb to divisive monetization strategies. The immersive world and solid gameplay mechanics deserve better than to be overshadowed by a cloud of discontent. Despite the unfortunate business decisions, ""Generation Zero"" remains a game worth experiencing, especially for fans of atmospheric shooters with a cooperative twist.

In conclusion, ""Generation Zero"" presents a captivating blend of exploration and combat marred by a questionable approach to microtransactions. The core gameplay, highlighted by excellent gunplay and challenging machines, manages to shine through the shadows cast by the micro DLC controversy. As a player, I find myself torn between the love for the game's intrinsic qualities and disappointment at the developers' decisions that undermine its potential.",1575304636,1701953754,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

Pros:

- Huge map with plenty of things to do to keep you going after the next objective and side missions, bunkers, and weird secret locations.
- I play with controller, so it's a plus plus to have such smooth controls that can be customized. 
- Audio for this game is AMAZING! The gun sounds remind me of battlefield or Insurgency Sandstorm. (The explosions will scare the shit out of you.)
- Graphics look amazing! If you like Deadside, it's similar to that. 
- Multiplayer is pretty damn fun! You can play up to 4 people and the devs don't care if you're using cheats in your own group (there is an invite only option) as long as you aren't bothering others. (I'm not that guy that uses them all, but I've seen the infinite rocket launcher guy around a few times lol.) There is some awesome quality of life mods for it. 
- AI is pretty damn smart and fun to hide from! They mostly need a line of sight unless you are spotted, but it's terrifying to run from them at that point. So you spend your time sniping them and figuring out ways to not get killed. 
- There is a pinging system for you and your friends that I love when you get that perk. Also, a cool radio system you can find so you can spawn by your friends so they don't have to run across the map.
- The explosions and effects on the robots when you kill them are top notch!

Cons: (not many for me)

- There are no vehicles except the damn bicycle (which is point to be with the rocky landscape). I REALLY hope they add something. Truck, ATV, motorcycle, something. 
- They need to add a melee action to break windows at least. I understand is range based, but cmon..
- The water is lava apparently...no swimming. You die. Weird. 
- AI soldiers, humans, zombies...something! it needed. It gets boring out there. 


Besides my personal gripes, the game is pretty damn amazing and if they added some vehicles with mounted guns or something, it would be so much more fun than it already is!

The base gameplay somewhat feels like a Far Cry game, with some elements from the Terminator franchise.

The game can be played alone or with other players, but, to be honest, I think playing alone does a really good job reinforcing the ""where's everyone else?"" aspect of the early game. However, co-op is somewhat encouraged by the game, and there are unlockable skills that literally only work in co-op.

Graphics are overall good, but some models can be quite low-poly even up-close. Also, some graphical effects are relatively unoptimised.

Sound design, IMO, is quite good. For example, when I experienced my first in-game thunderstorm, I almost thought it was happening IRL.

Some issues I have with the game include (but might not be limited to) the following:

- It's impossible to pause the game, as you can't create single-player sessions (the most you can do is set the session to invite-only).

- The game sometimes has issues remembering its state. I once resumed the game, and as I left the safehouse I was in, enemies I had to clear to unlock it respawned right behind me.

- On the subject of safehouses, some of them actually aren't safe. The first one you're likely to get in the second major region is in a hangar, which can't be closed, with enemies roaming the outpost right outside the door.

- While the places where you can do so are rather hard to find, it's incredibly easy to get stuck on geometry, and the only ways to get out are luck or fast-travelling.

- [strike]The inventory can't be sorted. It can be filtered using category tabs, but beyond that, finding a specific item when the list is unordered can be quite hard.[/strike] EDIT: this was fixed in the Base Assault update.

- Each time you scroll your inventory, item icons are reloaded, making finding stuff at a glance harder.

- Ammo drops in containers are mostly dependent on area. While enemies drop ammo based on their type and class (for example, a prototype Runner will tend to drop .32 ACP ammo), lootable containers will only actually start dropping .270 (used in the second hunting rifle you can find) once you reach the second major region.

- Consumables are quite common. Maybe a bit too much, actually. I know they're supposed to be used to make fighting robots easier, but if you don't feel a need for them and store them, you can easily end up with, for example, more than 100 emergency flares or 30 gas canisters by the time you reach the first bunker (which should happen at around the 15-20 hour mark if you're thorough when exploring the first area).

- Another thing: outside of quest items, every single item has a weight. While the base carrying capacity of your character (64kg) will feel generous at first, stuff does add up. For example, my current ""bare essentials"" (aka three guns, their accessories, ammo, medkits, lockpicks, and a pair of binoculars) add up to close to [b]40kg[/b]. Oh, and while there's a stash shared between all characters on your PC, it also has a weight limit (200kg, can be upgraded to 400)! However, the capacity of your character isn't a hard cap. You can go over it at the cost of sprinting and fast travel. Going above another threshold, though, will plainly and simply make you unable to move.

- Lootable containers take a *long* time to respawn. And I'm talking about multiple real-life hours here. While some people will see it as a good thing (as it low-key forces you to progress and explore the map), I see it as a con (for the exact same reason).

- On the other hand, enemies respawn rather fast. It's not ""turn around and they're back"", but in a three-hour session, it's possible to see areas get repopulated two or three times.",1594881105,1701780669,True,1,0,0.522144556045532227,0,True,False,False

it's amazing! im not even sure what changed from the last time we've played, but it's honestly so much more fun than i ever could've imagined it being. graphically it is INSANE, almost up there with red dead redemption 2. the game's engine really helps with this as it optimizes stuff like crazy and just makes the world very crisp and smooth. the audio (especially the guns, they're orgasmic) is incredible. For these reasons, the game is incredibly immersive... when you're not in combat.

that being said, the combat is fun, but it can get quite tedious at times because sometimes the robots take obnoxiously long to kill. it's not that the game is unfair, it's just that you get thrown between ""i am a god amongst men"" to being blown into oblivion in a matter of seconds and it's just kinda strange. you often find yourself repeatedly getting ass-blasted to a ragdoll state while you're trying to hit a shot and it can get a little annoying when actually killing something requires precision.

the story is okay, im not done with it so i cant give a firm conclusion but the story is really just 90% radio broadcasts, voicemails, tape recorders, etc. of swedish men freaking tf out over the robots and that's really it. it's cool and well-written but it doesn't really make you actually care about what's going on. you get two actual humans early on that are cool but don't contribute much to the story itself, so they're quite forgettable.

The whole place is empty. Open sprawling fields and scattered wood barns possibly a little town here and there. None of that would be a problem in the slightest. But every fifty yards I'm ambushed by robots that require a specific fighting tactic to take down and my only cover is a few trees and maybe some hillside I can squeeze behind. Not good. 

If you don't have the Motor Bike DLC your only transportation is a 50's style bike. I shouldn't have to explain why this is a joke, see the above comment. The DLC in of itself isn't complete. Via you cant turn the light off on the bike. You paid for a motor bike not a working light or mobile storage. That'll another 2 bucks someday. 

The DLC guns they add are more boring then the ones they had, I have no idea how they pulled that off. The only reason to get it is to have a rocket launcher a bit early. I have never played a game that made me go back to previous weapons I hated using because the new ones are worse. You'll find 20 of the same gun just looking for one that's one star better so you can move all your upgrades over to it.

That's basically the whole plot in a nutshell. Plot-wise, there's not much going on in GenZ. It's very short, without flair or common sense - at the very beginning of the game we meet a teenage girl who tells us her story, then sends us to various locations asking us to either clear the farm of machines or find where the survivors are hiding, meanwhile communicating with the military and TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO??? And they listen to her.... What? And this is just one example.

The game has a lot to offer, from the breathtaking sights and sounds, to the vast, huge open world of Sweden or something resembling Sweden (I don't know, I haven't been), to the quite addictive combat.... Well, at least for the first 20 hours of gameplay.
The desire to search every building, every town, village, bunker or airbase quickly evaporates when you realise that most buildings are copy-paste or simply impossible to enter. Loot is nice, you can find useful stuff in any backpack or small toolbox, but combine this with your own crafting and the stuff you find from destroyed machines and you'll quickly run out of space, whether in your cache or in your inventory, so that at some point you won't need to collect anything.

[h1]Character[/h1] 
Character development is also not rewarding. There are 4 trees and a lot of perks that can be unlocked, but for some reason you only get skill points up to level 30, and the max level is 10k, which is - as google says - almost impossible to achieve in real life, as you need 698million exp.
There are a few very useful perks, like rising once in a fight without spending adrenaline, healing efficiency, or 100% more found ammo/resources, but most of them really aren't worth your points. Usefulness of a factor of about 30-70%.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
In terms of the combat system, it's pretty cool. It gives you loads of options, you can use decoys, set traps, hack enemies, throw EMPs at them to temporarily immobilise them, loads of stuff. Exploding machines are beautiful, it's pure art, the sound of a destroyed tank falling like a tree after a battle is priceless ;) Destroying FNIX bases is the most fun, even after so many hours it still draws me in. Unfortunately the enemies are very spongy, the harder and stronger versions simply require more ammo to kill, even when you destroy certain elements, or shoot at weak points, they still swallow hundreds of bullets or rockets to die....

The big downside of this game is ERRORS.... There are a lot of texture glitches, I personally fell under the map in a few places, there are also countless bugged quests that you can't complete or have to restart the game multiple times to get them to load correctly.... Not cool...

I give this game a solid 5+/10, it has a cool Swedish vibe, I had a lot of fun with my mate while playing and we still do, despite having everything, the graphics are absolutely beautiful and unique, by far the #1 prettiest game I've ever played/seen. Period. But still, the core mechanics of the game are either poorly done, don't work, or just get boring quickly and are very repetitive.... I'd definitely recommend buying with some sort of discount, it's not worth the full price in its current state....",1675632771,1701361421,False,1,0,0.503275096416473389,0,True,False,False

To name a few issues:

Frequent crashes

Invisible quest NPCs

Vehicles being swallowed by the ground

Horrible object pop-in and pop-out (you turn around for 1 second, turn back around, things are now missing and the NPC you were talking to is now a disembodied voice until you reboot your game)

Base defense missions where if an enemy dies near the defense objective, you instantly fail 

Desync so bad your friend will be fighting enemies that are already dead, or never existed in your instance

Game breaking problems with main quest progression due to crashes (my game crashed when clearing out an enemy base, rendering the base immune to all damage and permanently hostile. Other friends who have played this game has experienced the same issue, and say the only way to solve this is to delete your save and hope it doesn't happen again. Note, if you cannot do this, you cannot unlock base building, and you cannot complete one of the main quests)

A gameplay loop that feels incomplete (You kill enemies and loot supplies, but there are always so many supplies it feels pointless to loot for things, and the games thematics want to push you towards a survival style type of play where you're scared of/avoid enemies, but encounters are trivialized and mostly very easy due to this next issue listed)

Death means nothing (you lose nothing, all you do is spawn somewhere that you choose and thats it. Only downside is maybe having to walk back to the enemy you were fighting, assuming they didnt become invisible or only exist in your friends instance and not yours)

Sometimes being invisible on your own menus so you cant see what you're wearing, or what you could put on (fixed by rebooting game)

Previews not previewing anything (you click on it, hover over it, nothing. You just equip it and have your friend tell you what it looks/sounds like)

Sadly some of the mystery of the world has been lost with the addition of NPCs. The feeling of truly being alone and constantly wondering where everyone went has significantly weakened. What's worse is there's no new *real* content to be seen. The devs keep pushing paid DLC with the occasional lone new enemy, but no significant updates to the lore, world, or weapons.

I guess overall, I would to anyone that's never played it before and especially if you have friends to play with, but if you like me and played it a few updates back and curious to jump back in, I'd probably hold off. Especially after seeing that their other game is being pulled already. It just brings in question what direction the devs are going in.

My experience with GEN Zero:
I was really enjoying this game but after recent updates it deleted all my saves, so I stopped playing and I'm not sure if I'll ever come back. It felt like the devs have good intentions and continue to add new content but too often game breaking bugs persist for too long. It is a really neat and unique game. The gun play is fun, the abilities are okay but I'd prefer some rework in this area. More abilities to feel like more unique roles and more ability trees and options and unlocking more choices at a time instead requiring you to unlock some perk you never wanted. For example, why not make it so the ability to expand your carry capacity is available either earlier or just all the time regardless of points invested in a single tree. I think the abilities should be more like a web or actually like a tree that branches. It's just two choices and only a handful of abilities in length. They did a huge rework of the crafting which made it extremely grindy feeling to be able to craft special ammos and items. You spend way more than you can get back if you play on GORILLA like I do. It also feels bad that there isn't really any reward scaling for playing on a higher difficulty beyond just wanting the game to challenge you. It's far easier to farm rare items on regular difficulty which feels backwards to me. Maybe that's just me though. Either way, there's a real bittersweet love that I have with this game. I've invested a couple hundred hours into it and may even continue to play it some but my saves are corrupted/unusable after the updates so I haven't touched it again and don't want to start completely from scratch again, especially since my friends stopped playing it after the big rework they did with crafting and some other game mechanics. 

The game does some great sales and it's worth picking up on a big sale even if you don't get any of the DLCs. I think the Map Expansion DLCs are defintiely worth getting and the weapon DLCs are nice variety if you want more weapon choices, but overall they tier the weapons in such a way that there's just always a clear **BEST** weapon per ammo type. So it kinda feels like a waste (or sub-optimal game performance) to use any other weapon especially since resources can be a bit tedious to get in order to build what you want to use. If you're interested in the game, I'd say it's worth picking up on sale for sure. I may never pick the game back up, so it feels like a bad breakout to leave it in a way that feels like I can't come back to it, since my game files are gone forever.

At 5 hours in (blind), you think you've stumbled upon a really brilliant Combat/Story/Looter/Survival FPS with RPG elements.  The graphics are beautiful with lush timberland and farmland sectors with appropriate POIs, all with a cool Nordic/Euro vibe; the sound is truly epic, which helps a lot in making the gun-play feel visceral and satisfying and the exploration scary; the story and the focus of the game are fairly original and mysteriously intriguing; and the looting is as good as any other looter. You're feeling really good about the game at this point.

Then unfortunately, at 20 hours in, when you've discovered most all of the mechanics in the game, you realize, in a moment of utter disappointment, that you're playing a complete clown-show of a game.

- Decades and decades ago, mankind discovered how to save status in computer programs and especially games. A shining example of the peak of this knowledge is found in the Stalker games, where saving game state is a vital necessity in a difficult combat game. Now, similar to how we lost track of ancient tech and don't know how the pyramids were built, GZ developer seems to have lost the knowledge of how to properly save your current game-state. The replacement of Save-Game with ""Respawn"" mechanics is a very disheartening direction for singleplayer games (which, while also MP & Coop, GZ definitely is), not just with GZ, but throughout the whole contemporary industry.

- Game is designed for gamepad control (really sad for a FPS), where mouse/keyboard control seems to have been a mere afterthought or a nuisance to port over, an exasperation, seemingly rushed out the door without concern for old school M/KB players. The truly superior functionality of mouse/keyboard on PC over gamepad is either lost on this developer, or actively prejudiced against.

- Developer seemingly despises lefties. Zero option for changing keybinds for weapon/equipment slots; zero option for changing menu hotkeys; zero ability to toggle Sprint if you've changed the sprint key (one must turn off ""toggle sprint"" in order to use other than default sprint key.) This all makes the gameplay a clumsy mess for lefties. Thanks a lot! I'm sure this ties in directly with it being primarily a gamepad intended game.

- FOV and Aim Down Sight. I increase FOV significantly so everything doesn't feel right on top of me. Sadly, when using only iron sights (often preferential for smgs etc...) you realize while pressing ADS, the game momentarily returns to default FOV until you release ADS. This leads to such a cluster-f@#! in close quarter combat that you want to pull your hair out. It only dawned on me later what was happening here, and I instantly realized why I become so discombobulated and ineffective during close range fights.

Look, I could go on and on with more problems, especially about progression [Fighting giant tank machines surrounded by other support machines, while armed with pea-shooters and a prayer, one against menacing squad; not to mention trap, distract, mine etc... options that NEVER seem to work as planned] or the obtuseness of other mechanics, but I'm done wasting time here.

I could never recommend a game that, after only 23 hours play, maybe barely a third of the way through, I've expelled from my hard drive with prejudice. Bottom line is: For the money spent, I gained about 5 hours of initial intrigue and gameplay enchantment... before it gradually soured upon familiarization. That's it!

STORE ALL IN CATEGORY - DELETES EVERYTHING IT MOVES
the game just deleted all my guns and their attachments when i hit store all in category.
I'm so pissed i may never play this again
i lost every experimental i had and all the gold attachments on them and the costs for the modifications for each one. Several hundred hours gone.

How is something so basic for the GUI so broken it deletes all my stuff.

I even tried it again, i modded a one star weapon put a scope on it hit the button Store all in category and ... Poof!
... Its gone the scope the materials and the gun.. just gone.
For a $100 game this is just unacceptable.

I cant believe i spent several hundred hours (literally months) collecting materials and scavenging parts for guns and killing reapers all for nothing just because a GUI that should have been fixed long ago; way before they started working on DLCs is still so broken it deleted everything i worked for.

The is also no customer support for his it just goes to the games website.

Macdallan:  Generation Zero is a first person ""looter/shooter"" game that takes place in Sweden in 1989.  

Interested Player:  Okay, but can you be more specific?

Mac:  Yup!

.....

Interested Player:  Mac, stop it.  You do that all the time.

Mac:  Technically I answered your question, but okay.  I'll elaborate.

You play as a teenager, sporting a wide array of clothing from that 80s, who ends up running around Sweden looting stuff from cars, buildings, and shooting (and also looting) a fairly limited array of robots (five basic types, several variations of each) while trying to figure out where everyone else went, and slowly learning where the robots came from.

Okay, so let's address this right now.  This game's got some glitches.  Some minor, some ah... not so minor.  Minor?  Sometimes the animation for working a bolt on a bolt action rifle doesn't play.  It still chambers another round just fine, the animation just doesn't happen.  No problem there.  Less minor?  Well, sometimes your weapons or items won't switch right away when you hit a key and you have to try two or three times.  Sometimes you have to jump to get out of a crouch or you won't sprint when you try to sprint.  Sometimes your bicycle will hit something and stop or bounce up in the air and both of those things usually knocks you off the bike.  Major?  Well, occasionally you'll get stuck on something or glitch through terrain and ""fall"" until you use your only option to fix it - fast-travel.  If you glitch through terrain you usually have to re-start in order to prevent it from happening again as soon as you step on a non-building surface.  Annoying, but it's only happened to me once.  I've been stuck a few times, too, but it wasn't really a big deal.  Fast travel, continue on.

The inventory needs more work.  Ammo type isn't always obvious for certain weapons.  Inventory can be displayed by basic type such as main weapons, sidearms, utility, ammo but that's as far as the sorting goes.  Similar items aren't grouped in the same part of the inventory list, and while items have several quality levels they aren't grouped that way, either.  I think the devs will continue to improve the inventory since they've made several changes since the game first launched.

Interested Player:  Okay, okay.  It's got some issues but most of those don't seem too bad.  But... is it fun?  How does it look?  Are the characters all the same?

Macdallan:  Yeah.  I think it is fun.  There's a fairly wide array of gear, weapons, and clothing to customize your characters and loadouts.  The story is pretty good, even though some people don't think it has a story (probably because they're not paying attention to it), and you uncover more as you play.  You have to really read and piece together the clues and information you gather and yes, that takes some effort on your part.  don't worry, it's really not that hard.

I think that overall the game looks really good but a lot of the buildings, vehicles, and building interiors seem far too similar, many are carbon copies.  It's most noticeable in buildings where one interior is identcal to another, or when several rooms in larger buildings look almost exactly the same.  The terrain and trees look good, and if you stop for a minute to really look around you'll find it feels fairly real.  I really like the robots.  There are variations that look a bit different.  Yes, there are a limited number of basic robot types (Bodies?  Chassis?) but they move well and I think they all look great.  The characters you play look okay, though some players don't really like the character models, particularly the faces.

The sound design is generally great.  You can hear a lot of the larger enemies before you see them, and can often tell roughly where an enemy is if you listen.  I often hear the wind in the trees, and it sounds just right to me.  I think the guns sound fine, too.  Overall I think the sound design works well.

I have found that this game, unlike many others, actually rewards you for exploring.  You may not have a mission or reason to go to some areas, but I've found that when I poke around in places that are a bit out of the way I'll often find more things to loot, and in many cases those areas have more lootable containers than the more obvious locations.

Loot is mostly random, but there are certain areas that contain specific items that you only find once.  Certain containers tend to have specific item types.  For example gun boxes contain guns and gun related attachments and ammo boxes have... ammo!

You can have up to four characters at a time, and can easily copy or back up the save folder in order to have multiple games on the go at once.  The game  has no way to do this, but it's not hard to copy/past or re-name folders.  Each character has a skill limit, so should specialize in a few areas.  Some skills boost health, damage resistance, carry capacity, stamina, healing items, amount of ammo found, reload speed, explosive damage, and more.  At the bottom of each column of skills there is a special ability, you have to put one point in each preceding ability to unlock the last one, and only one special ability can be active at a time.  You can change it, but I don't find it's worth buying more than one since it's a point that could have been spent on another skill.

The game begs to be played with multiple players since the skill points are limited and on higher difficulty settings most players find the bots can be rather difficult to solo.  You could easily build a team with a tough character that has higher health and damage reduction, a spotter/sniper with a steady aim that can mark enemies for the others, a medic with high carry capacity and the ability to use medkits on the other players and do so more effectively, and an engineer that can scavenge more parts from downed foes.

Interested Player:  Okay, but is this game worth full price?

Macdallan:  Yes, but only because the full price is quite reasonable.  As always I encourage you to wait for a sale, especially if you're not sure you'll like it.  Watch videos and read the forums if you aren't sure.  I really like the game despite some shortcomings and bugs.

The Gunplay feels good. Maybe not perfect but that solely depends with what it might be compared.
Character Customization does not only give personal Touch but you can upgarde every clothing with a modification of your choice.
Simply put: The game had a lots of ups and not that many downs if one considers it is STILL an Early Access Game. And the developers continuosly strive to improve the experience.

The thing that I still like the most about G:Z. is the atmosphere it provides paired with an actual deep and interesting story if you take the time for it. Sure you can just Run-and-Gun through everything.... But if you read the letters, the instructions of your Quests and take in every little detail, then you get a story that makes you constantly want more.

What magic spell the game has put on me to affect me so positively I don't know, but it feels almost addictive. Some say it's the breath-taking graphics, the light, the weather system and the eerie atmosphere you experience. Others say it's the 1989 setting on a Swedish island.

And now in 2023 that new Tactical Response DLC with the Homing Turret and the Remote Controlled Tick is great fun and the best DLC yet. Very helpful and useful tools to have in the fight against the machines.

The game isn't hard if you play like if it is real. You wouldn't go fight a machine as tall as a house from close up with just a pistol, would you? Sure you can play the game thinking you're invincible. But the only thing that is really hard is waiting for new content to learn more of the story.

I have not dug into the combat very far.  I have completed the campaign and one DLC with my crew.  Fighting against the small and medium enemies mostly consisted of ""hide behind a rock while reloading, and when they flank you, empty your magazine into them"".  For the building-sized enemies, it was mostly ""hide behind a building and pop out to launch a rocket ; repeat 30"" .  If there is a more interesting way to conduct combat, the game does not make it evident.

When you are not in combat with robots (which is the vast majority of the time) you are playing a Hidden Object game by looting all the abandoned houses.  Search every cabinet for spare bullets and first aid packs.  Search every car for steel and batteries.  Collect cool clothing.  Rob the dead.  They can't use those bullets any more.

Travelling around the map is boring on foot.  You can spawn in a bicycle in certain locations, but that makes it hard to go over hills.  If you are not over carry weight limit you can fast travel to a known safehouse.  If you are not over carry limit, prepare for a slow slog.

Inventory management is a nightmare.  What is even weighing you down?  I feel like I need a pie chart.  You have too much ammo?  Can you remember what ammo is used by guns you use?  The UI will tell you what is chambered, but not eligible variants (AP -vs- FMJ?) .  Are you overloaded with first aid kits?  Deposit some, and drag the slider to make sure you keep enough in your backpack to patch up all the ankle-injuries from the robofleas.  Do you want to recycle some stuff from your bank?  You'll have to manually remove some from the bank and then take it over to the recycling station.  I hope you pulled out an exact multiple of the recycle quantum, or you'll have to put the leftovers back.  

All this Amazon Warehouse Simulator chews up time I could be out strolling across the fields on my way to shoot way-too-many rockets at a giant robot and rummage through cabinets.

Now few years later: Oh my god this game is fucking awesome.

-The interfaces are inconsistent and glitchy.

-Damage calculation is absolutely broken- for example explosives do MASSIVE damage to players, but the rocket launcher is barely even usable at higher levels. A literal rocket launcher, yes, you read that right- is unusable at higher levels.

-Equipped weapons and mods are NOT protected.

-The new weapon augments are nonsensical at worst, broken at best.

-The companion has a habit of sending you flying through walls and out of the map.

-Other players have colliders which can cause you to get pushed or even stuck in tight spaces.

-The vehicles slow to a ridiculously bad crawl when you go offroad, even literal dirtbikes.

-Excess of DLC that is overpriced.

-Excess of DLC and new content despite how broken the game already is.

TL;DR - the devs have NO idea what they are doing, just chase money and new ideas like a spoiled child goes through new toys. I advise avoiding this game unless you are a masochist like myself and enjoy a love-hate relationship with some games. If you don't like idiotic design choices, blatant cash-grabs, and a fascinating (once amazing) concept of a game with some really fun mechanics- THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.

Sure is pretty to look at, though... And multiplayer actually works again.

This game despite being a sandbox open world has only three main features guns, robots and missions (short and story ones).

There is no survival mode (food, consumables etc)
There is no meaningful exploration (the map is awfully empty besides robots and structures that you only need visit once)
There is no meaningful base building (base building is barebones and offer nothing besides being a resource dump when your depo is full)
There is no variety in playstyles specially in higher difficulties (you either run and gun or you don't have fun)
There is no enviromental visual variety, everywhere looks the same (Memorable landmarks are rare, like the air base, the nuked bunker etc, they could add more memorable and explorable landmarks).

I personally think this is an ok game, not too good but not too bad (and that's why I hit the recommend option because there is nothing in the middle, but it doesn't exactly deserve a ""no""). I personally don't like it as much as I would for other games for a two reasons: The difficulty, and the monotonous gameplay. When I first started to play this game, I liked it and thought it was fun. But it just feels like the same thing repeats over and over again: Running from town to town to try and find any signs of human life. Now that cycle probably eventually breaks, but at this point I don't really feel like trying to find out because I am on a specific task that has me doing so, but I really don't want to do it because I've done it so many times now. And this brings me to my second reason: The difficulty. This can all be fixed with one thing though: making it easier to regenerate health. The only way to regenerate health in this game is to find first-aid kits. However, they are quite hard to find, and most of the time you won't have any when you are in the middle of a fight, so it's very easy for the robots to kill you. This could be fixed if you were allowed to regen health automatically, and the kits gave overshields, and then it would be much easier to face the in-game foes. 

Essentially, I don't think this is a bad game, and I feel like it has a lot of potential, but if you are ok with a large grind and difficult fights, then I think this game would be perfect for you. The world is breathtaking and the graphics are spectacular. But if you are not okay with a grind and difficult fights, then I would recommend another game.

There was plenty of ammo and enough med kits to keep you going. After you learn how to fight and get some of the better weapons (esp. the very fine .50 cal.) you can take down even the biggest of the machines. Early on tho there were times I simply had to run and hide. The woods and fields are beautifully rendered and the weather effects are excellent. Crouching in a wood shed during a driving rain you can almost feel the chill. The story line keeps the game interesting as you complete missions and gain a larger picture of where the machines came from. Combat mechanics are precise with very satisfying  weapon and explosion sounds. More than once while making my way thru a dark forest one of these machines would suddenly bark nearby and raise me an inch or two out of my chair. Playing solo, the sense of immersion and being alone is intense.

The physics is a lil wonky, example for this is when I was running to my motor bike and fell off a 1 foot drop while running and I lost 45 HP, I had 1 perk point on extra health too. This game isn't attune for lower end PCs but I've been able to have my PC run pretty good while keeping the game looking nice, I have it on medium settings with V-Sync. Definitely a unique, first person, survival, looter, building, shooter, and one of my all time favorite games to play with friends and alone, there's a ton of story telling, beautiful scenery, and satisfaction. This game has that really cool looking special effects when destroying enemies, just feels all so satisfying, kinda how Destiny 2 makes you feel when killing a ton of thralls with volatile rounds just oooo so nice. I really hope this game gets more attention, love, care, and players, I am a huge fan of this game and being able to see IGP play this when I was 14 years old in its early stages and playing it now at 19 years old on my own PC running way better than my crappy Xbox One is just amazing. 10/10 Definitely recommend a try without a doubt!

For gameplay the stealth and the system with different weak points on each robot is nice and the setting is a bit different then the usual games but so many fun Items are locked away behind a paywall and it feels like these Items could round up the game great to fill some empty feeling parts or quests that start to become repetitive.

I hope at some point in the future the devs will implement some more weapons and other fun things that you dont have to pay for.

Singleplayer is a lot harder then expected, you can feel that the game is intended to be played with friends but if i remeber correctly you can change the difficulty in the settings.

At the time, it was kind of a directionless mess in coop.  I had three buddies on, who were very familiar with teamplay, so we knew how to coordinate.  But there wasn't any direction on what to do, and keeping the group together became an infinite challenge amidst the crashes and general lack of information.

And we ragequit after a few hours, never to go back to the game again.

It's been four years now.  It's gotten better.  My coop partner doesn't get much in the way of directions, but I, as the host, certainly do, and I'm kind of bossy sometimes so I keep the mess somewhat coordinated and it's fine.

The game very clearly encourages a guerilla-style gameplay.  Enemies, even on normal difficulty, can end you fairly quickly.  I say ""fairly"" because even the teenaged protagonists can take four .32 ACP hollowpoint bullets and keep walking, so it's not the utmost of realism.  But enemies shoot like eight-round bursts or something so it doesn't take much to get killed up.

Though getting killed up is really a minor inconvenience.  You just get sent back to the nearest safehouse and survivors can (after advancing the plot a little) put down limited-use fast-travel beacons.

Sometimes the UI isn't interactive.  The character won't crouch in some locations (usually cramped quarters), without any feedback why.

While the forums are filled with notices about how buggy the game is, I've only encountered one now:  A flying enemy showed up that only my coop buddy could see.  They're not subtle, those guys, they glow and hum and, after getting shot up a bit, also smoke.  But I saw nothing, even when she finished gunning it down and looted the (non-existent for me) wreckage.

We haven't fully left the starting zone, since we're slow and methodical players, but I can say it's been a much more enjoyable experience now.  That said, much of what I wrote in my old review (which follows) still holds true:  You mug robots for bullets.  The houses feel fairly generic.  MOST loot is instanced (everything in containers, and much of the stuff lying loose) so you needn't worry about ninjalooting.

If you have a group of buddies who can communicate and work in a team, you could probably set up brilliant ambushes and teach the robots who the boss is.  And I can see this being really miserable for a group of randos.

-------------OLD REVIEW from 2019 follows-------------------
RIght now:  kinda buggy.  Not hugely, like totally unplayably buggy, just kinda buggy.  Like a crash-to-desktop once an hour sort of buggy, and you've logged back in a kilometer behind your party and need to run a gauntlet through enemy lines buggy.  Like, ""All the quests are just automatically found and you just sort of meander about mugging robots for bullets.""

There's nothing wrong with that, though.  It's kind of like a cooperative, modern(ish) TES game, where you roam the Swedish countryside and, yeah, mug robots for bullets.  You can get XP and level into various skill trees though they feel a bit basic and jumbled to me.

I suppose there's a plot but the whole thing started unlocked for me in a multiplayer game so I have no idea what's really going on, other than there's some robots that want to kill us and my fellow Swedish highschool kids will shoot the blank out of them so we can get the bullets out of them.

Also:  Loot is instanced, so you don't need to worry about things being swiped before you get there.  Definitely coop friendly.

My only complaint, other than the bugs, is the generic sameness of the houses so far.  They have exactly the same layout.  Yes, I've been to a mcsuburb and that's not really any different, but in a game with exploration as a key element, having different things to explore would be nice.

Right now, it's a cautious, heavily-warned, there's-gonna-be-bugs thumbs up.   You're best-off waiting for patches.",1553709991,1699298891,True,5,0,0.534763336181640625,0,True,False,False

It was okay for what it was, but always had enough weird nagging issue to stop if from being great. But they're trying really hard to turn this into a grindy forever-game (Get your friends! Do sieges! Get weapon drops! Keeping playing! BUY MOAR DLC!), and I just don't care. Really wish there was an actual interesting mystery to solve with an actual conclusion, but no, you're stuck in a perpetually ruined Sweden without any narrative closure.


But at least it sold well, which is presumably why [b]Systemic Reactions[/b] didn't drop it like hot garbage and leave everyone out to dry.


Which of course they did to their other game. No, not Ravenbound. Their other [i]other[/i] game. Yeah, the cancelled Early Access one. Yeah, [b]Second Extinction[/b].


[h2]So no, I DO NOT recommend this game. Because I cannot in good conscious recommend anything from this studio, on account of their anti-consumer business practices.[/h2]


They were radio silent for a year, then teased a final release, missed that date by months before saying anything again, then went radio silent for yet another year before finally cancelling the game. Meanwhile this same studio has been releasing DLC for Generation Zero like hotcakes, and also launched Ravenbound.

They couldn't afford to spend the time, effort, and resources to finish the game they already launched and which I already paid for. But they had enough to of those to develop a 3rd game instead, and launch it while having zero communication with the community about Second Extinction. Not even a 'hey, we hear you, but we don't have anything to say right now'. Nothing. They took my money, and used it to develop Ravenbound rather than finished the game I had bought. Then cried poverty that the game they failed to support wasn't popular enough to get the attention it needed.

Now Second Extinction is cancelled, meanwhile the game requires a login to their Apex account servers. When they close the servers, so too does accessing any legally functioning version of the game. Pirated copies will still work fine (the injustice of game DRM strikes again). But as for anyone who gave them money? We get to eat sh*t, because commenting out a server call request in their game's code is too much effort. Two years later, and not only are we not getting any of the hinted at release content, we can't even get a version that won't be bricked through negligence a year from now.

This game can be very buggy sometimes, much like Skyrim, and the game can run very poorly on lower end systems and consoles, but that's a perk of the devs being a rather small team. I've loved this game since the very beginning and i plan to stay loyal to this game much much longer.

If you ever think about buying this game, it's well worth it, definitely disregard any second thoughts you had for this game.

This game I would DEFINITELY recommend back in the day, the atmosphere that was devoid of life, filled with remnants of battles that had one obvious outcome of survivors being gone, either dead or MIA. The hopeless hints that pointed at the fact there was someone alive on the archipelago with you only added to the atmosphere, because wherever you searched, there were bunkers filled with machines and buildings scorched down to the ground.

This is where it ends, however.
With ""recent"" updates, the game was mildly casualified, schematics for various different things you needed back in time, obtainable by finding them around the world or completing side quests were replaced with a system, where if you craft enough items in a category, you can now unlock new ones by spending points.
The world, which whole atmosphere was being fed by the fact that there are ruthless war machines trying to kill you and everyone else present was now ruined, as literally right in the beginning of the game you get to see a 'survivor', which tries their best to make it look like they are afraid there is nobody else except you and them left, only to ultimately be met with a second one just a few story points later. This completely ruined the silent atmosphere that was only occasionally interrupted by growling, humming machines, recorders and your characters breathing while out of stamina.

There is a lot more that I won't dive into, but I generally think I do not enjoy the game as much as I did before, as what made it unique from a lot of games that are built on an atmospheric open world 'survival' theme, this one lost.

I still encourage you to try the game out for yourself, perhaps you will personally enjoy it for a few hours, or will want to find the various collectibles across the locations, there is still, infact, a lot to do.

If you go out of your way and loot inaccessible spots you will just find the same dull crafting components everywhere. If you're lucky you might even get another red dot sight for your collection, (you'll have 5 after about 10 minutes of looting). This is true EVEN if you've learned the lockpick skill and pick locks to get to ""exotic"" locations. 

The core gameplay is just depressing. If you let the devs hold your hand and play the game the exact way it's intended, (following the main questline without detours), you'll just travel from the same dull combat again and again. I've fought 3 of the games mini-bosses, and they're all the same. No new moves, attack patterns, weaknesses, nothing. 

IF you however are like me, and enjoy side quests and exploring, you'll find that you gain absolutely nothing from it. I've had FIVE different quests now where I've had to re-visit a location to get a quest item that I couldn't interact with the first time I was there, just because I needed to do something else first. These Items have all been letters btw, so there is no reason at all for me to not interact with the clues beforehand. 

If you get a quest that is ""Search for .... between ... and ..."", You'll literally get a marker of the exact location on your map and HUD. So you're essentially just a zombie fetching items which locations are already known. 

I wasn't sure if I would include this since I can't speak to the online experience, but I figured I might aswell let you know that the combat is WAY to easy. I've played on the hardest difficulty by myself and I find myself dissapointed after every boss fight I've had. No close calls, no nothing. With this in mind I can only imagine how easy it must be if you're in a squad. As someone who has played all of the Souls games + Elden Ring, I obviously don't expect that level of combat and difficulty, but this game just makes it ridiculously easy. You don't even have to use the stealth mechanics, since it's more viable to just run and gun all the time. 


Overall it's an incredibly underwhelming experience and I would not recommend it at all. The game HAS tons of potential, and it honestly makes me sad how the devs just did nothing with it.

Once you spawn your companion in it will then ask you to craft and equip armor for it, Which if you did that in the first place you can no longer do until it gets blown off. There are other examples of such oversight or unintuitive nature but I wont harp on it as they are mostly liveable.

This game offers a unique blend of open-world exploration, survival, and cooperative gameplay that sets it apart from the rest. After spending hours in the world of Generation Zero, I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this hidden gem.

First and foremost, the game's post-apocalyptic Swedish countryside setting is breathtaking. The developers have painstakingly recreated a visually stunning and atmospheric world that truly immerses you. The attention to detail in the environments, from dilapidated homes to the dense forests, is impressive, making exploration a constant joy. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle further add to the sense of realism, making each playthrough unique.

One of the standout features of Generation Zero is the cooperative multiplayer experience. Teaming up with friends or even strangers online to tackle the threat of menacing, hostile robots adds a layer of excitement and camaraderie that is hard to find in other games. The need for teamwork, strategy, and communication is perfectly balanced, and the feeling of facing the unknown together is exhilarating.

The game's core mechanics, including combat, stealth, and character progression, are well-executed. There's a sense of accomplishment in taking down the various robotic adversaries as you scavenge for resources and upgrade your gear. The weapon customization system is a highlight, allowing for a high degree of personalization to suit your playstyle.

While Generation Zero offers a rich and engaging world, it's not without its flaws. Some players might find the pacing a bit slow at times, as the game encourages exploration and cautious planning. Additionally, the narrative, although intriguing, can be somewhat vague, leaving players to piece together the story from scattered clues. This can be a pro or a con, depending on your preference for storytelling.

In conclusion, Generation Zero is a game that deserves more attention. Its unique blend of open-world exploration, survival elements, and cooperative play is a breath of fresh air for those looking for something different in the first-person shooter genre. The visually stunning world, engaging multiplayer experience, and deep gameplay mechanics make it a hidden gem worth exploring. Despite a few minor shortcomings, Generation Zero has the potential to keep you and your friends entertained for hours on end.

Pros:

Unique Concept: Unlike any other, the game's blend of survival and Swedish robot warfare stands out.
Gorgeous Scenery: The Swedish countryside is portrayed with stunning attention to detail.
Mystery Galore: Unraveling the cause behind the robot invasion keeps you curious and engaged.
80s Nostalgia: Get ready for a wave of retro goodness with a cool '80s soundtrack.

Cons:
Co-op Quirks: Teamwork can be as chaotic as an IKEA furniture assembly manual.
Slow Burn: Progression can sometimes feel as leisurely as a Swedish midsummer night.

It is precisely the effort to stay alive that is the alpha and omega of the whole experience, and without a lengthy introduction, when you choose and adjust your teenager as you wish, you plunge headlong into a quite original, but unfortunately poorly presented story. It is set in Sweden during the 80s of the last century, the Cold War is at its peak and while you are enjoying a boat trip with a bunch of friends, incomprehensible events have occurred on land in between. In addition, immediately after returning you find yourself under attack and the fight for your life begins without anyone asking you anything at all. The strange thing is that you don't run into other people anywhere, because the occupants of the game map are exclusively mechanized retro beasts, matching their appearance and equipment to the period setting. Unfortunately, for a long time you will only be wondering where they come from, what they want and what their goal is, after all.
There is no engaging story or generally dense lore in the game. Searching for fragmentary reports from newspapers, diaries or audiologists will tire you very quickly, and you will surely understand, like us, that the narration should definitely not play the main role.

Generation Zero is a relatively dense survival where every bullet will matter if the clash really happens. The fact that IKEA has not yet cut down all the surrounding forests gives the game a decent and burdensome atmosphere, which you can't get rid of at least in the beginning. Again, the thought of what if someone sees you is watching you will stress you out, and before long you will be hounded like a confused doe in heat.
I can praise the atmosphere of the game and its setting. However, not too many titles came to Scandinavia. In addition, the developers have added to the atmosphere with changeable weather and the alternation of day and night, thanks to which, even after playing for a long time, you will calmly stand for a while and just enjoy yourself. Whether it's a view of the misty haze hanging in the valley, or an old Volvo standing next to typical Nordic buildings.

This game is what i was looking for. Great graphics and the sound, OMG, its pretty amazing, the best sound i ever heard in a game before.

The game have a good ambientation, good aiming... I do recommend this.

BUT, i cant say if the game will not fall in a circle, till now is amazing.

Well, after 40hrs i have some words:

1 - The history is not good at all, but it does not matters.

2 - The game is very good.

3 - Have some audio bugs.

4 - Need more enemys. 

5 - Could be some animals in the florest.

6 - The robots could destroy the housesm or at least do some damage, its easy to get cover in there and kill everything.

7 - I really like this game, worth the money!

And here i go! 120hrs of gameplay!
The game still better then ever, but need more content, like quests, weapons and enemys. You can beat the game in almost 30hrs, then you just repeat again and again. 

Now i can tell you something really bad about this game, DLCs. They launch some content, but the best part is paid. Well, i dont like it. Every time i want to do some of the new stuff is needed another payment. They give you just the worst part of the dlc, the good stuff cost you every single time.

The game itself is fun, fluid animations and good game feel, but man, it feels like a kid's game sometimes. It suffers from FarCry syndrome.

Update:

It is still a fun game, albeit it likes to hold your hand, but the looting system is all the same. Most items are found in bags and boxes, with very little on the ground, and no way to search cabinets, etc.

It brings a refreshing and original concept to the table with its apocalyptic battle between humanity and robots, offers interesting elements like weapon rarity, diverse ammunition types, and can be an absolute blast when enjoyed with friends in co-op mode. At times, it manages to immerse players in its post-apocalyptic world and even delivers moments of tension, turning into a thrilling action-packed experience. However, it's hard to turn a blind eye to the game's significant drawbacks.

Let's start with the positives. The concept of Generation Zero is undeniably intriguing. The clash between humans and machines in a post-apocalyptic setting offers a unique backdrop for an action game. The implementation of weapon rarity and various ammunition types adds depth to the gameplay, making loot hunting a genuinely engaging experience. Co-op play shines as a highlight, turning the game into a hilarious and immersive experience that's both fun and, at times, genuinely scary.

However, the game's flaws are hard to ignore. The most glaring issue is the game's terrible optimization. Even with a respectable RTX 2060 and medium settings, players can barely reach 70FPS, suggesting that something might be fundamentally wrong with the game's performance. This technical hurdle significantly hampers the overall gaming experience.

Another major downside is the game's tedious solo play. Generation Zero is clearly designed with co-op gameplay in mind, and this is evident at every turn. The idea of forcing players to play online, where random individuals can join your world without your consent, is frustrating, to say the least. It hampers immersion and control over your game world.

Skill acquisition in the game is slow, which can be discouraging, and there's a distinct lack of rewards for players who opt for higher difficulty levels. This decision diminishes the motivation to challenge oneself in tougher gameplay.

While the game's map is expansive, it feels excessively large, making it difficult for players to find the motivation to explore it thoroughly. This is further exacerbated by the game's artificial difficulty, which often feels more frustrating than challenging, thanks to the AI's unbalanced aimbot abilities. The lack of enemy variety on such a vast map also contributes to the feeling of repetitiveness.

Generation Zero falls short in terms of character development and the rewards it offers for exploration. The slow pace of both character growth and exploration fails to provide players with a sense of accomplishment, leaving them with a feeling of aimlessness.

In conclusion, Generation Zero is a game that comes tantalizingly close to being great, with its unique concept and interesting mechanics. However, it is marred by significant technical issues, a heavy reliance on co-op play, slow progression, and a lack of motivation for higher difficulty levels. While it can deliver immersive and thrilling moments, these are overshadowed by the frustrations of playing solo and the game's AI shortcomings. If the developers could address these issues, Generation Zero could truly shine. But not for now.

I have tried searching online for troubleshooting tips or workarounds but to no avail, If you can deal with the constant crashing or BSOD if it happens I would say go for it but i think am going to shelf this game and hope to comeback with fixes otherwise don't waste your money on the game and DLC's until patches or fixes are implemented.

Update: After the devs released their new content update I finally reinstalled the game and try to see if the game works properly and unfortunately it does not. The same constant crashing and BSOD errors appear as it seems the game was not fixed. Its disappointing however I do believe this game needs to be remade properly or my system does not support this game as I have tried other games and did not experience these issues that I am having.

Update : After such a long time waiting i figured out the constant crashing while playing this game as it was due to the fact of MSI Gaming Mode was turned on.

The amount of DLC is pretty ridiculous, too - a lot of them should have been free additions, especially in a game that desperately needs more variety to patch up its weaknesses. 

I will say though that the atmosphere and sound design are fantastic. Creeping through a dense forest while hearing all sorts of bass-y horns, shrill beeps and thunderous footsteps from the robots never gets old, and puts me on edge even after a few dozen hours.

Healing takes way too long just to use one medkit. Too many redundant movements from switching to medkit (which also takes a lot of time) and using that medkit just for a tini tiny health.

And the only way the developer provide solutions to those problems are paid DLC. Normally p2w stuff can only be seen in f2p games but for this game it felt like ""if p2p and p2w have a child"" thing.",1697289315,1697289315,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

__

Development:
Anyone developing atmospheric games needs to play this. My first impression of this game was, ""This is Skyrim and an MMO with Dungeons, but the Dungeons are bunkers and the medieval tech is 80s pop culture and tech. Conclusion: Awesome!""

Downsides:

""The Message"". 
The only Swedes seem to be dead people, a rare couple silent npcs, and a soldier. Everyone else is like encountering a modern person trying to pretend how to be someone they have no idea how to be. 

""Lacking the love of Race, Nation, and Folk.""
I think this is just called Western Civilization now. 
That is, the distinct sense that if it reflects prosperity, culture, or goodness of any kind then the West will stand in opposition to that. It takes a little while for the playful deliberately B-Rate Horror feeling to fall off in Generation Zero. Because of that you can wander around enthralled for awhile with ""the 80s"" being itself. 
Even so, there are many moments that make you pause... and then cringe. There's no Swedish in Sweden is what I have come to learn from Generation Zero. Maybe there never were. And that in ""The Message"" coming back, redoubling, and defining what the West ultimately goals towards. 

The Game's Most Distinct Problem:
""Within a Year""
The game seems to take place within a single year. There are developments, but I prefer to think these are actually happening simultaneously in the 'real-time' of the game. The slowness of things unfolding is just because Development is hard, Maintenance is hard, and a team only has so much time to devote. Anyone disciplined also knows time-off is good at helping time-on projects. 
What I see taking place is that in the game your ""survivor"" is really playing out the lives of many others. This is the ""why"" behind your teleporting about. The reason you can be fighting a Firebird in the north then chasing harvesters in the South Coast  a few minutes later. Altogether, this sums to a story.
What the Dev team lacks is a sense of 'experience' for what ""plugs in"" with that original sense of ""belonging"" you had at the start of the game. Unfortunately, this ideal is now anti-everything the West does. It may be beyond the developers' to conceive of it. I really mean that. I avoid buying games from Western companies because I just don't believe there is a human positive message to be found in them.

That being said, here's the core issue:
           As you wander around about you eventually will 'see it all'. The typical response in these games from a Western Developer is then ""base building"" and ""base assault"". Pew-pew. It's very brainless and pointless. Obviously you will die from time to time. And the more times you do the more it adds up.
           You begin to notice that this couldn't possibly happen in real life. NATO, the Soviets, and FOLK would eventually send aid and people.
           This is where the game Dev's being Western can't think. In any Western game. FOLK are going to help FOLK. Not the Globalists with their ""message"" (Anita, Theresa, etc). Real FOLK. Unfortunately, you only find their shot up houses. 
There's no Grandma Johansson or the Nilsson' and Olsson's farms running an underground railroad. Because? That would be what the West hates. Itself and anyone that has this left in their nations/societies. 

It's anti-""the message"".  

Which makes the game just profoundly depressing. This is a game that shows us our future. 


What could be done to change this:
I doubt a Western game would survive censorship if it attempted to add ""Folk"". However, it could potentially circumvent the censor for a time. Adding supply runs. On-foot 'treks' from some one location to another or chain of them. Hang Glider missions from the Mountains Region or other high altitude related non-combat actions from there to other areas. Even randomized Signal Decoding could be pretty easy to replicate. Go to Radio Tower at Mountains Region. Plant device OR Modified Tick (different purposes) and receive... side mission. I also thought about some spawn types that appear in like mirages instead of airdrops. To represent undetected hunter-seeker scouting parties for the robots. Rivals don't make any sense to me. It's just a loot box with legs. Having a rare new sleek and agile robot with a few appearance variance, like that bubble head thing in some of the advertisement pictures you find about the net. Where is that? It would be easy to have a ""Seeker"" mounted on the ""head"" of a robot for example. Just make a single 'frame' (probably cat-like?) that can be 'kitted out' with variables. Just like the companion. It even fits with 80s jest-mentality: Cats vs. Dogs. 
But again, this all depends on how anti-civ the West is going to get. We still see things like remote control cars as not-controllable decoys being produced in recent updates. So, the indoctrination or ""messaging"" pressure on companies hasn't gotten so Maoist yet against the annihilation of the Four Olds that remote control cars being a thing ""from the past"" (old ideas) isn't allowed. It's pretty remarkable considering the state of the West, but it's likely the censor is just preoccupied at the moment.
And so, in summary, Generation Zero is initially very culturally savvy. Very honestly reflecting the West as it was. Everything has a farm-equipment name to it that you're fighting. Which might be ""the message"" sneaking in or silly fun. Hard to say. Generation Zero lets you 'touch grass' so to speak, of a time 'before', which is definitely anti- ""the message"". Yet, it has no FOLK being Folk helping Folk and it is definitely not about ""retaking the homeland"". And that last is so strongly ""the message"" that is ultimately overshadows anything else about the game to be discussed.

The emptiness of Generation Zero is at once enduring as ""spectacle achievement"", but it reflects the goal of those elites who action against humanity today so explicitly one is left a little stunned. This is a really good luck at the future, minus the 'camps' that are inevitably coming if nothing changes. Low-key I think that's what the data-servers are in Generation Zero, too. All ""the bodies"" went somewhere and the story strongly hints it wasn't somewhere nice. 

Play or Don't Play:

 [     Play     ]

It's a technical achievement I won't expect to see again from a Western company any time soon. If you want a good 'touch grass' experience of ""the West before..."" this is nice. Just don't look for any people of that era in it. I think that is something now for Archaeology. 

No joke, I also think this game could be considered a kind time-traveler's documentary kind of game. Seeing all the 80s tech is really fascinating. That near-miss feel of Diesel-punk with a glimpses of the modern unnoticed by those living then... that's really fascinating. It really does feel like playing a weird archaeological game. Journey Man: Legacy of Time or something where you're trying to stop the WEF and Davos, but with variable outcomes as you mess with history trying to undo the destruction of humanity. ""Well, we made it to the 80s, but this time they released killer robots 50 years early."" Another time JFK was never born so the Orion Project Launches and humanity enters Post-Scarcity.  


P.S.
Firebirds ""have legs"". 
Instead of having them always flying make them land and walk. 
I still think firebirds are the least well-done thing in the game. Especially now that, again, hacking them is only useful in so far as making them 'go away'. They can't target ground units for some reason at the moment once hacked. So, hacked once? Land? Spiked-walker mode. Hack twice? Go into berserk turret mode? Hack three times? Actually friendly? Spider-walkers would be nice, though.",1673515650,1697229368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Well I've played the hell out of this game and gotten to know the play, it works, it's fun sometimes, manly it's frustrating though,,,, that is the all the pro's.

1. The story and missions have been made by people that consider their consumers to be mindless idiots, that waste time playing meaningless games. It is true in this case, the games story has been written in such a way that your bored by the blandness until you find yourself laughing at the obvious mistakes in logic, it's clearly not meant to be a joke but it's so bad that it becomes one.

The map design. 
I'm familiar with this Avalanche engine from playing (The Hunter, Call Of The DLC Cash) so I recognise everything from that game, the trees, buildings, car's birds that fly around as decorations, the only thing that the hunter didn't have in it is the robots, the wilds, or the environment of trees and land is nice to look at so I don't mind it, the buildings on the other hand are TERRIBLE, the 'cut and paste' map creators use is so terrible that little details like a single floppy disk sitting on an office desk is on every desk, the entire building, down to the trash in trash cans is identical. I'm not sure if I'm in an office at one side of the large map or the other, the layout of underground bunkers is completely nonsensical, by the time you finish going through everything your so bored you begin to get angry, it's like the maps where made by people who knew their work wouldn't be checked so they did the fastest worst job they could do and still collect their pay, their pay was probably crap so I don't harbour any resentment for them, although I do hate how in society nobody has pride in their work,

I refused to do a crap quick job in my last job and it was not pleasant, my boss hated it, but the customers liked it, I tried to explain that if I couldn't take pride in my work then I would hate the job, but my boss never understood, I quit in the end, oh well, this worlds in real trouble.",1691994105,1697042731,False,0,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

the game unfortunately does either a poor job at communicating which areas are what difficulty/equipment grade or the difficulty scaling itself is really poor.
I've owned it since forever and remember having fun with friends back then when it didn't have crafting, base-building or the companion, but haven't had much fun in my recent playthrough. we basically cleared the first area, went into the DLC endgame, bruteforced some roaming bosses and it was just destruction from there with full 5star gear

TLDR: it [b]can[/b] be fun with a few friends if you just don't use the companion, because it's a worthless buggy mess. try to clear one area after another + go and try other areas if you see yourself failing in the one you just went into. also be prepared to look stuff up because the UI is horrible and some mechanics are poorly explained and not intuitive at all.

what it does right:
- the crafting system is intuitive
- you can craft almost all essential equipment
- weapon grades are self explanatory
- the graffiti found throughout the world explains different enemy types and their weaknesses in pictograms
- the gunplay and skilltree are solid
- the progression isn't too spiky unless you brute-force harder areas
- you can finally upgrade your storage

what it does wrong
- clarity on almost anything is lacking: from how certain mechanics work up to the difficulty scaling of areas
- some resources are just too scarce so base building as of now just sucks unless you've played before so you have resources in your storage
- there is no way to tell if a support item is placeable or throwable until you actually use it
- the only throwable EMP is not craftable???
- enemies respawn every time you boot up the session again even in areas that you had to clear for safehouses like the hangar in the second area
- difficulty scaling: still unsure if it's just ass or if I keep stumbling into areas that I shouldn't be in
- no real upgrade in form of defences or armor apart from what little we get from clothing
- the companion just sucks. it dies within seconds against anything with a gatlin gun, it gets in the way constantly when travelling, looting or fighting and it attracts enemies. once it teleported into me, colliding with my hitbox which didn't know what to do so it launched me into space killing me instantly
- the loading of objects is ass. things will spawn in your face. I once backed up during a fight and the box that wasn't there when not looked at spawned while i was in it.
- in bigger towns lot of buildings are just filler. they can't be looted but you don't know you can't until you walk up to it. a waste of time",1696611021,1696681458,False,2,0,0.520544052124023438,0,True,False,False

ONLY GET THIS GAME DURING A SALE

(this upcoming thread is an edit for the sake of it)
The games EULA has been recently updated and is therefore not a sketch ""we'll take all your info"" kind of scheme. The Developers (or studio) will now only take things that are within the game (playtime. Crash reports. Game File Infromation etc.) This is very much so similar to games like Call of Duty, Battlefield or the Tom Clancy franchise. Altough i must say, it was their main fault for not having their EULA updated sooner.

Now with that out of the way:

The Game feels very good to Play even if you are alone altough playing alone makes the game feel tedious (especially in late-game). With Tedious i mean that Robots chew through your ammo supply or collecting cosmetics or emotes from challenges or exploration being rendered partially useless.

---but let me talk about the main game---

In generation Zero you play as a Swedish Teenager who came back from a long hunting trip to witness your land in shambles. Your goal is to find clues on what happened.

MAP

The map is enormous and filled with land-marks and interesting spots. The Map overall is wonderful and gorgeous to just look at making exploration interesting. Traversing through the map is a mixture between atmospheric enjoyment and manuvering hell as the vehicles only perform well on the streets forcing you to go by foot on land if you ever need to traverse through the woods or mountains

COMBAT

The Combat is solid and feels good while having a twist by having you to consider aiming at weakpoints for effective take-downs. (A problem i have with the combat tough is that ironsights, red-dot sights and sniper sights share the same aim sensibility, making sniping or normal ADS very annoying sometimes)

the story is... Alright. It's nothing special but it's also nothing boring. While there IS a Main Storyline, i find the side missions more interesting because of better story telling

MISSIONS

While the missions HAVE story and reasoning why you are doing that. They still are very stale and boring because of the missions being practically the same (SPOILER: the only 2 missions that felt different were the Truck/Payload extraction(DLC LOCKED) And the introduction to the base Defense Game-mode)

PROGRESSION

Progression is somewhat of a incosistent curve. I wasn't able to wrap my head around how the loot system works but i'll try to explain it

As you Progress in the game. You encounter containers that contain loot for you. from Cosmetics and Resources, to Weapon Modifications and Guns.

Killing, exploring and Finishing missions grant XP which lets you level up. Leveling up in Generation Zero grants you skill-points which can be invested into 4 skill trees (Combat, Support, Survival and Tech). While some skills give you passive buffs, othersd can change the way you may approach your next enemy.

You will also find and recieve more cosmetics as you go, letting you dress up as you wish to turn yourself into whatever you want to become

ENEMIES

The enemies are creative and always a challenge to fight against. All the different Machines have also different versions of them which engages and tells you to find the new weakspot on the newer machines which may turn the every-day robot fighting into something more interesting

END GAME

in the End-Game you mostly just hunt for collectibles, join strangers are play the wave defense gamemode. Theres not much else to do aside from obtaining every crafting schematic and/or weapon.

WAVE DEFENSE GAME MODE

the wave defense game mode is a fun little way to play the game while also recieving loot. Altough it is still the same ""Dumping your ammo into robots"" there isn't much of a diversity or set plan for the game mode as it looks like. they aren't planning on expanding the game-mode aside from adding DLC's. Which is a shame and wasted potential :/

DLC's

While many reviews talk about the game being DLC ridden. I cannot say the same

the game DOES have a lot of DLC's but most of them are map/campaign expansions or cheap weapon packs which don't seem to out-rank the core-guns. Altough the Motorcycle DLC aswell as the Equipment DLC are a shameful act. None of them are needed to get the full experience. 

(besides that the DLC's are pretty cheap considering we live in a world where decent games cost 70€ while they offer expensive cosmetical extensions)


OVERALL IMPRESSION

Generation Zero is with no doubts an amazing CONCEPT. The game is alright and is fun for every now and then.
Get the Game when it's on a SALE because then it is really worth for what it is.

The single player experience is atmospheric from the outset as you gradually uncover what the spluk is going on! Its also better if you also take the mindset ""I really don't want to die"", rather than getting too comfortable hitting the respawn button. You will find yourself having to patiently crawl past enemies, running away, or using one of many distraction methods the game provides when you're not prepped properly for a fight. The game never really allows you to get overpowered, and skill point progression -even when maxed- only seems to make life about 30% easier. Multiplayer makes the game much easier as one player can distract while the other can concentrate on crits to take enemies down faster. But, I think the game is more fun if you use the crafting stations for what i think the developer intended. You can literally be the A-Team. When you want to take down a powerful enemy, prep the area around a safe house with various traps, landmines and lures. Lure them in to each prepped zone then duck and cover. Its very satisfying to watch that massive enemy drop without firing a shot, light a fat cigar and say ""I love it when a plan comes together"". What would make the game better?... considering that the max level is 10,000, there seems to be no actual point to this as nothing increases after level 32. It would be better if after level 32 instead of earning skill points, crafting items gets gradually cheaper and you unlock other schematic options such as combining experimental ammunition, or improving apparel with more than one effect and to a higher level of resistance.

You will find corpses with ammo in them but no weapons,for balance they could also contain broken weapons

The clothing system is also a bit weird it would have been better to have every type of cloth still in categories but also to be able to drag them in

-robot accuracy is always on point
-rockets can miss the target by one pixel meanwhile you get damaged even if the rocket hit 25 feet away from you
-the defense the base is just pain,any structure you build can't even handle 10 shots of normal gunfire and the resources they need to build them are just to much
-storage limit,why do we have a limit to this
-can't recycle many things just by them selfs
-the backpack upgrade skill is a waste because the amount it adds is basically nothing especially when you need to curry so much ammo

Stealth sucks, you don't know what foliage blocks vision and which doesn't, it sometimes isn't clear why an enemy has spotted you when you assassinate their allies in one hit
Weapon progression sucks, unless someone drops you an experimental weapon (max tier) during multiplier early you always feel crippled with weapon choice

The bugs, I don't know how a 25 Euro game can have so many fundamental bugs 4 years after release, here are some of the worst:
Cannot loot correctly when enemies stack on top of each others; also applies to large enemies where you have to, for some reason, look at a specific body part of the corpse just to loot them
Multiplayer bugs, like enemies just not having loot, not being able to fast travel, enemy targeting switching instantly
Bike just randomly bricking against small branches but also being able to traverse rocks and stones without trouble

I've spent some serious hours in ""Generation Zero,"" and it's been a rollercoaster of emotions and adrenaline. Here's my take on the game:

""Generation Zero"" is a unique blend of open-world exploration and first-person shooter, set in a beautifully crafted, post-apocalyptic version of 1989 Sweden, just 3 years before Soviet Union collapsed. The game immediately immerses you in a hauntingly atmospheric world where you're pitted against relentless and highly unpredictable robotic enemies, meanwhile trying to survive, complete missions and gather enough loot to fight against stronger and stronger hostile robots.

Pros [+]:

 1) Would be the stunning Environment: The game's rendition of Sweden is simply breathtaking. The attention to detail and graphics in the environment, from dense forests to quaint villages, is impressive. Most iconic would be the traditional red colored Swedish homes near a lake/river.

 2) Cooperative Gameplay: Playing with friends is where ""Generation Zero"" truly shines. The cooperative aspect adds depth to the gameplay, making it easier to strategize and tackle challenging encounters.

 3) Mystery and Exploration: The storytelling is unconventional but engaging. The narrative unfolds gradually as you explore the world, piece together clues, and uncover the truth behind the robotic invasion.

4) Tense Firefights: Combat against the machines is genuinely thrilling. Each encounter feels intense and requires careful planning and resource management. The AI's unpredictability keeps you on your toes. But that depends on your difficulty level.

Cons [-]:

 1) Solo Play Can Be Challenging: While the game is designed for cooperative play, going solo can be tough, especially in the early stages. The machines can overwhelm you quickly if you don't find loot or equipment to withstand the attacks.

 2) Some Bugs and Technical Issues: Although there have been updates to address technical problems, you may still encounter some bugs. It's worth checking for the latest patches and updates.

 3) Limited Storytelling: The unconventional storytelling may not be for everyone. Some players might prefer a more traditional narrative approach with cutscenes and characters. But in my opinion, that's just okay enough for now, since we got some NPC's too, so that we won't feel lonely anymore.

In conclusion, ""Generation Zero"" is a captivating and visually stunning game that offers a unique take on the open-world shooter genre. It excels when played with friends, but solo players may find it more challenging. If you enjoy exploring eerie landscapes, uncovering mysteries, and facing off against relentless enemies, this game is worth your time. Just be prepared for a few bumps along the way, both in terms of difficulty and technical issues.

6/10, at best. It's fun for swedish people, they can go like ""oh look the old SAAB and Volvo, I remember my grandpa owning one"" or ""Oh look postal office before postnord, how nostalgic!"" and its all fine and good...

BUT, here's the bread and butter of it: it's  janky.
This game, is so janky, but it's this-- unfun kind of jank.

The enemies, I get it they are machines, but, thanks to the stupid, idiotic weapon grading system that had to be included in every game in it's time (Ghost Recon Bullpoop sequel thingy that got the internet angry) and so unless you are hitting the enemy with the right grade and in their specific weak spots it takes forever to kill anything. And even if you are hitting one of the bigger machines in their weakspots, with the lowest grade weapons it takes several minutes to kill it. 

SO most of your time you spend on going to every possible building and exploring every stone and bug living uinder it and the bug's poop hole to find anything worthwhile. And then your inventory isn't that huge either, so you can't really go around lumbering all willy nilly... BUT then your storage box is also not infinite, not reallly. 
What is cool though, is that higher grade weapon is not rusty and is nicer colored and attachements are less destroyed and in general just better, so at least you can see and feel the difference between low grade and high grade attachments and weapons. 

So far, in my play time, I got a total of 2 vehicles: a bike and a motrocycle. The bike can go about 30km/h on a road and motor about 50km/h. They are absolutely useless offroad. So far there has been no other choice of vehicle in this enitre game DESPITE the world being filled with perfectly functional fake Volvos and fake Saabs. A lot of them look in great condition to drive. Imagine how fun it would be driving with your mates around and shooting pesky robots.... yeah, that's what you can do, Imagine. 
On top of that, bike and motorbike, are so janky... you can get stuck on a slightly exposed stone and then you get catapulted into space. And if you dare to just slightly take your wheel off the road, goodbye speed. 
It's ridiculous because if you upgrade your running you're only slightly slower than a bike, so often i just find myself NOT using the vehicles, becuase it's just --- slower.

Stealth detection is --- like a special kid in class. Sometimes it doesn't work and everyone sighs with relief, other times it detects you from another continent and screeches like crazy. 
Honestly, I get the insane detection, they are robots, they have lenses with crazy tech.... IF it was consistent. Because it's not. Sometimes, I can just run up to a robot and stand there in front of him--- and he doesn't see me. So i just--- assault it and no other robot around me notices it. Stealth here, is honestly stupid. They are robots, we have thermal sights on scopes so why don't the robots? Our silly little attempts at getting prone and going through bushes shouldn't work... but it does. At max stealth without any equipment upgrades, I just laid in the middle of all the biggest robots-- and sure I had to be still otherwise they were detecting me, but I was still just lying there and none saw me.... THen another time i just sprinted at them and --- no one noticed me. That's why this stealth mechanic is so jank, it's completely inconsitent.

Base defense.... I don't know what to say. If you're playing solo, it's just not worth it picking the hardest difficulties, because your defense options are so limited you're just wasting your time playing them on hard. If you have mates, maybe, sure, but otherwise no. I thought concrete walls would have more HP or something, but --- I can't see the numbers and it seems they all go down at the same rate. It's also super buggy. Sometimes I see robots just running at the wall, standing there loooking at it and doing nothing--- other timnes a robot just insta-kills my fully repaired wall and enters the compound---- then either stares at the van or shoots it. Most of the time they just stare at it, so I had nice picnics with my robot frenemies. 

Another thing I have a gripe with, is --- the locations. Once you visit a few houses and barns, you've basically seen all the houses and barnses. It's cool to see the ye' olde' swedish housies, but that's it. They usually have a few packs, bags.... Unless a location is marked on the map with ""weapons"" and collectibles, like ... 0/2 weapons... and so you loot a container with a weapon thinking ""ah that's gonna increase it"" but no. It was just your luck random loot, the actual weapons you have to loot are in some other house you have to look through, so you spend like 30 minutes in one location going through every possible house, shed, barn, car  you can to find it.
The biggest crime however, are the bunkers. Cool, yes, they're huge. But why are they so huge. There's nothing in them. Cool, you can see the bunker's sleeping quarters, okay, but there's just like 1 bag therte and I just spent 15 minutes to get there. Oh nice, a kitchen, again nothing in it. And you don't have a local map like in Skyrim or Fallout so you can quickly reference where you are in the location, so going through a bunker you have to look at the signs to get anywhere. It's nice and ok, but if you are or are playing with less smart people, it's bad because you have to go back and get them if they get lost, or if you get lost.

The people in the story, are mildly annoying, though this is a personal opinion. They really made me not care about  the story at all. I'm just here to kill these spongy robots that take several carl gustav rockets to the weakpoints.



I get it, weapons shouldn't be OP, but at times it feels like I'm shooting nerf darts at my big brother who then comes and beats the living hell out of me, while I furiously keep chomping my chocolate bars to heal my wounds, while getting mauled. 

Now don't get me wrong, the game looks great, but that shouldn't be the saving grace of games. ""Oh look, i just pooped a massive turd and polished it to perfection, it looks like it has ray tracing!""
Okay, cool, but -- you've just been polishing a turd, that doesn't make the turd any better. 
I'm not saying this game is it, it's just an analogy. The game is playable, though buggy and mildly frustrating at times, but it's immedietly more fun with a few friends (it seems to be a pattern in these sort of games, have you noticed perhaps?)



SO IN SHORT:
If you have friends to play with it, get it, stealth your way by sprinting into robots and mauling them to death when stealth decides to take a Fika break
If you're solo, you might have a bad time from time to time, but otherwise it's playable and you might enjoy it.

To preface - I played this by myself (basically singleplayer). I was initially really hooked on the game for about the first hour. The enemy design is very well done, They look menacing and have a decent variety of attacks.  Also kudos to the sound designer on them as I think they sound perfect. The environments are interesting and fairly well done (albeit a lot of copy-pasting), and the graphics themselves are serviceable, though a little dated. The characters are very typical and not very believable, though I didn't care too much about following a story in this game. My issue though is not with any of the above.

The largest problems and the first I noticed was with the AI. It's....pretty dumb and at other times clairvoyant. I can easily lead them into traps and pick them off without breaking a sweat when inside the building. The larger ones frequently got caught/stuck in spots for no apparent reason either. The were multiple times where I was easily in their FOV and they somehow did not spot me until I started firing on them. On the flip side if they spot me and I duck behind a structure and move to another part of it, they somehow still manage to always shoot at exactly where I am. They also could easily spot me through hedges (even though I couldn't see through them at all)....and other times I would shoot a flare into the air and they wouldn't react. Just really poor AI all around.

The other issues are more minor, but still take away from the immersion. I would frequently put down lures or explosive containers and have them fall down into the ground or rocks with just the tops sticking out. Some houses have massive doors that when you open them they practically touch the opposite wall and you cannot pass by them without closing them again. You find items on robots that make no sense of why they would be there, like medkits on robots - there is absolutely no reason a robot would have a medkit on it. You see all those bicycles laying around on the ground or up against a fence? Sorry, you can't use them since it wasn't spawned by one of the vehicle stations. Oh, you can also overburden (too much weight) yourself drastically but the only drawback is you can't sprint. You can still hop on a bike though and pedal at 25mph.

This game has a ton of potential. However, the AI needs A LOT of serious work before I'll even glance at this again. It sucks because I just got into the real crafting part of the game which looks interesting but when I know I can steamroll the enemies by playing smart it just isn't fun for me. Once the AI is fixed then look into other quality of life fixes above by implementing changes so things play a little more logically.",1695609771,1695609771,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Generation Zero"", developed and published by Avalanche Studios, offers an ambitious open-world experience set in an alternate 1980s Sweden overrun by mysterious and hostile machines. Released in 2019, this game brings together elements of survival, first-person shooting, exploration, and narrative-driven game-play to create a unique and immersive adventure. 

""Generation Zero"" presents a captivating blend of exploration, strategy, and combat. Players are tasked with surviving a world invaded by robotic foes, scavenging for supplies, and gradually uncovering the truth behind the machine invasion. The game encourages a methodical approach, emphasizing stealth and tactical engagement over mindless shooting.

The mechanics for fighting machines are well-crafted. Different enemy types demand distinct strategies, making encounters a delightful challenge. Yet, the game's difficulty can be punishing, sometimes frustratingly so, especially when faced with relentless adversaries in co-op play.

The game's open-world design is one of its standout features. The sprawling Swedish countryside is beautifully rendered, with lush forests, picturesque lakes, and quaint villages. The attention to detail is remarkable, making exploration a pleasure. Environmental storytelling is another strong suit; abandoned houses, vehicles, and notes scattered throughout the world provide glimpses into the lives of those who once called this place home.

However, it's not all roses. The world can feel empty at times, and the lack of NPC human characters can make the landscape seem lifeless. This isolation contributes to the game's eerie atmosphere, but some players may find it a bit too desolate.

The game's premise is intriguing: piecing together the mystery of the machine invasion and the fate of the human population. However, the story's execution falls short of its potential. The narrative is primarily delivered through collectible notes and audio logs, which often feel disconnected and insufficient to immerse players fully. The lack of a strong central story-line or memorable characters makes it difficult to invest deeply in Generation Zero's world.

However, ""Generation Zero"" shines in the visual department. The game's depiction of 1980s Sweden is wonderfully nostalgic, with detailed landscapes and accurate recreations of the era's technology. Lighting and weather effects are particularly impressive, adding depth to the game's atmosphere. However, occasional graphical glitches and performance issues can detract from the experience.

The audio design also contributes significantly to the game's ambiance. The haunting, synth-heavy soundtrack sets the tone perfectly, and the eerie sounds of approaching machines send shivers down your spine.

""Generation Zero"" allows for cooperative play, which can be both a boon and a bane. Playing with friends can make the game more enjoyable, as coordination and strategy become easier. However, the scaling of difficulty can be inconsistent, making solo play a more balanced experience in some cases.

All in all, ""Generation Zero"" is quite an ambitious and visually captivating game that falls short in some crucial areas. Its richly detailed world and challenging machine encounters offer an engaging experience, but its narrative and lack of NPC interactions leave something to be desired. Despite its flaws, it's a unique and atmospheric title that can provide hours of entertainment, especially for those who appreciate a slower-paced, tactical approach to first-person shooters. If Avalanche Studios addresses some of its narrative and game-play issues in future updates or sequels, ""Generation Zero"" could truly shine as a hidden gem in the gaming world.",1695581073,1695597135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, it is not a finished game. I feel quite frankly scammed that this game was sold to me as having been released 4 years ago and not as an early access game.

It's a classic for games these days. Have a bunch of great ideas, make a great map, get the mechanics to the point where they are barely playable, and put it on sale, then stop trying and reap in the profits.

I think the cars are a perfect axample of this. As a Swede myself I got a kick out of encountering the iconic Volvo 245, or Ville as it's called for legal reasons. It's fun, and I even got the joke about every car in Sweden being one of those old boxes. But it got old fast. The various cars are creatively placed. Some even tell a good story of how the driver died running over robots or hitting a tree or whatever, I like this. But that's kinda where it all stops. All the ""Volvos"" have the same number plate... like... wtf. You couldn't even just put a randum number generator on them? It's pretty immersion breaking. So is opening the hood and seeing a V8 engine... in a car that's famous for having an inline redblock 4. Which you can loot for a tiny ammount of accelerant, or fuel, as if every car in the game ran out of fuel just before you found them, which doesn't make sense as many of them have their blinkers and lights on. Yes, I know there's the Björk Saab clone too, but same story there.

I was thrilled to discover that bicycles were in the game. Presumably because the developers asked a Swedish friend that they were thinking of adding vehicles into the game set on a small Swedish island and wanted to know what people actually drove, then got the reply: ""Bicycles.""
This seems accurate, because the bikes sure doesn't feel like they were programmed by someone who has ridden one. And biking around for 5 minutes just throws in your face that the island is littered with cars that you can't drive. Cars that have their ignition on, with the driver dead in the seat. Cars that you should be able to just take and drive... the key is in the ignition, they are clearly in running order and you have gathered plenty of fuel from all the other cars... but no, devs didn't want to let you do that, they just wants to tease you.

That theme just goes through the game. I was positively surprised to find that you could harvest small trees for wood, but that faded quickly when I realized just how stupid and poorly implemented this was. You have absolutely no tools, yet your character can still rip a sapling taller than themselves off the ground and stuff it in their hammerspace in less than 2 seconds. Okay, fair enough, but why can't you ever pick up any of the millions of fallen branches that litter much of the island, there's even a shed every 500 meters filled with pre cut fire wood, and a logging field with several tons of lumber and lots of fallen branches. Hell, the sheds themselves, especially the derelict ones are made out of perfectly salvagable planks.
But no, none of these excellent and logical sources of woods are available, they're just there to annoy you while you run around desperately looking for small trees to rip out of the ground.

There's also no way to save your progress. I mean there kinda is, somewhere in the background, but the game does not tell you about this, nor how it works, what you can do to trigger those saves, or allow you to in any way save manually. It's just: ""Fuck you, retrace the last 2 hours of gameplay and figure it out yourself."" When it could have so easily just had a text bubble on the menu that read: ""The game progress is saved automatically when you reach a safehouse."" Or something like that.

it's still a really shitty system given how often your character gets stuck in doorways and you have to reload the game, but at least I wouldn't have search the reddit thread for shit that's bafflingly not in the otherwise quite impressive tutorial.

It is so clear that the developers reached a point where they felt: ""Yeah, it's playable."" and then washed their hands off the game.

I enjoy it for the novelty, fun gunplay, and chilled countryside exploration but definitely they need to improve the map and compass, it's hard to get a clear view of the way to the next mission objective without using your own pins. They should also double down on the funky 80s player looks and style, and update the player models to be more detailed, along with a 3rd person view perhaps. The artstyle for the scenery and enemies is very realistic but the character models look too cartoonish and low-poly, like they belong in a different game.

The looting doesn't feel boring and there is enough interesting stuff to make you keep wanting more.

For full cost, maybe, maybe not, I'm only 5 hours (2 play sessions) in. There are some issues with the UI's Design, and some jankiness with gameplay, and mouse sensitivity settings infuriating. Its a % slider, one setting is too low, the next one up is too high. The looting in the game is also instanced, so everyone has to go touch every box to get everything so you end up feeling like you're missing out if you dont go touch everything, as opposed to spreading out to loot, and bringing it all together to share and distribute. However, if an item isnt bespoke, like a weapon in the world itself, a collectible, or the more valuable long  military weapon loot chest, i implore you to don't mind. Grab what you can, but dont be too anal lest you slow down the flow/pacing of your session with your buddies. And for the love of god, dont crouch under things unless you absolutely must / its intended for you to crawl / crouch under. You will get stuck and the only solution is to fast travel (Deploying a field station creates a fast travel point, or you can go back to your hideouts.).

However, if you have 3 other buddies you vibe with, its a decent experience. The art is amazing. The theme is pretty solid, the cosmetics you can customize your character with are pretty dope. The gunplay feels good, nice visuals and recoil control. Nice sparks as feedback for hits and crits. The story, tbh i havent been paying the most attention to it, the Swedish vocals with English subs is the way to go. Im only 5 hours in though, so i cant speak too much on it. The enemy designs are nice and varied between the archetypes, and have variants among themselves too. The overall vibe of the game is pretty strong. Like what if dayz had good pve and good graphics, the game.

I'd give it a solid 6.8. For 5 bucks you cant go wrong.",1694501828,1694501828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is stellar, but beyond that this game has the potential to be a lot better. Not to say it's buggy or not fun, but it's missing some features that it could really benefit from. It has a stealth system, but you can be seen through closed doors. It has decent exploration, but it misses a lot of what could make you more immersed in the world. You can't break down doors loudly if they're locked, you MUST use a lock-pick. you can't swim through water unless it's waist high. Ladders don't exist (kind of). the movement is familiar, but clunky. Gathering wood is done via picking up small saplings, you can't cut down trees in a game that's saturated with forests. The crafting system lets you build components, but you can't upgrade equipment. etc.

In general i find myself thinking of how this game could benefit a lot more from working more like an immersive sim for the player, it has a lot of the environments in place and a lot of the tools needed to be as such, but the devs haven't taken that step.

I've rambled quite a bit in this review, but don't feel like taking the time to properly organize it. TLDR: boring gameplay, tedious looting, unimaginative crafting, empty open world.

It's a big and empty open world. Same buildings copy pasted over and over. Looting takes forever and gets repetitive fast - it just consists of going room to room looking for ammo boxes, backpacks, and the occasional weapon lying around. Oh, and every door, hood, and trunk of every car/truck. Everything else can be ignored. Bored of scavenging? Have fun running out of resources. I'm also going to add how dumb scavenging for wood is. You literally come across house after house with stacks and stacks of firewood logs, and you're telling me I need to go around looking for saplings to get wood?

Leveling up doesn't feel rewarding. You don't really unlock new game-play mechanics that change anything in anyway interesting. It's just, ""less recoil"", ""quicker aim time"", ""more damage"", ""more damage resistance"", ""more carrying capacity"", ""more scavenged ammo., ""run faster and longer."" The leveling system also feels very constrictive/punitive - why do I have to choose between improving combat and quality of life upgrades? You might be able to get a nice balance between the two once you're fully leveled up, but until then, dealing with limited carrying capacity, low mobility etc. is just an absolute pain.

Crafting sucks. I personally found the UI for inventory and crafting clunky. Why are there different workbenches for recycling, crafting, and storage? Why is your base inventory split between the recycling bench (crafting materials) and storage (weapons, ammo, consumables etc)? Why do they need to be upgraded? These upgrades aren't meaningful, they just feel like an additional grind that was thrown in so that you have to spend more time in game.

Back to crafting....just like everything else before, it's unimaginative and boring. You have different categories, such as apparel (defensive bonuses on clothes), equipment/consumables, ammo. Each category has its own unimaginative tech tree, and you get points specific to each tree by crafting in that category. Once again, it just feels like it was put in to add grind to the game. Why do I have to craft ___ bullets to unlock shotgun shells, then rockets? Apparel upgrades points are obtained by defeating ""rivals"" / ""bosses"" to are spawned in from time to time. Yet another grind - and why on earth do you need to defeat repetitively generated bosses to get better apparel? As you progress, you'll just unlock higher resistance bonuses and different resistance types.

I'm a solo player, and guerrilla difficulty felt like a wreck. It's either a cakewalk where you easily ambush and massacre a few robots, or a dozen machines start popping out of every single bush and start gunning you down. Solution to the second scenario: hide in a building, destroy the robots one at a time (the robots don't follow you in). That's literally all you can do as a solo player. I also have to bring up how ******* annoying it is when the robots are shooting  you through foliage. They'll have pinpoint accuracy while you absolutely struggle to find where they are unless you have the X-ray vision module. BTW, the night vision and IR vision modules are absolutely useless.

Bosses aren't really interesting...if they shoot rockets, you run. If they shoot gun, you duck behind cover. If they run at you (stomp, stab, shockwave), you run away. As a solo player, they absolutely suck. Bosses are meant to be fought where one player gets a flanking position and can shoot at weakpoints / components. You can't do that as a solo player without absolutely spamming EMP devices, or flares (distraction), or fireworks (stops enemy from targeting anything). The aforementioned devices last such a short period of time, you can't really do much before they run out. The best option to fight bosses as a solo player really is to just stun them, run up to them, drop a bunch of explosive tanks, run away, shoot a tank and repeat. While I never played coop, it appears to me that the level of cooperation you'd need is just one player getting shot at while other players flank and shoot components/weak spots on the back of robots. Not exactly creative or interesting.

Story is meh. The writing isn't all that great and the dialogue (which is rather sparse) often feels forced in order to further the story. I really didn't care for any of the characters.",1694334324,1694334476,False,7,0,0.563942015171051025,0,True,False,False

I have had so much fun with this game and continue to come back to it since its an open world map and feel like shooting things at times for the heck of it. At first I was terrified when entering the game when I first got into it and it still gives that same vibe time to time especially when you load in a REAPER, those things will mess you right up but you need an area on the map to be level 21 and wait for a rival to turn into one. I love the weapons, the progression and now the companion that you can bring along, just make sure you have lots of repair kits for that companion if you decide to bring them with. With rivals and killing them for 6 star weapons was also awesome to find out about too, the weapons really are powerful once you have them.

The enemy designs / anatomy, combat, and attention to detail in the world are all done very well.  It shows a lot of care went into it.  Even after 50 hours, I'm still not finding repetition from exploring the countryside, but I think that's due to the world design.  

There's plenty of common / repeated things to see and find, but with unique terrain, POI locations, and scripted events; it adds just enough flair to combat encounters that you're often forced to adapt to a situation and need to think on your toes.  Helps so you don't coast thru everything.

The multiplayer system works to jump in and just play together no problem but beating MISSIONS together is really touchy.

Really like the scavenging aspect of the game.  I think this game would benefit from some more survival aspects being added in as well maybe a food mechanic that forces you to deal with the machines to gather food now and then.  

Music and sound effects are also good.  The story could be a bit more fleshed out but overall I really dont have too much to complain about for the base game.

However I do think instead of small DLC packs being sold and released frequently, there should be more focus on adding some new areas / islands and story to the game.  

Also probably my biggest complaint besides adding more land or story to the game is that skill points max out very early on and you no longer acquire pretty early on even though you continue to level up.  Another major complaint I have is that if you slide a bit after getting knocked down its almost an instant kill on you.  The game treats it like your falling down a cliff even if your in a field and you slide.  This is what primarily causes me to burn through my adrenaline shots which is very annoying.

A feature I would also implement would be to be able to have a Sony Walkman or something where you can play your own music in the game rather than the ambient world music.  I would love to be able to listen to those mix tapes that you find scattered about.  I do like the world music but sometimes I want a change of pace even if that does cause me to wander into the machines a bit more.

Combat:   Combat overall is decent.   It has some major downsides however.   Reloading and switching weapons takes a very long time compared to most FPS.  You will be spending a lot of time in cover, switching to heals/other guns and reloading.  I mean a LOT of time.  

Balance:  This game is not balanced very well for solo experiences.   It turns out, the more enemies you kill in an area, the more the area levels up.   Higher level areas spawn more enemies and supposedly give better loot.   This means that even on the easiest difficulty, things quickly level up and get out of control.   With Harvesters being able to call in reinforcements, you can end up with a never ending stream of enemies that are difficult to push through.  

You will also spend several minutes unloading clip after clip into the larger enemies.  They supposedly have weak spots, but it doesn't matter because enemies take a clip minimum to destroy excepting the small ""tick"" enemies.  The larger Tank and Harvester enemies will take around 2000 rounds of ammo to take down, or several (10 or so) rockets.   Ammo has weight in this game, and you're limited on how much you can carry.   Also don't count on scavenging ammo, as there are several types of ammo like 9mm and each gun uses its specific ammo.

Supposedly you can employ advanced strategies to take these enemies down as there are several utility weapons.   Critically however, you are limited to 8 weapon/utility/item slots.   At least one will be reserved for healing.  You'll probably want at least 3-4 for weapons due to ammo reserves.  This leaves only 2-3 slots for ""utility"" type items.  Utility items themselves come in several flavors which further divides up their usefulness.   EMPs are also very short lived, it might buy you time to reload one weapon.   

All this adds up to battles mostly being peeking out of cover and unloading clip after clip at the enemy.   The battles become lengthy and repetitive.  

Missions:  After the tutorial missions, the map opens up.   Beyond the tutorial missions there is no storyline effectively.  What you instead have is a bunch of side quests effectively scattered around the map.   The only reason to do the missions is to gain XP.",1693876609,1693876609,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Every new discovery progresses the story in some way and some missions take place in similar locations so you don't have to travel too far and can progress a couple at a time.

I personally focused on story

The setting is amazing, the visuals are stunning and you can tell they cared about making the map as believable as they could.
At the start, the gameplay is engaging and shrouded in mystery of what the hell just happened.
You encounter enemies, stories, empty houses, some npc's, yadda yadda.
The best part of the game is the starting area as you feel the acute sense of danger and mystery while slowly making your way to the main island.
After that the game starts to unveil itself in a negative sense.

The story becomes barren and somewhat predictable, with little of the plot being told via the missions.
The majority of the story and the details of it are hidden mostly in collectibles that take you a long time before collecting them all.
Some of the DLC's inject more story into the game as one explains more of how your enemy actually works and the other gives you a new class of enemy with an additional boss-type, but that's about it.
Other DLC's just add guns and bikes that you can immediately start using because they spawn in your storage container that syncs between safe-houses.
Another adds a neat companion of which you constantly have to renew the armor when getting into battle.

The change in difficulty is also sad as you go from experimental units that don't take much to the supposed super-elite class units who take longer to kill. As it ramps up, the game just keeps spawning in more enemies, sometimes out of thin air, sometimes by air drop which makes little to no sense as it isn't elaborated on how the hell this actually works.

Your character knows how to handle a plethora of guns at age 18 to 21-ish and while explained in the intro, feels largely unrealistic.
You can drive on bikes, yet you don't know how to operate any car.

The timeline of the events also feels entirely unrealistic, especially considering the following spoiler:
[spoiler] Somehow the main character missed out on a nuclear explosion blowing up a huge bunker in the middle of the farmlands. You only learn that this explosion was caused by the russians ordering a strike on it. This really stretches out the starting cinematic explanation of you being on a boat-trip with your friends, as this is the only reason given why you don't know anything that is going on.
You also always seem to be at the scene of the crime a little too late and only find dead bodies, except for the starting island and two of the DLC's injecting NPC's into the world[/spoiler]

After about 30 hours it becomes a grind with little to no story left, only completing objectives the game has set for you for some ""prestige"" points.

The game feels more like wasted potential than anything else. Four, going on five years and this is the end result? A bunch of systems mishmashed together with no rhyme or reason? The perk system is atrocious and most perks are straight up worthless, the ""basebuilding"" is pointless, the difficulty peaks at early-midgame and SEVERELY drops into the abyssal zone when you get high-end weapons, and the story is nothing special.

At least the game looks pretty...

Played on the highest difficulty setting. Difficulty balance is all over the place. The game starts off pretty easy with nothing but basic enemies before spiking right into the deep end with little ramp up. Knowing enemy weakspots is critical to the game balance, but unlike in any half-decent shooter, most robot components aren't telegraphed or advertised. It was about 25 hours in when I looked up how to best take down a Hunter and the SHOULDERS of all things are easy weakpoints, not the obvious but ridiculously armored head. When it comes to sightreading a bot for weakpoints, it honestly just comes down to reading a guide somewhere and going off that. Don't even get me started on the way blueprints for machines work -- You have to find unique blueprints for each class and each type of enemy to view their components highlighted in the field. These blueprints are scattered to the corners of the earth and even 40 hours in it's ridiculous that I've only found like three.

The game doesn't tell you what the different ammo types do or how they work against different components. After about 15 or so hours you might finally notice that when you do weakspot damage, blue sparks come out instead of orange sparks. Some more tutorialization and easy to access info there would've been nice earlier.

Apocalypse-class enemies are supposed to be the most difficult encounters but can spawn with ineffective weapons like clustermine launchers that are extremely easy to dodge, potentially making them MUCH easier to take down than a lower tier enemy with how often they're locked into a worthless attack. 

On the final balancing note, it starts feeling okay for a bit during ""midgame"" -- level 16 to 25 -- but combat encounters largely play out the same all across the world. You'll have a similar experience from hour 10 to hour 30, which speaks more to the lack of enemy variety than anything else. But once you hit level 25, you can now potentially gain access to ""experimental"" weapons, and if you luck out on an experimental .50bmg rifle, the game is basically over. This single weapon can obliterate weakpoints in mere shots because of its extreme penetration capabilities, and you'll get so much ammo dropped for it you can use it as a primary weapon. There is no other weapon in the game so stupidly overpowered as this thing. It's fun for a bit but- I want to say I got this at around 35-ish hours into the game and it hasn't really been compelling enough to pick back up.

The story is nothing interesting at all and the game world is littered with dumb timewasting notes talking about, idk, shipping manifests or something equally stupid and not worth reading. It's mostly just generic whining about how the robot apocalypse sucks. We GET IT.

The ""basebuilding"" is woefully underdone and needlessly obnoxious to engage with such that it shouldn't even be in the game at all. It has no effect on anything if you just ignore it like I did.

I'm glad I got this for ten bucks because it's not worth much more than that.",1693618370,1693618370,False,2,0,0.506441593170166016,0,True,False,False

Stealth, only shows a few times then practically non existent as its hard to preform stealth kills. Crouching and laying down does help with being hidden.
Enemies, a good amount of variety. Most however can be beaten by a 50. cal sniper or long distance. Not much variety. 
Pausing, where is it? The game goes on even when ""paused."" I have died once to this. most dlcs are nice upgrades but most give minor to major improvements to basic game play.
AI, sometimes its good, most time no. Robo doggos will run around then do a melee attack and do nothing for 3-5 seconds. Same goes for hunters, really cool bots of death. But they run around, deploy tics, shoot and maybe run and melee the floor. 
Controller, can be done but needs some tweaks to be viable. With how unpredictable the machines are, it may be hard just to kill a single bot without either missing and losing a bunch of ammo (which can be crafted which is nice) or dieing.
overall in my personal opinion fun game but some things need to be slightly changed.

In the beginning, it felt so hard going from one place to another as i was constantly getting attacked by hordes of robots. But the game became much easier as i kept levelling up and unlocked a few perks (mainly the hacker line perks).
What made me keep playing was how beautifully the story was narrated via missions. I was curious to know how they started attacking in the first place.

Although the average time to complete the game (as i searched on google) is around 19 hrs, it took me 35 hrs to complete the main storyline as i was playing on guerilla difficulty. You dont have to play on the hardest difficulty btw because there is no steam achievement for it.

1.) Game is really enjoyable, even when playing solo. Of course that is dependent on what you want to play the game like. If you generally like playing multiplayer, its better to get the game with your friends. Either wise you may not enjoy it. If you enjoy managing inventory, grinding out better equipment, and building up an arsenal with a noticeable growth in how dangerous you become, this game does it very well.
 
2.) At the start you are a scared lil' baby survivor, for the most part choosing your battles is very important. After a certain point however, you become the hunter. Being able to take on even greater challenges. This is that noticeable growth of your character, you slowly get more dangerous as time goes on. Not only by your skills, but also the drops and improved weaponry you can pick up as you go. The game definitely has a greater risk = greater reward loot arc. 

3.) Acoustics are absolutely FAN FUCKING TASTIC. I've never heard a game more realistically represent audio before. There are also dynamic distant weather systems in the game that are realistic. The clouds aren't just sky box, they're real! As clouds move, they can block out the sun over you, you can see storms in the distance and hear the thunder before the storm reaches you, you can get rain shower weather that comes and goes rapidly, like in real life! 

4.) Combat can be very interesting, especially depending on your difficulty you select. Sometimes, choosing not to fight is best, especially early on. You also must consider your weapon attachments. Should I use a suppressor? Or should I use a muzzle compensator and go loud? Maybe you want to set an ambush? Lure enemies close to the cars to blow them up and double/triple down on explosive damage? Or set up EMP traps to disable them and open them up to vulnerable devastation with a downpour of rockets and bullets. Enemies also come with a set of their own combat gimmicks, sniper shoulder mounts that can track and shoot you right through cover, or flamethrowers that REALLY fuckin' hurt if they get too close. What about a mortar mount that lets them shoot over small covers, forcing you to move, or even a gas canister mortar to flush you out of buildings and cover! And the weaponry they use is distinctive so you can tell what the hostiles are rocking and plan accordingly!

Now the Cons.
1.) Despite my glowing like of the game however, it does have a plethora of bugs and issues. From what I hear, multiplayer is incredibly buggy most of the time. The game has generally received updates/DLC's to add more content to the game which slowly dilapidated the stability of the game most particularly in multiplayer. Even when playing solo there are some noticeable annoying bugs that occur. This game for example, has some of the best damn acoustics and noise effects I've ever had the pleasure to hear in a video game. However, there is an audio bug that occurs from time to time causing certain noises to just stop playing all together. to fix it I just have to stand totally still until the game ""catches up"" with the sounds and remembers ""oh right, sound, I forgor.""

2.) As for the multiplayer bugs, crashing galore, and most egregiously, server side desync to the host. (Host sees things correctly whereas teammates see incorrect things or vice versa, such as say that turret the host destroyed, your teammates still see it and still get shot to shit by it, but the host no longer sees it and cannot assist with killing it as to them, it just doesn't exist anymore, the opposite can be true too, your teammates no longer see something while the host still sees it.) 

3.) It also has trouble with User Interface Experience, lots of small quality of life functions that should be easy enough to implement just aren't here, such as a favorite system to prevent you from scrapping things you don't wish to on accident. A junk marking system to scrap everything with a button press of a button at the recycling station, as right now you just have to select what you want to scrap yourself. 
The way inventory is listed is large blocky rectangular displays that you have to scroll through everything to manage. Why not make it a grid instead and when you hover over them it displays a small rectangle of what you're hovering over and the count of that item you have? Also why can't we click something to transfer, then click another button to TYPE OUT a number of the item want rather than being constricted to the sliders to figure out how much we want to transfer in/out of inventories or storage? 
 
4.) And the skill tree needs a rework, and they plan to according to the road map. 
I hope they remove the ""total requisite"" issue I find the game. Why do I have to spend 2 skill points on stamina regeneration and extra health to get stealth skills? They should separate skills into ""sub trees"" that can be allocated into right from the get-go, so let me just get ""Less visibility"" right away, and for the sub trees, make certain specializations require X amount of points in this sub tree to unlock their desired specialization. 
Also, why does the Marksman specialization completely neuter the importance of the ""Weapon Sway"" skill? They should change it, example, call it ""Tunnel Vision"" and make the effect ""Semi-auto weaponry deals 1% extra damage per shot landed on the target up to 15% bonus damage, missing a shot or hitting another target resets the damage buff to 0."" Or something like that. 
ALSO ALSO, INCREASE THE DAMN SKILL CAP, I want at least 51 points to use! 1 point for specialization purchase, 50 for the rest! There are 109 total skill points for purchase in the game! The skill tree and skill point cap in my opinion is the worst part of the game. Many players don't know this off the top of their head, but there IS A SKILL CAP. You ONLY get 30 skill points to spend on skills! Let us at least buy half the skill tree, most abilities are inconsequential, but would be nice little buffs for those who dedicate the time! So as of right now, level 31 is the end of skill purchases. 

(You CAN respec skills using 5 Uranium, you get 5 Uranium for every 5 levels, and you also earn Uranium for doing base defense/base assault missions as well.) 


And now, the part that is unacceptable on account of the Development team:
Biggest negative of all, despite the updates, they aren't doing very many bug fixes at all despite the absolute PLETHORA of bugs in the game. This shouldn't be acceptable. They need to fix the game before they make more changes to it. The road map does show they plan to add more content to the game and change other aspects of the gameplay, but you should really first focus on stability and fix the bugs in the game. The Desync issues for Multiplayer are just really bad, to fix them people generally have to leave the match and just come back for things to refresh properly. We should not have to do this, it wastes time and pulls you out of the game having to do this so often. Not only that, it damages player retention. If people keep backing out to the menu, eventually that ""quit to desktop"" prompt is going to become tempting, and they will go play something else. And that damages player retention, which you DO NOT WANT. 

Synopsis; 
I generally can still recommend this game, but its a close shave. The game really should start focus on bug squashing before adding more content, then when they introduce content, focus on the bug squashing again, then get back to adding more content.",1693255915,1693255915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+combat is fun, engaging, and comfortable to to learn

+fast loading times. you can go from steam library to shooting robots in under a minute with a half-decent cpu

+easy to pick up as it often goes on sale. I recommend holiday sales as you can get the whole package for around 20-25 bucks

+very optimized and you can run ultra settings on an intermediate card

-CONS--
-unstable with some areas having weird frame loss and crashes more than would be preferable, but you rarely lose ANY progress (these are likely hardware caused though)

-DLCs are kinda meh, but theyre there to support the devs a little more. you arent missing out on much if you dont buy them

-Shift+W simulator so be prepared for your fingers to ache after several hours of gameplay

-AFTERNOTES-
Theres alot more I could add to the pros and cons but thats just nuance. Its a wonderful handcrafted experience by a small team of wonderful people. You may find yourself struggling to keep playing after 100 or so hours so be prepared for that.

This was possible because the gun play was very realistic and satisfying. Something that would make this even better would be if they added some form of PVP or at least allowed you to harm your teammates so you could fight among each other and add another layer to the fighting for survival aspect of the game. Maybe it could be a separate setting or difficulty.

However after you complete the first few main missions and get some okay gear, it just becomes an infinite, repetitive, looter-shooter game with an open world aspect. The open world will simply either be woods or towns, with scattered military complexes/outposts that are all the same and have nothing unique. The robots will all begin to be the most difficult, on par with a boss fight of an rpg, but after killing your first ten or fifteen of the same one, it becomes boring and disappointing that there will be no more bigger, cooler, stronger robots for you to kill.

Overall a very good game, I hope they come out with more updates which add more diverse content rather than just new vehicles which are just the vanilla one but with different stats, or different weapons which just make ammo scavenging more tedious.",1692997340,1692997340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm over 200 hours now. The devs are putting new stuff into the game continuously, however it's not the stuff you want. It's almost stuff that's to appease you but ever so slightly, there have been no story mission added for months, only little side quests which don't scratch the itch in the slightest.
The bits and pieces that the devs have added to the game I get the general feeling it's not what the bulk of players want and it's crashing the game quite often on multiplayer because they've just been thrown in. So there are constant patches and hot fixs available practically every week.

The cold, unforgiving terrain, the sense of isolation, and the ever-present danger lurking in the shadows. But unlike the magical threats of my world, here in Generation Zero, the danger is mechanical, relentless, and eerily silent.

The world of Generation Zero is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling. The Swedish Cold War era setting is both hauntingly beautiful and deeply unsettling. Every abandoned house, every rustling tree, every distant mechanical hum tells a story. A story of a world that was once alive but is now eerily silent, save for the deadly machines that now roam the land.

As Kiba Snowpaw, a seasoned gamer with over 36 years of experience, I've journeyed through countless worlds, faced innumerable challenges, and wielded powers beyond imagination. But Generation Zero offers a unique challenge. Here, stealth, strategy, and guerilla warfare are the keys to survival. Every encounter with the mechanical foes is a pulse-pounding game of cat and mouse, where strategy and timing are just as important as firepower.

The game's co-op feature is a delightful addition, allowing up to three friends to join the resistance. Together, we formed a pack, hunting the machines, scavenging for resources, and uncovering the mysteries of Östertörn. The sense of camaraderie, the shared moments of tension and triumph, added a layer of depth and immersion to the experience.

But what truly sets Generation Zero apart is its commitment to player agency and immersion. The game doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't guide you with a glowing path or a list of objectives. Instead, it drops you into its world and says, ""Survive."" And as you explore, as you piece together the story from scattered notes and tapes, as you adapt and evolve to face the ever-growing threat, you truly feel like a part of this world. You feel the weight of every decision, the thrill of every victory, and the sting of every defeat.

The game's crafting system is intuitive and rewarding, allowing players to salvage parts from fallen enemies to create weapons, ammunition, and equipment. This not only adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay but also reinforces the game's themes of resourcefulness and adaptability.

However, no game is without its flaws. Some players have raised concerns about the game's data collection policies, and while these concerns are valid, they should be weighed against the overall quality and experience of the game. Additionally, some aspects of the game, such as the repetitive building designs and the occasional bug, can be immersion-breaking. But these are minor quibbles in an otherwise stellar experience.

In conclusion, Generation Zero is a triumph of atmospheric storytelling, immersive gameplay, and player agency. It's a game that challenges you, rewards you, and stays with you long after you've turned off your computer. As Kiba Snowpaw, the Furry Ice Wolf from HowlStrom, I've journeyed through many worlds, but Generation Zero holds a special place in my heart. It's a game that speaks to the survivor in all of us, the primal instinct to adapt, to overcome, and to reclaim our home from those who would take it from us.

So, to my fellow gamers, to my fellow furries, and to all who seek a challenge, I say this: Join the resistance. Take back Östertörn. And show the machines that we will not go quietly into the night.

3 out of 5
The Good: this is a fun game that thankfully ""IS NOT ZOMBIES"" ( Zombies are over done. in my opinion.) anyway. Large map size is nice. the weapons are neat. the difficulty stays consistent. none of this you are a god crap. vehicles arent locked for most of the game. and playing as a squad is great.
The Bad:
here are bugs like the non server players being attacked and killed by phantom enemies while the server player looks at you as if you've gone mad. also wild sink issues where you and another play will accidentally trap each other in a corner, both claiming the other is in front of them. sometimes it looks like 7 days to die. some animations like getting on bikes is dissconnectingly bad. the skill trees need to be split up more so you arent learning a weapon you doing use before getting to a weapon you will. the kill the rival to get clothing skill points should be shared with everyone that tagged it not the 1 person who got the final kill.

On paper this game is fantastic, a guerrilla hybrid stealth game with giant robots? Fuck yeah!

But in practice, it is done horribly.

Let me walk you through an average play session, You'll spawn in at one of many safe house's, in which you'll look at where all your quests are and plan accordingly.

You go out into the overworld, immediately bombarded with 30 tanks and harvesters which spawn right in front of you, or, if you're playing the game now. A flying tank which you cannot run and hide from.

You either spend all your resources to kill these obstacles  , or you run away, choosing the latter is usually easier.

So you finally get to your mission with 3 bullets remaining from the trip, and its a fetch quest, always a fetch quest. The game doesn't even reward you with lore half the time, you're just doing a dead persons errands.

This goes on, and on, and on, until you get to the final fetch quest, and the game introduces the main antagonist in the final mission. Why?


To get you to buy the dlc.

The story is great, but you have to go through the swamps of Degobah to get even a drip feed of it. 

So what about the gameplay,
Apparently, it used to be fantastic, and you can feel this older gameplay in the beginner island, and especially the intro. The robots are scary, but few. You have to sneak through the foliage and be forced to not just charge in.

In the actual game however, gameplay is more like fighting a pack of 15 hunters after trying really hard to stealth, taking down most in 3 hits to the front, then getting killed because the game spawned more behind you. Are you catching a theme? This game really, REALLY. Does not want you to fight a small amount of enemies, which is where the game thrives.

Quickfire,

The weapons feel floaty
The balance is broken by bicycles
The balance is broken by all the weapon dlcs (which are just shoved in a crate)
You have to fight a miniboss as if it was a normal enemy just to get anywhere across the map
You go through periods of no ammo, and to much ammo, never in between. Never.
Devs are money hungry
NPC's that are in the intro never talk to you again 
Cant use traps because the pathfinding for robots aren't predictable 
Harvesters and Tanks dont drop anything usefull, neither do rivals 
You need wood to craft, you never get enough wood.
You will eat hundreds of medkits, but cloth is somehow the rarest resource in the game 
You can beat the entire game at level 18, even while stopping to do all the side quests.

Summary: Avalanche Studios attempts to make a 1986 Swedish version of Horizon Zero Dawn after Just Cause 4 fails to meet the legacy of Just Cause 2. Travel on foot in vast open areas battling re-spawning robots over and over again. Search for answers on the towns populous, who mysteriously vanished following your return from a probably European rave party. Find weapons, ammunition, and items in just about every house and vehicle to protect yourself during your adventures to seek the truth. I gave this game a thumbs up because I don't hate it, but I'm far from impressed. While this game plays like an early access title, I hope some future updates will fix concerns of the Steam community. I played for 5 hours, and will likely continue to play. 

Details: I was excited to play this game, but I checked the reviews before doing so. By noon (EST) on release day, the Steam community had already reviewed this game down to “mostly negative.” Strap on those velcro shoes, customize your pre-set Fortnite-esque emojis, and leave those swim trunks at home, son, you're about to embark on an all-exclusive cardio hike across a 10x15 km map. Luckily for you, the township has left you troves of weapons and supplies in their homes and vehicles to battle FAS prototypes created by the grandfather of Toreador Faro.

While traveling across the island, you'll encounter repetitive robot battles involving the same robot types with little variety. Ammunition, health packs, and adrenaline shots, which are used for revival after dying, are scarce at first. However, once you earn a few combat action ribbons, you'll learn how to conserve these items. If you, for whatever reason, need to back track, you will fight the same robots again, as they re-spawn.

Weapons:
Once you progress through the first few story missions, you'll find that your calf muscles are ripped from walking close to over 300 miles. As you discover new locations, you'll come across weapons in better conditions. The weapon pickups are certainly the same for everyone, including the locations you find them in. While you can't craft items or repair weapon conditions (yet?), they won't break. Each weapon has the ability for attachments, and like the weapons, are also found in certain conditions. I've only found dilapidated weapons and attachments, which appear to be the worst condition, and worn condition pickups. I believe the conditions affects the damage and accuracy of the weapons/attachments, but not sure.

Leveling Up:
After 5 hours of game play, I've just only reached level 3. I usually earn about 9 to 30 XP per robot kill; however, I've earned 400 XP by avoiding a fight. Huh? Because of this, I find leveling up to be very tedious. Each level gained will earn you one skill point, at least up to level 3. The skill tree is broken down by four tiers, which require pre-requisits as you move down each tier. 

Fast Travel:
I found a radio at a military FOB, which you can use to fast travel to. The catch is, you can only place it once, as I was not able to pick it back up. It appears on the map with an icon and option to travel. This could also be used for other players, as described, but I did not test that. During my brief adventure, I found a few satellite arrays, which I wasn't sure of their function. I figured they could be used later for fast travel purposes, but I am only speculating. 

Multiplayer:
I only attempted to play multiplayer once, which lasted a few seconds. I joined a random game and was loaded into a game with just one player located a good distance away from my location, which was, as to no surprise, the default spawn location at the start of the solo game. I appeared to have all of my gear from my game, but was unable, and unwilling, to travel to his location. I am unsure if the use of my items and ammunition would carry over to my single player game, so I did not want to waste any of it trying to catch up to him. I am unaware if your progression counts towards your single player game, although other reviews have conflicting facts on this subject.

Concerns:
- I found a shotgun in worn condition, and upon picking it up, it had turned into a hunting rifle, which I already had. 

- While at a soccer field hiding in a small building, robots were unable to see me over some small boxes. It appeared that the placement created some sort of invisible wall. This also effected my ability to shoot them, and I had to leave the building to engage.

- I wanted to test swimming, so I walked into the water and immediately fell strait to the bottom following a splash sound effect. The game turned to a loading screen and put me back on the shore. 

- While I can't prove it, I believe there was at least one enemy stuck in the wall of a bunker, as the threat icon and sounds clearly coming from a location where only a wall was. I was unable to find the robot.

- Day and night cycle appears to be selective. When starting out, it was night, then as I ventured out, it appeared to change. During one section of the game, it remained night for over an hour real time. I'm guessing the game script forces the time during that certain mission event to create the scene, but I'd choose consistency over developer preferences.

-The town appears as though humans had just left within the past 6 to 12 hours. Some locations had vehicles that were still left running. This reminded me of Tom Clancy's “The Division,” where vehicles were in streets with blinking hazard lights, but were likely abandoned months before. 

-I used an xbox one controller, and some buttons were not working right. It took me too long to switch from a primary to a pistol. I cycled through my two primaries at least 4 times before the double-tap button worked. Keyboard and mouse work fine though.",1553650087,1692232366,True,21,11,0.551144719123840332,0,True,False,False

The temporary way seems to be ok as you do not share extra information. But after that you have to accept the collection of data. And daaamn those are many, I read through the whole text and decided to deinstall and refund the game rightaway.
Why do they need my browser history and details, why all my hardware specs (which would be the only thing I am ok to share btw), why do they need to know my geo location and it goes on and on. Furthermore, they do not directly sell your data, but they share it with all partners, which is again a big list.
I know, some will say, if you have nothing to hide whats you problem. This is not the point, this is about why giving away data for free. I paid the game! If it is F2P I would understand it better.

Update on this review would be that the game is SOOOOOOOOOO much better today than at the time of my very inDept review above ;)
but yeah it's like night and day, back then you hade to figure out almost everything on your own and everything was waaaay harder. Luckily I had friends to play with at the time cause otherwise I don't know if I would have come back to the game today as the lonely non gaming shell of a non computerplaying person I am today...

The idea of the game is decent, the premise interesting, the visuals quite stunning, but the rest of the execution of the product is mediocre at best. Though it looks good on the surface, the core engine (especially the absolutely laughable physics simulation which seems to entirely throw the concept of friction and mass out of window and turn everything it touches into a astronomically high hook coefficient spring) feels like it was developed by a one-man indie operation.

Generation Zero had so much potential, but it ultimately falls flat on its face, leaving players frustrated and disappointed. I had high hopes for an immersive open-world experience set in a beautiful Swedish landscape, but what I got was a buggy mess that seemed to be more interested in wasting my time than providing any real enjoyment.

From the moment I booted up the game, I was greeted with an overwhelming number of technical issues. Glitches, crashes, and frame rate drops plagued my experience, making it difficult to even navigate the world without constant interruptions. It's as if the developers didn't bother with proper playtesting before releasing this disaster.

The gameplay mechanics are clunky and unrefined, turning what should be a fun and engaging combat system into a frustrating exercise in trial and error. The AI of the robotic enemies is laughably bad, often glitching out or getting stuck in terrain, completely ruining any sense of challenge or immersion. The repetitive nature of the missions and objectives quickly becomes monotonous, and the lack of variety in enemy types only exacerbates the problem.

The narrative is practically nonexistent, leaving players with no emotional investment in the story or the characters. The world feels lifeless and devoid of any meaningful interactions. Even the supposed co-op multiplayer feature is a mess, as it's difficult to find and connect with other players, and the lag and desync issues make the experience more infuriating than enjoyable.

The visuals might be the game's only redeeming quality, but even they can't make up for the laundry list of problems that plague Generation Zero. It's clear that the developers were more interested in creating a visually appealing game than in ensuring a smooth and enjoyable gameplay experience.

In conclusion, Generation Zero is a prime example of wasted potential. It had all the elements to be a captivating open-world survival game, but instead, it's a buggy, frustrating mess that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.

In its early stages it was really not a suitable game for a single-player game, as the world in which you were traveling was really empty and the enemies were very, very difficult. It had been really built for a cooperative environment, and I was only playing it as single player.

But in the four years since it's been made an immense quantity of stuff to look at, do, and collect has really been improved, and the difficulty has been made more manageable. I really am enjoying this new, fleshed-out version of GZ!",1566433640,1691360715,True,0,0,0.496061980724334717,0,True,False,False

Which is fine, people are allowed not to like the game, but I did wonder why they didn't like it.  Upon reading those reviews, I was genuinely left wondering if we were playing the same game.

Before going any further, a caveat.  Neither of these reviewers stated what difficulty level they were playing on.  Possibly, it was one of the higher ones and their take on the gameplay is bang on.  My review should be read strictly in the context of the default difficulty level, which is the level at which I completed my playthrough.

Now,l I don't want to get bogged down in to much TL;DR; detail here.  The core criticism leveled by both of these reviews seems to be that, outside of the starting areas, you get swarmed by enemies that can't be avoided.  I'm, like, *what* are they talking about?

Yes, it's true that the density of enemies, once you leave the starting area, increases significantly.  They are also of progressively higher level, the deeper you get into the map, and the Apocalypse tier mechs really can spot you from a mile away if you don't take care.  If any of these higher-tier mechs spot you, particularly if they are in a pack (which the almost always are), then you will die tired and with brown pants.  But the idea that you cannot sneak past these enemies ""without crawling across the map on your belly"" is absurd.  To be specific about it:

You absolutely can both run away from and hide from the Azalea/Firebird (the flying ones) mechs.

You absolutely can avoid detection by *any* mech, including Apocalypse Tier, and you can escape even packs once detected.

But not if you play like Rambo.  Running and gunning will get you dead.  I mean, there are probably players that can do that and get away with it, but I am not one of them. 

Anyway, the solution to the quantity/quality threat is simple:

1) 
As soon as possible, maximize all of your stealth attributes. Your early game build should be razor-focused on minimizing your audio and visual signature.  Do that and, so long as it is nighttime, you can ride past FINX-Tier mech while riding a bicycle at a distance of 50 yards and it will not notice you (so long as it is in patrol mode and not actively searching).   Note, however, that these higher-tier mechs frequently deploy picket mechs around their perimeter, and those will spot you if they switch to active scanning.  Apocalypse-Tier mechs require more respect; you will need to stay in cover and duck-walk to avoid detection. 

By the same token, manufacture Apparel that enhances Silence and Camouflage.   Between Skills and Apparel, you can easily get your visibility reduced by 50%, which is enough to let an Apocalypse-Tier Hunter *literally* walk over you without seeing you (if you are prone and in cover [such as high grass], and it is not in Search Mode).  This will also hide you from Firebirds.

2)
Realize that there are *always* more mechs around than you can see.  Some of the larger mechs can spawn smaller mechs but, beyond that, there are always smaller mechs in the vicinity of the larger ones, and they will com running when the shooting starts.

3) 
If you are playing solo, picking a straight-up fight with any of the larger mechs (hunters and up) in the open is borderline-suicidal.  Avoid contact until you can dictate the terms of the engagement.  Ideally, this will mean you are set up in a large barn, bunker, hangar,  or house before you engage.  Structures in this game are indestructible, but explosions can damage you through walls, poison gas can leak into the structure, and enemies can and will shoot you through broken windows and open doors.

4) 
Learn the audio cues for each mech and what kind of attack (kinetic, explosive, pyrotechnic, gas, melee, Ticks) it advertises, then respond accordingly.  

5) 
Learn the weak points of each mech.  More importantly, learn which armaments of each mech pose the greatest threat and how to disable it.  For instance: shooting the shoulder-mounted weapon off of a Hunter reduces its threat level against a player *under cover* by 95%.  For this reason alone, acquiring the top-tier sniper rifle  (the .50 cal Pansarvärnsgevär 90) is strongly recommended.

6)
For the solo player, the only Specialization that matters is Hacking  The best strategy for dealing with packs is ""let's you and him fight"".  You get full XP for any kill made by your hacked mech. and it costs you nothing but popcorn. In particular, hacking Firebirds should become automatic (bring extra popcorn; those things are a terror)  You may even find yourself picking off or disarming some enemies in order to extend the life of your proxy (this is safe, because mechs involved in combat with each other will not break off to attack you, even if you are attacking them).  And, frankly, the only sane way to kill a Firebird (flying tank mech.) is to hack it first.  A hacked mech will not attack you, even if you shoot it).

A word of caution, however: mechs *hate* being hacked and, when the hack wears off, the will be *pissed* and they will know where you were when you initiated the hack.  If you don't want them to find you, be somewhere else.


Another consistent criticism seemed to be that all there is never enough ammunition.  This statement baffles me.  I am *drowning* in ammunition with just the stuff I find. The only ammo I ever manufacture is the .50 cal for the P-90.  Everything else I find so much of it that I usually just recycle it.  But, context is important.  I am an inveterate Loot Goblin and will search every structure, shipping container and dead mech and loot *everything* off if it. If this is not your style, then yes, you might have logistical issues in regard to ammo.

To put real numbers on this, my typical ammo loadout is:

1500 rounds each of 7.62 FMJ and AP.
2000 rounds each of 5.56 FMJ and AP. 
200 rounds of .270 Soft Tip
200 rounds of .44 Magnum FMJ
150 rounds of.50 BMG FMJ
60 rounds of .50 BMG AP

Once you have acquired enough ammo to reach these targets, and have enough extra in storage to completely replace that twice, recycle anything else you find.

For firing that ammo, i carry:

Automatgevär 4 - Silenced (7.62)
Kvm 89 SAW w/recoil suppressor (5.56)
Älgstudsare Hunting Rifle - Silenced (.270)
""Pansarvärnsgevär"" (Pvg 90) (.50 BMG)
.44 Magnus (sidearm) w/recoil suppressor  (.44 Mangum)

Frankly, I could ditch the .44 Magnus and never miss it.

Use the Automatgevär 4 for dealing with runners and ticks at short and medium ranges
Use the Älgstudsare for sniping Runner fuel tanks at long range without being detected.
Use the Kvm 89 SAW when you get swarmed or surprised, to blast an escape path.
Use the Pvg 90 to disarm/kill Huners and tanks at range (the longer the better).

Be aware that firing the Pvg. 90 will advertise your location to every mech. withing a kilometer of your firing location; they *will* be dropping by to pay their respects. Also note that you will likely never find enough .50 BMG ammo in the field to maintain your supply, so you will have to manufacture it.  Looting all the Steel (or items than can be recycled to obtain Steel), Lead and Explosives you can find is critical to provisioning this weapon.

Beyond the guns and ammo, my standard loadout consists of five grenades, a couple of fireworks (they confuse mech targeing systems; useful for escaping ambushes/pursuit) and every  First Aid Kit I can find (not the Paramedic Packs, though; they are intended for group play and are too heavy for the benefit they provide).

The final general criticism is in regard to the storage mechanic.  As a Loot Goblin, I have to agree: I *hate* limited storage that I have to manage.  As a game design decision, I think it is the correct implementation; being forced to limit the available gear is part of the challenge, regardless of how much my packrat personality hates it.

DISLIKE #1
The main mission/storyline ended very abruptly, surprisingly. I had only explored maybe 1/2 the map at best, and suddenly the story was over. 

DISLIKE #2
It seems like its geared towards DLC. For example,  I never had so much Tungsten that if felt comfortable with creating 6 crown, special ammo.

Dislike #3 
Base defense. I tried it once around level 20 and I got smashed. You probably need some top tier abilities and weapons to survive, unless you go watch some 'how-to'. 

Dislike #4
The characters are so ugly. They all look like transgender teens. Maybe that was the desired look?

Do I like Generation Zero?

No. Not really, no. I can't say I *like* it, I like the premise sure, I like the concept and the weapons, and the robot designs themselves,[ and the DLC's are definitely worth poking into, I actually really liked FNIX RISING and Alpine Unrest.]

But the execution of the game leaves... something to be desired, a poor taste in your mouth, Like you've been shown this lovely breakfast, with bacon, eggs, some lovely toast, and some beans, and some properly nice bits of sausage,(work with me here i'm British, just follow along)

And then you get this lovely breakfast and, you notice the portion sizes are awfully small... and why are some of these extra? Shouldn't they just be part of the meal instead of being separate add ons? I mean some of this is fairly important stuff, and can really change the balance of the meal for the better.

It leaves you wanting more, in a bad way. 

There's something here, something that's *trying* to build up to an interesting story, but it just... god its boring.

It's missing something...

It isn't fun.

The DLC's are, sure, but they don't add any new weapons, just more robots to fight.

The map just feels... boring.

The limited storage space for safe houses is absolutely abysmal, who the hell came up with this idea?

And what do you get for beating all the main missions?

An achievement, a pat on the back. 

..and that's it.

No special something something, no incentive to keep playing, just ""okay that's it, that's everything""

I have been waiting for some kind of narrative update, some kind of continuation from the story, like actually finding out why people were being kidnapped by FNIX, or where did those Americans and Russians go? I mean you find some dead commies , and a hovercraft, and the occasional weird wacky russian robots that look straight outta Atomic Heart, but once again, lacking sustenance. 

I mean, what else  is this game even meant for?

Sandbox shooter? Because its mindless, and the sandbox gets very, VERY repetitive quickly.

Story Driven Shooter? The story ends half way through and just becomes ""go to A pick up B destroy C"" over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, I can go on honestly.

The rivals are a nice touch, but to even get those cool ""experimental"" weapons is a hassle and a half, I just stuck with the guns I found searching through the wiki for them.

Is Generation Zero fun with friends?

See previous answer, No, not really.. It's more people so, sure you can get into combat easier... but its still mundane. 

It. Isn't. Fun.

At first? sure. Any further? No.

Pro:
- Graphics: It's beautiful. Think close to Forest/Sons of the Forest.
- Optimization: Doesn't kill my hardware, and I can launch into my world maybe 20 seconds after I launch the exe.
- Enemy difficulty scaling: Unlike most games, the enemies keep the same HP throughout your character's progression. An enemy that takes 50 bullets to take down with your rusted revolver can later be one shot by your fancy experimental/electric revolver. They scale it according to natural geographic progression. As you work into different regions, you will find different ""models"" (Ex: prototype vs Mil-spec). I appreciate this sense of realism. After all, after after almost 100 hours, I'd hope to smash any prototype grunt with my pinky. -- To top it off, if you are really cutting through enemies, you'll start to see some bots become ""rivals"", and they will exponentially increase their HP and are visible on the map until defeated. And if you really REALLY cut through enemies, something quite cute will spawn in for you (I won't ruin it, but be sure to reap the benefits). 
- Enemy variance (*only in recent updates, not when I started*): Adding to the above, as you progress through the regions, you're introduced to new variants. It was actually fun to revisit this months later not knowing they added these in and being pleasantly surprised (it was actually quite terrifying, many ""WHAT THE F-!""s and ""WHO THE HECK ARE YOU!?""s).
- Combat system: You'll probably see people back and forth on the ""realism"" of weapon mechanics. As far as the weapons go, I'm neutral. You like what you like - you'll chose what works for you. I'm talking the overall system (stealth meters, damage zones, enemy differences and complimentary traits, etc.). At first, I tended to avoid all conflict because I was intimidated and always ended battles with 2 bullets to my name, but now that I have it all figured out, I can't wait to stumble on a horde of 40 bots.

Cons: 
- Bicycle physics: Just, no. It handles well as you'd expect a blown up polly pocket bike to hande.
- Tips/tutorials: I was an early adopter so I may not remember things too well. However, I do remember just being plopped into an open world with little to no context and I walked outside and got mauled - which, is sort of the vibe since you're just some kid who woke up to this whole event. But ...I feel like I had to Google a good bit on how to kill some of the enemies. Only to find out they all had different damage zones. Again, you're a kid who woke up to this and would learn it in real life too, but a little on screen hint of ""Maybe try to hit something that looks important"", would have been nice to start lol.
- Mission progression &system: Probably why the game gets hate. This game feels like it wants to be a survival game, FPS game, and RPG game all at the same time. You CAN do it (by evidence of me recommending the game), but the more honed in you are to one audience/genre, the more tuned your game will feel. Sure, you can run around surviving, but to what end? You survive for stints between safe-houses in order to eventually complete the story. The story, is actually quite cool on paper, BUT THAT'S JUST IT! It is LITERALLY on paper. There are an OK amount of voice acting to guide the story but a majority of the mission and side missions is ""go pick up this paper on a desk across the map"". You pick it up, and a new mission appears saying ""go pick up the clipboard from the bunker across the ocean"". There is probably important and well thought out story details written on these elements, and the game does give you the opportunity to ""Read item"", but, aint nobody got time for that. As to the actual system, some story missions only appear when you fall in proximity to it. So you can think you're done, but you better hope you walked the entire map lest you miss a mission. You'll be on one mission travel across a quarter of the map, and unlock 15 other main/side missions. You do one more main mission, you have another 10 side missions (all to grab some more paper). Heck, there's even a side mission to go visit the ""Warboards"" in like 10 different bunkers scattered throughout the map. What are these Warboards you ask? Another set of missions for that region. -- The missions are all pretty easy but all I started seeing them as were check boxes that needed marked and I sort of just stumbled into the final mission almost on accident.

Overall my expectations were floored when I booted it up and played it, it's a bad experience if need be, check out my twitch to see my friend and my reaction

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1885446745

it's sad because I love games like this and games in general and the premise is really good

(Back Story)

sadly the second game they made second extinction has been left in beta for years and they made a third game (generation zero is still in development and getting spaced out updates)

as far as I heard from my friend who has 300 hrs and talking to other streamers and vets of the game conducting interviews

is that the devs keep trying to re-make the game over and over

that is where the money and time is going, instead of making new ground they keep going back to square one to keep remaking the initial stats and premise and mechanics (skill rework is coming later on)

(community)

- many people swear up and down the game and defend the micro transactions to support the devs and I appreciate how passionate people are but its sad that they lock so much mechanics and basic things behind pay walls and most of these come with unexpected down sides

like the weight/ storage limit for DLC weapons, the bike verus bike and then moped in game

I will go way more into more detail but I will jot my findings in my spare time if any fans would like to share positive and negative insights all is appreciated (this review is still on going and will be updated when free time is made) 

[This was made with 1.8 hours]

Update: I decided to repurchase the game with its expansions and run proper testing and giving this game more room to prove its merit and see if there is anything to enjoy here

its opening presentation and story later on feels like its going on without you and you're simply a tool to complete tasks as the radio world happens around you

I will be creating a proper review video in time, in the mean time I will be streaming the game on twitch

[Adding more hours 5.8]

the community is helpful and wholesome but you will need to find it in game as oppose on the forums, the game does seem to get better as it goes on but is bare bones still, I'm continuing my efforts to progress through this game and give a more proper review

one thing to note is that the game as much as it is an open world really wants you to follow the correct mission path steady, online steam guides even have a guide of what paths to take as the game will throw mid-end game missions at players and 9/10 they try to do the top one on the list and end up on a goose chase while being curbed stomped

the world does regenerate misc loot in bags and general containers after a long while, there are consistent weapons, schematics and more in areas, it will be marked on the location of the map, hover over the legend and it will say what can be found, be warned not all loot is worth it but it is there to keep things consistent (Loot takes 4 real life hours to re-spawn loot)

a better vehicle, a moped can be found in a hanger in a bunker plane bay it requires fuel and proper care with vehicle repair kits

the new robot companion requires looking after and care but it can carry 32 pounds for you thus bringing fuel, repair kits, and spare medical supplies to aid in the journey

he does follow but in a fire fight he will try to duke it out with the care for his life, the good and bad

he is like the tank of the unit, properly distracting/taunting the enemies while laying solid fire

but he will get hit, and he will get hit hard since everyone will be gunning for him and now in a sense you have to cover and baby sit him, he can be pulled in and out of your inventory backpack with his loot on him intact

he can be a great aid, and seeing the DLC it seems they locked his best features on top of his standard behind a $8 paywall

there are better skins you can find in the game by general looting like for ones clothing

but these will be consistent for all characters/worlds

the modules add a lot of functionality for him 8/3/2023",1690616114,1691116715,False,2,0,0.368719607591629028,0,True,False,False

Gameplay-wise, the game is a pseudo-realistic looter shooter. The feel of the weapons is no more than that. Some weapons are totally useless.

Like other have said, weapons are largely unbalanced and most of the time you have to keep using health packs just to stay alive.

Skill trees are an absolute mess, there's a bunch of useless skills including some specializations (I'm looking at you Guerrilla). Schematics are too gated behind exploration and looting rivals, you'll probably explore almost the entire map before getting something decent. Oh, and don't think that you can use that cool 4* schematic, because you need every previous iteration. Why? Don't know.

As positives, graphics are decent, machines designs are pretty good and weather effects are nailed down.

It was a decent sandbox shooter, but now it's painful to play due to certain dumb decisions in the last updates like largely increase the number of roaming machines/patrols plus tanks got an OP attack in the last one, esentially stomping around almost non stop while shooting, it's not fun, and I don't plan to play a crawling simulator.

Game still has a lot of potential, I'm not holding hands but Systemic Reaction still has a chance to stop releasing so many dlcs, focus on fixing bugs, balance skills/weapons/etc and decide what they actually want to do with the game.

EDIT: Didn't realize at first, they are the same ones who are developing Second Extinction (great coop game btw), GZ is mostly abandoned.

Update 03/08/2023: The game still has egregiously bad design decisions. Unasked expanded tutorial with irrelevant NPCs, base assault is hardly explained and activated way too early in the game. 

Explore several empty areas then find a point with 20 enemies (half of them hunters who will absolutely screw you), max level enemies in what should be a mid level area, a companion who apparently can tank better than a Tank and, of course, paid DLCs every X months undeserving of their price. 

More than three years and the game is still buggy with no direction. They keep adding ""content"" without thinking too hard about it. GZ isn't finished and will never be, feeling more like a beta rather a polished product. It's playable, but that's it.

It's good. The introduction is long but it doesn't hold your hand too much and there's plenty to work out, mechanically, as you go. It has a story that is easy to piece together during the introduction and doesn't dominate gameplay. Don't be afraid to stray from the path to gather resources and xp.
The ""berry picking"" of loot is good and engaging, but the ""loot sorting simulator"" component can be a little annoying like it is in most survival games with a semi-realistic weight limit. 
It CAN be played single player (invite-only multiplayer) but there is no pause. I am currently squatting in a burning building in my game while I write this and wait for daylight in-game.
I wouldn't recommend this game to people who prefer to be a superhero who destroys all in their path and walks away with barely a scratch or a medkit used, especially if playing alone. It's definitely a skirmisher type game. Running away, using distractions and messing with the AI (they are robots after all) is encouraged.

A few notes for newbs like myself who haven't bought it yet or haven't passed the 2 hour mark:
- Flares and fireworks are more useful than grenades, even though they do no damage.
- Go to safe houses and interact with the supply storage box before quitting the game if you want to be sure that the game has saved your progress.
- Shooting the little canister on top of the dog robots may be a good way to take them out easily, but it deprives you of a certain loot. Robots are made of components which can be weak spots while also being useful parts.
- The first rifle (meusser) isn't as powerful as it would seem from other games unless you know your robots, and to move after firing once. It's not the ultimate newb weapon but there are vision modules later which make it great for scouting. SMGs seem to be more useful than automatic rifles, save the AP automatic rifle ammo for the big ones.
- DLC is not needed, I haven't bought any. Advice from experienced players told me that the two vital story DLCs are good for when you've finished a lot of the game, and the others are extraneous. There is one that makes base defence easier, apparently, but that might not be a good thing. I don't know if motorbikes are fun or not, but I've been playing on foot at all times without using fast travel at all.
- Base defence and companion robot lies behind two longer missions, but the game is quite playable before unlocking them: I still haven't and I'm enjoying the game while playing alone.
- There is no brightness/gamma setting, so don't play it in a sunny room unless you want to make yourself obvious by keeping your torch out much of the time at night (in game). 
- Loot DOES regenerate, but it takes a long time so it will seem at first like there is limited loot on the map.
- Aside from occasional pauses while playing the game for too many consecutive hours, it runs smoothly and the pauses don't seem to happen during combat. The worst problem I've encountered is getting stuck between objects, but so far I've managed to escape every time after struggling with jump and move keys and panicking slightly. 

I'll update this once I've unlocked robot companion, base building and defence, and seen what happens when my level is the main difficulty defining factor and I've stepped out of the newb zone (archipelago).

If you're going in expecting a DayZ-like survival experience, but with robots instead of zombies, you'll be disappointed. This game is more like Destiny than it is DayZ or other survival games. The only thing that makes this game a survival game is health management, as half-baked as it is.

I only recommend this game for some people who have a lot of time to play. This is not a game for somebody who has a lot of games to play or doesn't have a lot of time. This game is very grind-heavy, especially when you finish the main story. 

The idea of this game is fantastic, but its executed poorly. It feels like a cake that's made up of the most high-quality ingredients in the world, but then it was taken out of the oven way before it was done. Unfortunately, the game is old enough to where there will probably be no major overhauls, so what you see is what you get and it will stay that way, save for some new content added once every two or three months. If you like a grindy game, then this will probably be your game. There are a lot of weapons, especially if you get the DLC.

The game is also incredibly fun with friends. The most fun you will probably get out of this game after the story is base-building, base defense, and enemy base assaults outside of the occasional Reaper mega-boss fight. After the first four or five hours, the excitement of the story reaches a huge fall off and it just becomes one huge fetch quest. There are also way too many junk quests that just waste your time, lead you to dead ends, and give you sh!t weapons that aren't worth your time.

For all of its faults, the graphics, sound design, and enemy design are not one of them. These aspects are very-well designed. Its almost as if the dev team put much more time into graphics, sound, and design than they did anything, and it really shows. The combat is repetitive, but can be fun for the right audience, its not down right terrible. With the DLCs installed, you can make combat more engaging by setting traps and things like that, but 90% of fights just come down to unloading on sh!t until its dead. The early game is where combat is at its best with stealth gameplay. The attempt at a class-based system is just that - an attempt. Classes aren't very unique and the skill tree just kind of feels there to say the game has a skill tree. Some skills are absolutely required for everybody though, such as lock-picking, but you have to waste skill points on gas resistance for it, which is trash design. Its not awful though.

And that's honestly a good summary of the game. Its a very solid ""Meh."" The early game carries this game hard. Everything in the game is a great idea, but is poorly executed or executed very half-assed. Survival? Nah, just health, no food or water or temperature. Combat? Just shoot and kaboom and run backwards?? No strategy involved half the time past the early game. Stealth? Well, sure you could move slowly or lie down, but clothing choice doesn't really matter, hiding in bushes doesn't matter. Do you see now? Its all here to be a great game, but its all half-assed and lazy, and that's about it. Its just meh.

Reasons:

1) Terrible Controller Mapping, nearly impossible to play without a M&K. Usually this is the opposite for these kind of games but still inexcusable.

2) Lack of Swimming. This seems odd, there's a lot of games that don't let you slim, and a lot of those are fantastic games. The problem is that the game asks you to spend 30 minutes to an hour fighting a single enemy, using hundred if not thousands of ammo, only for it to roll off into the water and deny you the reward. If a player completes an objective they should receive the reward, end of story. Any reason for failure in that regard is unacceptable. Either let me swim, or have a loot container spawn on land when it happens. Simple fixes for simple problems.

3) DLC. Too pricey for too little. They put out updates that are only half complete so they can sell you the other half.

That being said, if you can get past these issues (and get it on sale) it's a fun looter-shooter with satisfying looting and shooting that's mentally stimulating with an interesting story (even if the delivery is a bit flat).",1689572751,1690920359,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Feels like a Far Cry clone. Except in Sweden with robots. Lots of rain and terrible voice acting. 
I do like the graphics/world. Plus combat can be fun. Though the AI, like many games, is terrible. 
About 12 hrs in. Incredibly tired of getting stuck in the world. Horrible collision boxes. Could really use an unstuck button like Medieval Dynasty has.

It feels clunky and janky in parts (I am running this on a 3060 and it still feels janky)
The story suffers from...the silent protagonist, which rarely works, ESPECIALLY not here
The story is boring and is just running from one place to another, once you complete a mission you have no idea what happened or why
In fights the enemys are bullet sponges and most fights will be a 10 min gun shoot at a huge target
Map needs to maybe have usable cars or trains, motorbikes are cool though
Guns are not fun to look for once you have the best ones as after that they all become irrelevant
Game can feel stale and reptetive

whom this may concern

I would highly recommend this game is you enjoy games that include tags like
-Survival-
-Massive Open World-
-Multiplayer/Single player-
-Offline or Online-
-Updated regular-
-Regular new DLC's-
And much more, this game includes but is not limited to, offline single player gameplay, online playing, mod-able and a giant map. this game is for you if you like survival gun games against bots. If you like PvP, sadly this isn't for you.
This game basically puts you in the middle of a war against robot 'AI' that was meant for the army but then turned against them. You play as a resistance fighter taking back control of Sweden using force, you have the to find weapons and materials to build and fight back the enemy. The AI in the game (can if you enable it) grow and learn your tactic's meaning you have to adjust your gameplay and get better equipment and gear. This game really challenged me as a dude who's been playing games like Call of duty and Call of duty Warzone. If you find the main gameplay to easy, there are DLC's that include a new part of the map which was previously unaccessable without it, it includes harder enemies and a entire new area of the map which can prove to be very difficult if you are under prepared for it. On top of new enemies this DLC allows those bots to travel all over Sweden, and can become a boss if you get a high enough level and threat level. Worth spending money on, I have been playing non stop since I got it and it's so addictive, all in all exceedingly though out and well made Dev's.
I really enjoyed this game and hope that anyone who buys it does too.

NOT recommended for players who have photosensitive epilepsy due to bright flashing lights
NOT for people who want the entire get laid back and relaxing.

If you're playing solo, combat requires a bit of planning and improvisation to survive the encounter.  Inventory management is kind of annoying, though.  Given the more survival focus of the gameplay though, it makes sense to have some limitations on the inventory.  Levelling up also takes quite more time to do than you might expect.  Note that levelling doesn't improve your character much more than to provide you with a single skill point. 

Gen Zero does provide a reasonable challenge, and the game hasn't ever really felt unfair or anything.  The AI ranges from really smart to really dumb.  It kinda depends on the situation.  If you're out in the open, the AI will use a combination of pinning fire to keep you from moving and outflanking attacks with the more nimble robots.  More advanced enemies will make good use of gas grenades and explosives to keep you from camping out in a good spot, too.  That said, if you can lure enemies to a nearby Safe House, its all too easy to just pop out and shoot the robots and then duck back into the safe house to heal up if necessary.  You get a similar experience in the more urban environments, too.  That said, combat is challenging, and you'll definitely want to make use of explosives, fire, and EMP weapons to give you an advantage.  Setting traps using flares or radios is a great way to set up an ambush.

Although the weak spots on enemies are hard to find and kinda whacky, it is a lot of fun to play solo or with friends.
The system requirements arent too high and you still get some pretty decent graphics.
My only current issue with this game is, that it sometimes disconnects other players in the lobby or their game just crashes, but the devs are actively working on this issue already so it'll hopefully get fixed soon. Still, it is very annoying - especially in rival killing or fnix base raid missions, since players can disconnect, but not join a lobby during these.

graphics are good, and there is alot of visual story telling. ""what happend here""
there is a good story line, but after done with all the missions, you find youreself a bit lost in the game what to do.

only downside so far is how hard it is to get all the experimental weapons in end-game.
after the missions are done you basicly hunt robots to get more rivals with higher drop chance to get them.
they added more variation in enemies but could do with more variations in missions differand missions.

The concept is really, really cool, but the execution has made me increasingly frustrated. The devs seem unable to decide if they want this game to be an action shooter or a survival game. It starts out really well, and there's a genuine sense of tension when robots are around, and the first hunter you come across is genuinely terrifying. 

But once you leave the starting area, you are absolutely bombarded with enemies, and they ramp up into the higher tiers VERY QUICKLY. Stealth is not really a viable option, especially when you start to see Harvesters and Tanks in just about every field that can detect you from a mile away unless you traverse the entire map on your belly. You want to take cover to avoid losing most of your health to a few shots, yet so many enemies have tools that force you to constantly be on the move like gas projectiles or cluster rockets, so you WILL end up eating med packs like candy. Its so frustrating to be nearly finished fighting a pack of enemies, because it will always be a pack of them, only to have to do it all over again because another pack of enemies has wondered by and heard the noise.

Yet it still wants to try and be a survival game and you're hit with a weight capacity and a need to craft a lot of items you need with some materials that rarely seem to come up. My biggest gripe is that its open world, yet there are many areas that do not open up until you do a certain quest, or certain weapons that you can't access before you do the quest for that area, so there's no real incentive to explore outside of doing the quests.",1690630888,1690630888,False,42,3,0.687551259994506836,3,True,False,False

I thought I would have more fun playing it with friends, that way we could laugh at the bugs and the silly stuff happening, rather than get pissed like I was in single player. Maybe with a bit of time too, some of it would be fixed and sorted out.

I convinced some friends to look it over now that the price has dropped a bit, and give it a buy while it was on sale. Turns out that the game now spies on you, steals, and sells a whole bunch of your private information. No wonder they can sell the base game for so cheap on sale, when they have that going on; though I am sure that the 15 pieces of DLC going from $4 to $8 helps too. It costs $64.85 for all of the DLC, *on sale*, while the base game has a regular price of $29.99. 

Honestly, just scummy business practices all around with this one. A real shame too. At this point I would not recommend this game at all at to anyone.

I did not expect such a great solo play experience and as for multiplayer i will try right away as i big fix improved this? hope so. Some of the situations as a solo you find yourself in WOW thx dev team great work, great design, great art, great engine and somebody has a little humour and nostalgic flavour (it suites well). I want map 2 plz and i will probably get some DLC in the future (only very small ones bean counter from accounts relax).

I don't exactly know if the game changed so much or I did but after over 600 hours in Valheim I wanted some other solo game an introvert can enjoy and this is it 😊 
The world is beautiful and hauntingly empty except for the robots that are trying to kill you, like greydwarfs, trolls, goblins other creatures in Valheim 😊
It has ticks too! 😊
After ~27 hours of playing the game I found out there is english audio dialogue not only Swedish 😊
I am still a noob, and I don't understand all the mechanics of upgrading and crafting, weapon ammo still a headache, but I can not stop playing it.
I am really glad I decided to install it again.
Every encounter is a lesson learned, I found out that you had to take armor plates first to deal damage after watching youtube videos (by 'TenebrisInfinite' and 'KilroyPlays')
Combat is very skill based so I guess you have to git good 😊 you have to use cover - after years of 'Unreal Tournament' and 'Doom' I had to learn it the hard way.
Looting is pretty good when you know what you need, but I want everything so it did fill up rather quickly 😊
Night and day cycle makes completely different experience.

Quick tips:
+ Don't jump from cliffs you gon die son! 😊
+ [Z] - to crawl.
+ Don't switch to binoculars when you need a gun 😊

[Edit]
Totally playable on Steam Deck, I've tried it with a mouse - plays absolutely fine.
In most encounters, especially at night I feel unprepared but I like the thrill 😊 I can't run circles around robots like 'TenebrisInfinite' 😊 but I am enjoying every moment of it😊

Basically saying ""Hey! Look! We aren't lazy we can say we added 1 new feature in a single 'major update' this year!""

Why is this companion update a thing? This should have been a MINOR CHANGE added to the hacker skill tree...

The only further things they are adding this year are new and recycled cosmetics...

At this point, personally, I would declare this game trapped in development hell.


2021 -- THEY BLOCKED WEAPONS AND FEATURES BEHIND A PAYWALL IN AN ALREADY BORING GAME WITH BARE BONE FEATURES


March 2020 -- recent updates broke some animations, and sounds. Also, it changed the UI in the most confusing and needlessly complicated way possible. Another thing, the crafting system they recently added? IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK!!!! You can find schematics, but when you try to craft the item, it eats your resources but you don't even get your item!! The most recent update has only seemed to BREAK things!!

Once you've completed the game, finished all challenges and DLC, there's nothing left to do. You cannot create a new character correctly, because your story progress will be the same as the first character. It's basically like just slapping a fresh level 1 on your already existing world. You have to delete all of your save files just to start a new game.

The game is fun when you first start playing it, but once you complete the game, it's just boring and not fun at all, even with friends. The game was often boring even when I had things to do! I used to love this game but it's fallen, and the devs just seem to be digging the grave deeper and solidifying my decision to leave the game.",1585262671,1690427772,False,2,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

This patch currently just totally wrecks your s*** with no easy solution. None of the suggestions online such as changing download region, clearing cache, going offline then online, etc. worked. I eventually managed to get signed out of steam and was able to find the local files for the game and permanently delete them and then remove the game from my library which stopped the issue.

The last major update for Generation Zero ultimately destroyed players unique bases that they spent the time collecting resources to build. The bug they introduced to the game was severe enough that those bases were not recoverable. The dev team was like 'yeah sorry about that.' Contemplate this situation for a moment. By the way along with this the robot bases were also severely affected and that has not been addressed at all. 

Rather than fix existing issues in the base game the GZ team continues  to release piecemeal DLC that add little to nothing in content for the game. These releases continue to be useless add-ons that typically bring in new game breaking bugs instead of QoL changes for the player base. The new bugs are always extreme and I am of the opinion that college professors need to study the GZ dev team so they understand what not to do when programming a video game. It's that bad. The sad thing is Generation Zero has so much potential and the programmers continue to aim low and release premium garbage. One of the things I appreciate about Steam is you can be honest about how poor a game is being developed or wrecked and the devs can't do much about that. Thanks Steam.

Multiplayer in GZ continues to be a nightmare. If you want to help out other players co-op style most of the time you will be disconnected at the crucial moment or the nOobs won't know any better and kick you to the curb. Pure un-WiN funs.

Edit 7/8/22
With a large game update from about two weeks ago Generation Zero has become unplayable. There is a game-breaking bug where a destroyed robot can infinitely spawn the smallest robot in the game known as a Tick. Tick swarms can become so large that the game ends up fighting itself and reaches a point where Generation Zero cannot handle it and crashes. Game crashes are now pretty much guaranteed within a few minutes of play. While I was willing to give the game devs some time to fix this issue it seems they are aware of it and not really doing anything at this time to solve it. Along with the continued DLC's going in the wrong direction for this game and coupled with the fact that Generation Zero is horribly broken I can no longer recommend this game to anybody. Avoid it, and if you just bought it during the 2022 Steam Summer sale I would encourage you to get it refunded now.

Edit 4/10/22
With recent updates and changes to Generation Zero (Landfall and Base Raids) resource tin-can collecting courtesy of Fallout 76 is becoming more of a nuisance issue. I also see some WARFRAME style game dilution starting to take place which is disappointing. What that means is for new players obtaining rewards that were previously straightforward are becoming more difficult to achieve. The game is going in the wrong direction and I would like to see the dev team refocus their efforts on making the accessible game world larger rather than incremental gameplay mode releases and minor DLCs for cosemtics and mid-tier weapon packs that are bordering on micro transaction costs.

If you are a fan of the sci-fi television show Black Mirror you may remember an episode called ""Metalhead"" that came out in 2017. In that episode a group of people were looting a warehouse in the middle of nowhere for an item, but were thwarted by a pack of small lethal robots. You don't know what happened or why those people were at the warehouse in the first place. It becomes clear quickly that something terrible has happened. The robots are everywhere hunting humans and the survivors are being wiped out rapidly.

Generation Zero takes this basic concept from Metalhead and expands it greatly. There isn't much of a story. You either choose to find a way to survive and fight back against a plague of lethal robots, or you can simply join the rest of your dead countrymen. I chose the first option and I have to say this game is totally fun. I'm about 30 hours into it so far and it just keeps getting more interesting and challenging. The game takes place in an alternate past across the Swedish countryside where everyone has been killed off. You need to scavenge for supplies and avoid detection long enough to reach safety or have enough gear and weapons to fight back and win. 

There's an open world to explore at your own pace which I appreciate. Be stealthy and wander around for hours avoiding conflict or force the issue by being a search and destroy monster. Do as you please. The game world is incredibly detailed and gorgeous. One of the best I think I have ever seen. Sometimes I have stopped what I am doing just to take in the scenery and snap a few screenshots. The rest of the time I am applying guerilla warfare tactics by staying off roads and trails to scout out an objective town or building before moving through it. My goal is to pilfer resources quickly and exfiltrate out of the area before being detected by a group of aggressive robots. 

When you are discovered Generation Zero provides a tense, stressful experience. The robot AI is pretty damn good. As a unit or group robots will try to flank or encircle you with speed and tear you to bits. If they are losing the skirmish they will summon nearby reinforcements. Prepare yourself because they are out to give you a really bad day. The longer you survive the robots will ultimately become even tougher to defeat and the AI is more ferocious. You'll have to think fast to fight to survive. Gunplay is excellent, weapons feel strong and when you do take down a robot the destruction is very satisfying. Behind all of this is a somber background music soundtrack that reminds me of something Vangelis would have scored in the mid-1980's. It fits the game perfectly and adds to the tension.

Unlike Fallout 76 there is no time wasted tin-can collecting for resources which is a nuisance aspect of game play. Generation Zero gets down to brass tacks and keeps the resource gathering to a minimum. It's just the important stuff, health items, weapons, and ammunition. There is a limited crafting system which is counterintuitive and a bit clunky to use. It's prone to a couple of annoying glitches that need to be fixed and I would like to see this function streamlined. There's also a storage system where you can bank supplies for use later. 

I honestly don't know how I missed Generation Zero when it came out in 2019 but in my opinion this is a hidden gem on Steam and I am glad I got it. If you are undecided about picking this up and giving it a try I'd wait for a Steam sale. The 2021 Holiday sale is just about a month away from now so you could always wishlist it and wait until then.

I enjoyed it so much that I just kept playing long after they were done with it. Shooting and ""killing"" the robots feels good like, REALLY good. To the point that, finding new groups of enemies almost feels like a reward. Which, in turn, makes exploring the countryside a ton of fun.

Now, it's not all good stuff. The game is extremely buggy and some bugs can literally break the game. I've even had a handful of random crashes here and there. I've yet to loose any progress because of that, however. For me, the worst bugs are the ones that are easily repeatable. Meaning that, the devs should know they're there but have chosen not to fix them. The worst being the one where you finally find a good hiding spot, maybe up on some rocks and, suddenly you can't damage enemies. Which seems to go both ways. Because I've had them just circling me only a few feet away and they can definitely see me but aren't shooting. To clarify, these were not melee enemies.

Also, sometimes enemies just vanish and I'm pretty sure they're falling out of the map. There were also a couple of times enemies got stuck inside trees or rocks. Which is the worst of all because they can hit you but, you can't hit them. Didn't expect a game released in 2019 to emulate classic World of Warcraft like that. LoL  :)

I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention how bad the inventory system is. It's basically functional. Very reminiscent of the classic Resident Evil games. Especially RE4, which could be good or bad depending on your own tastes. Some of the little item popups are straight up broken forcing you to guess about what does what. On top of that many of the item icons appear totally identical which just adds to the problem. I was hours into the game, blasting giant robots with my pistol and shotgun before I even realized that I had mountains of weapon plugins that would've made my guns WAY better. Which, in my opinion, only serves to further point out just how damned much fun it is to shoot stuff in this game.

Overall, the mechanics, the sound design and, the visuals are all simply amazing. Chef's kiss amazing. The game feels SO good to play that most of the time when I run into a bug it's funny instead of frustrating. Like a nice, little bonus. Which says a lot for the core design of the game. It's been a LONG time since I've enjoyed a game purely for its raw gameplay and nothing else. I couldn't care less about the bugs or the main narrative because I'm having WAY too much fun shooting robo doggos in their faces.

In fact, writing this review made me wanna play the game again. <3

The game has nice graphics that can sometimes makes you easily get lost in the beautiful landscape. It also allow us to experience a bit about Sweden like their language and cultures. Ans I love the fact they allow us to change the character voice to Swedish which is rather rare among games these days.

But thats about it when it come to good thing about Generation Zero. Despite having massive landscapes, the place was rather empty. There is mob sometimes spawn here and there, but other than that there is not much else. Even though there are many houses and point of interest to explore. But most of them empty and not much else. Massive underground bunker with rooms that has nothing interest or interact with. Most of them just leads to nowhere and waste of your time. Despite been one of the ""Apocalypse Survival"" games, and there is plenty of food and drinks models, there is no survival element like hunger or thirst mechanics. A big waste of opportunity to introduce us to Swedish food culture. 

Next is gameplay. One would think since there is so little things you can do in single player, it must be a multiplayer focus game right? Unfortunately is not. Despite having an online multiplayer option, you are only limited to only 4 players(including yourself) at the same session. And there is issues as well. Those who join the session gets little to know experience point unless they have completed the same objective in their own session, which experience point are already hard to come by. Which is also an issue since they can zic zac across the map to complete your mission objective. While trigger all the events in game, and left it at that stage after they left. Which leave you out out most of what little content the game has to offer, and most importantly affect your game experience. Sure if your teammates are veteran player with powerful Experimental equipment, they can make encounters much easier. But it create a dilemma where new player want to play the game but veteran players have to wait for the newbies to catch-up, which not many players have the patience or time to do so. And boy power creeping is a serious issue in multiplayer. The weapons deal little to no damage unless you are using Experimental tier weapons, which only spawn after level 25. And since experience points are hard to come by, be prepared to grind for a long time. And game physics can sometime be really glitchy. With the new companion update, I've encounter way to many times my companion teleport right at me and launch me several meters into the air and make me suffer fall damage. Sometimes outright kill me. The vehicle is another glitchy object with stiff controls. Instead of having an interaction list of menu to do stuff like repair or refuel, the developer decides to have several interaction points to do them. This sometimes in a panic situation can really ruin your day. Next is the recovery items. I understand they try go for realism by manual pull out medpacks and manually activate to heal. But the process was slow and the healing are not done instantly which make the process tedious during intense gunfight. With much of the battle are done in open field, not everyone is fond of the process.

There is also the issue of game instability in multiplayer. I was at a session with a friend where we have to take on 4 Tanks, and dozens of Hunters and Runners. Since I have low tier weapons and low level, the fight was really hard. After been incapacitated dozens times and completely deplete my supplies. We managed to defeat all of them. And right where I was about to loot those ""dumma plåtburkar"". The game decides to CTD on me. I lost all my loots in that fight. This still happen after they have the hotfix on 24/7.  I have up to date gaming spec PC and game was run on moderated setting. And that is where I have my last straw. Seriously, ""fan det här spelet""...",1690263538,1690271022,False,5,2,0.521975278854370117,0,True,False,False

Let alone bugs which I only experience in this game out of a hundred or so in my library. 

If you buy all the DLC it is priced at or above a AAA title which it is not, they should consider rewarding players who bought and put time into the game (it is co-op after all) by making the game better and not fleecing the faithful with DLC cash grabs. If it were a free to play title with $$$ DLC, i would give this a recommend. But at full price they should make the game better before looking to add more to their bottom line.

Game difficulty it's terrible. Most enemies are just bullet sponges.
Too much grind with repetitive missions. You go somewhere, you kill some guys, maybe if you want you can wonder arround to loot 5 bags among 50 buldings (which are all  the same) and then you repeat in the other parts of the worldmap.
Intense grind, boring and dull + an annoying weight limit.
There are only 5 different enemies. ¡¡¡5!!! only 5. Minecraft has more than this. 

Combat (unless you are fighting less than 4 robots) It's spamming flares to avoid getting 5 shoted, or hiding inside any bulding (which are undestructible) and kiting them untill they die. 

Robots are beautiful, their desing is great and the map has some awesome details.

But apart from that, the rest it's boring and empty

Game it's not trash, or awfull. But it sure needs a lot more. Get this if it's in offer. When you played like 10h, you kinda seen it all.
---------------------------------
19/06/2023. Changed to positive
Difficulty still same piece of shit, still repetitive shit, weight limit still the same (this is the most annoying part still), combat against many enemies still the same (and a little worse 'cause flares don't last as much as they did).

The only good thing now is that i don't feel the game as grindy as it was. There are 3 new type of """"""enemies"""""" they also shoot other robots so they are kinda enemy kinda friendly.

Because devs didn't leave this game alone imma swap to positive, but still, what i said on the 1st review it's happening. 
And, there are some P2W DLC's. Very strong stuff behind a paywall (and more weapons also which sucks to add behind a paywall) 

And, still no MOD support. Dev's this game is awesome with mods, the lack of love you guys have, modders can add to it. Look at Arma 3 as an example 
------------------------

Still true,


The AI might still be trash, pretty dumb, and match the dev's marketing IQ, but WAIT, let's add more skins and p2w armor.


There are many pay2win DLC's. The new doggo has P2W armror DLC.

I like the game but the problems I'm currently having with hosting a MP session is, I'll have friends from the other side of the world that join off of me and not long after 10 to 15 minutes, they crash even if they have a stable connection. The other thing too is, friends are not able to fast travel to bases I currently capture on my end but they cannot see any of them on their map. They can only see the ones from what they've came across in the one play-through.

Here you have gorgeous landscapes with day and night and weather cycles and you could quite happily just wander about, looking at the views. You'd enter a few houses and marvel at the lovely detailed interiors (until you realise there's very little variation between them, like they all shopped at the same IKEA). Well, you might have gotten away with that if it hadn't been for all those excellently designed robots and their pesky robot dogs.
There's no lack of suspense and action, especially in all those creepy military bunkers. The main story missions have been overhauled and are now actually making sense, hurrah. The side-missions are still on the unimaginative side though - go here, get this, break that.
They have crammed in more NPCs, so my question is, why didn't they at the same time improve the human models, both players and props (corpses). Let's be brutally honest. I've seen more believable models in Fallout Las Vegas from 2010. The voice acting is also pretty dire, even in its native tongue. The next gripe would have to be the 1st person lock. With so many cosmetic options, why lock the game to 1st person? Oh yeah, because the player models look so bad.
What the game has though, aside from great scenery, is a great mayhem factor. Once you start to get geared - which is quite easy online nowadays since there are a lot of generous long time players who share their endgame wealth with their poor noob teammates - the player goes from prey to hunter and those bots are just for farming equipment. You begin to wonder how the robots even managed to overcome the national defense at all. Great animation on the robots too.

So, in summary, it's a game that will hold its own on the budget shelf. It is a great shame that they didn't/couldn't realise the potential of the game. It could have been so good but is just OK. I'd say it is good for a few 100 hours or so of playing before it's retired. Worth a go but only if bought on sale. Note: Don't bother with the weapons packs, they just either clog up your already sparse storage space and bring noting noteworthy to the game.

A steady stream of updates have fixed lots of the problem this game had at launch, and it is now (for the most part) an enjoyable experience. Sound and artwork are still excellent, machine design is fantastic, combat and sneaking mechanics are some of the best in class.

But.

The game is still riddled with bugs. Mission objectives that refuse to spawn, randomly taking fall damage on slopes, getting stuck in terrain etc. It's not gamebreaking, but bad enough to be a nuisance all the way through.

Story feels like an afterthought, tacked on and fails to engage despite some great background material. A lot of threads are left hanging when you finally run out of quests.

Voice acting ranges from hilariously 80's B-movie bad (which is quite enjoyable) to just... bad. 

After a full playthrough, this feels like a missed opportunity. It's a fantastic setup for a game that turns out to be just that - a fantastic setup, and little more. I will change my negative score to a positive one, because I did enjoy it. It just could have been so much better.",1585438570,1689719982,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is a stealth-action shooter that lets you explore a vast open world map inspired by the Swedish Cold War era, alone or with up to three friends in seamless co-op.

The game has a lot of things going for it: a stunning and atmospheric visual style, a great soundtrack that mixes synth-pop and ambient music, a dynamic and reactive world that changes with your actions, a loot system that lets you scavenge parts from enemies and craft equipment, weapons and ammunition, a base building feature that lets you fortify your own bases across the island, and a motorbike pack that lets you ride around the countryside in style.

The game also has a mysterious and intriguing story that unfolds through missions, documents, audio logs, and environmental clues. You have to piece together what happened to the people who lived there, what caused the robot uprising, and what secrets lie behind the machines. The game has two big story DLCs, Alpine Unrest and FNIX Rising, that add new regions, enemies, weapons, missions, and lore to the game.

The game is more fun when played with friends, as you can coordinate your tactics, share your resources, and explore the world together. The game has a multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can play the game together in co-op mode. The game also has received several updates and DLCs that have improved some aspects of the game and added new content.

Generation Zero is a game that offers a unique and immersive co-op shooter experience. It is a game that will appeal to fans of open world games, survival games, stealth games, and sci-fi games.

My review is from the perspective of NORMAL difficulty (I feel like higher difficulties would be the optimal way to play tbh but that's not what I chose at the start and I haven't tried yet) and I bought the bundle that includes the Alpine and FNIX expansions which means some content I mention might be from that.

Also, I grabbed it on sale but, genuinely, the tone of this review is considering full price as a non-issue towards my recommendation. It's really one of those ""It's worth it!... oh it's on sale? It's SUPER worth it then!"" kind of games.

Early game was REALLY interesting and fun because you don't know what the heck is going on. New types of bots are intimidating on a knowledge-check without any knowledge level, that's fun!

Then there is a period of ""I'm OP as heck and the robots DEFINITELY don't have any tricks up their sleeves :)"" which is fun for a bit then boring. The length of this period is playstyle dependent, if you explore a ton in the early areas and don't push quests it'll be a longer period than if you just did quests ASAP and explored ""later"".

THEN the game sorta just goes ""Hey, we were lying, there's like a lot of robot types we were hiding from you because you were a new player, here's a firebird drone and like 6 tanks and a millions dogs in one area"" and it becomes REALLY FUN again because the sense of being overpowered has lowered to a ""I feel reliable and competent"" level and all those fun toys you've been picking up but ignoring because a bullet does the job just fine become more viable since running and gunning isn't always the safest way to handle things- or at least ""doesn't feel like the safest way"" which is good enough in my opinion lol.

Cool stuff:

The setting is fun! Tossing a bunch of mega military bots into the late 80s plays out rather nicely. The game doesn't go 300% in on 80s nostalgia baiting it's just kind of a nice backdrop that comes up sometimes while looting and explains why we- the humans- feel overwhelmed by a robot force.

Fighting the bots is fun! Basically all robots are comprised of weakpoints, break-able weapons, and loads of armor- with ""stronger"" (higher class/rank) robots having additional armor and better protected weakpoints. What this generally adds up to is either lining up a really good shot on an unsuspecting robot that's accidentally showing you their fuel canister, or using armor piercing rounds to break off armor before switching (or not) to hollow point etc to do more damage to the weak points (but obviously less to armor). 

(cont) The robots aren't that smart and can be cheesed (my first harvester kill was actually a double harvester kill by hiding in a house lol) but they are almost all, from the imposing tank to the little tick, capable of melting you if you let them, which actually kind of feels right in this game. Like these aren't robots in the year 2035, it's 1989, they are basically big calculators with canister shell capabilities- so they don't handle hiding in a house from them too well but if they line up a shot you'll wish they didn't.

Plenty of skills to make a build out of. From what I've heard, and the little I've experienced, there are indeed ""bad"" skill choices, but with the advent of later expansion content, it doesn't seem all that hard to grind up the 5 uranium needed to respec. I mean I keep using mine on schematics and I have like 15 on hand if I ever decided to respec- and doing FNIX stuff rewards it I believe- it seems like something that used to be an issue that isn't anymore.

Due to how armor crafting works, you can wear whatever the hell you want. Basically, you'll find loads of cosmetic nonsense as you explore, from 3-D glasses to silly shoes, and sometimes they will have an armor stat on them- but whenever you try to craft armor you actually just pick one of the pieces you already have and put the effect you want on it. So if you find a jacket you like but it doesn't have the bullet resistance you want- just craft it in. Bam. Wear your silly outfit :)

Coop! So do all that and more with friends :)

Not cool stuff:

Coop apparently used to work how you'd expect- with both players getting all the same XP and even sharing quest progression so coop players going to their solo world would be on the same quest they left on in your world. You know. Good coop, like normal stuff, like most coop games, like drop in borderlands or something.
They changed that for whatever reason. It's really abnormally player hostile now and I do not know why.

(cont) NOW, the coop player doesn't get quest XP, and quests give a ton of XP. They also retain none of the progression- except for sometimes minorly bugging quests by having locations read as looted while a quest demands you loot said place thus making it so a coop player has to do the quest for them (and not get xp for it lol)- it's weird.

(cont) The end result is that if you want to coop, then you're likely going to be doing every quest twice. Once in your world, once in theirs, and more if more players are involved, because it's not uncommon for 2 new players to play for an hour and find player 1 at level 5 or 6 and player 2 still at level 1 with no skills to play with. It's just. WTF. lol.

Might genuinely be the only complaint I have in mind. Not that the game couldn't expand in more ways I'd enjoy; Just that I feel currently ill-equipped to talk on that and instead my list of complaints I've experienced is just ""Coop was janky for a bit until I played ahead of my buddy and just cooped with him exclusively since I'm cool with being the double playtime person"".

Not cool or uncool stuff:

It sounds like at one time resources were harder to get- perhaps normal difficulty or expansion content adjusted this but I am swimming in far too many bullets for every weapon while some guide video content from as recently as last year claim ammo is rare. The surplus definitely makes things easier, but I have still found encounters where I ended a large scale fight with nearly no ammo on me- in part because of weight limits demanding I not just carry my thousands of rounds at all times, but still relevant.

But yeah, it's a bit silly to hear tips regarding ammo scarcity while I have over 100 rockets for my rocket launcher and thousands of ammo for my rifle, pistol, and shotgun. I think I'd have genuinely liked more scarcity- but perhaps it's difficulty related.


I recommend the game. I think it's fun and has a unique feel to it by virtue of the enemies they decided to go with.

It's really fun coop, got almost all the bells and whistles you'd like for that- a way to make spawn points for them to teleport to in the field, skills that can work off each other, tools that benefit from cooperation like setting traps and lures, and even instanced loot so you're not stepping on each other's toes AND you can give each other stuff you don't want. It's really just the quest XP thing making it annoying at low level where XP differences are so extremely noticeable and one player gets to have fun faster for no good reason.

Oh, as of this post I'd say going all the way down the Engineer tree isn't worth it. The Ticker thing sounds cool, but doesn't feel worth it at all. They weigh a hefty chunk and do seemingly nothing to anything stronger than an unarmored dog.

I heard grumbles about Hacker, but I actually like it from my play. In a solo environment it's just nice to sit way back and fry their brains so they go shooting each other and you just watch until the looting begins. Definitely cost effective, if slow and not as directly beneficial as some other specializations lol",1689427856,1689427856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Worth the discount price so far. Needs a LOT of polish. Has the potential to be a great game.

I've encountered numerous bugs so far, these are the ones that were repetitive: getting stuck near terrain, enemy's velocity increasing randomly, when I get knocked down from a hit I will become permanently ragdolled until I settle on a flat surface and can still take damage and die if this happens, containers and random textures spawning over top of each other.

Enemy AI needs a LOT of work. 
AI will frequently get stuck in a loop where they might fire infinitely at a  single spot, dance back and forth between two points and do nothing else, stand still for 10 minutes and let you kill them, etc.

Needs a lot more enemy and weapon/gadget types added to base game to be worth the undiscounted asking price.

Level/perk system is pretty bland and feels unimpactful.

There are many common QoL (quality of life) features that are simply missing from the game.
e.g. There's no excuse not to add details to the weapon mod descriptions so the player knows what they do and how they differ from each other.

Despite these complaints I have enjoyed several aspects of the game so far including world design, some of the main mission quests, (arguably) the voice acting, distinct character personalities, multiplayer base defense missions.

The skills tree points given are reasonable as after reaching a certain level you could just reset and get the perks that apply to you near the end game.

Als das Game 2019 rauskam, wurde es allgemein wegen der vielen Bugs gehasst – die sind inzwischen gefixt und der Spielspass ist enorm. 

Die Story spielt in einer Parallelversion des kalten Kriegs in den frühen Achtzigern, schon bei der Titelmelodie fühlt man sich an Stranger Things erinnert. Du kommst nach einem Ausflug nach Hause und musst feststellen, dass alle tot sind. Ermordet von Robotern, die eigentlich zum Schutz vor der bösen Sowjetunion konstruiert wurden, dann aber anfingen, Amok zu laufen. Der ewige schwedische Herbst mit Sonnenschein und Schneetreiben begleitet dich durch eine mysteriöse Story mit sehr, sehr viel Geballer. 

Dabei fällt auf, dass es keine Superwaffen oder Superrüstungen gibt wie in anderen Shootern. Statt dessen ist Nachdenken gefragt, Fallenstellen und Herumtricksen. Dazu kommt fleissiges Looten und Craften, um den Munitionsvorrat wieder aufzufüllen. Seit ein paar Monaten hab ich mit 3 Freunden einen Riesenspass damit.

If you pay attention you can discover the stories of survivors scattered all around you, and not the kind that are explained by a sidequest or some left behind text log, its just there in the environment for those who look.

  For example, one I found early on starts at a farmstead where survivors fortified their farm and set up a sleeping area in the upstairs of the barn for the fleeing neighbors.  The house was overrun (bulletholes, overturned furnitue, blood marks etc..) and the defenders fled to the beach (if you look for it you can find a patchy blood trail and tread marks) and boarded a boat, from there they went directly across the bay to a pier at the base of a hill (you find a boat with blood stains and 'remains').  Nearby was a military base that unbenownst to them was also being overrun.  Just up the hill from the pier where they landed is a small camp with a makeshift guard tower a few plywood barricades and a burn pit where they made their last stand.  Unfortunately the machines found this too and the last of the farmers and military escapees bodies can be found on the battlements along with some dead machines and bullet holes.  

None of this is marked, there is no quest or rewards, its just a story told by the environment of the final days of a handful of survivors.  These little stories are EVERYWHERE for those who care to look.

I humbly write to you today with a heavy heart, burdened by the profound disappointment and betrayal that has befallen me while enduring the wretchedness of Generation Zero. As a faithful disciple, I find it difficult to comprehend how such a pitiful creation could exist in a world that yearns for artistic excellence and meaningful experiences.

Let us begin by discussing the gameplay, or rather, the lack thereof. Generation Zero presents itself as an open-world survival game set in a post-apocalyptic landscape, but its execution is nothing short of an exercise in monotony and frustration. The world is vast and desolate, yes, but it is devoid of purpose and substance. The gameplay loop revolves around repetitive missions and mind-numbing encounters with uninspired enemies, offering no depth or meaningful progression. It is an empty husk of gameplay, lacking the engaging mechanics and captivating challenges that should accompany such a setting.

The narrative, if it can even be called that, is a feeble attempt at storytelling. Generation Zero's plot is as vague as a riddle, leaving players grasping at straws to uncover any semblance of a coherent story. The characters are devoid of personality or motivation, rendering them forgettable and inconsequential. It is disheartening to witness a game that fails to evoke any emotional investment or intellectual stimulation, for it is through these elements that narratives can truly flourish and impact our souls.

Visually, Generation Zero is an eyesore, a desecration of the potential beauty that can be achieved in the realm of video games. The environments lack the attention to detail and artistic finesse that make virtual worlds come alive. The textures are bland and uninspired, the character designs devoid of any charm or originality. It is as if the developers forgot that visual aesthetics have the power to transport us to wondrous realms and ignite our imagination. Instead, they settled for a drab and lifeless representation that insults the very essence of artistry.

Avalanche Studios, the studio responsible for this abomination, has misled players with false promises and empty marketing. They presented Generation Zero as a captivating multiplayer experience set in a unique and immersive world, but what they delivered is a soulless husk of broken promises. It is an affront to see a game that shamelessly borrows ideas from superior titles without adding anything innovative or distinctive of its own. The lack of originality and creativity is an insult to both the gaming community and the divine gifts of inspiration and imagination.

dear Jesus, I implore you to steer clear of Generation Zero, for it is a profane mockery of the profound and transformative power that video games can possess. It fails to honor the principles of artistic integrity and authentic creativity, instead opting for banality and mediocrity. I beseech you to guide your followers towards experiences that embrace innovation, meaningful storytelling, and the true essence of art, for Generation Zero is a lamentable testament to the fallibility of human endeavor.

Yours in disappointment,

I went to attack a lvl2 rival fnix class, harvester in the forrest region in one of the massive towns at threat level 9 and got trapped in a tiny house with only 3 ways to return fire by 6 apocalypse class hunters probably another 4 fnix hunters at least 10 fnix runners 3 seekers and a fnix tank plus a hoard of military class stuff too i didnt have time to count and after about 25-30 minuets of fighting the rival, hunters, runners and everyone else i ran out of ammo for all my guns and they wouldn't stop coming every hunter i took out more just came to replace it, i even had to make a last ditch effort with a bat! Ive played generation to the point where i cant get any of the main missions done because my threat level is to high from doing the other missions and i get mobbed whenever i get spotted, other then that large issue, its got some pretty decent gun handling a lot of the robots do an absurd amount of damage per shot like fnix hunters do 35 dmg roughly per shot and fire 6 shots enough to one clip you. Id recommend it IF you play with others or are very patient to wait for the robots to stop looking in your direction and be sneaky like other wise its going to get very hard late game.


40 hours of game play later, its still an ABSOLUTE s**t fight, the new flying bots are the biggest thorn in my side since dark sky's went live, they spot you from over 400m (even with all the camo skills) and they can hit you through walls for up to 40 dmg and what does my 40mm rocket do? Tickles the f**ker, it takes 29 4 crown RLG hits (dlc) just to bring it down to 45% its absurd they deal so much damage and all we can do is scratch the paint. you can no longer cover away and peek fire on those flying sky hippos, even running in the open is no longer safe cause the mines they s**t out everywhere like a seagull with diarrhoea, if you see one before they see you, f**k right off... just f**k off and leave it alone cause it will curb stomp you and piss on your corpse from the sky (metaphorically of course). ive knocked them out of the sky with EMPs only for them to get back up after a few seconds sit eye level with me and dump enough rounds at me to make a a10 jealous before f**king off into the sky again.

Right from the start, you're in the bath, it's dark, not a sound, no one around, no help comes. You are alone. Weak clues, bullet holes, a machine still smoking and not far the body of a police officer.

The adventure begins or rather hell.

Generation Zero is an open-world survival game. You are free to do what you want once the tutorial is finished, which is still part of the main story.

The rather mysterious context at the start becomes clearer as you progress, your country is at war against an unknown enemy, superior in number and technologically more advanced. You are alone but not for long, a resistance is created and it fights this invasion.

A vast map is offered to you, you are taken in hand in spite of everything by the mission orders gleaned as you go. But you are free to do the missions as you see fit, even if a specific order allows you to understand the dark story that will open up to you in the right conditions.

If you have played The hunter call of the wild you will not be out of place, the map follows the same principle, you discover main and secondary missions, places to visit that are part of the story, or places just to discover for recover loot and or hidden objects, bosses and refuges and bases (which serve as spawn points) in the event of death or fast travel.

Speaking of bases, you have the possibility if you earn enough threat points in a region to build an outpost, which will also serve as a refuge. You can build defensive structures there like walls, spikes and traps, a network of turrets of different types too. As well as furniture for crafting. From time to time depending on the progress of the conflict, you will have to defend your base against 4 successive waves of enemies, success grants you new structures.

The general atmosphere is superb, very oppressive and realistic, you also have the changes in the weather quite well done, making your task more difficult. The sound part is really well done.

The environment is very pretty with a rather coherent variety of decors, plain, mountain, lakes, fields, the little black dot is the buildings, there is not really a great variety, just variants (shape, color ).

The story is frankly intense and the feeling of loneliness is present, but it takes another turn if you play 4 in coop, you apprehend the war in another way. Either way, whether solo or in co-op, go headlong is a waste of time, the opponents are formidable even in the most affordable levels.

Oh! I almost forgot the most important, Sweden suffered an unprecedented attack, an army of ultra-sophisticated robots sows death and chaos, the army is powerless, the police are powerless and only a handful of lucky people have survived. You are your nation's last hope.


The only downside in this game is that there is no AI to accompany you on your journey. We don't always have a few friends on hand to play it.

Nevertheless, the game's unique theme, although occasionally perplexing, adds to its charm and allure.

The reason I chose the thumbs down because:
- Poor story-wise (they're short, literally)
- Short supply of weaponry (most are DLCs)
- Unseeable enemies (some players tend to see enemies in which you cannot see in your perspective view)
- Stuckable environment (I got stuck on a corner of a tank at the beginning of the game while crouching around the corner)
- Non-crouchable/prone-able areas (standing between a wall and container, for example, doesn't let you crouch nor prone)
- Players cannot vault small objects, such as fences (seriously, after all this update and DLCs, they didn't add this!)
- Enemies dealt alot more damage to you, no matter the difficulty scaling (Solo alone in easy difficulty still gives you alot of damage)
- Being overencumbered doesn't let you fast travel (Even if you only have sprint disabled, you still cannot fast travel)
- Maximum storage capacity is dissappointing-ly short (400 isn't enough, while the resource gets 500? You do know the materials weigh less than other else? They weigh no more than 0.1! Guns weigh no less than 2, and special weapons weigh almost no less than 6! Just to add this up: EVERYTHING IN YOUR STORAGE WEIGHS TOGETHER, FROM GUNS TO AMMO TO GRENADES!)
- Enemies have TOO. MUCH. KNOCKBACK POWER. (An enemy missile can send you ragdoll up in the air, causing your character to SLOWLY get up...while being shot by other mechs before you're able to react to them!)
- Even though the loots are RNG, most weapons appear more often than others (I...didn't get this one DLC weapon during every loot. It just never appeared, as if it's gone in the game.)
- No enemy scaling, depending on how many players there (If you're by yourself, they won't short out the enemies for you. You'll have to fight an army BY YOURSELF.)
- Enemy counters in missions are soft-locked (If a mission says that you should kill 3 Hunters, and you did...that mission is bugged. Players can help you on your missions, yes. But! If players shoot the targets down, it doesn't count. The developers didn't even tend to fix this as well...)


Sad, really. This game has alot of potential! It's too bad that the developers didn't even fix the issues in the game. How many? Oh, about...20-30 issues that I've found, so far? (including the above as well)",1688513360,1688513360,False,1,0,0.497001200914382935,0,True,False,False

Many of the locations are the same assets completely void of anything to shoot, just random boxes that each contain 7 bullets and a simple medkit. Its even worse when exploring one of the bunkers, just huge empty tunnels with the same looking rooms. Guns are identical besides how many stars they have. Robots with a simple swarm AI that can range from annoying to baby easy.

I played this years ago before this review and it was pretty bare, I returned recently and found they had added base building but I couldnt do much of it as the resource collecting was added in some time during my break and I had almost nothing to build with. There's some base defense missions you could replay, I can see the fun in testing your buildings against waves of robots but I didnt get to experience it.

The combat is the same as it was years ago. Enemies spot you from far away if not sneaking and can take an entire clip or just a few rounds depending which component you hit, luckily I somehow found an experimental rifle and sniper that melts enemies but when fighting large squads and hunters and dogs, it still gets annoying. Idk if it was just the regions I was exploring but all the guns I came across were identical; the pump action shotty, hunting rifle, 7 round pistol.

Can't swim, AI is linear so they make it harder by giving you multiple types, and quantity of enemies. 

The other downside is a majority of the skill trees are useless. Hacking sounds cool... its not just trust me. I hacked 3 tanks and just... no. They don't join forces or wipe out the enemy super fast. They don't emp or blow up after. They just shoot a few rounds into random enemies and then turn on you. So unless you're using it as a distraction to lay down canisters or something. Sort of pointless skill. OHHH and you have to do hacking with binoculars cause no other scope in teh game can do it. So you can't even aim hack, shoot in one motion.

Every single person I've seen so far play this game either uses a rocket/grenade launcher or an assault rifle. Thats it... no snipers, no pistol, or submachine guns. So ignore those and push for assault rifle as its the most viable to sustain from beginning.  So save yourself time on that if you play.

The voice acting is so bad... but i have to overlook that as its probably just people they know or cheapest voice actors they could afford to hire at the time. So just stick that one out, and accept that it's ok. 

My biggest disappointment is the fact i can't build anywhere on the map, just specific locations. They did this probably to control glitching and terrain mesh map errors. At the same time though, that small things don't bother me. Plus building is insanely expensive.... like INSANE to build a small defense base. Especially at the start!! So bases are cool feature, but sorta of dumb until you get late game. Again the AI attacking is stupid so its sort of fish in a barrel most of the time. 

Want it to be a great game... Improve AI and give each unit different tactics based on how many of that type unit there are. Lower cost of base building and expand options for defense (maze walls, smoke screens, decoy targets, turrets). Balance all the guns, ammo types and skill trees better. Give each gun a skill tree, give each skill tree a balance perk so you can take on a horde of enemies based on that (minus healer its actually really balanced as it is, and in a group its solid *id maybe add crafting perk to this tree for making kits or adrenaline(or just crafting skill tree in general). 

I like playing the game... i don't like playing it solo as much. It's almost a really fun game but needs some refinement. Don't give up on it until its perfect.

Weapon selection is fine. Not sure why melee is here, tho.
Game makes you think about positioning, how to approach certain enemies and stuff like that.

Weapons can use more balancing tho. Experimental .50 cal rifle overpowers any existing weapon by a wide margin. Other stuff might need some serious buff.

Also, DLC weapons can have some experimental versions too. I hope.

19 Hour Review
For anyone wanting to play casually to check out the story. the game still is not in a good state. 
If you are a long range players, the guns seem to have RNG on bullet placement. 
the game still has a lot of bugs for a title that has been out as long as this one has.
Terrian glitches, Machines can see your through the hills. AI respawn on top of you at times.
AI bugs, Machines can become perma aggroed on you no matter how far away you get.
DO NOT PICK UP THE DLC IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER! With all the bugs i decided to switch the difficulty down from the normal ""skimisher"" to Easy ""adventurer"" All seemed normal until i went to do a side quest. I get to the location at player level 8. The game marks 5 prototype runners to kill. But the area is populated with 5 prototype runners, 4 military runners, 5 FINX runners, 2 prototype hunters , 3 millitary hunters, 3 FINX hunters, and 2 Radioactive Hunters. This was on adventure difficulty WTF.

Edit: After putting 50+ hours in the game I have to admit it's very frustrating to play. Multiplayer is so laggy it's kind of a waste of time. Solo play can be impossible at times because you'll face 10+ foes at the same time. Sometimes it's even more than that upwards of 30+. Multiplayer has some experience issues also. The resource grind is a bit tedious. Crafting certain things is difficult due to the scarcity of things like textiles. Base defense is a joke mode and having things capped behind annoying things like base assaults for apparel points means you really don't get to build any armor. Skill points are capped and certain parts of the skill tree are locked behind skills that have absolutely no use to you.

Each robot has weak spots that can be hit for extra damage to that type of robots. The higher the classes (apocalypse type being the most difficult and strongest of all) are much harder to beat which is a great concept as it stops the game from becoming too easy with the same basic type robots, all classes have different weapon variations so you're always on your feet.

This however I feel like is also a bad thing as I have struggled to find any guide in game or on the internet that goes up to my standards. I feel like this should be in the game, It may also be in the game but I just failed to find it which would not be hard to believe. 
But I feel like this is a basic concept that you must learn and the game should give you access to it, the only variation of this I have come across is graffiti on some houses which show the weaknesses but they are not detailed nearly enough to give you a good concept, I'm not saying it should be confusing but having a detailed picture of the robots from all 3 angles with detailed diagrams (like a sentence or less) of where to aim and what to avoid aiming at would be the perfect addition. 

Aside from this I feel like this is such an under appreciated game, once you have unlocked a safe house you can fast travel to it (as long as you're inventory is not overflowing [Over burdened]).

This game could be really good with friends as it would make things so much easier and to kill certain robots much faster.

9/10 game would highly recommend at least for you to watch 1-2 game play videos to see if it's for you (or if there is a future free weekend planned for this game or a demo you can play, try it out!)",1687974959,1687974959,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

-weapons are fun and can be found across the map
-said map is big (my jaw dropped opening the map, you start on an island thats already big but theres a whole main island like 10x bigger)
-enemies are challenging and unique
-loot everywhere
-fun character customisation with clothes you can find across the map
-funky music
-really nice graphics

Cons:
-questionable ai
-lots of re-used assets
-janky physics
-awful vehicles
-NPC's are stiff and the voice acting is... okay.
-NPC's never help you directly and have a case of teleportation fever
-frequent crashes
-saving system is horrendous (coming from major half life fan)
-feels like a walking simulator at times
-No having sex with swedish robots

overall fun game if you can overlook some pet peeves, like this one time i lured 3 of the hardest beginner enemies and took them out with a rpg and everything was flying everywhere. 6/10

Edit:
after playing some more, i've figured out some stuff.
-saving system isn't bad actually, just a bit annoying in early game.
-graphics are still REALLY good for the lowest available 
-the two robot factions fighting is really cool
-robots are SCARY. SCARRY.
-overall better the longer you play

Mind you, I was scavenging pretty much every building and structure, doing the missions and quite a few of the side missions, and upgrading most of my equipment.

A Runner spots me, then suddenly all hell breaks lose as 6 Hunters, 2 tanks, and a few dozen Runners start charging at me from just about every direction. Despite all my equipment, I still manage to struggle against one Hunter, which I thought was normal difficulty scaling. I thought that for the first two islands, I'd be having to sneak to survive, and eventually I'll find some proper anti-armor weapons to make dealing with them easier.

Overall score: 7/10
Short descriptions: Action-packed, scary at moments, story driven but the story isn't forced, small community, no mods, not realistic (some things break immersion), enjoyable etc.

You are very free when you play this game. You can do what you want and you are not pushed to do the main story which is nice. The main story is kind of.... well you're fighting robots in 1989 and these robots look, move and act more advanced than what we have today in real life....""""POSSIBLE SPOILER BUT IT SHOULDN'T BREAK ANY IMMERSION""""  The breaker is that these robots are made by humans... Also the mission in which credits roll aka the last mission also has some questionable behaviors in it. The community of this game is also pretty small and well lets just say that I got disappointed when I tried searching for a Strv 103 (swed tank) mod. On the other hand the game is very interesting and it kept me playing until I completed it. Voice acting is good and I was discovering the lore piece by piece. I loved the game and I would recommend it to any FPS enjoyer. If you're a fan of Terminator I would recommend this game over Terminator: Resistance even tho this game has nothing to do with Terminator... 
One of the reasons why the score isn't higher is because DLC's cost a LOT and do not add much of value. You will come across these robot Data centers and Outposts and you will not be able to destroy them or interact with them in any way... After you complete the story line the game becomes very boring and from a few glitches it really does not come up to my expectations.",1645490004,1687604567,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The good news: the robot fights are extremely satisfying. Getting cornered by a couple of tanks and a swarm of hunters is pretty exhilarating with proper cover and enough ammo. Night-time fights are especially beautiful, with the landscape illuminating under heavy machinegun fire, explosions, and general mayhem. Sound design is also pretty dang good. Hearing the clicks, whirs, ominous sirens, and booming thunks of robots moving around you is suspenseful, and the gunfire sounds great too.

The okay news: Much of the content is designed for coop multiplayer. While you *can* play solo, you're going to be missing out on some of the core later game content, as even with plenty of points in your defensive abilities you get rapidly shredded by enemies in base assaults or base defense scenarios. Base defense was especially disappointing as a solo player, as the ""tower defense"" style gameplay sounded really exciting, but the EXTREMELY limited number of turrets you can place are overwhelmed even on the easiest difficulty and you just lack the proper firepower to take on the bigger swarms without help. With another player or two, however, things get considerably more fun.

The bad news: Monotony. There just isn't a whole hell of a lot to do in this game. There aren't a wide variety of guns, there aren't a wide variety of enemies, and there aren't a wide variety of activities. After you've killed the biggest baddies the game has to offer several times over, it's hard to find the motivation to keep playing. I think this game's best chance at longevity would be investing a lot more into the base building and defense systems. If I could find and rescue survivors, build a proper large scale base, manage the basic needs of the people in my camps, give them jobs, create better defenses, and enable regional bonuses and benefits based on my decisions (think something along the lines of Fallout 4's settlements) it would go a long, long way towards giving me motivation to keep going out and killing robots. You need something to fight FOR and fight TOWARDS. Otherwise, monotony is what kills you in the end.

All in all, I would recommend the game -- especially if you can get it on sale and have a friend or two to play with. While monotony settles in fairly quickly, that first 30 hours or so of gameplay is a ton of fun.",1687290122,1687290122,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Either change ""Guerrilla Mode"" or have an ADDITIONAL DIFFICULTY that is identical to Gueriilla Mode -- EXCEPT THAT:

Player damage is not reduced. 


Why? 

It gets really tiring shooting a robot over and over and over and over again. It gets really boring and tiring really quick to dump entire inventories of bullets into a robot and not have it die, ... but the robot and end the player in a few short bursts. 

Make it a fair playing field. 

The  robots are fast, deadly, and can 'wipe' the player really really quickly. 

But the player can 'wipe' the robots quickly, too -- with some well placed rockets, a well-timed volley of rifle bullets, etc. The robots should die at approximately the same rate as they would in less difficulties - and the game should progress and feel like it's 'going somewhere' rather than spending 10 freaking minutes fighting _one_ robot, ... shooting it in the same place over and over again, waiting for it to die due to artificially upped HP. 

You can say you are just ""reducing"" player damage -- but you are really doing is just giving robots more hit points. It is literally the same difference. Reducing playing damage just makes the guns feel like ""NERF"" weapons. They don't feel powerful or like they have any punch.

That is ONLY suggestion I would make:   Make it so the robots are -killable- at higher levels and that the player weapons feel like they have some 'punch' to them. The player should be REWARDED for sneaking up or using good tactics. ...

Because right now -- the players pends however much time and effort 'sneaking' up onto a robot -- only for it to always turn into an endless slug fest that just takes forever. 

Literally my only complain: the duration and 'spongy' feeling of the robots at higher difficulty is highly irritating.",1662508494,1687033096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The map is large (almost too large for the amount of content) and safe houses/fast travel are a must to maintain sanity. The game is in what I would call a completed state. It takes about 50 hours to 100% the game if you are using an online map for collectible locations (essentially a must).

The enemy leveling against you seems to be slightly broken. Around level 30 the enemies take a LARGE step up in difficulty that doesn't seem to match the player. I started a new character on the same world and the enemies still seemed to be leveled against my main character - I was getting destroyed for a while. I'm not sure how this system works but it still needs some tweaks. 

Game runs great on ultra 1080 and the world looks great too. I had a few dropped frame moments during large explosions but even when there were 20+ enemies fighting against me I had 100+ FPS.

The bad: Confusing map. Inventory is awful, trying to find something in the heat of battle means you'll end up dead.

The ugly: DLC items. You expect them for every character in your game, whether new or already created, but no. It's like a set of items for whatever character gets them first.

  The enviroment is impressive, lot of beautiful and calming scenery, big respect for adding details when we walk on the grass it will fall off. The ambience is on point for a survival game. Character voice actor did a great job for their acting, loved it! Guns is cool, had a realistic model and sound, you definetly gonna love the gunfight :3
  Game also offer base building after you capture the enemy base first, loved the base building you will be given a large area to build your own comfy base.

tak
Czy jest nudny?
NIE!
Mam zaliczone w tej grze już ponad 180 godzin z czego 35 na Steam. Więc czas na małe podsumowanie. Zaczniemy od największej ""wady"" gry czyli że jest pusta.
Jest i to jest jej największa zaleta. Jest to świat po czystce, i to czuć. Puste ulice, porzucone samochody. wraki i z rzadka trupy tylko potęgują poczucie osamotnienia i przerażenia. Widać i czuć że zostałeś jednym z ostatnich ludzi na wyspie i tylko masz nadzieję że to nie przeniosło się na kontynent.
Walka z robotami to walka o przetrwanie ale i o zemstę. Gdy widzisz co one zrobiły z ludźmi i dowiadujesz się dlaczego to nawet po zakończeniu misji fabularnej wracasz po to aby jeszcze raz dokopać maszynom.
Grafika jest fenomenalna. Czuć jesień i początki zimy przez niemal cały czas. Gdy pada śnieg to niemal czuć ten ziąb a gdy świeci słońce masz ochotę usiąść na ławce i ogrzać się na słońcu póki jest. 
Udźwiękowienie jest fenomenalne. Gdy tylko słychać wroga można bez pudła zgadnąć gdzie i nie ma znaczenia czy na słuchawkach czy na tanim systemie 5.1. Bogactwo dźwięków otoczenia sprawia że muzyka jest tu całkowicie zbędna. 
Poza tym ten świat wciąż  żyje. kiedyś to był świat po czystce, teraz widać że ludzie już drugi raz próbowali odbić wyspę z rąk robotów.

minusy.
w sumie chyba tylko jeden. Generyczne domy i bunkry. Są powtarzalne. Owszem można wytłumaczyć to tym że taka moda i taki kraj bo mam wrażenie że tu był ustrój totalitarny albo podobny a więc jedna linia myśli, ta poprawna. Mimo to przydałby się więcej modeli.


Is the game world empty?
 yes
 Is it boring?
 NO!
 I have over 180 hours in this game, 35 of which are on Steam. So it's time for a little recap. We'll start with the biggest ""flaw"" of the game, which is that it's empty. It is and this is its greatest advantage. This is a world after purge, and you can feel it. Empty streets, abandoned cars. wrecks and the occasional corpse only intensify the sense of loneliness and terror. You can see and feel that you became one of the last people on the island and you just hope that it didn't spread to the mainland. The fight against robots is a fight for survival but also for revenge. When you see what they did to people and find out why, even after completing the story mission, you come back to kick the machines one more time. The graphics are phenomenal. You can feel autumn and the beginning of winter almost all the time. When it snows, you can almost feel the chill, and when the sun is shining, you feel like sitting on a bench and warming up in the sun while it's still there. The sound is phenomenal. As soon as you hear the enemy, you can guess where, and it doesn't matter if you're wearing headphones or a cheap 5.1 system. The richness of ambient sounds makes music completely redundant here. Besides, this world is still alive. once it was a world after purge, now you can see that people tried to retake the island from the hands of robots for the second time. minuses. probably only one. Generic houses and bunkers. They are repetitive. Yes, it can be explained by the fact that such a fashion and such a country because I have the impression that here was a totalitarian system or similar, so one line of thought, the correct one. Still, more models would be nice.",1640687650,1686737486,True,9,1,0.642004787921905518,0,True,False,False

I want to make sure you understand I like this game, what I'm about to complain about are things that I think others would also find problematic or long term issues... With that in mind there are some issues I and those I play have run into.  Our biggest complaint and issue is storage.  After about 100 hours in a single game if your are anally looting everything there will be little room in either your main loot storage or the recycling stations storage.  The Recycler stores what is broken down into its base resources that can be used to make items through crafting and for building various control point bases throughout the map. 
 However, as I mentioned above if your looting everything there is little to craft, You'll be throwing ammo away because you cant break anymore down, even if you and your group is specialize who uses what ammo to maximize space.  You'll be throwing away weapons because it's not worth the weight to only discard what they get broken down into anyway.  Most the the craftables are lootable so why craft them if my storage is over flowing with them?  Collecting and breaking down things at a pace that is far exceeding your usage fills storage that only holds 500 kilos AFTER you fully upgrade it.   Base building at the control points only works so well.  Even then, requires different resources then your typically collecting to build.  I know Base building was intended to offset this effect.  However when last I looked I had over 20k explosive(bullet crafting) after tossing 15k with still little room for the lumber and cement required to build or upgrade those bases.   Many items also require 10 of said item to break down which weight a kilo a piece which end up tossed.  Unfortunately those same items are also required to make various items in the later tree of the crafting lists so some might be compelled to save.   You can see why this became the most frustrating situation. 

Other minor issues are hick-ups in graphics(floating trees faces disappearing etc.), and multiplayer game connections and syncing issue (that have apparently been addressed in updates, that haven't played because of above mentioned storage issue) seems like a seriously lack of ""people"".  Even though you see a few that just stand around saying they are going to help but never ""help"".  The constant base defense and attack missions are as repetitive as Fallout 4's save the settlement missions become.  While initially entertaining, become repetitive and monotonous, with success not meaning anything long lasting just rewards of more resources you cant store. 

Now I know I'm complaining a lot here. But the game loop of exploring Sweden's archipelago in the 1980's while hunting and avoid robots of varying sizes abilities shapes and load-outs is fantastic.  The graphics on whole are wonderful.  Those I play and I have commented on wondering if this is how it actually looks there cause there are some beautiful vista's and fjords to blow stuff up on.  The grass reacts to those passing through so you can use it to track if so inclined.  The characters are a little clunkie looking initially but your not looking at them in the long run.   It's Fun clearing the houses and buildings throughout the islands.  running and hiding while launching rockets, grenades, bullets, hacks, or what ever other goodies you've plundered, is hours of fun.

I would like to remind you that this is a ""stealth-action shooter"" not just a typical co-op shooter, which I think would have worked better for the type of game design its going for. For someone who really likes to see what unique a different types of survival games, creators can come up with, Generation Zero is unfortunately not worth my time. 

Ill pass, but someone might find enjoyment with Generation Zero.

First hour of the game its literally you go from point a to point b using a pistol with virtually unlimited ammo because they gave you so much of it and on the way you occasionally shoot robo-dog but it doesnt feel rewarding because its too easy and  the loot is just more ammo and health kit not like parts you can loot to make your own bot or at least you can sell them to a black market for money.

Should also mention a few other things, like the completely unbalanced and limited skill tree (some of the skills literally don't work) way too large map, very small enemy variety of fighting the same 4 robots everywhere you go (INCLUDING the new russian bots, there are a total of 9 different types of robots in this game. only NINE, which you will all meet in the first 10 hours of gameplay). Map is also way too big, it takes ages to get anywhere and when you get there its almost always the exact same thing as the place you came from. Also it takes forever to loot since if you wanna strike even and get more stuff you need to loot for AGES at a time, going through identical Bunkers/Homes/Farmsteads. 80% of the missions make me wanna fall asleep, literally ""ride bike for 10 min to faraway place. Loot it for meager amounts of loot. repeat for half the missions in game."" Also the story is just so random. at one point I'm fighting off some Rival Tank to help out these survivors and then all of a sudden the antagonist starts talking over the radio out of nowhere like what?? I'm not even doing anything related to it at the moment, and it's not even talking to the survivors im trying to help, it's talking to some random farm girl you help in the first 20 minutes of the game who is basically ignored after you meet the survivor camp.(btw none of the different survivors will interact with each other, they will basically only talk to you even if they all basically have the same goal of kicking out the robots.)",1686447569,1686448929,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I still think Gen Z is falling short of its potential, but I don't have any really serious complaints anymore.  The DLC monetization scheme is still garbage, but at least the DLC aren't expensive, and you can choose which content you want.

Edit: Thanks to the new update I get to watch 2 cassette rollers spin forever. And before all of that enemies were still glitching through walls, inventory changing irreversible when moving them around, etc. 

Was loving this game but these bugs have become too much.....enemies keep glitching through walls and whatever else and get trapped in houses wherever you are and can still hurt you...the spider robots once they leap at you, no matter how far away they are from you they still end up getting you somehow...i ran around corner and this thing just floated around and hit me like it was tethered to me. and about 2-3 from these little things bring you to about 10HP and then it takes a good amount of shooting to destroy them...the dog robots either spot you a mile away or not at all.... every other time i throw a flare or firework it disappears in the game essentially wasting it....these seem like issues that should have never made it past Beta but here we are.

Generation Zero offers an immersive and thrilling open-world experience. Its atmospheric setting, set in a post-apocalyptic Sweden, is visually stunning. The cooperative gameplay adds a layer of excitement as you and your friends strategize and overcome challenging encounters. The mix of exploration, survival, and intense combat makes it an engaging and rewarding adventure.

Pros:

1: Unique setting in an alternate 1980s Sweden, offering a fresh and intriguing atmosphere.
2: Beautiful and immersive open-world environment with stunning visuals and dynamic weather effects.
3: Co-op gameplay allows for enjoyable multiplayer experiences with friends.
4: Interesting premise of battling hostile machines in a post-apocalyptic world.
5: Wide range of weapons and equipment for customization and strategy.
6: Atmospheric soundtrack that enhances the immersion.

Cons:

1: Repetitive mission structure that can feel monotonous over time.
2: Lackluster enemy AI that can lead to predictable and less challenging encounters.
3: Steep learning curve and lack of proper tutorial or guidance for new players.

Not only are there several unique enemies, they also have an incredibly complex and thought through damage model. Every fight is different and tactics and knowledge are crucial. Everytime you beat a machine that is not a tick or runner, you feel a sanse of accomplishement (not only because there is a lot of looot). 
The open world is huge, and looks stunning. With the subtle music and background noises the atmosphere is always tense, and the sound design makes the machines always sound incredibly dreadful, even when they are only walking along. My favourite example are the tanks, when they walk a very loud and metallic rhytmic thumping is played which sounds very fear-inducing.
All in all Generation Zero is an incredible game, and you can really see the developers put a lot of effort in, even 4 years after release.

* You destroy robots, which is very satisfying
* A large map
* you can team up with up to 3 friends or anti-friends
* explosions
* [spoiler]The reaper and experimental weapons[/spoiler]
* nice graphics and music
* [b]the devs write regular blogs about the current progress of the game[/b]
* It still gets updates and new content

Not so cool things:

* endgame really gets boring once you killed [spoiler]The reaper and have a experimental PVG[/spoiler]
* many of the houses look the same
* increased difficult only makes the enemies bullet sponges
* you can't undo skillpoints for your character. Which makes it hard to experiment with the specialisations
* too much loot, not enough space for all that stuff (devs are working on this) Update: You still hoard too much, but the bases now lets you expand your inventory
* random crashes - my game rarely crashes but I have friends that can't host a session  because they have a crash like every hour
* story is kind of shallow, but you are not forced to do the story
* only 5 regular enemy types with different tiers (Update: there are more now, but the variety is still lacking)
* inventory management sometimes gets chaotic and it's possible to recycle your current equipped weapon without warning

The endgame loop:
You hunt rivals to get experimental weapons and weapon skins. Build your bases and defend them. the game has collectibles, like Garden gnomes and you can search for that stuff to get 100%

tl;dr get the game when it is on discount, the dlcs aren't a requirement.

The PVG90 (a Swedish variant of the Barret M82A1 sniper rifle) genuinely feels like a proper anti-material rifle. Just with I had some explosive rounds to hit Tanks and Harvesters with.



Edit:
Well, it's been about two years since I last reviewed this game, and while my original points stand true, the immense amount of issues still plaguing the game have prompted me to uninstall the game more than once. Constant audio issues around FNIX bases, I can see through the sides of all my scopes for whatever unknown reason, and now with the latest update, ALL of the loot I get from a Reaper ends up disappearing. And then there's the atrocious Experimental Älgstudsare Hunting Rifle. Oh my fucking god, if you wanted a new grenade launcher, you literally could have just made a new one, added it into the game, and made it just as piss poor as the Experimental Älgstudsare. When it launched I had high hopes of it being a single shot power house of a rifle that took skill to use due to the inabilty to mount a scope, but holy fuck did you drop the ball on it. Oh and let's not mention that almost every firefight turns into a war of attrition, because god forbid that just one Seeker can be enough.

I think the game is great but with flaws and ive been listening to all the updates before i was ready to write this, they have doing good on the updates and are really trying. I strongly believe they will make this game amazing. 

So from my point of view the game is lacking content and i really want them to add more to the world because its huge! But nothing really in it.
  No events.. 
  Not enough boss fights that are worth even killing or farming.
  No farming at all actually. That could be a plus for some but i like to farm for things. 
  No crafting. Which is something i thought would be in here from the start.
  No sense of wondering the world really every building seems the same and usually really never worth looting unless you need ammo or revive sticks (forgot what they are called)

Now the graphics, gun play, attachment system and hell weapons tier system is really nice to have and gives a small point to farm for those i suppose but was not ehat i meant from my earlier comment. I know they have improved the way tue game directs you to missions now and made it easier so thats a good note. The game is fun with friends really! But if your a solo player like me it can get dull fast and thats why they need challenging enemies and events and just thibgs to keep you wabted to play or at least daily challenges.. Not trying to say make it a live service game. 

But hey for 35 bucks it worth it to me id recomend buy it ina few months at this given moment though. I wont return till they add more interesting things to do

(I said no farming i was wrong, theres a little but id like more then just what small small amount they have)


**UPDATED** 05/31/2023

Well all my complaints about this game have literally been implemented !
this honestly way better than when i first played this game, grant you for the game being sop cheap and you got to buy all the dlc to get the most out of the game.. its worth buying most of the dlc. but the best part is you dont have to.

they have added weapon camos, new weapons, crafting, base assaults/defense, transportation, deeper reasons to farm, overhaul to the environmental story telling and overhauled the general map in a huge way making it look more like a battlefield, QOL improvements/ major ones like aiming matches your sensitivity settings!! finally.
and honestly allot more i cant think of.

defiantly worth to hope on this game now. 
it did take a very long to to get to this level, but hopefully this is a sign that the second game will be better than whats here which is already great. (if theirs a second one)",1559120290,1685551949,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the good part, the sound design is not bad, gun sound ok. 

But this game is trying to do its best and doesn't quite succeed.
Map is huge, which can be appreciated, but it's also very empty... there is absolutely NOTHING, no animal no other NPCs to help you fight, no bandit or anything. Yeah, I get that robot try to kill everything, but there should be animals, other humans. But no... Nothing, only killer robot.

Speaking of the robots, they are the main ennemies but there are very little different ennemies with little different variation. Their variation is mostly color or a slightly different weapon (With or without grenade launcher and that's it)

The survival aspect gets you to gather ressources to create bandages, ammo and that's it, no hunger meter, no thirst meter no weapon or armor condition or anything like that, it feels it's only half baked and that's a shame.

Weapon, without DLC there are very little of them, and with DLCs there are, a bit more, but that's far from enough. They all feel samey in a set category. The only difference is the rarity, similar to a borderland, weapons have rarity on them and they'll just look in better condition the higher the rarity with slightly better stats but that's it.

The problem of it having little NPCs well... there is not much to do.
Drive bike for 10 minutes, kill machine there / retrieve intel of some sort, and repeat.

Also excuse my crude languge.

So, first of, the devs need to start adressing all the bugs, now Im not gonna acuse them of ignoring the bugs, and Im sure they are hard at work fixing them all the time. But the fact that I had to restart my save, (before multiple save files were a thing,) and restart the whole game, just to get another game breaking bug that (almost) had me need to make a new save AGAIN a few weeks later, meanwhile there's a new DLC coming out every other week, is just fucking unaceptable.

Now, time to talk about optimisation, now I know I know, I sound like (and kind of am) that one guy who insists the game has to run on a fucking toaster, but while the perfomance needed is alright for what the game is, not unreasonable in any stretch of the imagination and not an issue, (and Im not being ironic,) the file size is just... what?
The file size of the game has been steadily increasing over time which is like, yeah, duh, ofcourse a game gets a bigger file size as it gets updated, but, well, I was doing my thing, untill my friend was like, ""THE FUCK IS GOING ON,"" and showed me that there was a 15GB UPDATE.
NO.
YOU DID NOT MISREAD THAT.
FIFTEEN GIGABYTES.
UPDATE.
With the file size already being big enough beforehand that I often looked at it and thought, ""I feel like the devs should do some sort of compressing, but, oh well, im not a game dev maybe they already have and the file size would be twice this if they hadnt.""
But, a fifteen gigabyte update?
Im pretty certain you could cram this entire fucking game into fifteen gigabytes, (granted it would probably look more like y-lands than what it does now.)

Now, lets talk about bikes.
Before, bikes used to be fair and balanced, enemies would see you coming from a reasonable distance away and it was balanced. Making choosing to ride a bike a choise, (granted 80% of the time the choice is no, im walking. unless you're Jingals who just fucking charges into battle on a bike and then proceeds to complain about how he dies alot and is constantly short on adrenaline and ammo.) But then they added motorbikes. Which dont get me wrong I like them, and I like them enough that I bought the biker DLC. But, well, after goofing around with motorbikes for a bit, I tried regular bikes again, and noticed that i didnt get noticed by a patrol that would usually notice me.
I then proceeded to BIKE INBETWEEN THE LEGS OF A HARVESTER ESCORTED BY SEVERAL RUNNERS ONLY GETTING SPOTTED WHEN I HAD ALREADY PASSED THE HARVESTER.
Or in other words.
BIKING IS MORE STEALTHY THEN CRAWLING NOW.
This is game breaking and completely ruined the game for me, with my only solution being that I prohibited myself from using regular bikes, and the thing is. I thought using motorbikes would be a gamble because THEYRE SO DAMN LOUD, but turns out, what the devs seemingly did, was they gave motorbikes the same stealth value of regular bikes, (who dont even have an engine,) and then increased the stealth of bikes ten fold and presumably didnt even test it. Resulting in the bike being an equivalent to the R8 in CSGO on launch, except instead of realising the big oopsie the devs made and reverting it within a week like valve did with the R8, they just fucking kept it like that.
Oh and ofcourse I made a thread about this on the community forums and all I got back was, ""bikes work with a LOS detection system,"" which is bassically saying, ""nah you talking shit,"" considering I was able to bike right infront of a tank and it wasnt untill I was 3-5 meters infront of it that it detected me when I was on a bike. When if i was on foot i would have been spotted at 50 or so meters on foot. And the only other response i got that wasnt talking smack was, ""i mostly just avoid using bikes,"" (which to be fair is the same for me aswell. But seeing the shit jingals got up to i thought it was more normal to chose the bike, but i gues that was just jingals beind jingals.)

Now, about those DLC's.

Now I know, making a game where you only make money when people buy it and then having to rely on that source of income to update it is impossible as 80 percent of profits come on launch, and DLC can be an effective way to fund the game and be able to keep supporting it. And i think the devs should keep doing it if it makes the difference between cutting updates and continuing support. But, pumping out a DLC every few months while I, (or rather, we,) are having to restart entire save games because of a single bug and spending 30 minutes trying to figure out why the game didnt register me destroying that building which was a central part of the mission and its not letting me progress AND OH NO AM I GONNA HAVE TO RESTART MY FUCKING GAME AGAIN.

Is just fucking rediculous.

And thats my conclusion.

Devs, this is fucking bonkers, fix this, now.

And lastly, I still love this game, I will continue to play it, and most likely will for a long, long time, do not let this review discourage you from buying the game if you saw it and a bunch of reviews and thought you might like it, because you likely will. But this neglect of ballance and bugs and file size and shit cant keep going unadressed.

And please, Im not some random dumbass who doesnt know what he's talking about, stop treating me like paul coming back from the western front and being treated like he doesnt know shit because ""he's just a dumbass soldier.""

And I swear if I see one doofus in the comments of this just beind grammar police even though it doesnt provide anything usefull, acting like my fucking english teacher knowing damn well that Im not a native english speaker. Or trying to twist my, ""All quiet on the western front,"" footnote into me somehow being a narcisistic piece of shit then Im just gonna fucking stop making these sort of reviews, because im tired of trying to speak out about an issue and you fuckos responding with fucking memes.",1635361040,1685314477,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,4,True,False,False

The game play was fun and the learning curve was a little tricky at first, but I do appreciate it in RPG games.

So youre basically in this massive country, and there are literally 3 other NPCs in the game (sorry for the spoiler) which literally cant move. So everything which moves in the game is an enemy. The storyline wouldve been a lot more alive if they precoded it into moving NPCs and this wouldve opened a vast array of extra missions if there were any NPCS in the world. The world itself (apart from the scenery which is stunning), is completely dead. Literally everyone else is dead and you are the only living survivor. Creating other survivors which randomly also fight the bots wouldve beena nice little extra and it would take a few lines of coding, since the models are actually there already, bots are already fighting each other which means the coding for enemy detection is already there. The voice messages and notes you pick up which basically gives you your missions seems distant and very impersonal. Skyrim set a standard over a decade ago on what makes RPG worlds come alive and this little detail wouldve been the difference between ""okay"" to ""awesome:""

Micro-DLC:

One of the main issues is the micro-dlc spam. For the last year they have released far too many of them. Each one cokes with an update that adds more bugs, and then they continue adding more DLC.

This would be a far better situation if the DLC were actually good. The weapon packs include weapons that are not very useful and have  cheap looking models. The soviet weapon pack had an issue where one of the weapons would not drop. It took them far too long to fix  that issue.

They have attempted  to buff the weaker items but the buffs did little and they continue to make more packs instead of going back and fixing the ones they already sold.

The expansions are pretty good, and there was work for a third one, but as far as anyone can tell it has been abandoned so they can make more micro-DLC. At this point it just seems they want the playerbase to continue funding them through these low effort packs.

Bugs:

The game has, and continues to be, plagued with a massive amount of bugs. Most are meh and can mostly be ignored, but some detract a large amount from the intended experience.

Here is a small list of current/fixed bugs
1: The most recent update made it so you are unable to loot top end enemies

2: The most recent update has made the amount of crashes on startup/during game play spike by a large amount (This happens EVERY update)

3: I have personally experienced 2 BSOD's and 3 crashes in about an hour of gameplay. (up to date drivers, OS updates, and hardware)

4: Assignments (basically challenges done for rewards) have been broken on and off for so long that I actually have no idea of they work or not anymore. Even if they did, they had at one point been broken for many months.

5: The Mosin from the Eastern European weapon pack (a paid dlc) was near impossible to get as a drop for those who purchased the DLC. This was fixed in the most recent update, but it had been a thing for many months.

6: The new procedural missions which were said to ""be unique for every player"", ended up being the same exact mission for at least 3 people in my friend group.

7: The update before last ended up vaporizing the home base of most players. These bases held massive amounts of resources for a lot of players. How this got past any amount of testing is hilarious.

These are just a few that I can remember off-hand. 


Content:

Other than what the main game content has and the expansions include the game has little content. base defense is okay. Very barebones with little variance between different missions. To add to this, the devs made base building, then a bit later added a base building item pack (paid), while the base building it self was still barebones.

Base attack is also okay, just plagued with massive side affects. They seem to make naturally spawned enemies far more rare. They also cause FPS drops and crashing issues for many players. This combined with the fact that there is a base every 500m makes the entire map far less fun to go around.

The new procedural missions are EXTREMELY lackluster. We were told it would take ""10-20"" minutes to complete. I was able to do mine in about 3 minutes. They also claimed the in-game rewards would be good but these were also extremely disappointing. I received a couple of higher-end attachments. You receive far better rewards from base attacks and killing high end enemies (assuming you can actually loot them)

Other than that the game receives very little content update by update. When pointing out how barebones things are we are told ""we will improve them in time with your feedback"". This has been pretty much untrue. They rarely go back and fix things let alone improve them.


Misc/Community/Systemic Reaction:

The community manager and moderators are goofy. They will get mad if you say something bad about the game.

Also who was the person that saw Systemic Reaction with  a struggling game and thought ""Let's go make two more that will be DOA""

Edit: And it finally happened. A new update with a brand new DLC that overshadows everything in the base game. I think the Dev team has lost there way and I don't see the game improving at this rate. While bug fixes are always great, they are adding too much in the DLC department instead of working on the game itself. If you can get this game on a sale, maybe for like $10 you'll get your worth, but honestly, just avoid it. 

For what it offers, it is fun, especially with friends involved you can lay cool ambushes and pull of stunts that you just can not do it solo. I mean, you are fighting giant robots as a combat unit so it is just good fun. I also do not regret the DLC I have purchased. That being the story expansion and the island that really beefs up the difficulty. I think they were well handled and add some challenges and fun to the game. While I do think some balancing needs to be handled, especially in the weight of some items, the overall experience has been positive. But, let me get into why the game is teetering for me.

The game is getting excessive in its DLC. The DLC is starting to fall primarily into weapon packs. While there are some others the weapon packs seem to be the primary focus of em. For some of these I have no issue. Like the USA weapon pack. Of course in Sweden these guns would be exceptionally rare, so I see no issue. Or even in one weapon pack there is a bow made out of the robot parts, that is just silly fun, perfect for a weapon pack. But things are getting out of hand. For instance, a Molotav is a DLC only weapon. Something as simple as a bottle of alcohol, a cloth, and a match/lighter. Something that has been around for hundreds of years is locked behind a DLC. Then something like Portable Cover, makes sense. Bring a piece of metal or something with you to place down so you can at least get SOME cover, not a hard concept to think about. So why isn't there one in the base game? 
Just as I am writing this they just released the Eastern European weapon pack. Inside is the Volkov Pistol, supposedly one of the most common weapons of the Cold War era. If it is so common, why is it in a weapons pack? Same with the PM-71 machine gun. Again, touted as one of the most popular machine guns in the eastern front. So it should be common right? Something our heroes can get their hands on easily? If that is the case, why don't our heroes have access to it normally? I have no issue if weapon packs are weird and wacky, or simply out of place and rare. For instance in that same pack is the Voca vz. 68. A Czech machine pistol, apparently used by special forces. That one makes sense. It would not be common. It is my opinion that the weapon packs should be for stuff not normal or easily gotten by Sweden at that time, or something wacky and fun. So the mix of incredibly common or simple items mixed with exotic weapons makes no sense. If each DLC came out with weapons added to the base game, maybe I would have less of an issue but so far, I think this is becoming an huge issue, something that is dragging the game down.

Supposedly this is because the dev's are running into money problems. I do not know how true or false this claim is, but if that is the case, excessive DLC is not the way to handle it, especially with the mishandling of supposedly common weapons. All it will do is drive what fans they do have away as all they see is DLC after DLC, and stop new people from playing when they see the massive list. I do like this game, and I hope the Dev's manage to pull through, but this is not the way to handle it.

Sad to see that hte game has not been improving, or improving in the wrong ways as I see it. Sorry guys but a negative is worthy at this point. Maybe put time and effort into the base game and people might start coming back.",1670838495,1685045061,False,0,0,0.51920628547668457,0,True,False,False

I just can't get enough of everything this game has to offer, the visuals, the sound design, combat mechanics, all of it blends together wonderfully.. when It's working properly that is... 

 This game does tend to be a bit buggy sometimes, and the developers have a tendency to add more bugs than they remove, (though recently they've been doing a better job). But no matter how badly this game gets broken, I'll still love it.

 Definitely worth the asking price, and goes on sale very often. I would recommend getting the motorbike dlc too alongside the game, unless you want a pure first experience, without making travel too easy. Though if you do want a much easier start, the weapon dlc packs aren't bad either, but they do quickly get overshadowed by the later in-game weapons.

 A little word of advice as well, back up your save data with this game, It's not hard and will save you a lot of hassle if a gamebreaking bug is introduced. Possibly save an entire character too.. All it takes is a small copy and paste and your save data is safe, also just as easy to restore.

Medkits disappear then reappears when you put something in the empty slot.
Guns disappear from your hotbar and when you find another of the same gun and right click a scope both show up even if one is invisible..

There is a lack of functionality with multiple aspects of the game, bugs that were not mentioned in any reviews, a few oversights in multiplayer that were a real bummer, and more.

The NPC spawning is wack, it makes no sense, especially with firebirds. You kill one, and you watch another one immediately spawn. The map is cluttered with a ton of enemies, which makes it hard to do literally anything with a severe lack of time to prepare for an attack. Let alone the amount of damage you're doing to the machines versus how much they're doing to you is way out of balance.

Command tokens are something you need in order to claim control points. Well, after failing to defend a control point, we lost it. And when I tried re-claiming it, I didn't have enough command tokens. So, naturally, I ask my dad (who I'm playing with) to claim the point, and alas, he can't. Apparently, only the host can claim points, which in my opinion makes no sense.

Apart from that, there have been a few ghost NPCs with negative health. They just float around the map and make noise, which gets super annoying. Additionally, the ragdoll physics of the dead machines glitch out and go flying across the map, making the payout after an engagement really underwhelming when you can't find the corpse to loot.

Now, I have to say, the game has great graphics, especially on console. The sounds are also amazing (besides the occasional dead NPC sound glitch). The guns are well made and sound realistic too, which is another great aspect. The game has some good features, but they're outweighed by the bugs that I've found so far. I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state. I highly urge the devs to fix these bugs because the concept is great, there are some really great aspects, but these few things really cap the amount of fun you can have in the game.

[u][current issues I found severely impacted my experience with the game:][/u]
[list]
[]NPC rag-doll physics bodies glitching through the map and launching across the map. This made the cost of ammo during a hard fight against machines really underwhelming.
[]The unbalanced machine difficulties, especially with lower-leveled players, being constantly killed by a machine gets tiring and annoying. It makes no sense for the machine to have limitless ammunition while players are constantly fighting for it.
[]Machine spawn rates, especially noticeable with the firebirds. From what I noticed, there are always 2 firebirds on the map, but again it makes no sense for them to immediately spawn after you kill one. I would always find myself fighting against a firebird one after another. And with limitless ammunition and high dealing damage, it was impossible to get through a mission without spending 80% of it fighting off the annoying flying robots.
[]The falling mechanics. When falling off of a bike or motorbike, I'd find myself rolling awkwardly down a hill and dying miraculously. The fall damage from jumping off of something high is pretty spot on, but the rag-dolling after falling off of a motorbike was incredibly annoying. Not to mention something similar with being rag-dolled by a missile and falling onto a rock or bush and then watching as my character gets stuck there, unable to move.
[/list]

[u]Other bugs I noticed that don't affect gameplay as such but would be nice to see patched:[/u]
[list]
[]The movement of some machines. Currently, they look clunky and move awkwardly more often than not, especially the runners.
[]Some specializations lack functionality, especially hacker. I went straight for hacker as it sounded useful during a battle and shortly after realized it didn't work at all.
[]The smoke grenades and rounds do nothing for the enemy. Regardless of the distance, amount, or strategic use of the smoke, the enemies still found a way to hit me with 100% accuracy, 100% of the time.
[]The story feels like there's too much free choice. I feel like the story should be more mandatory at the start as fighting the same enemies over and over made me lose interest. It just got repetitive and boring. The story should come first and then become a base defense and exploration game afterwards, stretching out the content for players to indulge themselves in.
[]The ""store all"" button. I found that I was accidentally pressing the store all button a lot accidentally, and it became really annoying. Constantly having to sort through the plumes of loot in my loot box to put things back into my inventory became a pain.
[]Massive oversight with base claiming in multiplayer. There should be a setting for other players in multiplayer to claim control points. This had a massive impact for myself and my dad as we went to claim a control point and noticed I didn't have any command tokens, and then when my father claimed he had enough, it didn't let him claim it. This was a major letdown as we had to travel away from our mission to take over another FNIX base in order to claim the one we were aiming for.

41 hours. 41 hours until my internet hiccupped and I realized that this game is based off a constant connection to Steam. I'm going to keep playing this game because I enjoy it, but just like that, I lost a lot of respect for playing a game, in singleplayer, that force-closes the game suddenly and out of nowhere when the internet has turbulence. This is bad design and now that i know this, once I'm done playing, I'm probably never coming back.

I've heard people say it's because I'm not hitting the correct spots, but that's simply not true. I have nearly 150 hours played on this game and hitting the correct spots doesn't do nearly enough. Oftentimes, hitting the ""correct"" spot on a machine will cause an explosion so large and loud that it gets you even more attention from surrounding machines.

Maybe it's a different experience online with other people, but I haven't ventured there as the lag in my own games has me wonder how much rubberbanding I'll deal with on another person's server.

-Modifications for guns, rarity of guns and attachments, recipes to unlock, fast travels to unlock, interesting quest line and story
-Needs to be polished up. 
-Robots have some clunky movements which results in them getting stuck on the tree lines or fences.

-Need to rework weight ratios and distribution... you are FAR too limited with how much ammo 
you NEED to run around with to take out enemies....

The game has it's flaws but every game does. Does the game crash, occasionally. Does the game have bugs, certainly. Does the game get hung up and force you to exit, once in a while, yup. The important thing to note is the game is still being worked on, it hasn't been forgotten by the devs at the time of writing this review. The DLC is decent and in my opinion worth it. The motorcycle DLC is a favorite, even though the game has fast travel, to traverse through the beautiful world of mech infested Sweden, I take the long route often. This game is pretty open to how you want to play it. You can dump munitions into the robots, you can be strategic and plant explosives, you can be a sniper or lead them into a death trap as you deploy explosives, utilize mechanisms to attract them to where you want them and, if in the right location, couple it with the environmental explosives to cause robot parts to fly through the air, you can co-op (I have had 4 on a server) or you can be a lone wolf. The game does up the anti in difficulty when you co-op, which I like, but you can turn that off in the settings. 

Completing the main story line, if you just hammer through, can be accomplished in a day, but there is a lot of side stories to follow, additional DLC story, and some really good environmental story telling if you take a moment to observe it. Some of the side story line can be really heartfelt and cause you to pause and reflect. All in all, me and my squad have enjoyed and continue to enjoy this game. When you get into an intense battle with several tanks, hunters, everything they trow at you in an all war for 10 -20 minutes of heated battle and as the last mech explodes you stand up a yell out ""Yes, hahahaha, down you go""! in unison with your squad, it is a heck of a feeling and this game provides those moments.

There are still improvements to be made and it appears, if the devs keep at it, they will come. One thing I do want to see is the ability to fire you weapon while riding the motorcycles. Currently they are transportation only.

The game can be a GPU hog on ultra settings, but a lot of games are. I am running a 3080 and the frame rate is variable on ultra at 165fps. It wasn't bad enough to throttle the GPU but, medium settings are still beautiful and its locked at 90fps. GPU, which is fan cooled, hangs out at 60-70c 90fps, no variability even during intense battles.

I am still enjoying this game and I would recommend it to anyone.

The simplest example is the save system. When you want to quit the game it warns you unsaved progress with be lost.
It doesn't say when the last auto save was, and it does not have an option to manually save.

So every single time you want to quit the game it warns you, that you may be losing progress but doesn't give you the tools to do anything about that.  It feel unpolished that such a simple little thing but fundamental to the game, like saving hasn't been addressed yet.

The map is huge but perpetually empty often times finding a small building filled with boxes or garbage that stops you from stepping inside or the building is boarded up so it can't be opened, so the buildings gave the illusion the world was filled without actually putting anything there.

I could go on but it's a thousand little things like that. New guns which are incredibly important, are just randomly strewn around without any type of meaning. I completed all the introductory quests, and I can only tell because I got an achievement from it.

1. The combat it's really sluggish and reload speed is poor even when upgraded no dash stam runs out far too quick

2. Health is very bad 2-3 hit's and you downed even if that's upgraded and Health Packs don't help or you go through them like money.

3. Bot's do way too much damage even on easy and their aim is like aim-bot you can't move without being downed need's to be more balanced.

3. Carry weight so under balanced even at max of 96 you can hardly carry anything the weight system need's a revisit like 20 hairclips/bobbypins weight you down, health packs should use less weight too and gun attachments are far too heavy once put on a gun should remove the weight.

4. At low level don't even think of trying to cross to the farmlands till your 25 and over you won't stand a chance and the amount of bots need's to be toned down a little.

5. Base building could have more too it little basic and also crafting is pointless.

Good things about the game.

Looks good, plays well, bot design is good that's about it really.

And before you say get good or you haven't gotten the good weapons yet etc etc, I have my reasons to say this for people that wanna have fun and not just get downed over and over, I have the good weapons and everything like I said on No.3 their aim need's to be toned down or at least let us dash left or right to avoid them better.",1683941501,1683941501,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd without a doubt say my views are based on only playing on the hardest difficulty, not bragging, I just love a challenge so I chose that. But its also contributing to the feel I get by keeping me insecure anywhere I am except in a safe house, since the first enemies you face do seemingly pose a threat, it makes you stay more on your toes in case you suddenly discover something way more dangerous, you'll feel like ammo is a blessing anywhere it can be found. Although it might not necessarily be that bad, you just never know how far away you may be from an unexpected amount of enemies or an unexpectedly powerful enemy. There definitely are bugs and glitches here and there, but they luckily seem to be quite easy to dodge if you really want to make sure and you already experienced it once or more. Must say it's kinda a drag how bad some bikes fare off the beaten path, and well, none of them do very well even if it seems like it should.

- Playing against pretty intelligent robots was a nice change of pace from the usual military/zombies enemies in today's FPS.  Some of the baddies are HUGE!

-  There was a sense of accomplishment throughout the game when you take down a tank, harvester, or basically ANYTHING in the Marshlands.  It was tough and rewarding.

-  I like the emphasis on targeting components.  Rather than the typical spray n' pray, you have to stop, scout, and think though your next move pretty regularly.  Sometimes running like hell is the best option.  (I'm looking at you, EVERY airfield)

-  I am a horder, and I never felt like I was spending a lot of time trying to make room in my inventory or my stash.  Since weapons don't break, once you get a higher quality, you scrap the old one.  

-  No matter your playstyle, you can find a way to get things done.  I think it would be possible (missions excluded) to finish the game without destroying a single robot.  

-  I think the variety of weapons was perfect.  Not too many, not too few, numerous attachments available for all.

Cons:

-  The ""vehicles"" are worthless.  Don't bother trying to use them.

-  The buildings are pretty much all the same.  There's maybe 10 floorplans?  The loot is always in the same places within said buildings too.  The bunkers, in particular, seem very cut-and-paste.

-  The fall damage is out of whack.  WAY too often I would jump down a molehill and take 20% damage.

-  I'm not really sure what the game was about.  I did all the side quests I could find, cleared the bunkers, did all the main quests, walked into a room, and the credits rolled.  I didn't really understand the point from a story perspective.

-  The water.  You can't cross it.  If you go in too deep, you teleport back to shore.  If you jump in, more often than not you'll have to fast travel cuz you get stuck.

-  While I like the schematics tree for the ammo and equipment, the armor tree is stupid.  Too much time and effort go into raising your resistances by 1%

-  I don't have the DLC, but there is a LOT of FINX stuff all over the map that you can't do anything with until you get the addons.  I'd prefer not seeing it UNTIL I purchase it.

-  I thought the learning curve was a little steep in the beginning.  It's not obvious, outside of the runners, where the weaknesses are on each class of enemy.  A little more tuturiol in the beginning would have been helpful.

-  I'm not sure about the skill tree specializations.  I went down the engineer path to where you can harvest tick pods to use.  It worked the day I unlocked the ability, but never worked again.

Overall, this was a fun game.  It's staying installed so I can round up some buddies for base defense missions (which I didn't do many of).  I have a bone to pick with the stupid flying robots in the Marshlands, so vengeance will be mine!  I think after 50 hours of gametime all that's REALLY left is achievement hunting and gear grinding, so it was a short but sweet experience.

    [*] Gunplay is fun and the enemies can be challenging
    [*] Vast world to run around and explore
    [*] Looter-shooter


[Cons]
    [*] Glaring number of bugs
    [*] Lack of proper updates to the game
    [*] Endgame is replayable but repetitive (lack of replay value)

To explain in further detail, although the world is huge and there is the looter-shooter aspect, there is a heavy emphasis on looting. The world is large with plenty of safehouses that act as fast travel points, but some areas lack detail compared to others. Very quickly, you will know all the building layouts and where all loot spawns are in most buildings. Other buildings are just the same repetitive templates moved around and slightly altered. 
Looting is so essential to the game that it is the driving force of most gameplay outside of the campaign. You need better guns or else you will spend a long time fighting the same bots. It is cool that there are specific weakpoints and modular damage to the robots, however the robots themselves have generic AI that cause them to be easily exploited. Often times you will have robots that ""freeze up"" in a specific animation until you break it free somehow. 
As someone who played a lot of what this game has to offer, I can confidently say that I had my fun. I played knowing the game would be filled with bugs that can break immersion. Although there are a ton of fixes in each update, the core gameplay itself shows that the game will be dull as is. Having dynamic gameplay is what makes an open-world experience replayable. Currently, the replayability of this game revolves around looting the last bits of endgame gear from the high-tier enemies with unpredictable loot tables. You need to spend a lot of hours in the game just to collect the gear you want. Granted, the developers have definitely made a lot of efforts in adding additional content to play, but the replayable content is still repetitive. As of late, the new basebuilding and base assault missions are cool, but lack any reason to play. You are rewarded with materials and blueprints for completing missions, which offer nothing else other than to lead you to need to do more missions. If the core game revolves around the gameplay loop of looting and shooting, its hard to not notice the glaring bugs and issues with the game. It becomes more prevalent as there is nothing else to distract you from it. Adding weekly objectives and adding generic skins to guns does not add more content for players. It only distracts the players from noticing how prolonged the lack of content has been. 
As a final note, play this game knowing the issues and do your best to gloss over it. It's now the games identity at this point. Playing with friends is the best option to enjoy the quirks of the game, and provides way more enjoyment than what it is alone.",1682087483,1683172471,True,20,0,0.690609395503997803,0,True,False,False

The game play is pretty solid. The movement feel pretty nice, if a slight bit clunky at times. The gun play feels a bit weak, but I know that this is more of a diversion/indirect attack style game, so it makes sense. Also, the fact that these bitches can tank quite a few hits if not hit at just the right place lends credence to the idea that these machines invaded Sweden. Which leads into my next point, and potentially favorite part of the game: the enemies actually feel like they're trying to look for you, and try to tail you once they've caught your proverbial ""scent."" They don't track for as long as a human would in real life (obviously, it's a game), or even a more open combat-style game, but I feel like the design of the enemies to be robots in the late 80's helps uphold that kinda terrifying suspension of disbelief.
The way that you take out the enemies is kinda reminiscent of Horizon Zero Dawn, in that you basically have to shoot the battery at the top of the mob enemies,

Bicycles still suck, so they added motorbikes, all three suck. I am shocked that the DIRT BIKE struggles with DIRT. Just screw it, give me a ATV mate.

i feel i should try this game out with other people, as solo its kinda bland. Most of the skills are useless & lord the storage is tiny. That's just what i need thanks.

The lighting and such is just..awful..and there is no option to change it. I had to find a reshader for it to improve it as i had to keep getting closer to my screen to try and make out things in the night / certain areas. I don't know why they thought that wearing sunglasses / gas masks should make that vision even harder to see, but hey thanks.

All of the rarity options is completely pointless. Oh you got a common scope? It's broken terrible and you can barely see through it. Oh you got a legendary one? It's like brand new and crystal clear. Why is the rarity system pretty much just the weapon / item quality? why?

The game is still fun to play, its a nice time waster, but there just isn't much to it.

~I can only recommend this game If you kinda like Day Z experience~

So after a bit of playing its a very slow paced game, likely better with friends but i really do not think it is worth 40$(AUD) after playing it for a bit it started to really give me day Z vibes, just replacing spooky zombies with spooky machines. Dog bots, flying annoying bots, Spiderbots(Fuck these), and even the Titanfall bots that you run screaming into a house after it spots you. But between the action it just doesn't have a lot to offer, which i guess MAY get better with friends?

The AI seems incredibly easy to cheese if you are in a house, unless one magically teleports in doors then you have kill it fast.

Game is in Swedish (Duh) but everything you need to know is in english, except for the gun names which are madeup gibberish i am sure. There is a lot of walking, and they offer you bikes sure but the terrain isn't really for bikes, unless you use them on the road,. Which gets you attention from the murderbots. There is also a lot of cars & Tractors which as far as i have seen only offer loot. And if you stupidly think you can just swim to the otherside of a little river to get across this game will tell you no as you sink to the bottom of the river & respawn, i would not be surprised if the player himself/herself is also a damn murderbot.

TlDR; If you arn't looking for a Day-Z like, this isn't what you're looking for. I can't say it's scratching the itch for me, but i MAY get it when its cheaper.",1586718294,1682477798,True,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

I played solo, and even though I almost wanted to seek a refund when I was being prompted to create an account (although the Steam page doesn't indicate this was required), I did the ""quick"" option and that was good enough.

The game is very repetitive, the enemies are extremely stupid and just manage to kill you because they are bullet sponges, the only way I found of actually killing strong enemies efficiently was by:

1-shoot an entire mag at them;
2-run inside a house;
3-wait for them to shoot their burst (their shots don't pierce the wooden walls and neither do their HE rockets, and they are too stupid to go inside);
4-run outside;
5-repeat for 20 minutes until it's dead;
6-do the same thing for the rest of the game.
(works for pretty much everything in-game)

The game's beautiful open world is very empty, there is not a lot to find and every time you get to a location, the game tells you everything you can collect in that location so there's not much surprise. It lacks cover so if you get caught in the open, you're basically fucked. You also can't swim, which looks stupid and is also very annoying.

The vehicles are lacking and very buggy, the bycicle gets stuck and kicks around everywhere you go except for some perfectly flat road, the motorbike only goes like 15km/h faster than the bycicle at like 50km/h but consumes a lot of fuel, gets damaged easily and will randomly crash your game, and I don't know if you ever get an actually decent vehicle because I didn't play through the entire thing, but what annoys me the most about the vehicles is that, throughout the entire game, you'll find a shit-ton of cars in perfect condition but you can't use them, the usable vehicles are completely individual and two players can't ride together on co-op.

Some of the weapons are practically useless, I've never had to use a melee weapon, ammo is plentiful and you can craft it. Shotguns can't reliably kill the weakest of robots, you'll need like 4-5 shots with a pump-action to kill a dog-sized robot.

Loot is shared in co-op, which takes away from the guerrilla elements from the game, since your friends will also get all the good loot and weapons you find and vice-versa. There is an option that supposedly disables loot sharing but it doesn't seem to do anything. Managing loot and just using your inventory in general is just extremely clunky, inefficient and confusing.

The robot bases feel completely out of place, they don't look like anything else related to the robots, they look like they came out of some Sci-fi fantasy game. The robots defending it are also very stupid but come in large numbers. I acted dumb through my entire playtime to see if I could atually have fun fighting the robots due to how stupid they are.

Honestly, this game doesn't even feel like it was ever meant to be a robot fighting game, the map feels like it should be on a standard survival game. The concept of a robot apocalypse is good but it's poorly excecuted, they could have done a lot more with it. The many bunkers in-game are mostly empty with usally just a few tiny spider robots that supposedly killed many trained military personnel, these tiny spider bots don't have any ranged weapons and just shock you from up close, they also seem to be the only type of enemy you find inside structures like houses and bunkers. They could have added turrets, humanoid robots with different equipment, literally anything that would make the game actually have some variety.

Oh, and it also has a lot of bugs and random crashes.

I am generally just very disappointed with this game, they only thing they did right is the graphics.

Also  it starts getting really annoying when almost every main story quest is in a bunker. Don't give me wrong, but after seeing the same copy-pasted rooms in every single bunker, you just can't enjoy it.
The combat starts feeling bland after 40 hours and there is just not enough motivation to kill the big robots, because you'll just get a shitty tier 3 weapon or worse, a bike skin.
The only real tough enemy is the reaper, and it takes a lot of time to get it to spawn.

Overall, I would not reccomend it for full price, that's just an insult. For the 5€ when it's on sale is a pretty good price but don't expect too much fun from it.
Also, bugs, bugs, bugs. A lot of them. From not seeing dead robots to hearing weird sounds coming from the ground, there is a lot. So....yeah

Exploring the abandoned settlements in between matches with robots that are fun to wreck but challenging is pretty great.  Combat isn't ""realistic"" like ARMA but it does require thought and tactics once you leave the starting region. Robots have different parts that can be disabled or hit for extra damage.
Stealth is unintuitive to me but consistent.  Running or Sprinting alerts enemies way farther than you would think and through camouflage.  Crawling lets you get very close.  The bicycles are superquiet, probably so players don't have to get off them constantly to fight.

It's got some issues. 

I think the game play is a tad more repetitious than most people will find enjoyable.
Talents don't feel very impactful at all,  the capstones especially.
It's not clear how to get upgrades and it's really not clear when something is more difficult than it should be simply because your weapons are in need of upgrading.
The ""good"" stuff doesn't start showing up until you are almost entirely through the story line. A huge mistake imo.
The loot issue makes 90% of POIs pointless. You won't return or interact with the vast majority of the game more than once. That's okay for an RPG, but this game tries to do ""endgame"" which I think should be integrated into the story, or the story continued through it.

There is a lot of creeping around the place until you find better weapons, no point in going all gung-ho in this game,but it is worth the wait. Eventually you'll have the robots running to hide from you,even the big buggers but it takes time and some customisation of your weapons. 
The graphics are great once you get used to the slightly foggy look.
I've now played the game twice it's that good. I hope there is a sequel as the way it ""ends"" certainly screams for one.

























































































As you see from my first review I had problems getting it started but for some still unknown reason it started working, so I tried it again and again and again. I can't remember how many times I rage quit on this game nor how many times I uninstalled it in frustration and vowed never to play it again. 
But here I am very much hooked on it.
Yes the game is difficult at first and your weapons are weak against an army of robots and health packs are rare. All this is true. Your first hours will be frustrating but I promise that if you keep at it the game gets much better and later in the game you will have weapons that will make the robots pee themselves with fear. They even run away at times and hide, even the big buggers.
One quick bit of advice, don't use any health packs in the early stages, it's much better to die and respawn. It means that you will have to back track a lot at first but when you respawn you get to keep any goodies you have collected,health packs, bullets etc and you have full health again. Also any robots you have killed should still be laying where you killed them so you can grab more goodies.
The graphics are great and much better than I first thought, water effects are top notch and there is little to complain about. As you progress you get to see a lot of Sweden and how the Swedes live.
I've just completed the game I think, the ending is a little confusing and the deep booming voice at the final bunker adds to the confusion but I assume its intentional. I will now buy the DLC's , I'm that hooked on it. 
I say buy the game and treat your self.


I've gone back to not recommend as there are now so many bugs as of 29/08/2021 that the game is unplayable. There are many times in the game you need serious fire power in the shape of a shell launcher ( I can't remember its full title ) and over the past few weeks I've used it to great effect. However now that I'm on the Island I cannot use the damned thing when I need to. Sometimes it wont load into my backpack from the storage crate and now that I've managed to get it to load, the shells are all missing. I've tried all manner of things to get the shells to load but no luck.
I wouldn't mind so much but this is my 3rd play through in the past 18 months and in the first 2 runs everything worked fine apart from the odd crash. We've had some updates since my last play through and it looks like the game is now too unstable, it crashed four times today which is a record for this game.
So as much as I've loved playing the game I must now stick it into my "" rubbish "" file and forget about it.",1561672076,1681600865,True,0,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

The biggest issue with the game is the scavenging. The game requires that the player spend time looking for weapons and ammunition, as should be expected. However, the issue with this is that ammo can be rather difficult to come by. This is for two reasons. One is that the loot sources in the world, meaning ammo boxes, backpacks, etc, are not a lucrative source of ammo. In addition, between the many sizes of ammunition, as well as the variants of those sizes, it is often impossible to find ammunition for the weapon that the player wishes to use. The second reason that ammunition is rare is that the best source of ammo is the machines. A player will fire far more rounds than the machine will give, and there is no promise that the ammo found is the one the player wants. Further, the machines themselves are problematic, which leads me to my next point.

The machines are, to put it simply, bullet sponges. They are over-armored with tiny weak points that are near impossible to hit for a variety of reasons, such as the poor sensitivity settings, the poor bullet spread while hip firing, and the speed at which the machines move. On top of that, anything larger than the dog machine has multiple weak points that must be hit for the most ammo effective kill. This is in addition to the fact that the larger machines will require the player to constantly move behind the machine to see half of the weak points, meaning that the player will have to get dangerously close to engage the enemy properly. This leads to the next point, which is the combat.

The combat is not fun, nor is it strategic. The most effective way to engage any larger machine is to run around it in a circle. This is negated by the fact that the player will likely, if not always, be engaging multiple machines at a time. This ranges from fighting about 5 machines, to fighting as many as 20 depending on aspects such as the initial size of the group, whether or not the machines can spawn more machines (which half of them can), and the surrounding terrain (as the player might inadvertently activate enemies in another area while fleeing). Further, range becomes an obnoxious issue to work around. Long range engagements are nearly impossible, as the machines will spot the player as soon as they open fire. Close range engagements are not possible, as the machines will often be too grouped up, or will utilize melee, flames, gas etc. to push the player back.

The machines' styles of engagement are also bad. Large groups of smaller machines will get as close to the player as possible, making them a fast moving in-your-face target that is more of a hassle than an actual obstacle. This is because they will likely be supplemented by the medium and large machines, which will fire missiles, explosives, gas, snipers etc. to keep the player moving. This means that the player will be constantly running from/eliminating smaller enemies, whilst simultaneously trying to ward off larger enemies. The player's attention is never allowed to be focused, and the player is never allowed to remain in one location. This is counter intuitive, as the machines' attacks are the most effective against the player when the player is in the open. Combat becomes moving in a circle from one semi-defensible location to the next, trying to time the attacks of the machines, all while downing dozens of health packs. The machines may be unique and fun to engage when playing with friends or against smaller groups, but alone and/or against larger groups of enemies, combat is a chore.

The snipers are next to useless, not only because of the aforementioned reasons, but also because they are really only useful in very specific circumstances, usually being engagements with smaller enemies. Shotguns are bad, because getting up close to enemies is not a good idea, and slugs are as good as using a sniper. The primary weapons of choice, SMG's and automatic rifles, are the most effective, but as they will see the most use, will burn through ammunition unreasonably fast. Even the rocket launchers take an unfair amount of ammunition to take down large enemies, which are the only worthwhile targets for them. This is in addition to the fact that explosives of any kind seem to do unbalanced damage to weak points, meaning firing rockets will be rolling the dice to see what components actually take damage.

Stealth is another issue. The game's enemies are very aware of the player, so getting close is not an option. Stealth isn't so much sneaking around enemies as it is avoiding them altogether. This is hard to do because of the density of the enemies in any given area, as well as the terrain often limiting traversal options. Stealthily eliminating enemies is not an option, except for smaller enemies with one or two weak points. Any large enemies, however, must be avoided altogether, as firing at them, even at weak points and from great distances, will alert them of your location before they can be destroyed. This will alert all enemies in the area, and turn what was a stealthy operation into a firefight.

Crafting was clearly not thought out. While crafting is extraordinarily useful, it requires two things: schematics and materials. Gathering schematics is either done with a guide, or by painfully moving from location to location and searching every room of every building of every town. Care to guess which most players choose? The materials are very painful to gather, as inventory space is limited, with next to no options to expand it. This means that gathering materials for crafting is essentially carrying around loads of junk in addition to your already heavy necessary equipment. I'd say that most of the time, when I was at my lightest, I had about one third of my inventory open. When scavenging, actually useful materials take up a good portion of that remaining space, which leaves next to nothing for crafting materials.

Equipment rarity. Ugh. As expected, the rarer the equipment, the better it performs. However, the game does not really feature high tier loot areas. Instead, it spawns high level enemies, which will provide the high tier loot. However, the game is not totally clear how powerful any enemy really is, meaning the average player cannot gauge their chances of getting high tier loot from a given enemy. This is also in addition to the fact that the powerful enemies are often larger enemies, which means that they will move with groups of smaller enemies accompanying them.

The UI is terrible. Some other people mentioned it, but the inventory really just does not carry enough, and the UI doesn't give you access to all the stuff you need fast enough. The map is cluttered, sensitivity needs more options, there are too many things to worry about when looting and reorganizing, and the skills.

The skills are garbage. To redo skills, the player needs high tier loot. Great. Then, if you mis-click, miscount your skill points, or just make a mistake, too bad! Get back to grinding!

There's a skill further down the tree that, when maxed out, gives 10% extra damage. When using fully automatic weapons. In single fire mode. Think about that. If you invest heavily into a skill, and then disable yourself from rapid fire capability, you can do 10% extra damage! Wow! It's a rip-off.

The game is an open world FPS with RPG elements and a vanilla-as-they-come story with poor attempts at voice acting. You will mostly spend your time performing one of two modes of gameplay.

Mode 1: driving from 'Undiscovered Location' to the next one, collecting a small handful of items before darting to the next 'Undiscovered Location'. If a Main Quest or Side Quest marker is near one of the 'Undiscovered Locations', you simply stop at it and (always...literally 100%) can wrap up the quest within a few minutes. 

Mode 2: Attacking FNIX bases, destroying them, then using the points you obtain from destroying bases to build your own (small build zone, very restrictive building rules) base in order to defend it from waves of enemies. At the hardest difficulty of the game and the wave setting, it is still extremely easy to defeat all waves. 

Co-Op works flawlessly and it makes the game much more enjoyable, specially when earning the in-game achievements.

If you're willing to deal with the absolutely frustrating and very well known crash to desktop bugs that plague this game. It's all over the support page. It's all over reddit. This game crashes **constantly**. It doesn't happen early in game. It seems to happen as you accumulate more spawn locations, basically as you progress in the game. By the last 60-75% of the game, and to the last 100%, you and all your friends will be crashing literally every 20-35 minutes. Sometimes losing all your loot or your entire base you spent time building. Crash to desktops are penalized by the game by instantaneously destroying your base and costing you (time consuming to earn) 'Command Points'. This game breaking issue makes 100% completion of Generation Zero a MASTER lesson in patience. The problem was identified years ago. The developers seem to have abandoned this game. This is the reason I cannot recommend this game to others. 

This is not a hardware or software issue. I play with several friends and every single one of us exhibit the excessive crashing to desktop. Intel, AMD, Nvidia, etc, doesn't matter. everyone crashes. 

If you are lucky enough to not crash then Generation Zero does offer you an absolutely beautiful graphical visual feast when you add in corrosive or shock ammo to any of your weapons. The game is decently optimized regarding graphical performance. With an Intel 10900k and 3080ti, I played in 4k with everything set to 'Ultra' on the LG OLED and experience consistent 60+fps.",1681357449,1681357449,False,10,2,0.570974647998809814,0,True,False,False

The only negative I have had with this game was the transitioning between weapons and medical gear. If you're in the middle of an intense firefight, to swap from your primary weapon to the healing equipment takes a couple seconds or so which you may not have. The meds aren't like other more traditional shooters of today where you can have them on an immediate use slot, and it makes my experience lack somewhat- however it isn't something I can't learn around and it ultimately doesn't make the game terrible.

The scenery is stunningly beautiful. I always end up just staring off into space while running around just to watch the sunset or the leaves fly by from the trees, hearing the birds chirping or the wind flow through my ears. Even in the middle of a blown up car wreckage site- it's still such a pretty game.

Weapons are perfect. The animations are crisp, the way the gun fires is accurate- not just a laser beam and they look beautiful even when covered in rust or the scope is cracked and beaten. Absolutely amazing modelling work.

This wouldn't be so bad if you could heal and run at the same time. The sad thing is you can't. Every tool requires you to switch to it specifically while enemies swarm you. Not a great combination tbh. Healing items do so over time, so they can be spammed before switching to a weapon to kind of circumvent this. Another problem then rears its head, crafting. You spam those medkits only to need to craft more while having a very limiting backpack. The map is huge with a neat concept for transportation, the bicycle, which is slow and clunky with terrible physics applied to it. This game is truly death by a thousand cuts.

With that said the Devs never stopped pumping out new content and still to this day listen to the community for new suggestions, hear our issues with the in game bugs and problems. As well as giving us a detailed view of their vision for their game that is Gen Zero. While I do caution the purchase and consumption of early access games for many reasons, such as the Devs can abandon the game at any point, bugs/exploits are never fixed or get worse, new content is sloppily created, or Etc. I see none of this with Gen Zero or the Devs. And I have to say this brings a breath of fresh air to early access Co-op/Multiplayer games. Far too often we hear about games like this going under due to lack of maintenance, care, content, or bug fixes, or the Devs just give up, cash out and leave. I for see a great future(I hope I'm not proven otherwise) for this game.

At the end of the day, I do enjoy me a couple of hours running around, trying to piece together the mystery of what happened to all the people in Sweden, and fighting off wave after of wave of increasingly more difficult enemies. At the end of it all, just wish ammo drops and certain other items that dropped, gave you more. Finding 1 ammo in an ammo case when you're low on ammo feels bad man, or only finding 1 med pack in a hospital when your low health and down to your last meds is terrible. Other then that, the game is on it's way to being one of those games I will go back to time and time again!",1574743673,1680972803,True,1,0,0.503472208976745605,0,True,False,False

I love the setting, the tone this game sets and the enemy designs of the swedish robots. It's basically a Diesel Punk game set in Sweden. 
The sound design is amazing, and probably my favourite part of this game. Gun sounds lean on the extremely loud side, so I had to turn them down a lot.

Coop is pretty solid, and fun to do. You just send a steam invite and it seems to be fine, even if there's an ocean inbetween people.
Östertörn is just such a beautiful place, that biking around, or driving a moped is also insanely fun!

Negatives:
The framerate was jumping all over the place at times, but I tried to look past it, and mitigate with dynamic resolution tricks.

After a while, around 50 hours, the challenge just DIED. 
I had so many explosives, great weapons, and great perks, it became impossible to fail.
At the same time, all of the enemies became bullet sponges, even if I always hit their weakpoints.

The privacy policy is also a big yikes!

Overall Generation Zero is a game I miss playing, because of the world, but not for the gameplay.

The game runs well, looks nice, , gun play is fun and the story while thin is at least unique.  BUT - the world after a short while becomes lonely / empty and just makes so little sense that is hampers the experience (for me at least).

The thing that really breaks the experience for me is the lack of NPC companions or other meaningful survivors.  The game in multiplayer I can see being fun as grouping together with other survivors would make sense in terms of the story but also create a sense of resistance instead of the ""you are the lone teenager that must become rambo and conquer all of Sweden because all the other survivors are useless"".

If they put in support for NPC companions or small teams I think the game would feel a lot better and balance out the fairly drab world with heavily repeated enemy types.

I would rate this as ""meh"" but since Valve has the intelligence of a stapler and refuses to put in a maybe button I am giving this a thumbs down despite not being a truly bad game.",1680796906,1680796906,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solo tengo dos problemas
1 A la hora de caminar o saltar en el mundo te puedes quedar atorado, de tal forma que ni agachandote, tirandote al piso o saltando podras salir. Solo tirando una granada o algun explosivo para que asi salgas volando, lo cual es divertido, pero muy molesto tambien
2 Los ataques a bases enemigas y defensas de las propias, es bastante entretenido de hacer, los primeros 5 minutos de los mismos, las bases enemigas sus defensas se expanden bastante rapido y los enemigos custodiandolas son demasiados y respawnean muy deprisa, lo cual lo hace demasiado molesto y tedioso. He terminado ataques con hasta 50 o mas enemigos muertos por todo el lugar y las estructuras que los spwanean son invencibles y no solo es una, pueden a ser hasta 5
Ahora la defensa de la base propia, si juegas solo literal no es muy recomendable hacerlas, si quieres hacerlo hazlo, pero en facil, porque asi es lo mas manejable. Y que los muros sean caros y muy debiles en comparacion del daño de los enemigos es un robo total. Y ni si quiera vale la pena poner defensas, porque estas no haran nada mas que ser destruidas y maximo eliminaran a 1 enemigo de los mas basicos.

There is no real originality here, it feels like a below average 2010 FPS. 
Like a 2009 and a 2010 game in a trench coat pretending to be from 2019.

I get that there was probably no budget to animate the (few) NPCs, but please try making it less obvious.
They are static, glued to the floor, give you stupid explanations as to why they will join the new hideout once you leave and then magically pop there. All of this gives the impression that I am playing in a ghost world, completely fabricated and on some plot rails.

Also, no real freedom of where you are going, the objectives of quests must be completed in a particular order.
If you need to do objective A to find B, you can't directly find B. You have to do A, even if A is just entering through the Northern gate while there are 10 other ways to enter the location. 
So can we really say that it is an open world?

Talking about the open world, it is gigantic. But not in a good way.
It's extremely big while being empty. Locations are very similar in their layouts.
You will spend most of your time opening the numerous containers to the point that you will see your inventory more than the rest of the game. The UI and inventory management are one of the worst I have ever seen by the way.

But oh well, it's a shooter after all, the gameplay is surely good enough to forget about that, right? Right?
You are not fighting robots, you are fighting sponges. Big bullet sponges. Look at all other reviews, many mention it.
It might not be obvious at first, but it becomes once you quit the ""tutorial"" island.
But something people don't talk enough about (in my opinion) is the number of enemies you meet. 
You are constantly opposed to groups of 4-8 robots every 30 meters. On top of which, most can kill you in 2/3 shots if not one. Combine this with the fact that they are sponges, and oh boy, you get very little fun.
Did I also mention that all of them respawn every time you log back into the game?

Other issues I need to mention:
- Gaining levels is extremely slow
- Very limited variety of weapons
- Very limited variety of enemies
- Buildings in general make the AI completely inactive

Now, about the bugs. Because lots of bugs there are. 
In just 10 hours of playing:
- Levitating bushes
- Textures flickering indoors, especially near doors
- Bunkers (of the main quest) with sea/waves audio as if you were on a ship
- Enemies instantly detecting you after your death and respawn, even behind walls
- Enemies climbing 90° cliffs to reach you 
- Enemies targeting the ground/sky but hitting you
- Enemies making a 180° turn in half a second to lock on you

All in all, all of these issues end up ruining the real (and only) originality of the game: its atmosphere.
I had 10-11 hours of 'decent' fun for a quite cheap price on sales, so that's okay.

 * Story is an afterthought.
 * World map is huge, but there isn't much variety or reward for stopping at farmhouse #3452.

I think the game should reward stealth and planning for combat more, make the fireworks, explosives and EMP deployables devastating and increase the impact of hitting critical components as a reward to not just running into a fight.

The game does have its moments of pure fun fighting robots however this game is held back by many faults. My biggest fault is with the story, it's mainly told through random articles or recordings you find throughout the game, which can make it very hard to get engaged.  There are two NPC characters you meet near the beginning however they mysteriously stop interacting with the player after the tutorial area, idk if they plan on doing more with them down the line in this games development but I thought it was strange nonetheless since the ""story"" progressed fine without them. Another problem is that the combat seems to be increasingly less fair the further north you head in the game. The firebird enemies or drones as I mostly call them; repeatedly bombard you with explosions while being tanky and hard to hit. They also follow you to the ends of the earth and never seem to leave despite how long I hide or cower in buildings. However the game did have its moments in particular joking around with the bike/motorbike ragdoll physics and attempting to rocketjump with the bazooka were very fun and fighting some of the non-flying boss enemies was a tense and enjoyable experience.

if you want a TL;DR. 8/10 for the price of a 2/10 game. This is a must buy; just understand that your camera may freakout when you loot and you might get stuck in very strange locations.

I love and hate this game. Lets start with love

Ive got about 86 hours atm, so obviously I think it is worth the money. The AI is a bit jank, but feels natural for the setting and is in line with the story. The Multiple factions are fascinating. I adore the story and how it is told. The various layers of trials and victories are addictive and the world of the game is amazing. I love the high speed fighting you can achieve with certain loadouts where you can go from corpse to corpse barely surviving against a horde by scavenging health packs as you dodge enemy fire.

I seriously can't dote enough on the world. Almost every building has a bathroom, there are emergency services, homes are furnished appropriate to the time, and the environments are so breathtaking that it makes me sad ill probably never get to see it with my own eyes. 

Now for the ""Hate"".
(#1 issue please fix) The game will flick your camera in random directions when you loot.
You will randomly get stuck on walls or corners; this is caused by the next problem.
You can't change your player state while against a wall; so you can't crouch or jump or run and while this may avoid a lot of clipping issues since you can't change your hitbox while colliding with something, it causes a lot of impossible to escape situations because you can't wiggle your hitbox to unstick yourself. The funny thing is laying down already displaces your collision/hitbox, so you can lay down, and back through geometry holes anyways.
Howitzers are too good and completely negate the gameflow.
Firebirds are absurdly annoying and need either a tweak to their target priorities or to their HP. Having two aimbot Firebirds staggered to ensure they are always firing, attacking you instead of the FNIX army and landing 10% of their shots as you run like a crazy person will still kill you rather fast due to being bullet+incendiary.
You can't move anything in the environment... like... at all. My player character can run full speed on a marathon of robot murder across Sweden in the winter while soaked and loaded with 6000 rounds of 9 mm and 60 RPG rounds (thats 164kg, or 329lbs of just the ammo) but can't move a small lamp and a 10kg box from in front of a door.
There was a room blockaded by a small box and a lamp.... Very Lame.
Also, most stores, all police HQs/firefighter stations are inaccessible, there also isn't a hospital.
There are a lot of areas that are totally locked off or empty; obvious locales for DLC, yes, but it causes issues when you are still playing the base game like I am.
There is no reliable and renewable source of cement.
No weapon crafting, despite being mentioned in game.
The TVs and Cars don't respawn.
Killing Rivals Lowers threat levels.
The core gameplay loop relies on the environment being made of unobtanium which can stop all weapons except for gas; but sniper rounds and howitzers can kill you through whole buildings. This is a major issue for me, since otherwise the AI doesn't behave like it always knows exactly where you are, but it is obvious that hunters and spetsnaz firebirds do. Which makes sense because they have OPV/thermal systems but there is no visual indicator for Howitzer shots.
Spetsnaz Lynx units are able to almost 1 shot you the instant you leave cover; I don't bother fighting the Spetsnaz unless I have a load of adrenaline handy. They and the other russian units are all balanced wrong for the player's physical abilities. I say this as someone who enjoys a good challenge and insurmountable odds, but the russian units dont beat you, you just can't beat them unless you have everything just right and even then they can still just one shot you through whole buildings.

some suggestions
The gameplay loop is best with the buildings how they are and the AI as it is; the buildings are not at all realistic, but things would not be fun if they were. Realistically speaking, a wooden barn would not do anything to stop... well... anything in this game. A Tank should be able to just run it over and most small arms would barely notice the wood; It may as well not be there vs 5.56 and above. Heck, a Runner could shoot down the door! 
The buildings being impermeable is vital to the loop as it exists right now, and that is why the Howitzers are so disruptive -in a bad way-. I actually like the solider firebird's gas attack; It keeps you moving but not in an overly disruptive way. The Howitzer would work better if it had a red laser light much like the sniper does, but also gives a decent idea of the AOE; Also, the Howitzer lug is 43kg and is launched at 472 m/s, why doesn't the Firebird get thrown backwards by this? 

More of the higher level bots should have gas based weapons, and use area denial techniques. The apocalypse units try to do this but just end up feeling weird. Like... A FNIX hunter with a prototype gaslauncher and the sniper rifle would be significantly more deadly... though I like the idea of having hunter squads; like maybe have just one grenadier with gas launchers or what not. 

anyways; I do love the game and plan to get the DLC
the rail gun is useless and doesn't go too far enough.
Seekers should definitely heal FNIX bots.
heals should be based on amounts and not %; I once had a run in with a rank 4 soldier wolf rival that I had completely disarmed but could not kill because it just spammed heals. A rank 6 SMG was able to burn it down by throwing walls of lead, but prior I had emptied about 30 RPG rounds to get it to 42% and 4000 7.62 with a rank 6 AG4 and... it was still at 42%. 
by keeping the heals at some flat rate you keep them relevant to the Lynx units without accidently making a Wolf (or tank/harvester) immortal.",1680451209,1680451226,True,6,1,0.59330141544342041,0,True,False,False

""I love the game concept and it's fun to play except it won't stay running.  The game constantly crashes within 1-5 minutes after load with a DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG.  It's a widely reported error that apparently has been happening UNRESOLVED for the last two years.  I've tried so many internet fixes for the error but so far none work.  If that issue ever gets fixed the game might be worth playing and downloading the DLC packs.""

My Updated Review: 
While the game still does have some major issue's with crashing I was able to search the internet and find some fixed that work allowing me to play 95% of the time for hours without crashing.  Not  what I should have to do to play a game but I did and it worked for me. 

I've played 180 hours so far and completed all the main and side missions and worthy DLC that I know of. The game has been very fun for the last 150 hours since fixing the steady crash issue. Missions are fun, finding notes that take you on alternate quests is fun and clearing as base or bunker to use as a return to point is rewarding.  Shooting and killing robots is just generally fun!  Sometimes they gang up on you and hunt you mercilessly showing that their AI isn't all that bad.  It can be frustrating sometimes when they're pounding you down but over time you'll learn patterns and how to kill them effectively while picking up skills and other items to help.  I recommend watching some video's by Tenebris Infinite which helped me succeed and enjoy the game. 

Overall I'd say this is a pretty good game game and so far  I'm please with the game play. I got it on super sale for about $5 ( Would have spent more if I had to) and took a chance even with the negative reviews.  I also picked up a couple DLC's which enhanced the fun and provided more missions.

-Whole ass RPGs

- Exceptional environment building and art direction deliver a vivid, desolate post-apocalyptic setting based in rural Sweden. Even today, one of the most immersive, good-looking open-world games ever made.

- Satisfying combat and gunplay; enemies are brutal especially on Guerrilla difficulty, and will require combined efforts, resources, a strategy and wise usage of cover to defeat. Knowing your foes is rewarded and encouraged.

- Enormous amount of content: quests, points of interest, side activities, collectibles, lore files and secrets to find. A vast open-world filled to the brim with interesting locations.

- High amount of collectible lore files that tell diverse stories about not only the catastrophe, but the inhabitants’ lives and their eventual fate. Those into reading will have their hands full.

- Solid variety of enemies that increase in challenge and diversify their attack patterns and capabilities as you explore farther regions.
[/td]
[td]
- Tremendous amount of annoying bugs and issues, ranging from minor UI problems to entirely broken quest-lines, borked hit registration, client desyncs, disappearing loot, random crashes and more.

- Inconsistent loot drops / materials economy that feel unrewarding compared to the effort: top-tier, difficult enemies and even Rivals often give useless trash that won’t reward the player appropriately, especially in late-game.

- Most skill tree specializations are gimmicky or useless. Only a few of them are truly worth investing into, with all the others being underwhelming in comparison.

- Base building is a waste of time and resources, doesn’t bring any convenience or bonus worth the expense and efforts to defend it from attacks. 

- Some weapon classes prove entirely useless throughout. Shotguns and pistols in particular have no reason to exist whatsoever, as they have no advantage over other gun types.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Generation Zero has one of the most extensive, realistic and impressive open-world settings you could hope to see anywhere. Miles and miles of countryside, and the occasional larger town, are dotted with the signs of destruction, but still maintain a natural beauty that feels eerie. It’s an impressive duality to have intense firefights in such an idyllic setting, a contrast that enhances both factors. The level of detail is remarkable, with each location having handcrafted parts that make it unique, and a good amount of Easter eggs, secrets and references untied to quests, there just for the sake of exploring.

The writing of the overall lore files, dialogues and story is passable but nothing exceptional. If anything, it makes up for it in sheer volume, and you’ll be able to understand several implied plots and schemes if you pay attention to all the hundreds of recordings and writings found all over. It’s interesting enough (at times), even if not great.

[h3]Exploration & Quests[/h3]
The world is massive and dotted with named points of interest, towns, bunkers and more. Between them you’ll discover Safe Houses, fast-travel hotspots that have a generous (but limited, and upgradeable) stash and various crafting benches, other than vehicle stations to spawn motorbikes and bicycles (they’re crap). There are tons of containers, lockers, bags, cars to loot and scavenge for ammo, crafting materials and loot - you’ll have to open thousands of containers to accumulate enough resources to survive. 

In many locations you’ll find side quests that will mostly task you with finding specific items, destroying a specific enemy, or racing a destination - they’re worthwhile as they represent the bulk of XP gain, but are rather monotonous in their objectives in the long run. Most are marked on your map, although some are obscure and I’ll admit we googled a few because we got stumped.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2949336701

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
The machines are relentless, programmed and built to kill, and you’re just a human. The superiority of your enemy in both numbers and ability is apparent from the start and this constant won’t change until much, much later. A few bullets are all that’s needed to take you down, and unless you get an adrenaline shot (rare / expensive if you have the recipe) you’ll have to respawn at a safehouse. Use cover, study each enemy type’s attack patterns and use consumables like flares, smoke grenades and fireworks to confuse the machines and gain valuable time for your attacks. 

Sometimes, fights draw neighboring machines which in turn alert even more, true mountains of spam that are better retreat from, and try again when things are quieter. Each enemy has unique weak spots you can exploit to permanently damage them, disabling weapons and components through precise and sustained shots. This mechanic is paramount to inflict enough damage to otherwise massive HP sponges. Later on, you may even draw machines of different factions to fight each other and just reap the loot.

[h3]Character Progression & Weapon Customization[/h3]
You’ll gain levels once enough XP is gathered, awarding one perk point to spend in one of the various specializations, with an “ultimate” perk at the end of each. Some focus on combat, others on utility like lockpicking or looting more ammo. Most of them are useless, and that only the combat and tech ones are worth a damn. Weapons have six rarity tiers, becoming better as you loot distant regions and kill more powerful foes, and can be customized with accessories like sights, compensators and more, also tiered in rarity.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2949336588

[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]
You'll be able to craft ammunition, consumables and utility items like a mobile respawn, if you have enough points to unlock the recipes. Points are accumulated by crafting lower-tier items and unlocking better ones, kinda like when you craft 500 iron daggers in Skyrim to grind blacksmithing. These diverse ammon types are better against armor, or may have special effects like fire, electricity, etc. but the latter can be very expensive and require rare resources. The economy in this regard is screwed, with some basic resources like Textiles (to make medkits you need to LIVE) being very scarce, while you’ll never have to worry about ammo ones.

Downsides are that most of the looting will be done on either destroyed robot/remaining human bodies and homes most of which are copy past and very few area's feel unique. The story has a cool hook of you in charge to find what happened to everyone and where did the robots' come from. At a certain point the story comes to a LONG go here clear it and do it again several more times before the story continues towards the end. (Still not there myself yet) but overall this idea is sold and the combat feels good and rewards map awareness and setting up traps for longer battles. You can't rush combat in most scenarios, harder fights might see you leave to return later but the damage you deal the enemy stay persistent and returning couple be the play when your better outfitted.",1680118981,1680118981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The concept of fighting a guerrilla war against machines that have taken over Sweden is very interesting and leaves alot of room for cool stuff. But the closest thing i got to guerilla warfare is sometimes putting explosives under robots to blow them up. 

The combat:
I dont have a problem (for the most part) with the combat. I like it actually. The guns are satisfying to use and the sounds design is great. I purposely dont put surpressors on my guns because i like the sound design of the guns that much. Besides surpressors dont do much for you. If you arent atleast 1000 meters away from a robot, whilst firing a silenced sniper, the machines will instantly spot you when you spot them. The game doesnt leave much room for stealth thanks to this, which in my opinion takes away from the game.

Also a small point, you are very squishy when it comes to combat. If i let a dog enemy fully empty a clip into me i die. Hopefully this problem will get better later in the game (10 hours in at the time of writing this) but i dont think the player should be squishy, especially when 10 hours into the game some fights contain over 20 dogs, 5 medium enemy's and multiple harvesters.

The inventory management:
Its pretty good. I like that you can craft ammo, and when you get the ammo gathering perk (forgot the official word) ammo isnt really a problem anymore as long as you loot the enemies you shoot.

The base building:
A bit dissapointing ngl. Some of the safe houses are giant bunkers, but they only serve as loot areas. You cant do anything in dept with them. 
The actual bases that you can build in are also pretty dissapointing. Yes you can build walls, but if you opt for the low cost ones (which mind you cost way too much for being low cost) they get destroyed after a couple shots. And the huts that have ai fighters shoot for you? die just as quick, making all the ammo and resources you put into them void.

The world:
I play on the lowest graphics and i still think the world is amazing. It looks very pretty and the attention to detail is clearly there. You can see this in the fact that almost every door is openable and every container is lootable. Stuff like this is a very good part of the game.

The story:
Not the best part of the game. Im sure some people like it but im not a fan. In the early game you save Therese a girl whose family was killed by robots. Eventually you get to a town where you go into a bunker which Therese thinks houses living people. When you enter Therese freaks out about a body you see. There are a couple things wrong with this interaction.

1. Many times during the trip to the bunker do you see dead bodies. Therese freaking out about this one is weird seeing as the player has already seen so many bodies. This brings me to my second point.

2. The player sees the body's, not Therese. How would Therese be able to see the body? The player character could've told her about it, but she reacts like she's right there. Who would react that dramatically to a body in a world where machines shoot people anyway. Therese's family was killed by machines, but no this one body, thats the one she freaks out about.

Also the program that gave every Swedish citizen military is very unrealistic. I get that they needed a reason why the player character can operate all these different weaponry but still. There would be people protesting the program (because everything is protested nowadays), not everyone would be comfortable shooting a gun. And what about the people that are physically incapable of firing a gun? Not my biggest problem with the game but its there.

The guerrilla warfare:
nonexistent. With Guerrilla warfare i think of hit and run missions led by a roup of rebels. Not a high schooler and a hip hop enjoyer (the characters me and my friend play as). They couldve done alot more with this in my opinion.

The vehicles:
Are fucking weird man. The bycicle stops if you drive up a hill of 20 degrees. And the motorcycle is 10 km/h faster than a fucking bike. They couldve really made the vehicles faster because right now they're not very fun to drive seeing as you slow down to 30 km/h if you drive off-road with the motorcycle.

Overall i think the game is fun. It's enjoyable to play coop (dont know if i'd play it solo) and the vehicle physics are sometimes pretty funny. Gunplay is satisfying and the world looks pretty. The base is there, but so much more could've been done. It feels like they ran out of time making this.",1680094118,1680094118,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the game has updated and now you have to make an account to play the game was not part of the game when i bought it. should be illegal to do this. i want the developer to give me my money back!

would be nice to pick a maybe. the game seems ok. i just hate having to do the same thing over and over. the save game function in this game sucks. you can not save when you want or need but only saves when you reach a certain spot. i have work and a family and sometimes i have to stop a game for any number of reasons but coming back to a game later just to have to do the same thing again sucks. i have not gotten far in the game so i can not say for sure yes or no. but from what i have played for me it is a no.

edit dec 18/2019

i will edit my review i had refunded the game after my last try playing. but the game kept sitting in the back of my mind. i really like the style and the idea of the game. so here i am buying the game again and here i am again wishing i had not. now i have played too long to refund and i must keep the game. i will say the reason now for my dislike of the game is still the same the save function sucks. and it has now been compounded on. if you want to start over with a new game good luck. my game had glitched were i could not use all the weapons i had. it was in my save so no matter what i did i could not use my best gun it was there and it was in my weapon slot but nothing would happen when i press the button for that weapon. i wanted to try starting over from the beginning but oh no you can not do that even with a new char. the game every time will start my new char at the same point i left off with my first game. but now all the loot boxes and other loot locations are all empty. delete this game again almost thinking of asking steam to remove the game from my library.",1553771148,1680052611,False,3,0,0.525268018245697021,0,True,False,False

Story : I don't play story mission much, was doing more exploring and grinding. So, no comment on the story.

Visual : 
-The environment is great, however my laptop gpu would still render the fog even if i put fog settings to OFF.
-The weapon is not much but quite hard to get the best version of each weapon, the variety is okay for maybe multiple different playstyle or approach.
-The enemy design is amazing.
-Even though the buildings and trees mostly look the same, it is still good quality.

This game has no real plot, which makes the repetitiveness (enter a territory, kill a bunch of robots to get pass codes to bunker, turn on power in bunker, pick up 2-3 ""missions"" which have you killing some robots at a location) a bore. You find out along the way what's happening and why, but there's no driving force. Why are you, the PC, bothering to do any of this? You should be trying to escape the area with anyone you happen to run into. The who, what, how, and why of what happens doesn't mean anything if you're not trying to get away from it. I gave up playing after my third region when nothing seemed to be advancing the PC's escape. 

The combat is fine. Get guns, shoot robots, run or sneak around them. There isn't a way to save the game manually or go back if you screw something up - missions will get bugged and you may have to start the game anew unless you mod it - and pausing the game doesn't really pause the game.

Overall, I found it fun to play, engaging and I found myself looking forward to playing it next. A key decider in whether a game passes the mark. Here's the good and the bad:

Good stuff
> Reasonable story arch, which is compelling, especially in the first 30% of the game
> I do really like the puzzle type approach to figuring out the story and what's happening, that's something that motivated me to keep coming back - it was to find out what was happening
> The use of atmosphere, the score and sounds are epic - I would be walking around my local shopping centre hear a noise and my immediate reaction was to crouch to hide from the nearby tank machine! It really got in my head, very well done on that front.
> I played this on a low end machine. I imagine on a higher end machine it would look fantastic.
> Voice acting works and sounds good
> Game mechanics are good and work well, they don't hinder the game play experience

Not so good stuff
> Ending is pretty poor, the antagonist suddenly makes themselves known which feels disjointed and rushed
> Gameplay can be repetitive in terms of variety of missions and side missions
> Exploration can be tedious unless you are making full use of the transport options
> An incredibly large amount of bugs - missing scenery, poor AI interaction with environment and the animations around cycling are just incomplete
> Story starts off well, goes a bit AWOL in the middle and then picks up a little towards the end
> Low weapon selection
> Playing it multiplayer probably offers a much richer experience, I played the whole thing solo

So I'm a Swede who grew up as a teenager i the 80's in a small/middle sized Swedish town and the graphics and sounds are absolutely spot on, in fact so good that you for long moments forget about modern technology such as Internet and smartphones. Brilliant

There's a thin storyline when starting out which makes you get the understand the basics pretty quickly, mechs have invaded the archipelago and it's your job to stop this. Fair enough...

My biggest points of criticism are:
- It's not very easy to understand what to do with the raw materials that you loot from the destroyed mechs. I guess you have to have experience from games such as Rust or DayZ. At least that's my guess after seeing my boys play these games.

- It is quite obvious that the offline single player part is not so much game-tested as it suffers from balance in the game proggression. I still don't get it what strategy I should adopt to succeed.

- The respawning of mechs in already ""conquered"" parts of the map is just boring, at one part of the map I keep strafing into the tunnel in the cliff to avoid beeing hit and making the mechs line up. But by doing this I realized that they actually respawn when i retreat far enough in the tunnel, duh!!!

- I still play ""easy"" and it's still a tad too hard, my ammo depleats faster that the respwaning of mechs.

As a summary if you are a teenager with a large amount of freetime hours at your disposal I guess this offers something but if you are a fulltime working dad with a couple of hours here and there, this game does not offer any ""casual"" game mode.
Funny that this game offers a trip down the memory lane for a generation X person but it's name is ""Generation Z"", go figure...

The only thing I would recommend is a in game voice chat system. This is due to having to type increases time you spend not shooting the enemies that are trying to kill you. Although I have not found a game even close to this quality in a long time. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes a high quality first person shooter. From what I understand this game is still in development to an extent. Meaning more content, patches, bug fixes, and maybe more features later on. But that is just what I have heard. I have found many of those who gave a bad review that ""I have met in game"" had bought it understanding that it would not be a play style they enjoy. So don't listen to the reviews only, give the game a try if you think you might enjoy this style of game play.

The damage models, and physics are extremely well done. The explosives are very realistic as far as area of effect, and graphics / physics are very high quality. But you don't need a top end machine to run it, you can run it on a 3 or 4 year old machine without to many issues.

One thing that I can say needs work is the inventory system, right now organization is a bit of pain. But other than that I find it one of the best games I have played in a long time.

Still loving this game, took a short break due to playing other games with friends and came back loving it even more. Got a friend who thought he would not like it to try it out. He now greatly enjoys the game but he said he still likes shooting squishies instead of robots. But he is starting to love the game as a whole.

Game still needs work on the inventory organization. Like being able to sort types of ammo, or category of items like med kits vs explosives. But that is small stuff compared to other things.",1556557098,1679885110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you leave the archipelago, you are in for a world of hurt.  Every robot you come across will take hundreds of rounds of ammunition to destroy.  Robots have no indication that they're damaged.  I just launched 11 rocket launcher rounds into a single robot without it buckling.  I then hit it with 200 rounds of AP 7.62mm ammunition, and it still had no signs of damage or smoke or anything.  It's completely and totally absurd.  I'm playing on normal difficulty.  There are flying robots.  I literally shot one with 800 rounds of AP 7.62mm ammunition, 3 rocket launchers, and 4 shotgun rounds before it came out of the sky.  That's like 3 hours of looting.  And these robots are UNAVOIDABLY EVERYWHERE.  This game isn't fun when you're looting.  You're just holding E then pressing R to take all over and over and over and over.  Then your storage at your main hub has a weight limit as well, so you have to worry about not having enough room to stockpile things.  There's a base building component to the game, but wood seems to be one of the rarest things to find even though you're literally in forested countryside.  It's just not good.

You expend tons and tons and tons of ammunition to take down ONE of the group of robots that came walking/flying through the town you're looting.

The multiplayer has desync problem which causes you to constantly be pushed by other players and also you pushing others without even realizing it. This is bearable, but very annoying.

Their DLCs are just horrible as well. Majority of them should've been just content updates to the game, but the money hungry devs decided that they're better off being DLCs.

First issue are reused assets, everything look very similar, you loot the same cars, buildings, bunkers. The map is huge but point of interest are copy-paste. This is why I prefer beautifully crafted semi-open world games instead of soulless open world games like this. 

Unrewarding loot. Loot is simplistic, containers and backpacks are everywhere. I reach the point that I didnt want to loot at all, I just wanted to finish the mission and I completely skipped containers, rooms etc. Quality of the loot also affects crafting, its very basic. You can craft ammo, medkits and some other basic items. I have to highlight that I love loot/crafting games but this one is one of the worst and boring games in that aspect.

AI of robots. Yeah... gameplay also sucks hard. AI is terrible, easily exploitable by the player, robots are very often stuck in one place, they struggle to move around corners, they cannot enter many places in the world. The gunplay is bland, its not fun at all.

It follows the typical an open world formula and incorporates the typical ""looter shooter""-mechanics. So with that in mind, if you're not into that kind of games this is not the one for you.

I have burned out a bit on that repeating gameplay loop and struggled to get into this game but as the art style and theme of the game I decided to give it a good try. It has definitely its shortcomings and issues, such as for me the initial walking speed for your character made it essentially to more of a walking simulator, spending way too much time traveling and looking for elements of a backstory in game. After upgrading walking speed, stamina etc. it became more manageable, still not good but I could live with it.

This game needs you to be interested in the setting of game and forgiving for you to like it. But if you do want a game set in Sweden during that period with some robots, the options out there are limited, but you will enjoy this game. 

I played this game strictly as a single player game and on the easiest difficulty setting as my goal was not to play it as a grinding looter shooter but more as a story driven game.

The theme of the game and art are reminiscent of Sci-Fi classics like Tripods and the robots look great. Also the base game world itself is excellent although there is no real game play dimension to the natural environment apart from collecting sticks. So the problem is that the game is otherwise unfinished and particularly the single player game being really bad. The assets for the non natural environment, buildings and so on, are in very short supply to the point of feeling like a 20 year old shooter. %90 of Sweden was built by IKEA apparently? Juxtapose that with an abundance of military crates of ammo lying around everywhere and it has a very silly feel to it and it occurs to you that the developers either ran out of time or didn't bother. When it comes to combat its seems clear they couldn't figure out what to do with cover and they probably should have had something like partially destructible buildings? But instead to prevent the player cheesing combat too often they made up for that with explosions that clip through walls and seem to have a bizarre radius's in some situations and also the Robots clip through walls to do melee attacks which looks really bad. But what really did it for me was some of the slightly later game robots which can target you while your taking cover like magic basically. Without high velocity guns and with no line of sight It seemed like I was being chased around to different positions and whipped by invisible enemies and I realised the game is just too silly at that point.

I bought the game and right after installation it prompts you to either create a temporary or permanent account.
The temporary way seems to be ok as you do not share extra information. But after that you have to accept the collection of data. And daaamn those are many, I read through the whole text and decided to deinstall and refund the game rightaway.
Why do they need my browser history and details, why all my hardware specs (which would be the only thing I am ok to share btw), why do they need to know my geo location and it goes on and on. Furthermore, they do not directly sell your data, but they share it with all partners, which is again a big list.
I know, some will say, if you have nothing to hide whats you problem. This is not the point, this is about why giving away data for free. I paid the game! If it is F2P I would understand it better.

I recommend buying on sale at a price point that denotes the bits of inconvenience you may experience playing it.

CONSTANTLY CRASHES
I have tried a few times to play this game and I haven't made it through the tutorial portion because it crashes either just before or just after discovering the church (start of the game basically). There are numerous other users with the same problem.

From what I played it looked nice, seemed fun, and had a lot of things probably would have liked, but it is way too unstable to play.  I can't even start from a save game because the crash wipes that out and corrupts the auto save, which really sucks because there isn't an option for manual saving and no workarounds.

I'm running a PC with Intel i9-11900KF @ 3.5GHz with 16GB of RAM, NVIDIA GeFoerce RTX 3080, along with plenty of storage space on my SSD drives.  I've tried different settings and toning down the graphics to see if that helps, but no luck.

I asked a friend if he'd like to play this as a co-op game because we both like the stealth genre, with games such as Payday 2 and GRWildlands. So far in this play through, apart from being able to attach a silencer, it does not feel stealthy at all. The robots seem to detect the player's movement no matter what the player does, and being grouped together, shooting at an enemy just alerts all other enemies, at which point the stealth element is lost. There's also no option to try to sneak around robots during missions, you can only choose to fight them, which was disappointing.

We haven't come across any game-breaking bugs so far, but we did come across a sound bug which made it sound like there was an enemy constantly running at us at full force in certain locations.

My friend also pointed out another part of the game which was quite tedious which was the menus. There are [i]so many menus[/i]. Some of the interfaces are also pretty confusing, such as the looting system and inventory. First of all, the game at the start feels like a looting simulator because there's [i]so[/i] much stuff that can be picked up - it's insane. For each lootable object, a new UI appears in which you have to press another button to pick everything up, or keep spamming E, which for the amount of loot that can be found becomes repetitive and annoying very quickly. Then when trying to equip items to the on-hand inventory, it seems there's no easy way to rearrange items in the wheel, and often I need to scroll around to find what I'm looking for because it's buried under a mound of loot.

As I said at the start, this game feels like it could have a lot of potential, but unfortunately (for us) this game doesn't live up to the expectations we had.

For the meantime, we are having some fun aimlessly running around shooting robots, but I'm not sure how long this will last if this is the only thing that's keeping us entertained.

There are some drawbacks. First, you get hung up on door frames and such way too often. 

This is basically an open world RPG. Well, RPG much like the last few Assassin's Creed games. No real choices. On second thought, imagine a Swedish version of Far Cry. There you go. 

On the plus side, I love the gun play. The recoil? The feel of the guns? Amazing. Really, really good. Combat is hard. I love the fact that there's a real chance of death on the harder difficulties. Enemy AI is ok. Not great. There's a real risk of running out of ammo. Challenging. 

The map is huge. Enemy variety is pretty limited though. But the world is built very well, and there's a lot to do. 

There's skills, guns, gun add-ons (again, think Far Cry, not Tarkov), and crafting. And loot. Soooo much loot. Here, think Fallout 4. You're going to be grabbing sooo many of the same objects.

Pros:
+ Visuals/Graphics
+ Limited skill points encourages different play styles/builds

Cons:
- The game tries too hard to be a bit of everything. Is it supposed to be casual or realistic?
- You can complete objectives by running around with health packs (Normal/Skirmish difficulty)
- Damage calculation & resistances are too vague.
- skill trees may need some rework as some skills are a bit lacklustre

The only things I consider to be serious cons to Generation Zero are the lack of weapon and general loot variety, and the cosmetics system. The cosmetics (clothing, makeup, hats, yadda yadda yadda) are... fine, but it's clear that there was some disagreement among the developers as to what the tone of the game should be. The 80's setting and the cosmetics choices indicate a ""whacky and zany homage to iconic films of the 80s like E.T.!"" on one hand, but in every other way, the game has a somber post-apocalyptic feel that takes itself seriously. I wish it had gone fully one way or the other.

traversal, stealth mechanics coupled with investing points into the right skills/trees, can feel very intense when you're crawling through a ditch past a patrol of robots and very rewarding once you've made it past. if not and you're detected, the gunplay is solid with it's respective skill trees as well (can be reset at the cost of a rare resource), weapons feel great to shoot and modify/upgrade. machine combat seems tough at first but there are hints to weak spots painted in some locations you should keep an eye out for (or if you're sly you can avoid most combat all together)
vehicle travel on some terrain is... hilariously dangerous. I highly suggest riding a bicycle down a mountain.

character customization is bland at the beginning because as you explore and loot you'll actually discover a variety of different cosmetic options, some of which can actually be upgraded to provide different buffs.

some glitches with ai and buildings not protecting from enemy detection and/or damage as it should here and there, but if you're smart about your healing you can overcome the unseen malicious machines in this game as well as the seen.

I ended up enjoying it so much that as soon as the free-to-play weekend was done I immediately bought the game.  Its surpassed my expectations again and again and is just fun as hell to play.  I love the idea of being able to roam around a MASSIVE map on my own, finding cool s**t, uncovering the story, dodging enemies and having some crazy firefights.  The inventory system can be a little wonky, and the crafting system is not so good, so I just don't use it; however, the gunplay is great and really packs a punch with the various firearms, theres a variety of cool weapons, attachments, and other loot to find (such as car batteries and EMP devices you can use to disrupt and take out the robots, as well as radios and other noisemakers you can use to draw enemies in a certain direction).  Like pretty much every game nowadays, there's an experience point system you use to earn Skill Points that you can spend on upgrades for you character. The upgrades available are what you'd expect, with skill trees for combat, support, health, etc...The game isn't super generous with giving players XP, so it does take a bit of grinding to earn those Skill Points.

All in all, this is a great game that I highly recommend checking out.  For me, it checks all the boxes for what I would want in an open-world apocalyptic FPS

Map is huge with a variety of locations, terrain and wether. Urban, rural, industrial, mountains, forrests, summer wether, winter wether, you name it, its there. Planty of beautiful sceneries and loot to find and the odds of getting more exotic gear are not completely stacked against you like in some of the other games i played. 

Fights are fun, and even when you get your hands on some of the more powerful gear, with weapon in every slot, they are still challenging. 
I was a bit confused when confronting my first enemies, since hits doesn't give you a clear feedback on whether you just scratched them or dealt serious damage, but once you get a hang of it and figure out the weak spots and which ammo type to use in a given situation it gets easier. I just wish the aim of the enemies was more predictable and constant. Mobility is a key to survive in this game. Enemies struggle to hit you when you're constantly moving. Theres a rythm to it. But sometimes it feels like they subscribed to Perfect Aim and out of nowhere, in a middle of the fight, wipe you out with a single shot. A bit annoying.

The game is set in 1980s Sweden, where players are stranded and alone, fighting against deadly machines. The graphics are stunning, with a detailed open-world environment that is both beautiful and terrifying. The sound design is equally impressive, with the sound effects and music adding to the tension and excitement of the game.

The gameplay is challenging, with a mix of stealth, strategy, and action that keeps players engaged throughout. The enemies are formidable, and players must use their wits and skills to defeat them. The game also offers a variety of weapons and equipment to choose from, which can be upgraded and customized to suit players' play styles. The multiplayer mode adds another layer of excitement to the game, allowing players to team up and take on the machines together.

One of the best aspects of Generation Zero is its attention to detail. The game's world is rich with lore and backstory, and players can discover clues and piece together the story as they explore. The game also offers a range of side quests and missions, which provide additional challenges and rewards. Overall, Generation Zero is a must-play for fans of first-person shooters and open-world games.

not all negative though the levelling, perks and openness to approach any mission however you want was really fun and well put together, the different classes of robots are all interesting in their own way, the setting is pretty cool and some of the weapons are really fun to use. at times when you are attacked suddenly by an enemy that you are not equipped to fight efficiently it can get scary and i love it, it also means you have to think a lot more strategically and tactically before getting into most fights, especially early in the game. 6/10 held back by the story.

If I'm understanding correctly, it's made by Systemic Reaction which is a subsidiary of Avalanche Studios Group- Avalanche Studios being the developer of the Just Cause games. That information isn't necessarily pertinent, it's just something I want to throw out to say: Systemic Reaction is potentially a decently sized team and studio. I was under the impression that Generation Zero (from now on shortened to ""GZ"") was made by an indie developer. Not sure where I got that notion, but here we are.

GZ is heavily optimized in very specific areas. 

The guns are easily the best part of the whole game. Every gun looks, sounds, and feels almost lifelike- to me who has only ever shot a crossbow.

The enemies are very interesting. Robots of varying size and function that are made up of components and armour. Components are the lifeblood of the mechanical threat- the squishier bits that help the robots move and perform certain actions. If you're fighting a robot with artillery-style missile launchers on its back, consider shooting them so the robot is unable to fire missiles! Certain ammo types work better against armour plating and are terrible for component damage and vice-versa. 

The voice acting is... Pleasantly bad. In English that is. It really sounds like the English dub actors are Swedish people who took English in college and went to America once for a Summer vacation as children. As English is my first language I can obviously tell the dialogue is a bit off- but it actually adds to the overall atmosphere of the game! I know this goes against the presented story but I roleplay as an American in my mind who doesn't know Swedish and the local population is kind enough to talk to me in a language I understand because I'm great at firing guns.

Speaking of, the story didn't really grab me. It's okay enough with some interesting elements here and there, but it feels more like a means to an end. A reason to move you on to the next battle.

Bugs and glitches are unfortunately common. Nothing EXTREMELY egregious, but mainly just movement issues. It's very easy to get caught on walls or on stairs the wrong way. Be very careful of crouching to get into tents and corners of rooms. You may be stuck there without explosives to blast you out.

Very fun with friends!

Bad, verey spread out at times, pickups being stuck in geometry all the time not allowing you to finish an area.

While the game itself is definitely in a much better state than when I first played it around launch,
It's still far from being worth any time or money investment.

The looting is still pretty underwhelming. Pretty much all static weapon spawns as far as I've seen are always a tier 1 version of whatever you find so trying to find all the weapons at a point of interest is pretty pointless.
Collectibles basically only exist for people who want a collectathon. 
Finding schematics is largely pointless since the schematics that matter can be easily farmed by crafting (Ammo, DLC, Equipment schematics)

The general item economy is pretty screwey too since early game I seemed to have plentiful healing items and struggled with ammo, but later game this was reversed. More ammo and crafting ingredients than I could possibly ever use but difficulties maintaining a steady supply of healing items. Not that it really mattered since I always had enough to get me by.

The actual combat of the game definitely seems to be where the game received the most improvement overall, but again still leaves a want for more. In the earlier stages of the game fighting lower tier robots can be quite satisfying as finding out their weaknesses and focusing your fire on those parts can usually kill most low tier bots (even larger ones) in 1-3 hits with a high powered weapon (Hunting Rifles, Anti-Material Rifle)
However as the game progresses and you start fighting the higher tier variants of the bots, the game becomes a bit more annoying as bots start becoming bullet sponges to all but the highest damage weapons. Nothing like unloading 40+ .50 BMG on one robots weak point just to take it down.
Granted you could also just as easily use a high DPS weapon like an AR or an LMG and kill them much faster.
If nothing else though at least the most of the smaller high tier bots can still be one-shot by high damage weapons, though at that point they can be one shot by nearly any weapon regardless.
However the high tier armored ""Ticks"" are an absolute ball-ache to fight as most high tier enemies continuously spawn them and each Tick takes a minimum of 2 hits to kill (One to break armor, one to kill, even with .50 BMG Armor Piercing ammo) Unless of course you're lucky enough to be behind them to hit their weak spot. But even then the hit boxes are wonky which often prevents you from hitting their weak spot.
One additional note for the combat system is the 'feedback' for when you're [i]actually[/i] dealing damage to enemies is hard to gauge. While I love the shower of sparks and electricity you get when landing shots on (what I've assumed are vitals), it's hard to tell if you're actually dealing any significant damage, or even why sometimes. Or even more so if shooting one vital is better than shooting another when both seem to yield the same amount of sparks and electricity.
But even once more further than that is the damage feedback on structures, which is basically entirely absent save for some cracks that start to appear once you've dealt [i]enough[/i] damage. For a while I didn't even know you could damage enemy structures until I just tried doing an absolutely ridiculous amount of damage to something.
Even for structures that are specifically designed to be destroyed (sections of walls with EMP or Explosive tanks mounted on them) it was hard to gauge if my attacking them mattered at first since there's no distinguished feedback for damaging the tanks up until they exploded.

One small note about the weapon handling is that it's pretty abysmal if I'm honest. I mean I've seen worse for sure, but it's still pretty rough. Especially for scopes/optic (Yes singular optic, as there's only one in the game) since the guns jitter around [i]a lot[/i] while aiming. This is especially annoying for sniping at further ranges as trying to hit a small target while your gun and reticle spazzes out is very annoying. Though I think this largely stems from how the Dev(s) handle the FP model for your characters hands/animation etc. Particularly with how they render the optic and scopes (which is to say painfully wrong both from a real-world perspective and a game dev perspective). That is to say the reticle is basically just [i]painted[/i] on to the glass like something you'd see from a PS1 game, and when you ADS it basically just ramps your FOV and moves the gun in front of your face.
Not even mentioning weird lighting [i]completely[/i] blotting out your reticle at times because again the way they render their scopes/optic (still singular) is flat out wrong in all regards.

Even the whole Rivals system, while an interesting enough concept, ultimately feels lackluster. The Rivals themselves were just standard enemies with more health and a special name. Rarely did I ever really feel compelled to fight rivals since the loot they drop was often mediocre, and they really never had any impact on the game otherwise, save for the few story missions that force you fight some. Other than that the only time I really bothered to fight them was when they started fighting me, or they happened to be on my way to an objective.

Not to mention the actual enemy variety. Not counting variants, there are maybe, 6-7 types of bots in the game. Of which each type are effectively beaten the exact same way across all their variants. Interesting at first, painfully repetitive in the long run and the variants do precious little spice up combat outside of being more bullet spongey.

Then there's the 'base building' system and the defense of said base. Again, another interesting enough concept, but still feels largely pointless. The rewards are pretty underwhelming yet again, mostly crafting resources (of which I already have basically unlimited quantities), along with whatever loot you scrounge off the bots you defeat.
Even the base assault missions where you attack enemy bases is just painfully tedious for little to no real reward.

Almost forgot general character progression like leveling and skills. Leveling up is very tedious, some skills are basically mandatory, and by the time I finished playing my character felt more like they were finally where they should have started at stat-wise, rather than being a very high-level and experienced robot genocider. Suffice to say underwhelming and lackluster.

Plus let us not forget the story, what precious little there is.
Not to sound like a broken record but once again, ""Interesting enough concept but...""
The story is painfully short as I've already beaten the game within my ~26 hours of playtime Which includes previous playtime from the initial release version of the game as well as hours of avoiding the main quest to begin with. But I found once I actually dug myself into the story, I finished it in maybe less than 8 hours. (Once I'd gotten past all the tutorial missions ofc)
Suffice to say in terms of 'content' there's very little, and the plot is okay but the ending is embarrassingly anti-climactic.
While I was fortunate enough to get the ""complete"" edition on-sale for ~$30 USD (Add ~$11 USD more for a DLC pack that wasn't included with the 'complete' edition), the non-sale price of ~$76 USD for the ""complete"" edition (again add ~$11 USD for the missing DLC) is absolutely insulting for content that should be included with the base game to begin with.

So bottom line, if the game still feels hollow and lackluster with upwards of ~$87 USD worth of 'content', the base game will feel absolutely destitute at $25 USD.",1553764624,1678623864,False,2,0,0.486951082944869995,0,True,False,False

It has potential to be a great game, but with all the tedious mechanics and bullet sponge enemies with crap loot, making the game exhausting and boring for a time. My friends can't keep on playing this game.",1678239791,1678239791,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the tricky one, generationz zero is hard for me to review because its clearly a coop game but I couldn't get my roommates to play it, as they were too busy not washing dishes and smoking odd herbs, so I play and beat it alone in my dark room, blackout curtains down, door locked, immersed for hours spraying bullets at robots, ignoring all else except for to do pushups and drink my smoothies (orange juice, bananas, unflavored whey, oatmeals, this is my cheapest meal recipe for you to try) 

Where do I begin with the gen Z, You get all manner of weaponry, rifles, pistols, big rifle, but none feel powerful, I'm spraying hundreds of rounds of 7.62 at these ghouls and nothing happens, I'm supposed to find power guns but nothing drops, It's dark and lonely, my roommates are screaming, dogs are barking, the roommates are playing dance dance revolution now, it's vibrating my walls. Overstimulated and undermedicated I sink into a “fugue state” what comes next is a man searching for experimental weapons for hours, days? The femboy protagonist finds yet another skirt while salvaging the wreckage of a UFO, I don't know how long this has gone on for.

It begins very strong, with an interesting mysterious story, very large map, not much weapon variety, I wish there were animals roaming around, there sure are a lot of barns.

I enjoyed what I played but I was getting burned out near the end, every skirmish seemed the same, I'd sprint around in circles, spraying bullets and healing myself until the robot was ash and the conflict was sorted, you are meant to hit weakpoints but the most common enemy is a running guy, all his weakpoints are merely a suggestion because shooting his head is the most efficient way. Still this kept me going for 81 hours, mainly because I was looking for the perfect outfit for my cute boy.

There are Spider Bots, Running guy, tall bots, large guy, and flying ones too, you shoot them until they are no more, I feel that there are too many enemies when playing solo, and my vision darkens from the commotion.

Con (3)
-Too many enemies spawning
-RNG unfavorable
-I shoot 1400 bullets during one fight

Pro (4)
-Reminds me of Binary Domain (very good game)
-I completed my search for the perfect outfit
-I don't feel bad for my enemy as they are all without souls
-you can ride a bike

I give this game a 6.5 out of ten, my 6.5 is a real 6.5 and not a false 6.5 that other reviewers might give,  my 6.5 may be analogous to somebody else's 7.5 rating, With a con of (3) and a pro of (4) I give this game a regular score!

Set in a stunningly rendered alternate 1980s Sweden, players find themselves battling against an army of malevolent robots in a vast open-world environment.

From the moment you set foot in this world, it's clear that the developers have put an incredible amount of effort into creating something truly special. The game's aesthetic is nothing short of breathtaking, with the lush Swedish landscape and menacing robots rendered in stunning detail. The game's sound design is also top-notch, perfectly capturing the eerie atmosphere of this world.

But it's not just the game's aesthetic that makes it stand out. The gameplay mechanics are refreshingly different, with players having to carefully strategize and think on their feet to survive against the game's challenging opponents. The game's open-world design also encourages exploration, with players free to wander and discover hidden secrets and treasures throughout the game world.

Of course, no game is perfect, but it's clear that the developers have put a great deal of thought into addressing player feedback and improving the game. Bugs and glitches are few and far between, and the game's combat mechanics are well-balanced and satisfying.

All in all, Generation Zero is a truly promising game that sets a new standard for the first-person shooter genre. Stylish, immersive, and refreshingly different, it's a must-play for anyone looking for a truly unique gaming experience. Highly recommended!",1678145530,1678145530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think this game is very underrated, and although it may have had a rough start, it's quite a lot of fun. Sure there are some minor bugs, but it's nothing I'm not used to seeing in similar games like STALKER for example, which had more issues than this game does in my opinion. If you can stomach the bugs in that, the occasional bug in GZ shouldn't hold you up too much. 

Right from the start, I want to say the sound design is what mainly caught my attention. The guns sound MEATY. They sound like they actually pack a punch. The shotguns are particularly satisfying to fire. The robots make creepy electronic growls and clicks. Heavy footsteps from the larger bots are unnerving from afar, and downright terrifying when they're stomping around near the house you're holed up in. One of the most fun and nerve-racking experiences I have had from this game was being chased into a house by several robotic dogs and large bipedal mechs and hunkering down while they sieged it. The sound of windows shattering, explosions of the rockets, and robotic chatter made it feel like being in a sci-fi horror battlefield. The one thing I felt was missing was the robots actually breaking in. Usually if you can get into a building, it's rare they will actually enter it, though they will surround it and change their positions to try to flank you constantly, and often try to use gas grenades to flush you out. Visually this game doesn't look bad either, and I think damage on the robots is modeled pretty well.  

The larger enemies in this game can be tanky and a bit bullet-spongey, if you don't know where to hit them. It makes sense that a heavily armored machine is going to take a lot of firepower to bring down. It can be a bit intimidating and sometimes frustrating at first, but after a while you learn what weak points to look for and which weapons are most effective against certain bots. You get plenty of tools to use against them, and leveling the crafting system really helps. There is a good blend of stealth and outright combat too, without being too restricted to one or the other. The open world is pretty large, and traversing it isn't too cumbersome, especially with a bicycle and motorcycle available for riding around. 

I haven't noticed too many performance issues, though one of my friends did get the black-screen issue where the game would load up, but all he saw was a black screen with audio. Restarting his computer fixed it fine though. There are sometimes odd glitches I encountered playing co-op where certain things wouldn't sync correctly. Most notably, I was in a fight with one of the larger tank robots, and my buddy couldn't see it all, despite practically standing right next to this huge behemoth that was firing rockets at me. So far I've only seen this happen once though. Other weirder, less game-affecting bugs included sometimes not seeing another player on their bike when they ride it, resulting in what looks like a possessed bicycle rolling around with no rider. That aside, I've yet to find anything that made me too frustrated to play or that was particularly bad enough to make me stop playing. I have the game installed on my SSD and it loads into the game incredibly fast for such a large world to render. I've been having a lot of fun playing what I can describe as sort of a mash-up of Left 4 Dead, Stranger Things, and Short Circuit.",1678068922,1678068991,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As a survivor, you must scavenge for resources, fight off machines, and uncover the secrets of what happened to the world.

One of the game's strengths is its world-building, with a rich and detailed environment that feels like a true alternate history. The graphics are stunning, and the sound effects and music create a sense of isolation and danger as you explore the world.

The game's combat system is also well-designed, with a variety of weapons and abilities that can be used to defeat machines. The different types of machines each have unique abilities and weaknesses, requiring you to adapt and strategize as you face them.

The game also offers a variety of different modes, including singleplayer and multiplayer, as well as different difficulty levels to cater to different playstyles. The multiplayer aspect is particularly engaging, with the ability to form squads and work together to explore and conquer the world.

One potential downside to the game is that it can be quite challenging, especially for solo players. The game's difficulty can be unforgiving, and the machines can be tough to take down without a coordinated effort. However, with practice and teamwork, the game offers a deeply rewarding and immersive survival experience.

Overall, ""Generation Zero"" is an excellent survival game that will appeal to fans of the genre. With its rich world-building, engaging combat mechanics, and immersive multiplayer, it's a great choice for anyone who wants to experience a unique alternate history and survive against hostile machines.

The enemies have god-like senses that can penetrate nearly every object and terrain type. Ran into my first bi-pedal enemy who proceeded to lose sight of me, unknown to me that it was still following me even after ducking into a building, and then clip into the wall and fire it's gun that didn't hurt me. Eventually it's head clipped through so I could 1 shot it in the face with a shotgun.

Side note: The animation and sound design for the bi-pedal enemy didn't match up to it's dimensions at all, with really quick running animations and speed paired with the lack of a thud as it sprinted, it felt really weak.

---Things I liked:
*The first instance of the game world in the first area is pretty cool. I liked the little set pieces of dead humans, blood and de-activated robots from the skirmishes that have happened.
*The foggy weather adds a nice atmosphere, too bad it is ruined by robots seeing you from a mile away through several bushes.

Overall, the game feels pretty rushed and lacks any stand-apart features and as a fan of robots and androids (2B best thicc android IMO) I feel let down.

Refund requested :(

Edit:
The previous issues that I found, aside from the slightly weak sound design of the hunters running, have been met with updates, fixes and a lot of expansion in the ways of things to do, enemy types, QOL changes and DLC. I've gotten lots of fun out of just travelling around on my motorcycle and reigning chaos down on the robots, let alone still trying to complete the story missions.

like first Aim is not precise don't work good and  iron sight is blured  optical sight is far to working precise and realistic. Well i don't know if you are guys been in army or ever used real weapons  but this is very far of how look real weapons iron sight and how working optical sights too . Second balanced of damage  and used ammo is pathetic and ridiculous i spent more of 4000 AP ammo plus over 50  rockets all with full hit in center on one of tanks and he is still been so nice live without any signet of damage and continued to kill me so i just abandoned game.Maybe your guys is forget what is mean word game? Game must be funny not frustrating 
Well another ridiculous thing is  weapon lots so rare is possible found good weapons and equimpent i finish game with usless and ridiculous equipment based on 2 and 3 stars. I pay for 2 weapons DLC and what you are give me 3 star weapons  LoL
Often it is all useless weapons and equipment  with one or two star just wondering  what is point of game frustrate players ? Hitting for half hour one tank can't kill him and just leave game ?It is not fun for sure . for all game time i found only couple 4 stars and couple 5 stars weapons never found 6 stars  see them only in youtube. Another thing skill system , craft ,  limited storage in chest is  ridiculous too Crafting system ask materials what i never saw or found  for all time of game . Too much limits and so bad working progres system for rise up levels and skills it is pathetic and ridiculous too. Not all people can stay all day front of pc and level up character. My own opinion guys you must to rebalanced a lot  all system of game play. Loot ammo damage effects (have no difference what type of ammo use)  I have don't see  any difference from soft point full metal jacket or AP ammo my addvise is maybe you guys need to give look to some balistic tablets about ammos and different effects of different calibers and different type of ammo   aim skill system and progress system and make iron sight sight more clear  and same with optical sight.

Lore has substance, but doesn't have much direction; after finishing the beginning area in the south, the rest of the open world is immediately unlocked for free roam and missions have much choice in the order of completion (depending on the exploration of a trivial difficulty ""bunker""). This means that the lore is segmented into small tidbits that has less linear connection than a typical game's.

The game has been getting stale lately. You can spend to unlock DLC which does alleviate the problem to some extent, but the type of gameplay is always the same. Once you know how to beat one type of enemy like a Tank or Harvester, the rest of difficulties in its class become trivial as you keep aiming for the same places. The only real challenge in this game is learning weak spots, after which it becomes a game of finding cover (a pine tree always suffices for most encounters) and spamming bullets at weakspots.

Example: Whenever you start the game your given a couple missions to find out what is going on by either audio tapes or Mission reads which is fine not really a bad way to explain your story, but doesn't really contain the right emotions the audio tapes just feel bland like I hear a struggle or a mayday call, but the voice actors act as if they are just reading a line and not putting much emotion in it ""My personal Opinion"" Like I do not feel the sense of urgency and panic or sense of lose of them losing someone which then proceeds to feel empty.

Here another Example: The Environment I come across Battle Fields or Small battle areas and see dead body's and broken machines and feel nothing, there is not change in the music in the background slowly changing into a sad melody there no real change when you reach those areas and although you might feel slightly bad for the soldiers at the beginning after awhile like 2 times of seeing a dead body you start treating them like storage boxes and nothing else.

Even the mayday of the fighter jet coming down and crashing like your not really in a rush to see if the pilot survived and to go help him you are only curios to see if he had any cool stuff on him or maybe some parts from the jet itself to see if you can use as you don't feel any attachments to the characters, and there's not really much in the forests and open grass plains for you to go explore for because all the loot areas are mostly always at Houses,Camp sites, Dead bodies, or only Cars/Trucks the rest of the vehicles have no meaning such as the tanks, Planes, boats.

 They never have an option to loot them which is weird as that were everyone at least always looks at when they first start the game to see if they have unique or Much needed parts for ammo or crafting materials personally to me they are just wasted objects and a wasted unique mission or mission were you can build your own tank, but it requires all the parts of every tank in the game which would then be only allowed in like 1 areas/2 areas or the whole open world everybody at least once thought they wish I could drive one of those tanks when they first look at them I'm just saying they were wasted.

Last Example: Ambiance, the game doesn't draw you in that much besides the Robot/Machine fight scenarios like there is no Distant Gun fire in different areas that would fit in or like once in a while mayday transmissions that request help; that might be a trap mission or real mission that could possible tie into the base defense DLCs that could add like a extra defender or actual defense npc; or like more audible foot steps, sounds like Tree creaking and gun shots hitting the ground/Tree hits sounds or even a massive distant sound under water/in the distance plus maybe even jet fighting in the air above the clouds with maydays and such, there is little to burly any drawing in ambiance I get that there focusing on the more alone type vibe, but doesn't quite feel executed well like I can feel slightly alone, but I just get bored and want to go fight the machines Instead of finding out what the story is about.

It is a very weird game as not in its content or story, but on what it focused on and somehow doesn't have any major problems in that area besides of course bugs, but that can always be fixed with an update, like it quite literally has all the aspects of a good game Lighting, Graphics, Creativity, Weapon selection, Enemy Variety and Map Size heck I don't even mind the similar looking buildings and the only reasons to me that keeps it from bringing in more players is the  Environment, Attachment, and Ambiance. 

If you found this review interesting or helpful, be sure to put a like, so it get up-voted so the developers can see and read for them self's and maybe change and improve on these issues. By Zeta The Unknown Gamer.",1677801692,1677802813,True,0,0,0.456096798181533813,0,True,False,False

Feels like playing Fallout 4 with 3 times as much empty space and what feels like only ~5 enemy types. Combat is based entirely around damage models which aren't intuitive and aren't explained. There's also a load of different ammo types, which also aren't explained. There's 6 different quality levels for your weapons but you probably won't find any actually good ones unless you grind yourself into the endgame or get locations from the wiki.

DLC should've been included in the base game, otherwise the content feels very limited. The story is slow. The map is empty and you never see other human characters outside scripted events with maybe 1 or 2 main NPCs. If you're not playing with friends you'll probably get bored and disappointed quickly.

TL;DR extremely repetitive and overall boring. I got it on sale so I can't complain too much, but don't buy this game at full price. Graphics are mid, gameplay is stale. Story is slow. Maybe I'd enjoy it more if I was Swedish.

For a game that costs 25€ Fucking euros you have to pay to unlock transportation the first 20 minutes were awesome ingame + the gun handling isnt the best

Feels like an effort of a cash grab by milking everything in the form of an DLC yeah... pay 50 bucks for the complete edition... ID rather spend 50 bucks on an older or newer game that has more content in the basegame without dlcs

Shooting a couple of robots, looting 7 houses for nothing and then walking 10 minutes to get to the next group of houses is NOT a good game-play loop.

The robots are samey, the gun play is awkward and unsatisfying, you cannot properly utilise cover (no contextual leaning in a stealth/guerrilla game that pushes you to ambush enemies and stay hidden??) and the game seems incredibly inconsistent in the way it punishes/rewards you for the things you do or your game-play style.

The game still has extremely basic bugs in the first area of the game, but also 3 DLCs? Sometimes I saw lights without fixtures, and large invisible walls in the middle of an open area. Forgivable around launch and a few patches in, but not 2 years and 3 DLC's later.

The only vehicle in the game is a bike, that's all you get. And you gotta travel FAR and sometimes off-road. If you get stuck on something or you die, good luck getting back there if it's out of the way.

This is just an example of a game that should have been linear, or at least much smaller, but they opted for an open world.

Gunplay is a lot of fun

Customisation and equipment looting is addictive (character faces will always look a bit silly)

Lore is serviceable, not great not terrible.

Story missions are really weak, probably an afterthought from the devs

NPC's are static objects that can't move or assist in combat in anyway. Which is a real dissappointment.

The online co-op isn't restrictive like other games and players can go to totally seperate parts of the map if needed, and bring their weapons and unlocks from their own world into their friends. This is something I wish more games let you do.

Good sounds, graphics, all around gameplay mechanics. Missing some improvements. The campaign is amazing, really immersive and engaging, good voice acting and ambiance. For a couple missions. Then it looks like the devs lost interest in the whole idea and moved on to make new content. Really quickly changes to fetch quests that are uninteresting and unrewarding. You go there, press E, pick up a paper, done, 500xp. Same thing with side quests. Useless. Buildings also all look the same. One bunker asset, one house asset, copy & paste through the whole map. Really gets repetitive fast. Base building needs improvement and buffs. Gets destroyed fast and easy for the time and ressources you put in versus the rewards, not worth the time and effort. Really big potential but still too many bugs for it to be a full release in my opinion. Crashing every 30mins for unexplained reasons, this issue seems to happen to a lot of people on the forums since it came out. Doesn't look like any importance is given to this issue by developpers. Character getting stuck everywhere, some issues with stuff not appearing in one player's game in multiplayer, the list could go on for a long while.

It has consumed around 70 hours of my past week of no lifing this game and I still have so much to do and explore. My main problems are stuff that can be fixed so I am not too worried about it but;

1) Scopes do not line up to where the bullet will land 100% of the time. I am unsure if this is actually a thing for the lower tier scopes that are cracked (would make sense they might also be loose) but this is extremely infuriating when you will spend so much time lining up perfect shots in stealth for them to completely miss, sometimes 5 or so in a row. This mainly seems to be happening a LOT with semi-auto DMR's like the M14 and Draganov tho I have seen it with the Barrett, Mosin, and the .243 just not nearly as frequently. Makes them unusable as reliable sniper rifles.

2) I understand this is probably a balancing issue, but the way attachments are used right not does not make a lot of sense to me as weapons like the AK and M14 have weird attachment specifications. For the M14, you use a RIFLE suppressor but a SNIPER RIFLE scope which means you cant use 1-4x or 4-8x rifle scopes on a weapon that takes rifle barrels. I imagine the attachments system is not set in stone as I would love to see the ability to put 1-4x on MP5 or AS-VAL, or even the M14, also maybe adding an under barrel slot for fore-grips, bi-pods, and maybe even under slung 'nade launchers. I would really love to make a retro Vietnam M16 with a launcher and straight mag.

3) My only other real complaint about this game (which I know is still developing) is that the enemies will sometimes hit you through walls, mainly with missile strikes and the hunters lunge. I know missiles have AOE and should do damage through a wall with windows or something (context obviously) but its VERY inconsistent sometimes. Two different missile barrages in the same place will be opposites, one time you take no damage at all, the next time you are instantly killed. The Hunters will sometimes lunge and still end up stabbing through a wall you are standing close to and then slide back out of the building.

ALL of these things are annoying but DO NOT  happen regularly OR truly disturb playing it. It can be very annoying sometimes but again keep in mind, THIS GAME IS NOT TRIPLE A AND STILL DEVELOPING, so I don't take these things to heart. I really do absolutely love this game and most everything about it (gimme M16 launcher!) and really do think anyone looking for a solid and terrifying survival game should check this out.

EXTREMELY impressed with this games development and current state, solid 9/10 PLEASE don't give this game up it has SO much potential.",1653611832,1677509385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It takes me back to when I was a teen playing Dark Souls for the first time because this game is legitimately scary and gets my blood pumping.

Playing single-player is definitely harder than multiplayer but it forces you to get super tactical with killing the machines, you'll be spending a lot of time gauging enemies from afar and planning out different attacks or roots. I can see why some people don't enjoy this play-style, but it really makes me think hard and study the bots so I like it.

The game has a vast map, and is realistically filled, in other words, there are great big area's of wilderness speckled with small  farm ruins and then a few larger town sized ruins.  For the most part enemies are also not omni-present, you can go quite a few minutes without seeing one, and then all of the sudden come upon a large group. 

The enemies all have auto-aim and will never miss, but trying to shoot at them is tedious.  There are lots of dog size-shaped robots that are usually in packs of 5-12 or around there.  They bounce around and can go from full stop to 60 mph in .0 seconds, they will also circle around eachother so as your doing damage to one, it will suddenly jump behind one of it's undamaged friends, even though they are the most common enemy in the game, it can take 5-10 shots to kill one, and all the while it's shooting you with 100% accuracy.   There are flying drones, they don't participate in combat, but they continually summon more robots to come fight you until you take them out.  You can ""aim"" but when ""aiming"" all the enemies can move faster than you can pivot, so in order to shoot something you have to first get it in almost perfect sights then go into an aiming stance.   Since they continually try to move around in a circle behind you this takes way longer than it should.  Larger Mech, human shaped robots the size of a tank can also pop up in groups of 2-5.  They can one shot you, and have no weight to them, they move like a puppet on a string, once again going from full stop to 100mph in 1 frame.  

Healing is tedious, trying to use any items is tedious, and trying to reload your weapon is tedious.   Question, if i can quick slot a healing item, why do i also have to equip it and use it in order to use it?  Isn't the whole point of quick slotting something so i don't have to unequip my gun in the middle of a fight in order to use the item?  Then after you've healed you have to reequip your gun, and it's now out of ammo so you have to wait for the reload animation to finish before you can shoot.....and now you need to stop and reequip the healing item again because while you were reloading you've been shot 2 times, draining your health to 12%.  

The controls are poorly laid out, there's no pause, and there is no way to save, only auto-saves.   I've gotten far into the game and explored a good portion of the map, and i have so far only gotten 2% armor.  Yeah, you can upgrade your weapons fairly well, but there's no armor, no helmets, no vests, no nothing.   Wait, did you read that right earlier?  You sure did, THERE IS NO WAY TO PAUSE THE FUCKING GAME.  Suddenly thrust into a fight with 20 invincible robots with infinite ammo that have 100% accuracy?  Opps, the doorbell rang?  your phone is going off?  your animal wants something?  Fuck you, you're dead.   Sure, go to the main menu screen, the robots don't care, they will keep shooting you!  Thats alright, since there's no save you can't just quit and come back either, screw you for trying to play this.",1628316894,1677450778,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The fact that the developers are still adding to it is great. It's a very decent game, but with so many bugs (random clipping issues, visual artifacts, ""time returning"" stutters, etc.).

But these developers can't even debug their games to save themselves. They are great with supporting their games long term, a lot better than the current trend of the trash AAA developers nowadays.

If this was priced more and had some trash, overpriced DLCs, I wouldn't recommend it. But while the developers lack the skillset, I do think they are a decent bunch since they didn't overprice this game and are still supporting it.

Ultimately, the game is playable, but it could be that I've thus far been lucky enough not to encounter game-breaking bugs. If you're worried, buy it on sale. If you think the developers deserve full price for good habits (with lack of skills), then you're not really losing anything here.

GZ has a good variety of machines to kill, there are no zombies, aliens or bad guys. 

The stealth actually works in most cases. The story line is not bad, there are lots of quests and missions.

A wide variety of weapons, the higher level items will start dropping mostly after you hit level 25+. 

The crafting is simple enough, crafting material drops are pretty constant without having to grind for them.

The only usable vehicles are bicycles and moped. There is a DLC that adds dirt bikes, cannot comment much on those tho.

New characters that your create will have access to shared storage and all previously unlocked crafting recipes.

The 2 DLCs that I highly recommend are FNIX Rising and Alpine Unrest, these add story line and more world.
Get the other DLCs if they offer something you want, They are not required to play and enjoy the game.

Gets updated every couple months or so. Does seem that the updates and bug fixes tend to cause other bugs.

I have not had any game breaking bugs, currently on my third play through with my third character.

(just noticed its on sale for 5 bucks now, which is then probably worth it, the initial exploration and such in single player or coop is definitely fun.)

what really killed it for me is that it gets repetitive pretty quick, mostly compounded by the fact that ammo is just lying around everywhere. we figured out that the ammo you find is linked to the guns you have too, so the more you use the more you find basically. this took away any aspect of ""survival"" in the game in that we never really needed to ration ammo or supplies, and the longer it went on the less patient we got with setting up traps and sneaking around carefully and the more we tended to just shoot everything we saw with overwhelming firepower. missions arent really that interesting in themselves since there's only so much you can - you go to places and there are enemies there, and the story missions just send you after documents inside buildings. i guess they added or adding base building and more complicated crafting and stuff and maybe thats good but we moved on to other stuff before we got far enough to see any of that.",1677260813,1677260813,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a mission that can't be finished and will basically ruin your world/save. The devs are working on a fix but it's been MONTHS since this has been reported.

Yeah, I get it. Small dev team so they're doing their best, right? Well guess what? This is how long it takes to fix a game-breaking bug that MANY have already reported. You'd think there would have been a hotfix or something. It's suppose to be fixed by the end of this month. 

If it takes this long to fix a MAJOR mission bug, you're screwed for all the other ones that still exist after YEARS and more that are introduced every update (however long it takes to release them).

It was good fun while it lasted, but the more we played, the worse it got. I tried continuing to see if it got better but I keep running into BS bugs. This game had so much potential. A shame.

UPDATE:
They FINALLY fixed the mission bug. They added more weapon skins to the game and it all looks like shit. Seriously, go have a look. I honestly can't believe they spent time on this shit.

Still a ton of bugs. Recently played some co-op and the enemies didn't spawn during a mission. We had to reload the game for it to work.

Assignments are a hit or miss. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. Still pretty broken.

Surprise surprise. New issues introduced in the latest update. People are reporting missing bases now. Just look it up on the forum. *SLOW CLAP*

I can list others but I'm pretty drained from this game now. I'm gonna go play some 'Shower With Your Dad Simulator"".",1675661320,1677222114,False,194,19,0.698543429374694824,0,True,False,False

However, it really does nothing to stand out in an overbaked genre, apart from ""hey the enemies are robots."" The gameplay loop also gets real stale real quick, especially when the enemy variety is laughable (there are a total of 10 enemy types in the game, counting bosses, and the only ""boss"" enemy is a souped up basic enemy). You'd assume with such lacking variety, what it does have would be interesting. But no, honestly a large portion of the basic enemies feel generally the same to fight. There's so little variety. It's evident that this game wants to be like the Horizon series, but what sets Horizon apart is that it has a huge catalog of machines, each with a complex set of weaknesses and attacks you can learn to master them. The basic enemies have 5+ attacks each, and you can analyze their weak spots to form a plan to knock out an encounter. Here, the basic enemies have two attacks: melee and machine gun fire, and one weak spot. The larger basic enemies? Also melee and machine gun fire, but with two harder to hit weak spots. It's just uninteresting overall. Geniunely the only fun I've had with this game was in messing around with friends (which admittedly is actually pretty funny sometimes with some of the weird physics stuff that happens).

I can't stress enough how much worse each update has made the game, half of the content updates released don't even come close to working which makes you wonder what they were smoking to even consider releasing it in the first place.

It's a shame too, they had a great idea with the game and the weapons and overall map are really well designed. Just all the downsides to the game really make these small wins hard to appreciate.

They have taken an interestingly unique, promising premise, and just ran in to the ground as an unfinished cash grab.",1676843403,1676843576,False,0,0,0.456431567668914795,0,True,False,False

Pros
- Graphics are good
- Map is huge

Negatives
- Weird detail issues, EVERYTHING in the game is very high quality, but then the players hands and weapons are about 4 polys (not literally, however it get's the point across)
- Lag in singleplayer? (Could have been my computer so don't take this for granted).
- Bland gameplay (walking simulator)
- If you walk into an area it will tell you if there's a weapon in there (statically spawned items)
- Pointless death system, nothing is lost, may as well bait enemies to your spawn and just kill them there
- AI can't find it's way into some rooms and is often very slow to react to situations
- ""Stealth"" is just a gimmic here, it's about as stealthy as vanilla Skyrim",1561703695,1676617236,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Try to sort out what happened in Sweden when some machines seemingly decided to attack people. There is more to it, perhaps even a hidden background that eventually will come into light. Discover how and why this all happened, and be the force that brings us closer to the solution. 

Very cool game with a very clear campaign, alone or together with friends. A given, perheps the very best, co-op and if you are 4 to play it together, that is clearly what this game is made for. Allow your group to evolve with different specializations to maximize tactical advantage when challenged with the worst of enemies. 

Excellent graphics and weather, superb lighting and variation of seasons. Welcome to a wonderful swedish landscape of wonderful forests, agricultural landscapes and beautiful coastlines. To that comes an excellent sound production and sound mix of absolutely highest standard. 

Evolution in the game is driven by increasingly more difficult resistance, where you need to upgrade skills, aquire more advanced/evolved weapons and sharpen your tactics. Tactics is everything, so also in this game. Weapons are 'replicas' of well known traditional guns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers and so on. You can decice, whether to be a 'support' or 'assault' expert or any specialization of your desire, depending on your tactics, which is great fun. 

This is also a collect-and-craft game that allows you to be creative and mindful about your tactics. You can play without crafting, but I would certainly recommend it.

At the time of this review, some bugs seem to remain in the game. It would certainly make a very good game even better if the developers could sort those out. Nothing critical, but it would bring a little more shine to it. 

Do you wish to play like a sniper ghost, or dash in with your guns blazing? It's your choice, but they are egually fun! 

[u]In short:[/u]

- Excellent graphics design,
- Very good story with clear 'career options' as you evolve and gather skill points.
- Excellent selection of weapons and equipment, but do not expect a space weapon.
- Nice game features and challenges through a variety of menus.
- Exellent sound, excellent sound mix. This is gem in that regard.
- A few bugs, but nothing critical. 

What could be better? Well, not including a few bugs, which does not really affect game play, I think the game could benefit with additional NPC characters. There are a few, but that does not really create a sense of ""other people"" in the game. You feel quite alone storywise. There are some vioces over radio that provides story push and context, but it could be even more evolved. It would be great to call-in an air strike for instance, or perhaps a  few tanks driven by NPC's to support. I would not mind to be able to use more vehicles either. 

[u]Weapons/functions that could be added:[/u]

- Minigun
- Assalut weapon mounted grenade launchers
- Sniper outfit (perhaps in one of the many DLC's?)
- Hellfire missiles
- Artillery (possibly as a NPC-reinforcement)
- Call in a NPC airstrike
- Call for a NPC spotter 
- 40 mm ground to air gun

 The games looks good, nice view, but the mechanics are really simple and poorly made. Things like riding a bike can make you glich with the ground and make you bounce, or the boss fights can get really anoying when the enemy's gun is out of shooting angle because you are at it's back but still shoots you with the rounds or rockets clipping inside him going direct at you.
  I was playing in Guerrilla mode (aka hardest mode) thinking about doing actual guerrilla fighting to save crafting material while I started with the game telling you that the char is a random guy who was in a boat trip, so the missions start with you looking for survivors, but when you find then, the game tells you to clean entire bunkers filled with machines.
  This logic problem isn't the only one, as you can guess by the achievement win rate of completing game main missions (less the 5% completed all main quests according to online charts). And here are some examples of miss-understood logics:
In the ingame description of a 270 caliber (.270 Winchester) says that is weaker then 5,56 round but the .270 hunting rifle does +2x damage then the 5,56 assault rifle, also deals then same damage as a .50 cal sniper (Pansarvärnsgevär 90).
Other thing is the AI commanding the robots, in lore is something as chad as Skynet but in game it's dumb as soldier talking back to a Drill Sgt. To make it clear, the robots maneged to wipe tons of tank platoons all around the map and killed entire companys (I cound't find how many soldiers would be stationed in the island to use the correct term), but couldn't deal with a random pissed farmer. Also, in the DLC FNIX rising they got a huge turret with cruise missiles that destroyed a survivor camp but for some reason didn't used on our first base defense, only shot once to break a ""wall"" and other time try to stop our ""Armored"" truck approaching the launcher position.
Talking about the world building around the many military bases in the map, the only military vehicles shown were Stridsvagn 103,  JAS 39 Gripen (or something closer), and some retextured trucks and civilian cars. That's cheap because things start to look the same as you explore the bunkers bases, plus even make things look weird as you look closer at the battlefields, because the AI meneged to destroy every single tank send to fight but couldn't defeat the protagonist once for all (like a end game scenario without respawn), or when you noticed that they made the army looks like a bunch of untrained conscripts compared to the random civilian even with the chance of a WW3 starting any minute.

Your just some random teenager and you progress through the world gaining experience and learning from your mistakes and that's something that really helps immerse you in the game.

The game is really good but I have a few issues with it, First off I'm playing with a low end laptop so I can't really say anything regarding lag and optimization issues but I have heard a lot of people in the community saying that it has optimization issues so take that with a grain of salt.

Next the game has SOME replayability simply because it is somewhat of a looter shooter and if you are the type to want to collect or atleast try the rarer guns then that is your replayability, it would have been better if there were more to it than that, things like replayable side missions or hell add in a new game plus. 

Next is the grinding, I am not new to grinding I play games like Warframe and the like where you'd have to grind for days on end just to get a new frame or a new gun and a further day simply to craft them, but unlike games like those Gen Zero simply does not have that level of... satisfaction when it comes to the rewards after the grind not to mention the L O W drop rates, to explain you will have to grind for EVERYTHING in this game, you want ammo grind for it, you want new guns grind for it, you want stronger versions for those guns grind for it and ask RNGesus to take pity on you, the issue with this is not only are they so hard to get(once again low drop rates especially for higher rarity guns) they are not as rewarding as others are, I am already at end game, I've beaten the last mission(base game only, I'd love to get alpine unrest and FNIX uprising but for now I dont got the money for it) so now I'm just farming for the experimentals so far in the total hours I've spent I've gotten 4(pistol, SubMachine, Shotgun, rocket launcher) while that sounds easy ""ohhh it only took you 3 days to get 4 of the rarest weapons"" that's because I got lucky, like any other looter shooter games the loot you get is dependent on the enemy you kill and the only way to get the experimentals is to get lucky and get a Rival of the specific enemy type and specific enemy model(once again RNG) or get the Reaper, now to get a rival to spawn in the first place you'll need to level the region you are in which is S L O W as fuck especially if you want to get the Reaper(guaranteed to drop an experimental) where in you'll have to have a region leveled above 21 or 25(i forgot but it is one of the 2) and you must have less than 8 rivals in that region which also means that if you want to get a Reaper you'll have to kill a Rival and then farm again to make the Reaper spawn, also Killing a Rival lowers your Region level therefore you shouldn't be killing rivals until you're sure that killing them won't lower the region level below 21 or 25, furthermore you will have to level the Rivals to level 4 by killing non Rival robots in order to increase the chance of getting better drops, not to mention the fact that killing them at level 4 requires more resources and boxes that give those resources are scattered around the damn place and you'll have to do farming runs, those boxes will then take 4 real life hours to respawn their loot and that means leaving the game open for 4 hours while you do something else to let them respawn. After ALL THAT BS and you do get the experimentals or atleast the experimental you WANT(again RNG, just because its the specific mob that CAN drop that specific Experimental doesn't mean it will drop that specific experimental PLUS the loot table for experimental drops ALSO INCLUDES experimental Clothing so your not even guaranteed to get a fkn weapon) unless you plan buy the major DLC's(alpine unrest and FNIX uprising) or farm for more(if you want ALL the experimentals) or just waste your time by killing mobs there's nothing left for you in the game to do which just leads back to the replayability issue.

BUT with all these issues I still believe you should buy the game, it is still fun as hell and if anything else its a good time waster.",1636195648,1676136878,True,0,0,0.488599330186843872,0,True,False,False

For example, when the game first starts it looks awful and the gunplay with the pistol is loose, It feels a little janky and the voice acting isn't great. Later on in the game you will find areas that look stunning, some of the rifles and machine guns feel excellent, and you will see a lot of 'not' Commodore 64s - this was a nice trip down memory lane.

The concept is quite simple, some bad robots killed everyone and you need to find out what the funk happened. Some of the early robots are easy to kill, and the later ones become absolute sponges for anything you throw at them. This is where the little ones become dangerous because they are everywhere and if they spot you they will alert the big lads who will happily stomp on your head.

One of most creepy, engrossing, terrifying, and atmospheric moments I've had in gaming happened in GZ. It is night time and there is a thick layer of fog, I'm walking through some woodland and the moonlight shines through the trees illuminating the fog around me. It is peaceful, then you hear a deep THUNK THUNK THUNK, clearly, a heavy machine walking, followed by a War of the Worlds-esque machine-horn-brrrrbuuuur sound. The problem is that it's almost impossible to judge distance by sound alone, is it a goliath that is far away, or is it a mid-sized machine just over the hill, who knows. You are outgunned and outnumbered, if you don't plan out an attack then you are almost surely dead. Amazing feeling...

Then the problems start popping up. Firstly, it does get a little bit samey, exploring the first few bunkers and towns was fun, but then you realise there isn't really anything to find. The world feels empty, aside from you and the machines, there are very few people and the ones you do meet are absolutely dead soulless automatons. I destroyed a small army of robots attacking this lighthouse and rescued this old dude hiding in his basement, he said a couple of lines then nothing more. I stumbled across a besieged underground base with a woman cowering over a fire, she said 'hello'.

The stealth and strategising are good fun, but it does get too repetitive for me. 

With all of that said, I do keep going back to this game, and when I do I get the same 'OMG this is terrifying' feeling for a while. I would recommend you buy this game it is good fun, although I'm a little disappointed with the DLC milking they are doing, a couple of the DLCs are fundamental in my opinion.

On one hand it really scratches the loot-goblin itch, lots of loot and collectibles, a plethora of weapons all with different rarities, and it feels fun to kill robots.

On the other, since there have been several world altering DLCs, there are some collectables that are impossible to collect now as the changes to several towns and buildings have obscured or blocked the ability for them to be picked up. Others are exceptionally difficult requiring the player to find an obscure angle in which the prompt to collect the item pops up and allows it to be collected.

The Replayability is mediocre, there are plenty of missions, and this FMTEL system that allows you to partake in daily tasks to get some rewards, but killing similar robots again and again can be a bit tedious at times.

If you are looking for a Triple-A experience then I would suggest you look elsewhere, as there are several bugs and issues that have caused me some grief, I will list them here and if you think it is a deal breaker then by all means move on to better things.

1: The player model has some obscene hitboxes, I have gotten stuck on several objects and under several things because my model clipped into the object and I had to jump around and spin in circles until finally it would let me go. Otherwise I would have to fast-travel and return to the area which takes quite a bit of time if you haven't unlocked a safehouse nearby.

2: Speaking of the Player model, the firearms are rendered accurately...the bullets come from the barrel of the firearm, and the model holds the firearm correctly when prone...however the camera doesn't believe so. Several times I would be prone on top of a building, or hiding behind a low wall or a car, and the crosshair shows no obstruction, but when I fire the bullet hits the wall in front of me. In the case when I was prone on a flat surface looking down at enemies, my rifle actually shot way above the enemy, because even though my rifle was aimed downward, the model of the rifle was being held straight by the player model due to the collision. 

3. Previously mentioned, several buildings in the world, now have collectables that are impossible to obtain due to the changed geometry in some of the locations. The developer didn't do a good job of placing and updating the locations to include the adjusted loot, this goes for loot containers as well, some locations will have floating loot containers, and some that are obscured within shelving units.

This game starts off very fun, you grab a bunch of gear, kill a few enemies, grab more gear, complete missions and so on so forth. My problem with this game comes in the form of just how buggy and unfinished the multiplayer is. Now, I was playing this with 2 other friends, one of which was hosting the lobby. It started off fine, but about 7 hours in, the game started to suffer from major desync issues. Missions were not appearing, trucks were seemingly only on the host's pov, the dlc literally boots you out if you try to enter it without owining it (that means that everyone needs to buy the dlc campaigns) and the player collision got incredibly bad. We collectively decided to stop playing when we actively had to use resources to fix otherwise inescapable softlocks. Other than that, I think the combat needs some MAJOR rebalancing. There comes a point where at the difficulty I was playing at, advertised to be the intended one, taking out a horde of randomly spawning enemies can take up to 15 minutes due to the sheer amount of HP the enemies have. Now, I think I only got roughly 30% through the game, so I don't know if the gear gets better or something, but I can't imagine it getting less tedious. It really pains me to leave a negative review, because at the core this game is REALLY fun, it has great sound design, great controls, the weapons are fun to use, the crafting system is very deep, the bikes are just so stupid that it's fun, but I've rarely had games hook me up so much, only to lose my interest this quickly. I really do think that with some bugfixing and balancing this can become one of the most fun survival games I've played.

I found the game entertaining at first, I mean, what's not to like? Super cool robot apocalypse scenario and all that. However, the game very quickly got old and tiresome. The higher level robots, anything past the second tier really, are far too challenging, to the point that it's not even fun to fight them. 

Tell me, who hurt the developers as a child that they made a robot capable of tanking 20 rockets, in addition to roughly 600 rounds of conventional ammo. I died 8 times fighting this thing, and by the time it was finished I walked away with so little loot it made the whole ordeal not even worth it. A game should not be made so that only groups of players working as a team can win. Some players prefer playing solo, and the robot difficulty should be adjusted for this. I mean, why are the flying robots so tanky??? They already have tremendous firepower, speed, and maneuverability, did you have to make them capable of tanking 10+ rockets??? 

Robot difficulty aside, the map is far too large not to be able to save at specific locations. Even with safe houses spread out the way they are it is still annoying to travel all the way to a mission, get killed, then have to hoof it all the way back. Even with bikes and scooters, the time it takes to get to some places is tedious. I would be willing to forgive this, however, if the robots were not god modded.

Lastly, this game has more glitches than any game I've played recently, mostly in the crafting. I have made countless rounds of ammo and should be receiving ammo schematics from this action to unlock additional ammo types but I haven't received a single point from crafting. Not to mention the fact that certain items in the crafting menu simply will not craft, even after the schematic is paid for and the required resources are in my inventory. Trying to make landmines, explosive barrels, ammo boxes, etc, and they will not craft. Sometimes they will if I make a few additional items required to make them but usually not.

Look, if you're ok with glitches, and have some friends who don't mind battling extremely tanky robots, go ahead and get this game. But, honestly, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, and wish I could get a refund.",1674291786,1675322765,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The environment is beautiful. Dense forests that go through seasons. Green in spring, leaves falling in Autumn, and snow in winter. Expansive and open to boot. If you can see it, you can go there. From the rolling hills of a Swedish farm, to the tall wooded ridges. Nothing will stop you... Except the machines.

You begin by bouncing round after round harmlessly off of their metal frames. Wondering if you can even hurt them. You search constantly, praying to find something, anything, better... And you will. Each new piece of gear makes it just a little bit easier... Until your enemies become stronger.

This game takes a couple of hours to get into. Give it that time. The equipment trickles in, but patience is rewarding. Don't look everything up By the end of the game, you will be standing toe-to-toe with those very same enemies you once felt were unstoppable. You will be able to blow their electronic innards across a field with half a dozen well placed shots. Gameplay fluctuates wildly. A poorly handled ambush can turn into a 30 minute long skirmish across an entire hillside.

If you ever wanted to fight a Man vs. Machine war guerilla style, THIS IS IT.

It's at about 45%, so it falls on the ""no"" side, but barely. I mean, it's still a nice game, just has a few too many drawbacks for me. Opinions of course will vary.

Now, this may not be fair, because it's a COOP game and designed as such, but I play solo. The game isn't very good for solo. If you have friends, the game will probably be much better for you. But solo? Nah, not really.

Keeping this short:
Pro: 
- nice graphics, 
- gameplay OK, story sort of engaging, 
- interesting premise, and 
- Sweden! Who doesn't love Sweden!

Cons: 
- the story ends... rather abruptly, with nothing actually resolved. Was sort of OK up to that point, if sort of disjointed. But, the ending was definitely very unsatisfying. At least you can keep playing, although doing so solo... would kind of suck really.
- can't swim (seriously? wow.)  Although you can still get across some water hazards if you jump far enough, it'll put you on the *closest* shore, not the one you left from). 
- Some enemies are just there to troll you (the large flying jet things seem deliberately geared to mask all sounds in the area while being almost impossible to kill. Also, the sound is very annoying.)
- the skills and gear are... well, not all that useful really. 1% to 3% improvement from gear and can't have gear with more than 1 improvement? Skills are... well, there might be a couple, but getting to the levels necessary is lots of work.  Which leads to...
- potential *massive* grind to get anything serious done.  This is what really brought it down from just over ""yes"" to just under the ""yes"" line. Just to level up without cheating would require going around and around to ""easier"" targets that don't use too much ammo, as resources can be a bit scarce sometimes unless you cheat.
- They obviously intend for people to play this over a much longer period of time, despite the world not being, well, all that interesting. Much re-use of assets, for instance. 
- what do you mean I can't jump over anything more than waist high?? I can even do it in real life and I'm really unfit!

Often introducing a myriad of bugs of varying severity, or re-introducing old ones, that take months/years to fix(?) because apparently most Swedes only work 4 months per year to begin with.

Got it and several of the DLCs on sale, and I had my fun in a single solo romp through maybe 80% of it until quest bugs made me put it down. Won't be waiting for glacial speed fixes that may or may not work, won't be bothering anyone to get it for a co-op playthrough, and don't think it's good enough to play through more than once anyway really. Didn't get to the base defense/assault stuff so I can't comment there, but other posters make it sound like it's nothing to miss anyway.

Absolutely do not pay full price if you decide to pick up Generation DLC, and research the DLCs before picking which ones you buy because most of them aren't worth it.

My wife and I love to play coop shooter games together so we bought it, not knowing much about it. This game has elements like Division 1, TC Wildlands, Farcry Series, Fallout 76, etc. I get Division 1 vibes the most from this game because there are tons of things to loot looking for supplies, weapons, clothing, and ammo. There not many humans around and there seems to be an invasion of machines that can be very intimidating. Especially at the beginning of the game when your weapons feel like bb guns with limited ammo going against tanks. There has been many times the wife and I had to run to a building for cover and get bombed at, shooting though windows, just trying to survive. We have had many intense moments and it so much fun. 
We both bought all the DLC’s to support the developer and to try more things out. At this time, I have not played the DLC content, but I have enjoyed the weapon packs and new motor bikes in the game. The stock ones are fine, but the DLC ones are such an improvement. They are faster, better fuel efficiently, and handle off-road better. I would recommend at least getting a few weapon packs and the bike pack to have more variety to this game. Like most loot shooters it can be repetitive because all your doing is killing machines in various locations. The key is the learn better techniques and try different weapons out and see how you fair. Base building was another surprise while playing, which enables missions to defend your created base. There also boss type machines with better rewards that can show up. I have yet to see it but there one called a reaper that can show up that is supposed to be extremely tough. 
If you only plan to play this game by yourself, I think you will find this game like most games that have coop to be less satisfying. Where this game really shines is coop. Being able to produce strategies to beat the big machines like simply flanking them helps. I only encountered a few minor bugs with no crashes. This is a solid game to play with friends. Highly recommended.

It's bare-bones, but has a good foundation, and fun gunplay.  Play it on the hardest setting, play online with friends. about 45 hrs so far, so well worth the pricetag on sale.

Amazing Sound design and outdoor world, nice lighting.  The robot designs are cool, and animate well.

-Just needs more content: enemies, buildings and weapon upgrades.  If the developers wanted this to be an FPS Diablo, they need to add more parts / customization to the guns, which will just add more to the loot grind fun.  Just look at CoD Warzone, and the gun parts like that.  This way you can further adjust a guns base stats, with different stocks, grips, etc.  And every gun part should clearly show what stat it effects, do silencers reduce damage?  Show that change when equipping.  Maybe allow crafting to combine with certain gun attachments, to further make weapon customization fun.  
So I can grab a basic SMG silencer, and craft to add some bonus stats to it.  A silencer that increases velocity (slightly) too?  that adds a burning stat to the bullets that are fired?  Or electrical dmg?  Maybe it requires 2 silencers, a battery, wiring, lead, etc.  And then you can craft a new silencer.  
You want the weapon grind to make the gameplay loop more addicting, more parts and depth makes the grind more rewarding and fun, I don't need an endless supply of low tier silencers and 1-4x scopes.

-Destructable buildings would be nice.  When you run into a house for cover, the walls can get blown out.  It doesn't have to be complete destruction with crazy physics, but enough to blow out preset walls like in the Battlefield games.  So the house you're using for cover starts getting bombarded, there's a real threat to staying put.  Eventually the ceiling and walls can be blown out, and the enemy has easier shots inside.  Also, I found a few mini apartment blocks, they have a stairwell, and basement hallways, but none of the apartments are ever explorable.  I want more above ground, building interiors, and less gigantic, empty bunkers.  The main missions force you into so many copy-pasted bunkers.  And many have huge extra floors, of just empty space and rooms.  The bunkers should be small, base/spawn points, not gigantic underground labrynths of empty hallways and storage.

-Also, maybe tweak the enemy AI and attack patterns.  They're too easy to figure out.

I will keep playing, and may adjust my review.  But good potential so far, especially for sale price I paid.",1674202065,1674202065,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game, set out in Sweden during the year 1989, has been turned over by futuristic robots/mechs that you'll fight off and loot for weapons and equipment. You'll investigate and explore their origin as you travel through the vast landscape of Östertörn, that has been carefully crafted with very beautiful scenery. 

I can recommend this game to anyone wanting to freely discover and roam a wide and seamless open world, you'll be fighting off random mech opponents as you complete missions and discover side missions. Scavenging plays a huge part of the game as you'll need to craft gear and ammunition to continue the resistance of these mech overlords. 

The developers do listen to feedback. They frequently improve and add both free and premium content in the form of DLCs.

The game has some noticable bugs, where some (Update 2023: now very few) items are placed where they're impossible to loot. 

During the early days of the game, you could've started a mission by entering an area, but it wasn't made clear that it had been started and if you left the area and went back later, the mission would've been bugged and enemies would not respawn. Exiting out of the game and starting it up again fixed it. Now, in 2022/2023, this appears to have been fixed.

Update 2023: There are still few bugs around, like physics glitches, character getting stuck here and there and legacy rare items that now causes the game to crash. Like some easter egg, holy hand grenade and other rare items. Somehow, all these little bugs has their charm and reminds of the olden days where software in general was filled with them.

Game play wise its pretty solid.  Bullets go roughly where you shoot them, though the accuracy seems to be...slightly off sometimes, though my pc barely meets minimum, so could just be me.

This game shines best with at least one other person playing with you.  Machines have X-Ray vision, Night Vision and Thermal Vision so they can see you through walls, trees and other things.  Having a friend to juggle aggro with makes large scale battles that much easier as well as feeling more engaging.

Can you play this game solo?  Yes, you can.  Just prepare for a slog if you want everything.  Even some story missions can be hard solo if you dont plan it out properly.  

My largest gripe is the storage box capacity.  Trying to keep at least one of every max tier weapon, maybe two incase I accidently recycle one and it just eats storage capacity.

Found a few graphical issues but nothing too crazy.  Game crashed but only on multiplayer.  Some of my singleplayer problems im chalking up to poor PC and not running very well.

It has such huge bugs that simply will lock your progression, mission objectives getting stuck, won't let you move forward, no mods to help on nexus, no proper save system to restore and redo the quest, basically if you get stuck on a mission on your save and you didn't manually make a backup, you're gonna have to start all over again.

Every playthrough I've had, playing for 1 hour or so on average, I've constantly backed up the game so I decided to be careful on my next playthrough, However, what put the nail in the coffin for me is the following:

Apparently the mechanics of the game which give you damage resistance don't work at all. People have been testing it and posting on youtube but they literally don't work. That's a huge part of the game as 80% of the talents in your skill tree give some sort of resistance, all of your equipment gives some sort of resistance. None of it matters. It's just too much and even at 80% discount I feel scammed. 

I would suggest only purchasing this product if you can find someone who experienced this game before and can confirm to you these things no longer happen because as beautiful as the game is, fun as it is, It's just demoralizing knowing whatever you find won't matter and of course, you'll have to be on edge every playthrough to make sure you backup. 

If you play more than 2 hours , you probably should do a backup. 
By the way, backing up is manually going to the save file, the game doesn't have a save feature outside when you quit the game. Who does that at 2023 holy shit.",1672495159,1673725700,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

the game play is the only thing that works with this game, and thats all they care about.

just look at the discussions at all the bug threads

-DLC is junk if its not story based
-game crashes to desktop whenever you bump into something on the dirtbike
-the only weapon that has any worth from the DLC is the RPG from the Soviet Weapons pack
-turrets from tactical equipment pack do damage to you as well as machines (and they don't do that much to machines)
-main missions are bugged
-achievements, challenges, and daily tasks are bugged (DLC weapons do not count towards FMTel tasks)
-schematics are bugged (can't unlock level 5)
-story is bland and unoriginal
-voice acting seems like the devs called the actors while they were just sitting down to open presents on christmas and the devs cracked that whip over the phone.

Multiple paid DLC for an EA title, now they say they're ""reallocating"" team members to work on ANOTHER project when this one isn't even close to done.

The game has promise but they aren't going to deliver.

Currently the last update broke the schematics system so no one can unlock the last tier of schematics.

But that doesn't matter because most of the clothing schematics don't actually do anything, they just flat don't work. I looked up the schematics trying to find a specific one only to learn they didn't work 9 months ago and they still don't work now. They introduced them and they have never, at any point, actually done anything. How hard is it to add a simple damage reduction %?

Quests are bugged, enemies spawn under the map, doing some quests locks you out of other quests if done in the wrong order. You get stuck inside terrain, caught on strange objects, there just flat isn't much to do after the 5 hour mark anyway. There are only really 8 or so actual types of robots with each having multiple ranks but the ranks just gain something trivial like a slightly different weapon or an armor plate where there wasn't one. The level design is copy and pasted to hell. There are maybe five different houses reused over and over again. Bunkers have the exact same rooms over and over and over again. The farm house is reused for every single farm house.

They give you a ton of weapons but most of them are terrible. The 50 cal rifle and the LMG are basically all you'll ever use. I don't even know why they put pistols in this game they won't kill anything.

The worst thing is the save system. You only have one autosave file, but it's for your character, the entire world, and everything in your storage. So if that single autosave (which is huge because why would you do this?) corrupts the game crashes and you lose everything. Even if you make multiple characters they all exist in the same save file so if something happens to one it happens to your entire game. This is beyond an amateur programming mistake no one does that.

You basically run from marker to marker while shooting the same enemies over and over again. tbh it's more efficient to entirely ignore enemies, But if you do that, the game has nothing more to offer.

-Vraken strike:even though this game mostly relies on close combat there should be this ability to call airstrike to fire HE or EMP rockets on targeted place.It would really made FNIX base attacks easier.
-Artillery attack:Same thing as vraken strike except we should have mission to hack gun at normyra arty base so that it can help us and rain fire on robot heads.
BUGS:There are a lot of them,some of them are game breaking but rest are pretty anoying like when Hunters melee attacks you through wall or when somehow they enter houses and caves,getting stuck in random objects and currently big one is unable to finish mission wrench in works.

With an open world kind of game, from Archipelago Region to Marshlands Region, there is a lot to explore and a great catalogue of Machines ready to kill you every corner you go.
Besides all the good points of this game, I must talk about the bad points of it. In my opinion, Generation Zero is a game that was released incomplete. With my almost 70 hours gameplay (some of those , I played with a friend) We have experienced several bugs and crashes. For a game released almost 4 years ago, this should not happend anymore.

Well, let's talk about some specific points:

[b] Map [/b]
Generating Zero have a big map, if the player consider exploring all the areas of the game, it would take more less 80-90 hours of gameplay (without dlc expansions) So, at this point I would say that the developers had a great time doing the map. Almost every building is furnished inside, so the player can get inside and loot good and important itens.

[b] Collectables [/b]
The idea of adding collectables actually conclue the ideia of the map, To players like me who seeks for an aditional adventure (search for collectables an be rewarded with acheivements). So there's a reason to explore all locations, cities and farms, military outposts, etc.

[b] Weapons/guns [/b]
To the players that really like playing with real life weapons , that's a game for you (the only thing that changes are the names, but I guess they are just in Swedish (sorry if I'm wrong about this). Besides the real life weapons, there's a variety of new weapons called 'experimental weapons', that came into an update, and in my opinion it was one of the best adds of the game. If the variety of weapons is too small for you, then try the DLC's that adds American weapons and Soviet weapons, I have not bought then yet, but in a near future I guess I'll.

[b] History [/b]
I need to be honest, I haven't finished the game yet so I can't tell much of what is happening, but,  the history of Generation Zero is not very 'clear'. There are some holes that I must fill, yet, I like to create theories during the gameplay, and make some questions to myself while I explore the map. I must say that the creativity is not only inside the game, but inside the player's mind as well. 

[b] Bases and buildings [/b]
This is a part of the game that in my opinion should be more explored, There is not much to Build, and the reason is unknown. Ok! I would like to build a resistance base, but, why? The idea of it is simillar to already existed 'safehouses', the difference is the missions you can do. Maybe adding NPC's to join my base, and trade itens with then would be nice and make the Base a better add to the game.

[b] Combat [/b]
There's something very nice about this game. They did it 'simple', but well done. The combat is simillar to some games I played, but you can really feel the strain and the fear when you see robots in your way, at some points A LOT OF THEN. Imagine you need to face 2-3 huge robots , but they can spawn medium robots, and those medium robots can spawn small and tiny robots, So when you realise that you are actually facing 3 huge robots, 8 medium robots, 10 or more small robots and 11 tiny robots at the same time, well, it's too late mate, pray for your life and pray to have enough medkits (and good weapons too).

[b] Bugs [/b]
That's an important part of this review, and to be honest the only part that made me feel sad.
I have played cyberpunk 2077 at the release date, with a lot of bugs that made my game experience worse. That is the same case with Generation Zero. Several visual bugs during the gameplay, missions you can't finish ('A WRENCH IN THE WORKS') schematics that you can't pickup, Machines that don't shoot you and just stand still (I'm running with all the graphics maximazed). I decided that I am not playing it anymore until they fix the main mission I said before 'A wrench in the works'. No one can finish it, and at the point of the bug (the last part of this mission), you must destroy a place that I am not going to tell, and when it is exploding you can hear the sound of explosions ALL OVER THE MAP. ''That is okay!'' you may say, The problem here is that the developers are only going to fix it in February. Mate, this bug exists for more then 3 months, and there are no excuses or explanations. The game is unplayable. Other bug that is really anoying is when the player falls into a place or just 'noclip' thru a wall, there's no way out, you just can't move, the only way out of this situation is to fast travel to a safehouse and walk or drive all the way back to where you were.

I wish I could tell more about this game, but to be honest I'm just too sad that I won't play it until they fix that major bug. 
to conclude, I had no high expectations on this game, bought it for 15 reais (3 dolars) and It got me by surprise. 
Beautiful graphics, great map, a wide variety of weapons , good combat, intriguing history , but unfortunatelly, fulled with bugs that are really anoying. 

If I could rate this game for all the content: 72 out of 100

At first, the game seemed like a slow started. Going up in missions, areas and killing valued targets started making the game harder and harder. I liked this, because the harder it got, the more creative I needed to be. Which I was. Used lures and explosives to get a big advantage in.

I enjoyed mostly the stealthy gameplay, base raiding and killing valued targets. Even took out some fully fortified bases without being seen, but not without gruling patience. Had a couple of awesome moments where I completely disabled a big guy in one or two Emps. And liked the nature of most of the tools like the flares.

However...

It comes to a point where creativity and tools are just not enough. You simply need to out bullet the machines, outlive them and you will be more effective with it this way as well.

I have many times ran in a house, virtually uncontested, and killed everything around the house with just bullets for a while. Most enemies becomes so bullet spongy and strong that you cannot do anything BUT haul a ton of bullets at one.

The game then plays like a Serious Sam game where you run in open fields shooting at big and small targets. The tactical option is just not worth it when running and gunning is better, albeit more boring.

A boss called the Reaper even has armor in which a moment you cannot damage him, which you then have to wait out. Its not an exciting fight.


So, the game is steering you closer and closer to a run and gun playstyle and it is not a fun playstyle for this game in my opinion. The skill system isnt balanced enough to make different playstyles worth it. Commando giving 15% more damage to unaware enemies? Really? Compared to other skills that give 10% extra damage constantly, and isnt even a specialist thing?

So, we have the missions that, you just have no care for in the world. They are, in a way, something to do and progress with, which is something. Traveling across to do the different missions felt nice sense Stealthing to prioritize the mission wasnt bad. But then I just keep doing it again, and again, and again. Travel, take/destroy thing, go back, do this, do that. Its not really engaging. The only engagement I have is making my way around the enemies, the missions themselves are dry.


And I kept playing, tried multiplayer. What a fucking mistake. At least you can play with other people, but man is the stealth gameplay further devalued. And the machines further spongy depending on settings.
Even 30 hours in, I couldnt bring myself to finish the game, I didnt even get to the Soviet Machines (That I encountered more of in multiplayer).

The game at one point, simply becomes.... a chore.



[b]My Suggestions[/b]
I do not know what the real intention of the game was, it feels like a Monster Hunter game, but isnt focusing on that. A stealth survival game, but its not focused as that either. Run and gun game, but not focused that way either.

The game needed a focus, being ok at everything just turns it Vanilla as all hell.

Imagine this...
You can pilot a make shift hunter bot as a mech/skeleton suit. This is your real vehicle(s) that you would upgrade, change weapons on, etc. When you are outside the mech, you then are stealthy.

The crafting and tools are underpowered as it takes a lot to craft a sufficable number to execute a plan versus any one thing (when the bots get that hard). The stealth gameplay needed to be more decisive, and as with the suggestion with a mech suit. You then have the option to go from full stealth, to a full gun/brawl.

Would also be awesome having more remote tools, such as scouting using a flying drone. Or calling for mortar shots from a planted mortar elswhere. Hack a bot, and play as it for a short while, that way there is a good reason to hack different bots.

Have a quality of tools, rather than requiring a quantity in order to succede on anything.

Give the player the ultimate ways to manipulate the bots in stealth, and give them their powertrip with a mechsuit. Why should the game be so... stale and be everything inbetween?",1673497940,1673497940,False,5,0,0.587301552295684814,0,True,False,False

I really don't like how much DLC there is for it now and I hate just how hellbent the devs are on making most new content DLC. Still worth playing but I beseech you to not buy all their DLC, most of it isn't worth it.
This game is a good in my opinion but I will review the different sections individually.

Story: The story is pretty good though slightly minimal even with DLC. I ain't going to spoil it but Alpine Unrest and FNIX Rising adds a much needed extension to the story.

Graphics: Conisdering the game is only 2 years old (at the time of review), it looks very good. The machines themselves look high detailed and the explosions and electricity that comes with them looks good. The weapons look very good, especially at 6 crown but some people complain that 5 and 6 crown look too good. The world looks very well made, though it is expected from the ones behind ""Hunter: Call of the WIld"" as that game has plenty of detailed terrain. All the other assets look very high quality. Of course though, such good graphics requires a lot of power. My I5-9300H with a GTX 1650 can run it well but it gets real hot so watch out if you have lower grade equipment.

Combat: The combat feels good though some things feel over or underpowered. An example of overpowered would be the shock ammo as it can shred tanks with 20-30 bullets. An example of underpowered would be the Granatgevär m/49 as it feels perhaps a little weak even though HEDP rounds aren't great for what it is fighting.

Machines: They are by and large the main antagonist (As of now). The machine faction's leader is often named as FNIX. The machines look good, their AI could be a bit more intelligent when it comes to most things and the system of armor and component damage really works for them. I like the classes of Prototype (The starting machines. Weapons are bare bones and armor is usually pretty poor. Easy to kill with the weaker weapons but loot is usually not that good when you can kill better machines.), Military, (Once you get out of the starting area, these take the role of Prototype in being the weakest rank. A lot more variation in weapons and they are usually stronger, drops better loot, better armor, and are usually slightly tougher though still easy enough later on.) FNIX (These are your big boys. Their weapons are a little more limited then the Military but they are the stronger weapons. They usually have heavy ordinance with them like a rocket launcher for the runner, heavy sniper rifle for the hunter, multiple rocket launcher for the tank and missile launcher for the harvester. Their armor is much better and their loot can be great but they are rarer to find unless you head far north. Harder to kill then Military and can be a real challenge unless you know their weak spots.), Apocalypse (These are a special breed of machine. Their weapons are similar to FNIX type weapons, with some exceptions on the tank and hunter. Their weapons are now supplemented with effects like radioactivity and setting targets on fire. Their armor is near impenetrable to all but the strongest weapons and their components have much higher health as well as the machines have much higher health. Hard to kill for even veteran players with the best weapons in the game but their loot is amazing. They are very rare spawns on the island but if you have Alpine Unrest, they the only class of machines on Himfjäll.), and Cataclysm (Only the tank has this class at the time of review but it is a terror. Shields that block all damage and come online randomly, heavy twin machine guns that set you on fire as well as dealing high amounts of damage, multiple rocket launching system that leaves behind toxic waste for a short period of time to damage you, a gas dispensing system that deals really high amounts of damage per tick, and a gas exposion it can trigger that blasts away to 200M away. It is a very rare rival spawn at max region level and is by far the hardest machine to kill as 4 people with the best weapons are still given a run for their money. If you can down the mighty beast, You get some of the best loot in game.) as they are all different and need to be handled differently.  They make great antagonists.

Weapons: There is a good selection of them and as I mentioned before, they look good and some feel a bit unbalenced.

first things first: the pricing is misleading.
the level of quality and polish presented here speaks to a much higher priced game.
running the game on ultra (locked the FPS to 60 myself, 3070, i9 and 64) looks stunning. it might not be CP quality, but it's certainly not that far off when it comes to the enviroments and enemies. lighting, fog, foliage, textures: it's very pleasant to look at. the same goes for enemy animations, weapon models and your own animations.
where the engine kinda fails is human npc models and some interiors. 
the icing on top is the level of detail employed here. every enviroment is full of detail, telling small stories (similiar to the 3D Fallouts) or looks kinda ""real"". 
the OST is great, kinda feeling like ""Stranger Things"" in parts (minus the popular charts songs). 
the U.I. looks good, but is  a tad strange to use with M/K. you get used to it fast enough, still it's kinda clunky. 

what makes this game so addicting is the gameplayloop. it's a FPS, but loot is everywhere. from weapons, schematics for crafting (which got it's own little skill-tree-thingy), to player skill progression. exploration is rewarded asmuch as combat. 
the plot does a good job of leading you along while beeing surprisingly entertaining. 
combat feels very thight. you fight robots similiar to Horizon Zero Dawn, just kinda the mature/FPS version. each enemy got it's own ""weakspots"", which got their own hitboxes: fuel-tanks (which result often enough in a one-hit-kill), weapon mounts (disable), movement-moduls or actual vision-tools. since most enemies got also armor-plates where you hit matters. you can kinda dps-spam normal enemies, but actualy aiming conserves ressources and makes it way, way, way easier. 
but that's not all: either by looting or crafting you can employ a gigantic amount of tools. setup turrets, throw nades, lay traps with gas-tanks, lure enemies with flares, radios, etc. . 
the FPSing feels great, but mixed with the vast amount of incombat and precombat choices it becomes stellar.
neatly setting up encounters, by setting up traps, sniping, etc. and then crushing whole packs of robos feels great.
and you kinda need to play it smart: starting from the normal difficulty upwards enemies deal a hefty amount of damage. similiarly to souls-like games you are not ment to tank damage. 

a realy well crafted, very addicting looter, rpg, exploration FPS, even in pure singelplayer.

about the only thing i kinda miss/or would like to be added is followers, aka npc-help like merc in Diablo or npc-companions the 3D Fallouts got (or the Farcry games).",1673223836,1673223836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first review was more of a disappointed one - especially because of the inefficient use of the beautiful Avalanche engine that i enjoyed and experienced to a significant extent in theHunter game. The narrative feels much more immersive, the atmosphere is much more in-tune with the map, locations and milestones as well. FXAA+TAA option was already a nice touch and the entire game feels more stable and optimized - with all settings cranked up to max (even with the global illumination) it feels smooth with desirable fps values. The latest updates seem to have worked well and led me to start the game anew with an even more hype and curiosity that i felt the last time. In my humble opinion, the game is now complete and became a title that should not be missed.

If you wish, feel free to read my previous review and edit before changing my vote, down below.
                                                                       
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit after two DLCs and a few months later: even its ""complete"" version feels so empty - it appears the Avalanche Engine turned out to be a liability for the game - rather than its strong suit. Sure, for a game like theHunter, vast stretches of true-to-scale-ish landscapes might positively contribute to the immersion aspect of an already realistic setting - yet in Generation Zero, you find yourself in the middle of sheer boredom with nobody/nothing to interact for miles and miles of Scandinavian territories, isolated from almost everything and in an action-shooter hybrid this is unacceptable (no wonder the mobile phone technology was developed initially around this region: Finland and Sweden).

Technical instabilities seemed to have been corrected and the game surely looks better, compared to the state it was first released in. However i'm still wondering why evil robots chose one of the least populated regions on the entire planet to invade?! I'm sincerely hoping to get the answer with a clever plot twist endgame.

This game is the worst open-world game I have played in my life. It has a boring gameplay loop, a wide array of bugs, a terrible story, horrible devs, and many more issues. I HIGHLY recommend not to purchase this game or even play it if you get it for free. Spend your time elsewhere.

(P.S. ACHIEVEMENT HUNTERS BEWARE! This game has bugged achievements that haven't been fixed for months!)

[h1]Full Review[/h1]

This game is an amalgamation of so many things I dislike in a game. There are way too many specific issues to list, so I will go over the main points on why I dislike this game so much. Keep in mind I have done nearly all the content in the game and visited nearly every area. I have fully extracted what this game has to offer, and I am still making this negative review.

The gameplay. It gets boring VERY fast. If you want to do everything the game has to offer, you will quickly notice that the game is mostly a looting simulator whenever you aren't fighting robots. As for fighting the robots, that gameplay loop becomes quite repetitive, as there are only a few robots in the game with various levels of difficulty. The difficulty of facing and taking down these robots has to be the few fun things about the game, but it becomes a chore that hinders your progress after the 50th time you encounter the same group of robots. Not to mention, these robots can also sense you from what seems to be multiple football fields away, which is fair but becomes quite annoying VERY fast. You learn to deal with it, but that is still a factor that I disliked about this game. The world is also very boring to traverse or just straight up a herculean task at times. 

The bugs. This game is FULL of bugs. The achievements have bugs, the guns have bugs, the map has bugs, the leveling system has bugs, skills have bugs, enemies have bugs, and many more other things HAVE BUGS! What is really sad is that this game had EVEN MORE BUGS when it was released. To go into a bit more depth, I will describe multiple bugs I have encountered in the game. There are around 10 achievements that are bugged and do not activate if you fulfill the requirements for it. Sometimes they eventually activate, and sometimes, they don't. There is also a bug where your gun doesn't register the ammo that you put into your inventory from your storage, and you need to manually place the ammo inside of your gun via the ""Attachments"" menu. This was a small issue but an annoying one, nevertheless. There is also a near game-breaking bug that ruins the difficulty of this game entirely. The skill ""Survivor"" allows you to revive yourself for free once every combat encounter. You would expect this to mean between every firefight between the enemies, but it turns out that the enemy AI is so flawed/buggy that every single time you get downed, you are registered as leaving the combat encounter, so essentially, you get free revives as many times as you want during combat encounters. This also isn't exactly consistent, as sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I would love to go more into the bugs that are present in this game; however, this section is already long enough as it is. 

The story. The story here is just to set up the world and give a vague reason as to why you are fighting these robots. It is basically a nonexistent story, and the quests you do in this game are simply to gain XP and nothing more. I recall there only being one quest I actually cared to listen about, and even then, it was around a paragraph of dialogue, likely even less. Also, the ""final mission"" of the game was one of the worst ""final missions"" I have ever done in a game throughout all my 21 years of living on this earth. Spoilers ahead for the rest of this section, but it simply gives you vague dialogue on what is happening in this game behind the scenes, says you are being used, cues a few explosions, and teleports you to another place outside of the mission zone. After this sequence, credits play, and you get a brief explanation saying, ""You don't know how you escaped but here you are."" That is literally the ""final mission"" that everything in the game ""leads"" up to. They can't even be bothered to wrap up their game in a coherent manner.

The developers. These devs are some of the shadiest people I've played a game for. One of the first things they require you to do is to create an account to play the game, which allows them to sell your information to third parties based on the game's terms and conditions. I don't really care about my information getting sold, but this is highly concerning to someone who does. Also, despite all the bugs in the game, the devs decide to make paid DLC that lock a decent number of achievements or simply give you items (which sometimes are worse than items in the base game). Another gripe I have about their DLC is that the main methods of transportation in the base game are with one bicycle and one motorbike, and the max speeds you can reach on these vehicles are quite low considering the sheer amount of space in this game. All the other vehicles with higher speeds and other stats are located within the DLC. This isn't exactly the worst thing ever, but I thought I should mention it. Also, as of this review, the devs haven't addressed a major issue with a MAINLINE QUEST where it cannot complete, and you hear explosions nonstop from every point in the map. People are mentioning it on the forums, Reddit, and etc; however, the devs simply don't seem to care. 

Overall, this game is a piping hot sewage waste that I could NEVER recommend to anyone else. I only have this much time in the game because I have an irrational hatred toward not completing things that I start. I sincerely hope after reading this review, you choose not to play this game or outright refund it. The initial experience of the game is enjoyable, but that is about it. I implore you to take a look at all the other reviews here while also noticing the playtime in relation to if they recommend it or not.

Oh, and also Sweden. 

Realistically, this is barely enough to sell me on the game, but the enemy designs weren't generic, it didn't look like a lazy asset flip made with Unity, and the graphics looked OK-ish. So, I gave it a shot when it was on sale. 

I cannot recommend this game. I can see that the developers put at least a fair amount of effort into creating a unique entry into a clogged genre, but this game comes out feeling more generic than even the most painfully lackluster zombie games do. The animations and character models are genuinely [i]worse[/i] than even [i]Mass Effect: Andromeda[/i] was [u]at release[/u], the way your character holds weapons and items is disturbingly strange, the tutorial is decidedly unhelpful at telling you what to do, enemy AI is both predictable and blindingly stupid in the way it handles combat, stealth is a joke, and the world feels both lifeless and boring despite being 1980's Sweden during a robot apocalypse. 

I mean, wow, how do you mess up a premise like that? 

Despite the supposedly Swedish setting, there is little that distinguishes this pocket of woodland and outdoor areas from any other setting for any other survival game. The idea that in the intervening years between WWII and 1980 Sweden somehow became a military powerhouse and gave everyone a gun because possible apocalypse would be laughable if it wasn't so bizarre it makes my brain hurt. This makes the whole setting feel more than a little silly, like the punchline of some bizarre Monty Python sketch. 

Honestly, even without playing this game for more than half a hour- which was generous at that- I can tell you there's nothing here you haven't seen in half a dozen other games in the same genre. 9/10 for creativity, but a whopping 3/10 for execution. Avoid unless you're a die-hard Survival-Crafting fan and just [i]have[/i] to play every game in the genre regardless of blandness.",1672894906,1672894906,False,2,1,0.520257651805877686,0,True,False,False

Cons:
Minor glitches such as, when storing your inventory, there's a button to store everything that's not currently being used. It's supposed to leave anything on your hotbar, and anything attached to those things on your hotbar (i.e the rifle on your hotbar, the scope on the gun, and the ammo in it) and basically ignore them, while storing everything else. It does not always do this.
Some items don't really seem to be thought out. For instance, the small fuel tanks and large propane tank all weigh the same, which would be a problem if you didn't get one with every third of fourth enemy you kill, quickly adding 10's of kilos to your weight.
After a few hours of game play, there's so many enemies it's really hard to get anywhere without just shooting your entire way there, shooting everything while you're there, and then shooting your entire way back. There is no lack of ammo is you take more than 5 seconds to look around, but it's still an inconvenience.
Enemy ragdolls can be....wonky. Watching a small enemy the size of a person yeet the dead body of an enemy the size of a hours into the stratosphere because they bumped into them.

The pros:
Literally 95% of the game. It has fun game mechanics with figuring out the weak points of each enemy, and how best to employ your provided weapons to take them out. The gun fights can get pretty intense, even overwhelming if you aren't careful. You'll start fighting with 1 and next thing you know, there's 10 of them. It makes you really think about whether some fights are worth it or not instead of just running around like an unstoppable bulldozer.
The sound design has some oddities but for the most part it is amazing. The suppressed weapons sound suppressed, but a .50cal will echo off the near by mountains for a solid 3 seconds. Just absolutely beautiful.
Decent weapon selection, although there are some weapons that are just clearly better than others in every way. It still gives you options, which is nice.

So there would not be the sort of character-driven game where people would just go, ""okay, I understand you were being tortured by a monster, that can't be it, let's stop and go get some food here, let's get some water there, wait for someone to come over, kill you or get a drink there and just do the things you don't want to do"", and that was a really beautiful way to",1672876807,1672876807,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Im not a huge fan of FPS games, but Im hooked. 

Weapons feel and sound just right, bullet impacts feels real, gun-play is just excellent.  I cannot stress enough how the very high quality sounds in this game really adds to the atmosphere. 

Do yourself a favour and just play on the easier difficulty until you get some experimental weapons, then switch up the difficulty to medium. 

Otherwise you'll end up wasting all of your health packs and ammo on 1 large fight. 

Starting the game on the normal difficulty is very punishing, but if you like that sort of thing, go for it!

Highly recommended just to play on the easiest difficulty, otherwise it will sour your experience. 

With the lights off, and an empty house,  and a quality headset  this game scared the crap out of me at first. 

Listening to the heavy thumps off in a distant field, and the trumpeting horn of the hunter packs is unsettling.

Yeah, it's tough at first, but if you play it smart and avoid combat (at least initially), explore the visually decent and constantly changing environment, and stockpile ammo, the game becomes easier and you can take out even the biggest enemies. I'll admit, the cars, bunkers, and houses all looking the same is a bummer, and the crafting system is kind of pointless. But if you can look past those issues, this game is a great escape for those of us who want a slower-paced, single player experience. It's not as polished as some other games in the genre, but for the price of a cheap meal, you get hours of solitude and the chance to vent some frustration by destroying giant robots.

I know my play-time on this is pretty low to be reviewing it already but thats how bad of an initial impression this game has made so far. It has some glaring issues and I'll go through them.

The first is the premise. The game doesn't seem to be able to decide whether it wants you to be mid-apocalypse that's been going on for quite some time or dealing with something that happened six minutes ago. They'll have diagrams of where to shoot the robots in world as well as people hoarding supplies and having safe camps but the main premise of the initial story is 'this happened five minutes ago, you were on a boat that got shot for some reason and you washed ashore'. A grand total of five minutes had to have been spent on the game's story and it's glaringly poorly realized. Most of the story is told via the same annoying NPC chattering in on the radio constantly. She will not shut up, she doesn't talk like a real person, and will not permit more than thirty seconds of silence to go by before another round of forced crappy dialogue. We're not even going to get into the fact that this person's survival plan was to run to a church and call her grandparents for some reason.  To round it off, the game is supposed to be cold war era but you could have fooled me. It could easily be set in modern day and it wouldn't have made an impact on the story. Neither does the 'total defense' system they keep referencing. It as all tell, and no show.

The combat also isn't great. You're meant to trek large distances on foot with an incredibly short sprint meter. I was frustrated this, but it didn't take too many combat encounters for me to understand why. The game's AI literally cannot handle a player sprinting. It will pretty much be unable to track and you'll get through a lot of combat encounters quite easily just by strafing in and out of cover. The shooting is a bit clunky and there seems to be a bit of RNG involved even when ADS from things like movement, which is fine but isn't communicated by the gun model (some visual sway would be nice to signal to me that this is a thing, but that's more of a nitpick.). There are explosives like gas cans that you can't actually throw, you just drop and bait enemies onto. The ammo and inventory screens are super unintuitive and it's a pain to get your items where you actually need them.

So between the combat, voice acting, characters, and story all irritating the hell out of me from pretty much minute one I have to say give this game a hard pass. If I can bring myself to play the game any further I'll update this review with more details but it takes a LOT to leave such a bad taste in my mouth so fast.",1672714048,1672714048,False,5,0,0.518815577030181885,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
Excellent tone and visual story telling
Fun and exciting gunplay
Enemies are varied and interesting to battle
Visually stunning

Cons: 
You have to make a separate account (or be heavily pushed into doing so)
Your neighbors will not appreciate the screams of ""OH GOD, ANOTHER FUCKING WALKER""

Great visuals that may not be the easiest to capture on a screenshot. A good balance of realism and style. Not too much in your face information or splash screens. Total freedom to tackle situations or just free roam, loot, stalk, blast bots. Absolutely wonderful feeling riding around on the Cykel in the middle of a full moon night, listening the ambience, seeing distant lights, like police car flashing. Menus have a filter option for items (by weight, name, time acquired). Recycling and learning (getting points for ""manufacturing"" upgrades) from making items is quite fun. Riding a bike is really a blast in this game, even though the steering is super sensitive at speed and the brakes are immediate. Really cool to just pedal away in the trails of Swedish forests :D

I played pretty much nonstop for 14+ hours and didn't go much past the first part of the islands. So much to see.

-Little rough around the edges (which adds to the charm).
-Inventory menu font size is quite massive in 2560x1440 (console port (conformity?) issue / ""laziness""?)
-Scrolling the items on the list is janky
-Changing gun attachments is pretty cumbersome (though may add to realism)
-Looting gets a bit repetitive , which may have something to do with difficulty setting, so loot spawns to already lootet places, though which would be totally fine in multiplayer situation.
-Character may get stuck when in tight places or when on a bicycle at terrain. 
-House designs seem very similar (at least at the start of the game) which is also understandable from developer standpoint. 
-No reusable stashes in the wild. At least at the starts?
-There are some very quick key commands that may come as a surprise and may not be introduced (like quick moving items inside menus by pressing E)
-No ability to walk the bike to hard to reach areas or let it roll down a hill (this may be possible by dismounting at speed)
-On bicycle, you can get stuck without option to dismount

What I would like to see
-Ability to quickly set an item to the quick access by pressing number on a numpad
-Inventory should have at least 8 slots showing at a time so one could see all the items currently in quick access (plus a filter option for showing the quick access items first, with like a checkbox)
-Stashes that you could either put up by yourself or pre determined stash points (like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.)
-Tire splashes from bicycle tires when riding through puddles
-Selection of bicycles (basic commuter, about 25-30 km/h max, a hybrid, about 35-45 and a road bike 45-65+ (at downhill).",1672469620,1672469620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the recent update, the mission 'Wrench in the Works' will soft lock your save. You can do other missions before it and kinda skip it until the end, but you will have to do it eventually since it is a main mission. During the last section of the mission, you have to escape the facility that you have gathered information in. It's exploding as you escape (get it, wrench in the works) but there is one issue. You can never escape the facility. Sure you can walk right out or teleport to the other side of the map, but the game doesn't recognize that you have escaped. Now this wouldn't be that much of a problem but in my experience, I can't track any other missions and the explosions from the facility are heard all around the island. Usually, there are explosions in the game of robots attacking, but this is a constant set of explosions in the same direction on a loop of about 10 seconds. You could get away with the tracking missions issue, but the explosions will basically force you to either disable audio or stop playing all together. Now bugs like this happen a lot in story based games with the devs releasing regular updates. 

This issue with the game has soft locked many users other then myself into not playing this game. On steam discussions, there was one guy who stated that ""Can't open the prototype lab gate"" referring to this mission. Sorry, that was in 2019, this mission has had bugs since the start of the game. The old bug is fixed, but why can't they block users from doing the mission at least? The new bug has been reported as far back the 12th of December and reconsidered by the devs the day after it's report. Can't the devs just (if it is easy to mess with save files) revert the starting of Wrench in the Works for anyone who has started it or block the mission from being done by new people. The devs have also stated that this will not be fixed until February. It doesn't make sense, but this is Avalanche's dev group called Systemic Reaction. They are a relatively new studio that has 2 buggy games out, and this is one of them.

TL:DR
Systemic Reaction can make good games but can't bug fix quick enough. You will have fun with the games these guys make until you find the game breaking bug in them.",1672433933,1672433933,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have spent over 9 hours on this game and over half of it is me trying to fix the crashing that the devs should have fixed instead leaving me trying to fix a crash that crashes your game anywhere from 1 second to over an hour.

I wish for these problems to be fixed in the future, but they have been around for years. In other words: Great game, terrible bugs.

As of right now, I still think its a great game. I was able to play around 20 more hours of gameplay before the crashes came back. If you want this game, you need a high-end gaming computer, otherwise you will get what I did: Disappointment when it crashes again, and again, and again.

I found out that the reason the game wasn't working was because my computer could not handle it. I had a windows 10, and when looked into it, my computer could handle it, although it was just barely into the ""not compatible zone"". Turns out it wasn't able to handle it, with the RAM and GPU going over by the slightest amount.

Every time you lose internet connection for a moment, a message pops up saying you lost connection and your windows cursor permanently stays on screen and moves independently to your crossfire. 

So you basically have a floating arrow on your screen constantly unless you quit to desktop and start the game again because that is the only solution. Trust me even tho you won't notice it that much doing anything else, your connection drops for a split second for couple of times every gaming session(2-6hrs) even with a decent provider.

Another annoying bug is that same shit happens when you are changing weapons while running, which you will be doing constantly because it is part of the combat gameplay loop.

Also you get stuck on pretty much everywhere. In a game that plays like a stealth game, this shit is unacceptable. 

My first review on a steam game and it is on this unbearable annoying piece of shitee because you will actually like the game as it is pretty fine, so it will be far more disappointing to HAVE to quit the game.

The game has none of it. I don't know if it's supposed to be played with friends but trying to play it solo is a sure-fire way to get frustrated due to the enemies' huge pool of HP and damaging attacks when all you can do to enhance your protection is to rely on an useless skill tree and even more useless clothing schematics that will grant you a ridiculous protection bonus that won't mean shit when you get ganged up by 4 Tanks at once.

The game has its pros. The world is huge and interesting to explore, the loot aspect is there to satisfy scavengers such as me and its always exciting to try a new weapon after finding a better quality variant. The graphics aren't that bad, nothing special either. For some reason, the game makes my CPU go BRRRRR and turn my PC into a portable heater. The gunplay is fun too, though some weapons are plain useless no matter the approach you choose.

You'll enjoy the game until you leave the initial island. As soon as you step into the mainland, you'll be greeted by a hard to explain difficulty spike, that gets smoothed up once you find better weapons, but still, the enemies are such bullet sponges that turns any engagement into a long and dreaded battle where you'll get hit inside buildings by melee attacks from outside range and blasted by AoE missiles despite being under cover. It makes the game so hard to enjoy and after you put some hours into it, it gets frustrating enough to make me drop the game. That tipping point for me was the Firebird. Fuck that thing, really. 

Anyway, as I've said in the opening lines of this review, it hurts me to give it a negative review. There are fun times to be had, but I have no idea why the developers wanted it to be so scarse and hidden behind bullet sponge enemies with no idea how walls are supposed to work. I'm willing to give this game another try if someday I get enough friends to play it and tackle the enemies as a team and only then this game might provide a enjoyable experience, because as a solo player, I'm not touching it again.",1672244080,1672244080,False,4,0,0.537311077117919922,0,True,False,False

EDIT-
This game in now unplayable solo.robots are bullet sponges and tanks will leave you with no ammo and they will still be standing.sniper robots take you out practically with one shot AND THEY DON'T MISS.hiding and finding cover doesn't work cause they will gas and bombard you until you move. im tired of looting an entire town with a bunker and losing all my resources on a small skirmish. i don't have time to endlessly mag dump robots. like i get it killing robots is the main point but still makes fighting very boring, i've got places to be missions to do. Killing robots takes WAYYYY to long even with the highest tier weapons.

say what you want that im bad at the game or im just not built different, but i've put a lot of time into shooters and this is the first time i have ever lowered the difficulty and said %$#@ this! i shoulden't have to die 15/20 times just to kill a few robots.

the game when it was still under major developments was playable and i made alot of progress but now its just a major waste of my time for literally no reward.like most games playing for hours straight will leave you feeling like you've made progress but not this one, you will have spent or 7 hrs playing and just killed 50 robots, and died a hundred times, completing maybe 2 or 3 missions leveling up also maybe once or twice.

 at the end of they day this game will test your patience, don't play it solo bring friends because its wayy more fun that way",1614888128,1672123405,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The combat is great, you can easily be killed if you get too cocky especially when you just start out. The enemies aren't too hard or too easy to kill, even with the improved weapons you get further down the line.

The missions aren't too tedious or confusing to do, it always feels fun to complete them and get another; especially with friends. 

The optimization is great too, I can run the game on ultra-graphics on a laptop with relative ease.

Now, all that being said, why do I not recommend it?: Invasive as hell (gathering FAR TO MUCH INFO FROM YOU), required to have some kind of account to play, get's boring really fast, hit registration is REALLY inconsistent, the ""boss"" bots that show up every now and then can be put down like they're no threat at all..I can keep going but after that, some of my gripes will just be petty stuff.

Verdict for me: Catch this game on a sale if you're really itching to play it, that's why I even got it in the first place, cause it was on sale.

The Good:
- The game's idea.
- The design of the robots.
- The audio design of the robots, the guns, and the environment.
- The ease of being able to gather resources.
- English is a second language for the devs and they did a fantastic job with that not hindering their UI or in-game content.
- Night time has some added suspense that makes the game more fun when exploring a new area.
- Cosmetics effect the UI, such as wearing a gas mask adds a filter to the screen and new breathing audio.

The Bad:
- The character models and clothing system are very under-baked
- Travel is extremely tedious with sprint requiring such a strict cool-down and a very frustrating experience trying to use the bicycles in game.
- The campaign is boring and you immediately know what the entire game will play like within the first two hours.
- The voice acting of the people you encounter is bad and doesn't help with immersion.
- The in-game weekly challenges are uninspiring and frankly a feature that shouldn't be baked into the game already when so many other things are not.

The Ugly:
- The AI is terribly stupid and very easy to kill right out of the gate.
- The game is glitchy and you will encounter rubber-banding and environment glitches.
- Combat is dull and not at all rewarding. You don't really feel like you've achieved anything by surviving an encounter and the loot is nothing to celebrate.

- There is no stealth in this game. You will be spotted unless you belly-crawl from a mile away.
--- I could see why this would add a layer of intensity, excitement, and fear to the player who is trying to traverse the map, but as mentioned in other points, the AI is nowhere near scary enough to invoke those feelings. Its more tedious than exciting.

- The in-game crafting system and leveling up system is horrific.
--- I feel almost certain that the recycling bench does nothing other than delete something from my inventory, if that's not the case I saw no advantages in recycling items.
--- The crafting system needs to be far more straightforward and transactional with resources. I felt like I collected hundreds of resources with very little to do with them in return.
--- Leveling up takes far too much effort to improve abilities that should be significantly easier to attain. It shouldn't take me 7+ hours of leveling up to have only achieved sprinting mildly faster and being able to carry a bit more weight. 

- Multiplayer might as well not exist. 
--- No voice chat in the multiplayer.
--- To my knowledge, multiplayer is completely randomized.
--- It's glitchy, really poorly executed, and rarely lasts longer than minutes.
--- Multiplayer can and will result in the game randomly closing with no warning. 

- Adding DLC to this game in its current state should be a sin
--- They are nickle and diming players with ""DLC Bundles"" that should absolutely be patch updates. 
--- In it's current state, the $7 I spent feels like full value of what is available in-game. I don't know why the developers think their game is worth $25 or $50 with a DLC bundle.
--- This game is completely unfinished game and any new content should be regarded as patch updates. Reward players for investing in your passion project by using the money they've already paid you for content you've promised. We hate triple A studios for abusing the DLC system for profits, what makes you think you can get away with it as a small studio?

Summary:
In what could have been a very promising game and a staple for a new studio, has turned into a half-baked cash grab built on a great idea. I hope the developers pull their head out of their asses and make some much needed directional changes that can save this game.",1671849081,1671995475,False,7,2,0.528441905975341797,0,True,False,False

I have spent hours upon hours upon hours destroying everything I could find.. reading everything I could find and trying to get a SIMPLE explanation as to how to get your base attacked, and even though the guides are written in english, it might as well have been in ancient greek.. So.. destroy a bot and a dice rolls.. you cannot see this dice.. but it rolls and you have a chance to have something happen that could lead to something else, then you run around while rubbing your belly and patting your head.. just 4 times and click your heels.. then you have to go around and destroy a bunch of things.. maybe.. but then a dice will roll again.. but maybe not, then during winter solstice you have to do a back flip jump shot bullseye to a bot named george.. and a dice will roll and MAYBE.. you MIGHT.. get to defend a base? possibly? 10 videos, countless posts.. cannot figure the damn thing out for the life of me.. so.. bad devs.. I was liking this game.. only to find out its broken and too late to get a stupid refund.. no wonder it was on sale. 


I am really enjoying the game, and I am still at the beginning so my input is limited. The only thing I would like to see is more options when creating a multiplayer game.. so far there is a LOT of loot. I have more bandages at any given time than I know what to do with.. So something where you can change the difficulty of the robots to more than 3 settings.. change the amount of loot into 5 levels, scarce, low, med, high and abundant and thats really the only things I see right now.. this game has had me in intense moments..

While I understand people's frustrations and scepticism, I don't understand how you can make a negative review with >5 hours of play time. 

What's good? 
Graphics, fire-fights, plenty of objectives to follow (including side missions), tier-based weapon systems, the skill tree, schematics to improve your crafting capabilities and much more. For a custom-made engine, it's rather impressive what they have accomplished. There's plenty to do, plenty to discover and plenty of enemies to keep the game challenging and engaging. 

What's not so good? 
I've experienced a few random/unexplained crashes in multiplayer, multiplayer progression does not transfer to your singleplayer save (only your person achievements & unlocks), if you are a bit of a lone wolf, some areas/machines may be a bit overpowering, forcing you to seek alternative routes of progression unless you're a strat-king.

In terms, of story and lore it's pretty interesting but the quests are little lack luster. More or less you find a place, collect an item, get some lore and call it a day. 

But you're here for the base building, the grind, the ACTION! And oh boy when you see a Harvester or Tank for the first time, it's pretty darn terrifying. This game has a solid upgrade system, and attachments system to best suit your play-style.

If you want the best experience play with friends. I recommend the DLC as more of a side thing, especially if you think the weapons the vanilla game aren't as tasteful.

I'd highly recommend picking this beauty up during a sale, and be sure to have some friends tag along.

I’m just reviewing the single player thus far because I’m not social enough for that nonsense. I almost didn't play this due to a few privacy reviews because I hate companies that bottleneck you into giving up exorbitant data in order to use their product after you’ve purchased it. However, that really isn’t the case. Just select limited profile and you don’t have to jump through any 3rd party hoops. 

This is a good value, especially for what I was expecting. The gun play is somewhat of a crossover between CSGO and the first Mass Effect—by that I mean there are few frills and a clean aiming mechanism. The atmosphere is solid—I especially like the scenario of machines taking over, and the most fun I have in the game is at max difficultly in the initial stages when they’re able to maintain the confusion of a spontaneous ground invasion. 

Pros:

*Good combat AI—I’m playing on max difficultly, so I don’t know how the machines behave on other modes, but they chase the hell out of me and work together. This was always my complaint of Horizon Zero Dawn:that a game about AI had zero AI in it. The AI has led to some fun combat situations.

*Awesome scenario. It could be that I just like machines taking over. When it’s working well, it’s Red Dawn meets Horizon Zero Dawn and the show Jericho (albeit with quasi-Resident Evil like cheesy lines from translation… I haven’t decided if the audio is a positive or negative yet.)

*Tough spawn. It’s demoralizing, but refreshing in those instances when you have to travel miles because a giant machine killed you on your last health kit.

*So far, leveling up hasn’t broken the game. 

*Really good performance. Nice graphics and 17 hours in, and I haven’t noticed any frame drops.

*Character takes realistic fall damage, enough that it caught me off guard to die from slipping on a rock.

*The world is big, open and has an immersive aesthetic.  


Cons: 

*Low interactivity of environments. I’m torn on this one because the game preforms really well at high settings and I’d hate to see it get bogged down, but more interactivity with objects and a smoother crafting system feels needed. 

*Not enough character stories. Short stories of locally affected people would be far more interesting than the overarching main story. 

*Simple crafting system still manages to be cumbersome.

*Spawn isn’t brutal enough. I know I mentioned that the spawn as a positive—but I meant that it’s better than most games. At least in hard mode, it would be good to remove the players ability to game the machines by continuously re-spawning when they’re chose to a safe house. Maybe a realism mode of torturous difficulty would be a good addition. 

*Menus. The menus aren’t bad, but they aren’t designed for you to make changes on the fly. To switch the health kits on your quick select, you have to scroll through a backpack full of mostly useless bs. Given so many weapons, a system that feels smooth when you’re swapping out items would be nice.

I have beaten the main story and the dlc's up to now and have reached max level and farmed all the experimental weapons par two of them, which I'm still working on.

On the topic of the dangerous experiments update, it's....interesting.
The new map updates are quite cool, and the item rebalance made a massive change in the right direction. But, the difficulty change and the way enemies now attack much more aggressively, especially when many attacks are undodgeable, makes the combat much more annoying now. Like I understand there was a need to make it more challenging, but this is way too much. I don't want to walk into a horde of 10 fnix and apoc hunters, 4 fnix tanks, 2 apoc harvesters, and more runners than i can count, and proceed to get gassed, blown up, or one shot every other second by a sniper shot. I have used more adrenaline shots in the past 3 days than I had in my entire previous playtime, and thats a massive issue when i cant craft them anymore without killing almost 100 rivals. That is all to say the enemies need to be toned back a bit, a lot actually. Another massive nerf for zero reason, medkits now craft one at a time, but the recipe remained the same, making them substantially more expensive. Anything higher than a standard is just a waste to craft since its so expensive now, making both the advanced and experimental health kits useless. With the item rebalance, you do find a lot more textile and thread, but that pales in comparison to how much you need, especially with the new horrible difficulty increase. On the note of the apparel crafting now, its basically useless, since you need to collect substantially more to receive the same bonuses, making it a chore, same with the experimental scematics, i was lucky enough to alreayd have most of them, but now with you just getting points, it would take probably 10-15 hours of just grinding rivals to get the points needed to unlock them. Which is a direct contrast to the likes of the ammo and equipment point system, where you get one point per craft, meaning i had everything unlocked from both trees in less than an hour, which is waaaaaaay to easy to do. On the bright side of crafting, ammo has seemingly gotten lighter, which is nice, and the dlc ammo drops naturally more and can be crafted now, which is good. SPOILERS AHEAD - STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW WEAPONS. The new experimentals are just odd if I'm honest. The rifle acts like a grenade launcher in having a lobbed shot with massive fall off velocity, while the shot is visually an AOE, while it isn't. And at any useful distance where you can hit an enemy while looking at it, the damage is terrible. Any farther distance, in which the damage is high, you basically have to aim waaay above the enemy or borderline straight up, aka not even on your screen anymore, which is hella stupid. While sure it has one of the highest damages possible now, its bunch of gimmicks makes in very unreliable, making the exp pvg still the best option for a sniper, aside from maybe the vintovka from the new dlc. The new lgm (kvm 89) is basically just an lmg version of the exp ag4, making it about as useful as that. Lastly the exp .44 magnus. I actually really like the magnus, its a different playstyle, but a potentially ""safer"" one if you get used to it. The shot doesn't get effected by itself, but when shot through an object, it more or less shotgun blasts through the other side, dealing potentially very high damage, as well as the blast going substantially farther than the 12 gauge. So instead of running around shooting things directly, you can now hide behind bodies or objects such as trees, rocks, or buildings, etc, and shoot through them. The advertised way of being able to do that through living enemies does happen, but imo can't be relied on since you effectively have to ingore the enemy shooting at you in front to kill the one standing behind it, making it not very viable to do that in a big fight. I have found the pistol to be very viable in dealing with fnix assault missions though, being able to blast mines and enemies through the walls, and absolutely massacre the main beacon through the wall when all generators are down.

I have enjoyed this game a lot but now it's getting harder to like it. The Dangerous Experiments update, while it brought many neat things like the new experimental weapons and the crafting tweaks and skill tree, also brought an annoying update to the crafting costs and amounts. For example, I craft 60 standard medkits because I run and gun, the cost was reasonable. But after the update, a single standard kit costs 8 textile to craft, multiply that by 60 and you'll notice how ludicrous the cost is now. I am out of textile at the time of typing this because of that update (I had over 1k in textile)..

The game also of course has it's fair share of bugs, from map glitches (telephone poles in the middle of the road, cracks in the map) to weapons disappearing on you at random (ie: My friend's experimental KVM 59 disappeared the next day after I gave it to him and he stored it) even to the Lynx machines randomly lasering you with full auto rather than burst firing, both machine guns and rockets, it can drop you in a second.. There are more glitches but I'm sure the community has reported on them and the team is HOPEFULLY, working to iron these out.

My final complaint is the camo weapons skin DLC. Mainly the fact that it's a cosmetic DLC, changes nothing about how the game plays and doesn't give you an advantage, yet at the time of writing this, it costs 4 bucks, more than: US weapons pack 1, Soviet weapons pack, and US weapons pack 2 which are all 3 bucks and give you an advantage. It doesn't help that the camo skins pack just adds skins for the rest of the base game weapons, one skin per weapon.. Not really much variety either at the moment.

In conclusion, I have 332.7 hours on the game, I love this game and I've played it with friends a lot, it's painful to see the path it's going down as of late and I wanted to be honest with this review because it needs to be addressed. I'm still gonna play this game from time to time, but please, fix this stuff, I'm beggin ya. My friend was attacked by angry comments for being honest about the game's bugs and this ain't Metacritic, I'm not saying the game is complete doo doo, but I'm also not saying it's flawless. Right now, it's a 5/10, used to be a 7/10 before Dangerous Experiments.",1605308107,1671601994,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The weapon packs and base defense packs should all be normal updates to the game available to everyone, especially considering the lacklustre amount of weapons and buildable objects in the base game.

It's also a broken mess at times, so there's that.  Their god-awful online system is a buggy piece of garbage.  The daily challenges often disconnect from whatever system they use, without telling you, leading to a lot of wasted time and effort.  Multiplayer is also busted, where the host gets random bonus XP for no reason and quests simply don't work for any of the other players.  Base building and defense is really lacking as well.  It's the most bare-bones build/defend experience I've ever had in a game.

The stories will be different, but the game play will mirror closely.

My guess is avalanche liked their idea and took it and implemented it in this rather quickly put together game created with reused assets.

With that being said, if you just wanna run around soviet era Sweden and kill a bunch of fucking robot dog, spider, big spider. two legged robo-cop bullshit ass MFs, then yeah, by all means. I guess give it a go. I at least have been finding it entertaining. Though honestly the setting and the atmosphere are so eerie that it would honestly make for a better zombie game than robots.

         This game is like a horror game, when you first get in, and encounter your first killer robot, it is TERRIFYING.
The sounds they make are horrifying, even the smaller robots can be actual threats, and more than 3 can be a death sentence. This game truly is scary in a good way, and it makes me love the feeling of exploring somewhere new, because I don't know what the actual hell to expect. It's a great game, super fun, the people in multiplayer are actually pretty helpful, the progression is great, looting is fun, and it serves as a great time killer.

PS: The sound design is great, it really gives you the abandoned, war-torn, Swedish feel that it means to have.

PPS: If you like the feeling not being alone in the sense that all of a sudden, you could be met with danger, then this game is for you!",1671392656,1671392656,True,5,0,0.543759524822235107,0,True,False,False

The game has so much to do and it's really not grindy unless you want to. The game has so many different things to do and so many side missions. If i see a game that says i will take 40 hours to beat normally i can beat it in like 25. This game however truly pushed my skill to the edge made me think of what I should and should not do. If i had to give it a 1/10 rating i would say a solid 9, here are some reasons that I say this.


Pros:

1. So many different weapons. Their really is no level lock which makes game play challenging but fun. You could get broken guns at the start of the game but you would have to go through the hardship of difficult enemies.

2. Enemy detail. Each enemy has different weapons,classes, and look. Weapons can be shot off certain point can be shot to lower speed or the blow them up for extra dmg. Their really was a lot of thought put into it.

3. Story line. When i first got the game the story line was really indirect but the latest update changed it completely. Basically it overhauled the story line giving you someone else to talk to you and help you.

Con:

1. Enemy types/drop rates. The game doesn't have that many enemy types I would say it has 5 main ones that you encounter the most. The devs should add some more low level enemies. Drop rates specifically experimental weapons the highest tier. You could spend hours grinding for these and not get one the drop rates are low even for high level machines. I just think the drop rates should be slightly higher or you should have a higher chance the more rivals you kill without getting one.",1644371922,1671247550,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game makes no sense. There is basically no story. The missions are all over the place and the robots are so hard that you almost can't even leave a safe-house before dying. If I hadn't played with a friend, I don't think I would've actually kept playing. 

The game feels like it had a lot of potential and that the ideas probably began great, but Avalanche gave up with the game mid-way through and just repeated the same process over and over. When the strategy of killing robots is: dying, shooting a few shots and damaging the robot, then dying again and repeating this strategy.. something is definitely wrong. 

Sadly, I can't recommend this game unless you're a swedish person that wanna have fun in a game that only swedes understand or just a group of friends looking forward to have fun with the game for the first 5 hours. After that you'll just get bored of the game and find no fun in doing any missions since it's all the same for over 30 hours.

The core gameplay of fighting giant, somewhat believable robots with an assortment of well modeled weapons that sound and FEEL like they should for the mostpart in a beautifully rendered countryside is absolutely top notch. Enemies don't have a health bar, they have components. Shots that do no damage tell you via richochet. There's no hand holding tutorial but world building that warns you of enemies and their weaknesses and you get several tools to help you fight. 

Lures and distractions, the ability to escape and reset are all tremendously useful. Even if the AI is a little janky at times, it actually contributes to the idea you're fighting some kind of malign artificial intelligence or drone with lag from the operator. 

But it's not a perfect game by any stretch.

What the team put into the core game (And most important) was left lacking from other elements of the game. The skill system is serviceable at best. The game clearly has an emphasis on looting to keep you coming back as crafting is locked behind random drops from loot sometimes from 'boss' enemies making it very frustrating at times to even contemplate progression. 
Some features don't really seem to work as intended such as the map and log which could be combined into a single comprehensive page. 
The UI doesn't respond well. And so forth.

It seems to me you have an AMAZING team who put together the core of the game, but had to wing it on the details. Which is fine for what they're asking for the game usually. The DLC though, that's annoying. But I appreciate more content for free is a gift, not the expectation. 

I'd easily pay full price for a sequel that only needs to polish the core game (AI) add a little (Enemy types, interactions) and get the other systems up to the same level of quality the core gameplay is. 
Combining menus like crafting and recycling at the same workstation, storage and weapons tweaking, and improving the skill tree to have more interesting things than the typical ""Reload faster"" ""spot enemies"". The ability to hack enemies for instance is a wild departure from mostly passive perks and would be a great tree in itself. Or calling in rebel support, or perks for vehicles that unlock more and capabilities for them (Assuming AI could handle them) etc.",1671151378,1671151378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I originally wrote a good review for this game. It is a fun game and I have almost no complaints of gamep[lay besides a few annoying UI issues and sometimes seeing a robot spawn in front of your face. But later, I changed my review when I kept getting my system to freeze up and require a hard reset after quitting the game. I never had this issue with other games or apps on this computer before playing this game and it only occurred immediately after quitting this game, where my system would not shut down and everything I did caused it to freeze up more until finally I couldnt even move my cursor. And that was when the game wasnt crashing itself, which was frequent.

However, after a few days away from the game, I decided to try changing a few things in the nvidia graphics settings. I then game back to the game and tweaked more settings in my system (I also bought a new monitor, which I cant rule out as helping the issue). I was just changing a number of things, and nothing in particular seemed to stand out as the cause of this game crashing. While changing settings, I had some crashes. However, I think some setting is partly to blame for the crashes because now I do not crash as much and havent had a hard reset required for some time.

Before, I used to crash multiple times per playing session, and almost every time I quit the game my system required a hard restart using the power switch cycled to restart the computer. But now I have played a number of times and only get a few crashes and no hard restarts. I'm not sure if it is the settings I changed, the updates that the game has received lately, or some combo of both. But now that it doesnt appear to be crashing my system anymore, I feel I can once again recommend the game. However, if it is crashing your system, I dont recommend playing the game, as hard system crashes that require cycling the power to restart and reset your computer can cause serious damage to your OS, your data and your hardware.

When not crashing like this, I give this game a 9 out of 10. It's a lot like fallout 4 and Hunter call of the wild if they had a baby. totally recommend for the gameplay. Just my kind of game.",1667082015,1671042278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat is not guerilla-like at all with how far enemies can spot you along with how precise your shots have to be to actually do damage to the enemies(armor v. module damage). Getting hit is insanely punishing despite the aforementioned combat not catering to a guerilla playstyle. (looking at you apoc tanks)

Story sucks, both DLCs have an abrupt ending with no satisfaction as to what you've done. Although the voicetapes are cool, similar to early fo76. The lore is very unclear AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. Probably different for others because i'm just stupid. 

Grind for high level(25+) is awful especially with experimental equipment along with the fact past level 30 you don't get skillpoints.  Hunter rivals are literally just a waste of your RAM and GPU as they give terrible rewards and eat up your region/threat level/score for getting rid of them because there's a cap to how many rivals there are in a region.

playing with friends isn't bad. especially if you're messing around with physics. blowing eachother up and sending them miles away is peak humor. Although you can't progress thru quests together, so the second you leave your friend's lobby to play singleplayer it'll be as if you never played in the first place(minus your ammo/weapon pickups).

generation zero is a very buggy, unfinished, lazy feeling game that fails to achieve what it advertises. However, it's a good game in concept(even with friends) that is as fun as you can make it. If you want to have fun, stay away from rival grinding as you'll only get disappointment 99% of the time and an awe inspiring gun every 1 in 500 rivals. 

If you want to introduce a new friend to the game, kill a few rivals with them or give them some good guns so they don't have to suffer with the terrible grind.

I am really glad I did.  The gameplay is intense, bring in a few friends and it can get really crazy.  I highly recommend trying Gen Zero.  It is important to note that it has a unique questing and multiplayer system, but once you figure it out, the game really shines.  Like others,  I have experienced a few crashes which can be frustrating but they are rare. 

The games's battle mechanics is built with specific hitbox areas on enemies that do more damage, and wraps in a skill system to accommodate your particular play style.  It also has a some crafting as well as base building.  

Give it a go with some friends and you will not regret it.  Would make for a great gift for your pals that will turn into hours of fun.

Update 1 - not recommended: Great potential, but major irritants remain unfixed for well over a year now. 

One save :: You get one character save, which seriously sucks since its a campaign coop - so it stands to reason you would want to have a seperate save for yourself and for your groups;

inventory system :: is very strange and I don't like to be hyperbolic - but is the most innefectual method of inventory management i've ever seen in a game. It was actually changed a few months ago from an average system to now being a preposterously bad one. 

Weapons  ::  i found all the guns in the first couple of months of play, and now it has been a year since then with no new guns. one DLC has been launched, and a second one is coming now, and no new guns. Come on. That's boring, i'm sorry.

---HINTS---

 This game want you to build up angry robot level bar to 21+ by killing and do mission. Then you will have the right to fight hardest bot to get best weapons.  6 stars weapons will be drop by level 2(slim chance) -4 boss (10-30%)

Base building does not even give you option of where you want to build in the vast land....you have specific area......and let me tell you; some area are pathetic deploy with your command center easy for enemies to pop it. If it get pop...you have to spend 10 command points to fix it...basicly go find FNIX Base to get those 10 points.  Make sure look at your command center location and surrounding before purchase it. 

- How to play safely and ensure your victory -

1) Field radio is your #1 friend in this game. Deploy this little 1 kg item to give you an instant teleport waypoint for your whole team/friends to jump into action with you. (These radio only stay in your current session; if you leave the game it gone.)

2) Have at least 5-10 adrenaline sticks with you to self revive against big boss

3) Use high ground at your advantage when you can; and know where the choke points so you can set land mines or EMP them in group.

4) The game providing you with ton of looting places make sure loot as you go along. Leave no stone un-turn if you want to have maximum gear/fire power when needed.",1670363751,1670363751,True,3,0,0.537699639797210693,0,True,False,False

So what's worse than a bad game? A [b]boring[/b] one. This game, as well as Second Extinction, face the exact same problems. TLDR; The 'video' is terrific, the 'game' is painfully weak and lacking. Devs don't seem to understand what players want, or ignoring them. Only buy on sale, and play/suffer with friends.
I'll start with the good; punchy sound design that fits the intended aesthetic perfectly. Title theme is a blatant copy of the main Terminator theme, but it works. Explosions, gunfire, and visuals are superb. Robots are clearly inspired by Simon Stalenhag's work. They all have locational damage that actually means a darn and can disable weapons, mobility, or armor. Guns can be customized fairly well, and there's plenty of cosmetics.
But oh god, here comes the bad; It's BORING. The map is fairly gigantic, but it's gigantic stretches of nothing but loot containers and shoot the same 4 enemy types (or just 3 in the north coast). The side quests are exceptionally lacking and offer nothing of value nor compelling characters, never meeting a single one. Base assaults and defenses are resource sinks with no compelling rewards aside from grinding for the .50 cal railgun that obliterates everything. No interactive setpieces, no unique fights, only one 'boss' that you have to grind for ages to have show up. It [i]looks[/i] like there are a few spots that were meant to have cutscenes or neat things happen, but nothing ever does. Not once. Assets are ad nauseam copy and pasted. Whole hallways, rooms, so it gets a little confusing.
The game is also a clunky, unbalanced mess. Some skills do absolutely nothing of value (ADS, throw accuracy) while others do literally nothing (revive speed in a game with instant revives??). Getting stuck on geometry is all but guaranteed, and the vehicles control shockingly bad. The bikes control like they weigh 200+ pounds and the slightest tap sends you ragdolling for ~4 seconds. Just walk, seriously. It all lacks polish if I'm being honest.
If you want a weekend dose of Sweden (or wherever this game takes place) in the 1980's buy it on sale only. There are much better open world shooters out there worth your time though.",1670337648,1670338240,False,6,0,0.541227638721466064,0,True,False,False

But, in the end, after way too many hours clocked, all I got is an unnerving frustration.
now, I don't have a problem with difficult games. I know those exists, and if you play them, those are the rules.

But the problem with GZ is that the robots in the game do not abide by the same set of rules as you.

It's all gay and fun untill you find the first hardenned 2-legged robot.

And I'm not talking about the big ones that move slowly, unless they have a clear sight of you and then decide that sprinting as Usain bolt is something a 10-ton robot can do.

I mean about those 2 legged ones that seem ripped straight out of Alien 2. Here's the thing: If you have a robot, any robot, no matter the origin (Alien?) unless they are made of _adamantium_ the idea is that, well, _may be_ a full front RPG hit will take them down. But nop, I've hit one with 3 RPGs in a row, just to end killed by it.

Now, do you know what would happen - let's assume they are, effectively, made of adamantium, and cables and circuits are not affected by a blow this powerful - when you hit a robot this big, that is seriously unbalanced and the only reason it stands up is because of some beefed up AI? What would definitely happen, unless it has some sort of gravity altering Ant-Man reduced machinery, is that it would trip over. But no, it just stood there, Mohammed Ali style. Daring me to hit it one more time.

And don't get me started with the big big robots. I managed to kill 2, and to this day I have no idea why that happened.

In one occassion, I dropped a +500 bullet cargo of a 50 cal in one of those big ones (The ones with 2 legs as well, with the ""head"" between the legs)  straight into, well, the head - I managed this idiot to put it in a position where it'd just fire at me the machine guns because I was in plain sight, while at the same time a low building was between us - and the thing would just sit there.

Honestly, it's borderline idiotic that you need a cargo of more than 100 bullets, no matter the robot, to destroy it. Well, may be the big ones, but then a 50 cal mate. Seriously.

If we do get invaded by robots of this quality humanity is definitely doomed.

I understand that may be the idea here is to get people to play online - or, well... Buy the DLCs - but the difficult of this game once you reach the big robots is ridiculously impossible.

Sure, there are some issues, and I don't need to rehash the ones mentioned in other reviews.
The only one I haven't seen yet is that once in a while, you can get stuck in terrain. It is rare, but can happen.
But I love open world games, especially when you have the freedom to problem solve an approach that may not have worked before. You can be creative and do battle the way you see fit. I use a stealth ambush style ( which most probably do).
I have not progressed too far at this point. I have restarted a few times to get the hang of the game. I look forward to building a base someday.
But despite my first impressions being a little underwhelming, the game has grown on me.

Let me get to the thumb down reason.

As a person born and raised in Sweden, even I at times went: This is awesome! To see names that sound really swedish, in the game.
I almost believed that the names were taken from places in Sweden and put in the game, but it wasn´t.

But the more I played the more I noticed that things was... Lets say not as one hoped, or expected.

Sidenote: I played with a friend at the same time in co-op mode. And even he noticed this.

First (and biggest) problem.
The RPG/Skill tree.

When you look at the Paths that you can play and choose, 80% of them is a lie.

There is only two ways you acctually can play.
First is melee and second is ranged, in that order.
The big machines are not fast enough to turn around so you can run around them in circles and take them down easily.
Even with armor piercing rounds, the machines easily soaks up thousands of bullets, before even one is taken down. (No joke).

My friend played as a Melee character.
I played as a Scout / Hacker.

As a Scout I wanted to Stealth and Mark the enemies, cause marking is a Skill. With Hacking I wanted to take over enemies to help in battles.

Stealth dosen´t work. 
With high stealth, stealthy clothes and mussle on the rifle. As soon you shoot, the machines knows where you are.
They don´t even have a harder time spotting you if you are only trying to sneak past them, then a person without stealth.

Hacking dosn´t work.
You might look thru your binoculars and see that you have a 95% chance to hack the machine. 
When you hack them, either nothing happens, or the machine just stops and does nothing.
There is a skill in Hacking where you can throw machine bombs, at the enemies.
First problem here is, you need to get the bombs from the machines that drops them.
Second problem is that, as soon that they see you or have taken damage from you, they more or less drop the machines so the bombs attack You.
So you can never get the bombs, that the skill tree allows you to use.

Second problem.
The experience system.

I mentioned that I wanted to be a Scout to Mark, and my friend wanted to go Melee. 
We started to notice a level difference between us, even thou we had played together at the same time.
We started to look at the experience gain after fights and we noticed that I gained no xp.
Passive skills like Mark, does nothing to give xp.

One have to damage the enemies to even gain xp, and even the xp distribution always goes to the person doing most damage.
Wich meant my friend always got the most experience, cause as said, melee and ranged is the only way to go.

Third problem.
The acting.

The actors could get more into their roles. 
Mind you, not everyone is bad.
But many of them sound more like they are reading from a script then acctual acting.

There is more reasons. But I will leave it with this.

I do reccomend this game. 
The feeling of a post-apocalyptic a Sweden in the 1970´s. 
Machines have arisen and wants to kill you and you need to survive, find allies or die. 

I do not reccomend this game.
Not with the current RPG system it has. 
If I want to play as a Sneaky person that hides in the forest and let the machines kill themselfs for me, while I survive.
Then I want to play that way, not be penalised for it. 
Not only by not getting xp, but also for the skill system not working.",1670065487,1670065487,False,8,3,0.55444866418838501,0,True,False,False

Game is broken-difficult, with bad enemy mechanics, broken spawns, and underpowered equipment/consumables

Long Form:
I started this game having watched the videos on the store, and heard a friend of a friend liked it.
I am a huge fan of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC and Metro 2033 & Last Light (on the hardest difficulties)

Playing through the first area was good, it felt like it was easing into the mechanics and how to kill robots. This was a 1/5 difficulty. (this is based on the faction/level of enemies, 1-5)
The second area is what I'd consider end-game, difficulty 10/10. There was no transition, it just got impossibly harder. Enemies 5/5 difficulty of all types spawned every km or so in every direction in packs of 5-20.

Broken Game Mechanics:
Looking up the wiki, enemies level 2-3 were skipped for some reason, and they spawn on each other to form packs from a single enemy.
On top of the difficulty increase, all the enemies have spot at 2 km (if you stand still they will see you) and aimbot accuracy, including arcing over terrain (no line-of-sight) and through 1-2 layers of walls. They also out-run you and know exactly where you are once they have seen you.
Strangely, they can only see you if they are turned toward you, and have bad pathing so it is possible to cheese them.",1670040349,1670040349,False,2,1,0.513618707656860352,0,True,False,False

For years this title fely very B-list, perpetual beta kinda status. Unpolished, interesting but only in small doses. Each little increment was barely enough to bring me back on its own beyond the usual threshold for simple interest shift. 

But now? 

The game feels finished, Polished. Clean. It has tons of personality, flavor. It *drips* with atmosphere. It oozes character and in spite of some odd design choices, everything really gels really well.
It's just a shame that I saw basically everything it had to offer *before* this point.

Most of the features are well done (Not steak) and the combat is enjoyable with even the end game still leaving you with a challenge. The games story line is incredible and I am personally really into it, but you really do need to go out your way to get that sweet lore.
Tho the game in its current state does have some problems, the Soviets bodies do sometimes rubber band at times, some enemies just randomly start flying into the air (tho it is incredibly funny) and some problems with the bikes as in rare moments the bike in multiplayer other may see a ghost riding the bike (Just get off and on to fix) and sometimes the bike can flip right over leaving your legs up and stuck in the ground tho my friend exploded me out the ground, but all of these are new and probably getting fixed as I write, with the game usually being very stable in terms of bugs as over the 100 hours I have been playing I have encountered very few bugs and if there has been any they were very easy to fix and usually never any game breaking bugs have shown up.
I really don't have anything bad to say about the game, with its amazing looks and environments, combat, story and more with even the mid game being fun I really recommend getting this game, if your a big fan of The Forest and its own story line you will probably get into Generation Zeros lore and all.

I get that Indie Devs *'need'* money to keep going but adding content that should be base-game into paid DLC but other than that the world and immersion of the game is great, I'm not a fan of how the Binoculars look or how the gun aiming is, I didn't like it in the Hunter game either.

I really like where the developers are going with the basics of this game and if they continue to strive and improve, this could be a fantastic game. My suggestion is to watch play throughs or wait for a free weekend to see how you feel. I was a bit skeptical because of reviews being middle of the road but I have no regrets at all. Great game for those who like suspense, strategy, and a break from fighting the undead.

*UPDATE*

I honestly have got to say I love this game! If you are more accustomed to fast past a FPS then, yes, this game may seem a bit more laid back but its far from boring. I have put an easy twenty more hours in since my last review and reading over some others I felt compelled to update. What appeals to me is the game seems to learn from your gameplay. While the AI is  spotty at times glitchy through walls and appearing inside buildings, I am always amazed when hunters swarm randomly from nowhere. Is that irritating? Sometimes LOL but it keeps you on the edge and fighting to stay alive. While I have only a bit of time spent multiplaying, I can attest that online multiplayer is more fun especially with friends but you need mics to communicate. Most of my 25+ hours have been solo, it makes it tougher but it is also a good challenge. Absolute best part is ""outsmarting"" the AI when they do swarm. I really like the exploration side of the game and I hope the devs add more ""secrets"" here and there. Obtaining new items and weapons drive you to keep fighting and while the story may or may not be your thing, its very interesting to watch it all unfold. Give the game a chance and again if you are on the fence, wait until another free weekend. All that said I want to thank the devs for an excellent game! My request is please keep updating monthly and a variety of new robotic bosses would be fantastic! Keep up the outstanding work. 

*UPDATE*
Still an absolute great game. I really want to give another grand shout out to the devs for continuing to work on improving and updating this game. Thank you!",1572907188,1669568077,True,1,0,0.515113353729248047,0,True,False,False

Not sure about solo since I have not played it solo but I doubt it would be as fun.

Are there some odd bugs and issues? Yes. But with some there is a work around. Several times we have gotten stuck against structures or in and around things like tents or jets. You can usually teleport out. At times it can get super irritating especially if you didnt get to a closer teleport point and you have to travel across the map again. Robots spawn back in after a certain amount of time and if you have to teleport out and your group is still at said location, its a pain if you run across war machines on your own back across. I had one time where teleport was not available. I was in a building but my friends were outside close by fighting some machines. Guessing I was close enough for the region to be considered under combat but nothing was attacking me. I crouched down and went under a jet. I didnt stand up but for some reason I got stuck. Laying down from crouching did not work, which feels really ridiculous. Would be nice to have a ""get unstuck"" option like other games, though I could see that being dangerous if lets say you get stuck inside a structure yet you are surrounded by enemies, and the unstuck places you right outside. I was finally able to teleport out but it was about maybe 3-5 minutes.

At the most I have seen tiles in the floor of a vault in a hill side/mountain side slightly lifted like a graphical glitch, but have not seen anything else that seemed super extreme or that caused an issue yet. Riding a bike can sometimes get a little irritating when you get caught against things. Also same with players. If you get to close to each other you can push or get stuck sometimes. Pathways that look like two people might be able to squeeze past one another, at times wont work. Again more of an annoyance than game breaking.

(Update 2 days later:) We have noticed some more major issues like the game crashing. A friend bought me some DLC packs since I had chose to guy three friends the game instead of the complete pack so we could all play together. The stuff he bought me was mainly for guns and the bikes. Nothing map changing. Since then the game has crash at least once each game play. One friend who does not have the DLC end up crashing at specific spots. She will come back in and try to cross those exact areas again to meet up with us and the crash happens again and again. Only way to avoid it was for her to go around a completely different region at that time. Now she is getting kicked at the spot she is put at when coming in. So no sure how we will fix that. Would hate to have to wipe it everything clean and start over.)

Overall I was having more fun than irritation, till all the crashing. It did mean a lot but now its getting a bit irritating. Its also a very beautiful game. I run all settings on ultra, pc plays it smooth and its gorgeous.",1669397669,1669560207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really like the concept of it - you can explore a vast and open world, discover tons of things, and fight off robots at the same time.  Open-world survival games have a certain feel to them, a feeling much different than normal first-person shooter games.  Instead of fighting other players, all players are on the same team, which, in my opinion, re-enforces the values of teamwork and cooperation.
Despite the world in Generation Zero being finite, the gameplay is not.  The missions that are available are so abundant to the point that they seem endless.  The concept of region score gives players the opportunity to fight increasingly tougher enemies as they play more and more, all the way up to the Reaper, which is by far my favorite machine.  Because of this, a person will never be out of gameplay opportunities.  And to add on base building?  That's another insanely fun feature that I think every player should know about.

Now to the part that I'm going to hate saying.  While this game has a lot of funny quirks, it has it's annoying ones, too.  First off, the multiplayer system in this game could use a big overhaul - I don't think it's at its peak potential.  When I try to invite someone to my world, or accept an invitation to someone else's, the game will often do the following: time-out on the first attempt, and then crash altogether on the second.  This usually repeats 4-5 times, and can get extremely annoying.
Secondly, the machines aren't even close to realistic, and I'm talking everything about it.  Machine health is not proportionate to machine type, the attacks seem way to overpowered, and sometimes, the attacks don't work as expected.  And oh my god, please fix the tanks shooting their machine gun 360 degrees through their legs, it's impossible to outrun it and it's extremely laughable.  C'mon, that's just breaking the laws of physics.
Lastly.  PLEASE fix the shock ammo types. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!  It always crashes either my game or my friend's game when I'm playing multiplayer.  Either reduce the time the electricity is active, or add a client-side (or even server-side!) option to make the shocks lower-quality!  Once enough shock bullets are shot, they create so much lag and causes tons of problems.  I really enjoy using the shock ammo, but it's near impossible to use in a multiplayer setting!

Considering my good comments and my not-so-good comments altogether, I still rate this game very high.  I just think that I'd enjoy it a bit more if some really weird things were fixed.",1669495584,1669495584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun game with a solid combat loop. Shooting and moving around feels good. Most of the enemies are fun to fight and kill if not a little bullet spongy(they are robots IMO more forgivable your standard human sponges). It is buggy and has a weird movement system with the bikes/vehicles(I recommend moving on foot mostly), but overall this is minor. Biggest issue I have is with the NPC's and by extension player character models. Most of the human models look like something from 2005 with the facial animation from the 90's. Voice acting is subpar to down right amateurish. The game really needs more polish in the character models and voice acting departments. Single player is okay, but it get old fast.

The first two big DLC's added a reasonable amount of content and were more or less worth the purchase, but community suggested updates to the base game are being added as paid DLC, and mixing/matching with friends that don't own all the said DLC is awful. 

The base game feels empty and boring long before you've progressed into mid-to-late game. There's simply nothing to do other than seek out new respawn points as you push further north with no real goals that feel rewarding enough to make it worth pursuing. You'll have all the best guns and possible attachments by that point already, and the tension of the early game is long behind you since you can effectively solo even the biggest machines. Proper base building should have been a base game feature, instead, it's sold to you in two different DLC's. This kind of marketing strategy is not very conductive to playing with friends and earns no goodwill for the developers and the player base is shrinking rapidly. 

The game had a lot of potential, but was ruined by the typical greed you see these days in the gaming industry. Instead of adding long requested features by the community to the base game and making money off of optional cosmetic DLC that players could buy to support the dev, or package bigger updates into fully fledged expansion packs (as basic as the original Alpine Unrest DLC was, it still added a whole new landmass and felt like an ""expansion""). 

Some of the DLC edits the base game's environment, but also when you don't own the DLC. Just without it, you're unable to interact with those areas properly. It's just poorly thought out design choices compounding on each other. 

The early game plays like a survival horror game, only until you realize that dying isn't punishing at all, since you just respawn at any previously unlocked safezone of your choice. Later on, you're basically a walking tank that can destroy a three story massive mech by yourself while camping in said safezones while only expending ammo that is not that difficult to obtain, even on the hardest difficulty. Only worth getting on a sale as a whole bundle, if you have a group of friends willing to experience what would happen if Boston Dynamics was evil, otherwise don't expect to find a lot of people to play with you as the DLC has pretty effectively driven away most of the playerbase and fractured the remaining.",1669309326,1669309326,False,5,0,0.526759624481201172,0,True,False,False

Look through the dlc, you'll see what should be base game features, weapon variety, transportation, and the fucking end game. However the worst part is the game play itself, your character never scales, the game is apparently ""stealth action"" but  the only rewards you get are higher tier guns and the stealth is worse than skyrim, you still have to crouch but light isnt a factor,so you are forced to fight, but your charcter doesn't scale so the game drowns you in medkits cause every attack nearly kills you, but you don't scale so you do no damage, but if you hit the special spots where the sparks fly you can remove armor and gun mounts, but if you hit anywhere but those special spots you do nothing. But you are fighting skyscraper sized artillery platforms,  you don't have the luxury of standing around, oh and after the tutorial every enemy exclusively uses aoe attacks so cover is useless, and so is running you will get hit. 

Ultimately playing is useless, levelling up feels bad cause the skills are bad, so you can't even get hyped for powerful builds cause there are none, the enemies are beyond spongy, and  you are so pitiful that if you don't hit the special spots you do no damage with a max tier rocket launcher to a basic enemy.",1669237560,1669237560,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first half of the game consists of carefully choosing your battles, and looting in hopes of finding a better weapon to replace your awful rifle. You focus on smaller enemies, avoiding those which you know you cannot fight. It's a beautiful game in this part, minus the English voice acting. There's mystery, action, and fun to be had.

Then you get to the second half of the game. It sucks. It's a grind for all the quests and military bases, and the enemies become less and less of threats as your weapons are near top-tier and you have thousands of rounds of ammo to spare. Enemies can sometimes be ridiculously difficult, with the game having little to no difficulty scaling. Oh, and the skill trees are kinda pointless. You'll never grind out all of the perks.

The ending of the game, holy shit, is awful. I walked into the end area without even realizing it was the end. There's no final boss, no big answer to everything. You walk in, get monologued by a robot, leave, and survive an explosion. That's it.

There are a lot of great points to this game along with some bad points.
good points : 
1. The game is great at story telling. There are a lot of side missions to complete. Most of these side missions run along with the main mission. The story keeps you guessing all the way through until the end. Play it single player or co-op with up to other three players.
2. There are plenty of weapons to use. From baseball bats, to shotguns. So depending what you like. So you can be a sniper to a heavy weapon person.
3. You can craft clothing from jackets to tee shirts and find other clothing from skirts, rings, baseball caps to sunglasses. Ammo can also be crafted. (Most of these will require you to have the dlc packs.)
4. A lot of different machines to fight against. From Harvesters to Tanks. Each of these have strengths and weaknesses.
5. It's open world, so you can feel free to explore the world between missions. You can enter almost all the buildings.
6. Outstanding graphics and sound affects.

1. The game crashes a lot and you get stuck on nothing.

Like anybody else purchasing Generation Zero, I went into it with mixed feelings & a huge amount of skepticism, given all the reviews from steam & IGN. And I have to say, from the first moments of the game beginning, I was immediately intrigued. 

There is a real feeling of emptiness in the land, and unless you are playing with a friend or two, you are completely alone, which to be fair didn't bother me in the slightest, I like the feeling of vulnerability in such a hostile environment.

Which brings me to my next part. The machines.
The AI behind these mechanical monstrosities can be both intimidating and annoying in the same breath. They are clever, resilient, and come in all shapes and sizes, from the annoying spider-like tick, to the behemoth of the tank. They will devise strategies against you, and if your playing solo, you can easily become overwhelmed. Generation Zero is not a game to be taken lightly, you NEED to plan ahead, and devise tactics in order to defeat the machines, stock up on resources, and explore the environment and use it to your advantage.

The map in this game is vast to say the least. You start off in the archipelago region which is a make-up of small islands for the intro missions. Once you've completed these, you are free to go wherever & whenever you want, and explore the massive land mass that lies before you for the rest of the game. (That's not to say this can't be done sooner, but completing the intro missions first is advisable.) 

At times the game can feel a little like a walking simulator, and the only other way of transportation other than your legs, is a bicycle, which is tedious, at best. But along the way are safe houses, which you will unlock in various settlements and areas on the map, this makes the traveling time between locations slightly less frustrating. But just remember, this game is all about exploration, so wandering around the map for hours on end can pay off, you never know what you might find.

As well as being an FPS, the game does have basic RPG style elements, such as leveling up your character, the ability to create more than one character, and a standard but yet rather generous skill tree. Since the level cap only permits to level 31, it's recommended to have a couple of characters that specialize in different areas, just to keep the experience interesting and versatile. 



All in all I found Generation Zero a gem of a game, after knowing almost nothing about it before jumping into it. The game is not without its occasional bugs and glitches, but on a game of this scale it is to be expected, and sometimes it is barely noticeable. The concept of the game is both original & challenging 9/10

It had potential but at that stage it was pretty limited, with the first island only unlocked. After a few hours it became a tad boring and i stopped playing. Roll on to now and after redownloading and playing the game again its come on leaps and bounds. 

The robots, well they are nasty so stealth pays off, the sound from range of the larger robots is by far the best sound effect i've heard in a long long time, heavy and menacing. The map is huge but once visited fast travel points are plentiful and you have the ability to drop your own so travelling doesn't become tedious.

The POI's are a tad repetitive, but they are all short and game play is more focused on running around the map, avoiding or engaging the enemy's you see.

The number of guns is a bit limited and the movement/clipping with objects at time can be a bit clunky.

Overall it's a far better game than at initial release and i've enjoyed the time i've spent playing it, the good news is i have plenty of story line and map left to explore so wont be done with the game any time soon.",1668973891,1668973891,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a combination of a shooter + dark souls.   You can die very easily and there is really no way to make armor or defense.  You can make clothing which adds 2% or 4% defense but that is nothing when 1 missile volley will kill you or 1 sniper shot from a normal robot will knock you to 10% life.  There is a high level skill that can reduce damage by 25% though, but you can only have 1 type of these skills active at once.

Stealth is really the only way to play the game.   Rest of the time you are hiding inside buildings trying to shoot the robots through doorways.   Fighting in the open will kill you.   Single player is just not playable once you get to the northern areas.    The problem with Stealth in this game is the huge open land too.   It took me 45 mins to crawl through a warzone where there was two opposing robot armies fighting each other; fun? No.

This is a multiplayer coop game only really.   Not recommended for single player unless you enjoy constant frustration.

Edit: After searching online I found that there is possible way to play solo and really the only viable way because you use so much ammo, you often would need to go places just to loot stuff for ammo.  Hours and hours of looting and not fighting.    The way is ""Experimental Weapons"".  Basically double the damage of the best weapons.  They can only be dropped at player level 25 and up.   They can only drop from Rivals (bosses) on the map that are rank 4 or greater (not sure if goes greater or not, I kill them at 4).  While this does make for a tough solo game still, I changed the review to ""recommend"" although only borderline really.  Its a struggle.

Story: Eh, it feels all cobbled together and attempted to squish it into a square hole and then capped it off.   Its a mess and does not make sense really.   The final ""room"" you go in is very anticlimatic and much of the ""Story"" you can get is bits and pieces from side quests in the form of notes.   Looks much funner on Multiplayer though, I am just playing through it to ""finish it"" since started it even though still playing solo.  The robots get harder and harder and the only ""progression"" you can realistically do solo is increase damage.  So if playing solo, I highly recommend the combat skill line.  I made mistake and took some of the more interesting looking ones and later regretting it and then reset my char.

Also there is a base-building aspect of the game, but its pointless... Unless you want to build a base just to have it destroyed by waves of robots over and over again.  The base gives you nothing except for some rare bullets that are so expensive you have to do more base defense missions just to get more resources for them.  Pointless.  Waste of time, your better off ignoring it completely.

The only vehicle in this game is a bicycle and its difficult to control and does not go up hills either.... or even just moderate slopes.    Huge map and you waste lots of time trying to get to places.   There is now a scooter thing you can get that can drop off bosses or you can pay for DLC that gives motorcycles.  Yes, thats right just motorcycles for extra money.  Money grab.

With the latest addition to the game (flying drone), not worth playing.   Drone can always see you when not inside building.  The drone can shoot through a building without effort.   It puts out floating bombs which you can shoot down, but that means the homing bombs just hit you sooner.   The entire game is about exploration and going place to place, this thing stops that.   Its tougher than a tank.    During a fight you can a) dodge, b) get up off the ground, c) shoot about 10 shoots.    Choose 1 of those things before it shoots you again, but only 1.   Each shot it does is AoE as well.   After 150 hours of play, this was the final for me, the game is more frustration than anything now.   Yes, I have 6 experimental weapons, but there is no point in playing.

Summary:  This game basically has no story and just a blow-up-robots-game (great fun with multiplayer)
