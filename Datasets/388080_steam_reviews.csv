[u][i]Brilliant little tool[/i][/u]

I use this program on my Laptop for Zwift. 

For some reason my laptop will no longer fullscreen Zwift. Even after reinstalling the game, my Nvidia drivers my Intel drivers and even Windows, Zwift refused to run in fullscreen despite other much more demanding games running fine.

Zwift works perfectly fine on my PC but I ran out of room in my man cave for a permanent Zwift setup hence it going to the laptop.

I did hours of messing about with preference files, inis, nvidia control panel etc etc and nothing worked.

The game ran fine but borders and start bars are annoying.

I stumbled on this by googling for a free version which I had heard of. Finding this on Steam with all the positive reviews and super reasonable price made me try this first.

First boot and Zwift is now running full screen and flawlessly.

Very happy and glad to support some small devs rather than going free

You can even favorite any game, and when this app is opened alongside that game, it will automatically apply it without any other inputs.  After favoriting, you just open the app, give it a second, and close the app.  Done.  Simple.  Beautiful.

You can get the free version online, but I felt it was worth supporting them for the $4.

One tip: I recommend using the build-in ""Disable Steam Integration"" feature in the settings, otherwise Steam will always say you are playing this game and record numerous hours in it.

https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/issues

Some of the biggest issues:

* When you use the option to ""Toggle Windows Taskbar Visibility"", it only lasts temporarily, you have to re-toggle it fairly often.
* Same as above but with the Mouse Lock options, only works temporarily.
* Sometimes the app will soft crash while you're playing a game, where you can see a white box window but nothing else. Sometimes you can't even see the window, in both instances you need to do a full restart of the app.
* When you start the app via Steam, it will register as you ""playing"" Borderless Gaming mode, canceling out any other game you could be playing. The option to ""Disable Steam Integration"" doesn't work, and sometimes isn't even available when you start the app.

I felt compelled to write a review because when I asked the dev about a (free) Windows installer on their Github page, I was told to buy it on Steam, only to have paid for a intermittently functional app. I'll modify my review if the bugs are addressed, but as of right now I can't even enjoy a game for more than 20 minutes before having to reset.",1702921381,1702922835,False,45,4,0.718483567237854004,15,True,False,False

This eliminates the need for time-consuming alt-tabs and reduces the risk of crashing. It has received very positive reviews on Steam.

Here are some key features and benefits of Borderless Gaming:

Forces borderless-Fullscreen mode in any game: This allows you to stream at any resolution while still being able to easily alt-tab out as if you were in windowed mode.

Reduces the risk of crashing in badly optimized games: When you want to switch songs or check your email, there’s no more risk of crashing.

Improves game performance: A lot of games run smoother when running in a window, eliminating the need for V-Sync1.
Simple to use: You can click and forget. No more apps with overly complex methods of adding games or useless features bloating up your system resources.

Open source: Anyone can contribute to making it the best tool out there.
However, some users have expressed their preference for games to natively support a borderless Fullscreen/borderless windowed option. They find it very useful to be able to alt-tab out of the game seamlessly, especially when they are switching focus constantly or taking notes while playing.

Overall, Borderless Gaming seems to be a highly appreciated tool among gamers, especially for those who prefer playing in borderless Fullscreen mode.",1701008220,1701008220,True,1,0,0.481249988079071045,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★

Borderless Gaming by AndrewMD5 is a game-changer for anyone who enjoys gaming across multiple monitors. This utility has become an essential part of my gaming setup, and I can't imagine going back to playing without it.

First and foremost, Borderless Gaming seamlessly transforms your games into borderless windowed mode, regardless of whether they officially support it or not. This feature alone is a game-changer. No more alt-tabbing, no more taskbar distractions - just pure, immersive gameplay that extends across all your screens. It makes transitioning between different applications and multitasking a breeze.

One of the standout features of this utility is its versatility. It works with virtually any game you throw at it, from old classics to the latest AAA titles. I've yet to encounter a game that Borderless Gaming couldn't handle. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to add and manage your games, and it even allows you to save custom resolutions and positions for each game.

Another thing I love about Borderless Gaming is the level of customization it offers. You can fine-tune the position and size of the game window to fit your preferences perfectly. This is particularly useful when dealing with games that have awkward aspect ratios or scaling issues.

Performance-wise, I've noticed little to no impact on my gaming experience when using Borderless Gaming. It's incredibly lightweight and doesn't hog system resources. It also doesn't interfere with your game's performance or frame rates, which is crucial for competitive gaming.

The developer, AndrewMD5, deserves a lot of credit for consistently updating and improving Borderless Gaming. It's evident that they are passionate about their product and responsive to user feedback.",1696642707,1696642707,True,8,0,0.597183108329772949,0,True,False,False

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight

The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no

Boy, was I wrong.

It's been user friendly and extremely useful to me, and I highly recommend this to anyone who has spent many years combing through .ini settings and using launch parameters like -w or -windowed in some crazy time consuming effort to get games displayed the way you want.

▢2 English muffins
▢4 large eggs
▢4 slices Canadian bacon
▢Vinegar , just a splash
For the Hollandaise sauce:
▢4 Tablespoons butter
▢4 egg yolks
▢2 teaspoons lemon juice , or lime juice
▢1 Tablespoon heavy whipping cream
▢salt and pepper (to taste)
Instructions
 
For the Hollandaise sauce:
Melt the butter in a small saucepan. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks. Mix in lemon juice, whipping cream, and salt and pepper.
Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well. Repeat this process adding a spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture.( Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure they don't curdle).
Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for just 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and set aside. It will thicken as it cools. Stir well and add another splash of cream, if needed, to thin.

To poach the eggs:
Fill a medium size pot with about 3 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling.  
Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the water).
Crack one egg into a small cup (I use a measuring cup).  Lower the egg into the simmer water, gently easing it out of the cup.
Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft you want your egg yolk. Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon.
**It is not abnormal for a white foam to form on top of the water when poaching an egg. You can simple skim the foam off of the water with a spoon.
While the egg is cooking, place the slices of Canadian bacon in a large pan and cook on medium-high heat for about 1 minute on each side.
To Assemble:
Toast the English muffin. Top each toasted side with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, and then a poached egg. Top with hollandaise sauce.",1650335659,1650335659,True,9,0,0.506340980529785156,0,True,False,False

If you run a second monitor default fullscreen will minimize the game on your main monitor while windowed frames the game with a Windows border. Fullscreen borderless is what you need to interact with multiple monitors and not minimize your game.  What to do if your game does not have this choice but only offers a windowed or fullscreen option? Borderless Gaming is the solution!

I've noticed a handful reviews belittling the developer and claiming the software is shady, and while I can't vouch for the developer himself, I can say with 100% certainty that Borderless Gaming is the farthest from shady. There are also a handful of reviews saying that there is a free version of the software on Github, and while that is true, the software on GitHub does not work nearly as well as the one here on Steam, and purchasing it on Steam is an amazing way to give the developer the support he deserves.

Additionally, the ""advertisement"" that has been brought up in several reviews is non-intrusive, as there are very few occasions in which you will actually need to have the window visible. The advertisement is also rather small and easy to ignore.

Yes, I followed the guides on the community pages. No it did not work.

If you are lazy for games that you can make borderless yourself, go for it.

Also made me want to die because i played dark souls 2 through it 

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labour"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realise that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realisation, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.

Thank you

There are also some tools that you can use which lock the cursor to the active window, useful for some games where the cursor can still escape and click outside, minimizing the game. I wish that could be automatic, but at least it has a global hotkey.

This is not a game, its a tool. Many games have poor ports to PC. And even good ports may have poor compatibility with your PC.

Some games have whats called ""windowed borderless"" It essentially lets you play visibly in full screen while not technically being full screen.

The single biggest issue with this tool is the [b]constant[/b] background CPU utilization; it's simply [b]excessive[/b]. On my machine, while the Borderless Gaming tool is ostensibly ""idling"" in the background, its process actually cycles between using roughly 100% of one CPU core for ~3 seconds, then goes idle for ~3 seconds, and then repeats, without end. So, whatever methodology is being used to do the window detection stuff, it's clearly too heavyweight to realistically justify itself.

And then to add to the above, the developer of this tool has effectively abandoned it since mid-2017. So improvements are highly unlikely to ever happen. Oh and did I mention that this $4 offering on Steam can be obtained for free, as it's an open source project hosted on GitHub? Yeah...

I would highly recommend that potential users of this tool (a) download it directly from the project's website instead of paying for it on Steam, particularly given that it contains no actual Steam integration, and in fact works best in isolation from Steam; and (b) consider an alternative tool for the job instead of this one.

This utility worked wonders.
It can give your game a fullscreen borderless window which looks exactly like standard fullscreen but without any multi-tasking headaches.

First setup your in-game settings to play in a standard window of your monitors native resolution.
If you have ever used a utility like Creative Alchemy then this utility can be setup up in the same automatic launch functionality.
A triangle button to move your running game to the righthand side auto-execute list and you won't have to think about it again.

I originally posted a negative review based on a horrible popup delivery system for ads for  another project the developer was working on.  That system has been removed and the developer later apologized (Thread pinned in community hub).  The comments up to Feb 4, 2019 are in response to the negative review and will be left as-is as any negative threads at the time were quickly deleted.  There is now a small ad asking the user to ""Check Out Rainway"" on the menu bar which is only seen when adding/removing a program and never needs to be clicked.

The app is simple, it does one thing and it does it well.  It takes windowed games and makes them full screen borderless.  The interface is very simple.  On the left are running programs, move any you want to be borderless full screen to the right.  From that point on, whenever you run that program, it will pop up full screen.  To stop it from doing so, remove it from the right side.

If the game changes the window name (like Everquest 2 does every time they push a new version), it will need to be re-added to the list, but it only takes about 5 seconds from a tray window.

It is worth noting that the app can be downloaded for free from github.

WAS a great app that did what it was supposed to UNTIL it added unwanted POPUP ADWARE.  Hopefully the dev knocks this crap off and reverts the program back to what it was supposed to do and not open unwanted, unsolicited ads in a paid program.

I retract my statement saying that this software contains ads. They advertise their own software, and its free, so that is fine.
I do have to stand by my other two statements but i'll explain the first one. If, from my experience, when you try to windowed fullscreen a game and it does not cover the screen, then all this software will do for that game is remove the border, and not fullscreen it as well. All other games seem to work fine, to my knowledge.
I still can't recomend this software cause it is too expensive, and doesn't work on all games.

Download Borderless Gaming on Steam.

Start the game in windowed mode, just make sure fullscreen is unselected in the settings.

It will look ugly, that's okay.

Open Borderless Gaming, put Shadowverse in your favorites (right column), the game will say it is 1920 x 1080p but once you reboot the client it will load up in 3840 x 2160p and if you double check the in-game settings it will say ""3840 x 2160p"" congratulations you've now set up Shadowverse in 4K and it looks fantastic!",1533494071,1533494071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This developer (Andrew) pulled the same unethical behavior about 9 months earlier according to Reddit reports.

He knows exactly what he is doing and doing it again...

He is also reporting Steam Users and getting them banned (abusing the system).
He is also deleting posts and calling it thread consolidation in an effort to bury the complaints.
Official ""reply"" is deliberate manipulative spin.  Dev never apologized and attacks anyone who complains or criticises.   

** I do not have any problems or complaints about developers promoting other products in unobtrusive and non-invasive manners.  Changes were made, but the storm of complaints could have been easily avoided and from previous lessons ""not learned"" by the Developer.  

**Suggestion:  Public apology (eat the crow) and CHANGE the ""Check Out Rainway"" menu option to an ""Other Products"" or unobtrusive label in a Help or More menu area.   The rollback and current menu advertisement is not acceptable either.   Dev keeps pushing and breaking that line of unacceptable behavior.  

***Obnoxious ""Check Out"" menu still exists in the BG application one week later and no apologies were ever given.

=================================
Highly disappointed by this software. The additon of ads popping up on launch is unacceptable. I turned my computer on to think I had some rouge software running on my PC, only to find out that the pop was caused by this program.

Without the Adware, this software is great. It supports most games that don't have borderless windowed and does it better than some games that do.

As someone who bought the software but still preferred the standalone installer, I was a bit disheartened by the GitHub drama that unfolded, but that's something I can look past.

Don't put ads in your paid software. Whether meant to open once or every time, this is the hallmark of junk software. You had customers tripping over themselves malware-scanning their systems. My suggestion would be the age-old method of listing your side projects under the About or Help header within the program, someplace where we'd find it if we were actively seeking more information about your company. 

I found borderless gaming by recommendation. I didn't need to see any popup advertisement to know I needed it. You know how many software titles I own because of an intrusive popup? I don't care if you've designed an app that cures aspergers, ANYTHING popping up from a paid program is intrusive solicitation. If your new software is better than Moonlight or the dozens of other chinese pc-to-mobile streaming platforms, I like to believe I'm informed enough as a consumer to discover it through reputable channels. The mistake made here isn't that the ad didn't go away after one time...it's that you PUT A POP UP AD IN YOUR PAID SOFTWARE. Acknowledge that.

This app has saved me many times. I love doing stuff on my other monitor and most games (full screen or not) have issues with alt+tab. It is extremely easy to use and does exactly what I want it to. I use it for almost every game I play and have recommended it countless times with them enjoying it also.

[b]-The Ad-[/b]
Now I believe any paid software should never force ads on the user. This being said the way they went about the advertisement is wrong. Yes, it did feel like adware and freaked me out when I saw it, but they fixed it. If they maybe asked ""would you like to see another product developed by us (YES or NO)"" then displayed the ad I don't think I would have had an issue with it, considering it isn't a third party software. This being said there new program is interesting.

[*] Life Saving/Essential
[*] Low performance cost
[*] Works flawless
[*] Does exactly what it needs to

I would just like to emphasis this is the only issue and it only happened once. Not to mention this was fixed.

If you've fussed with DXWND in the past, you know how annoying it is to get old games to run in a window.  Borderless Gaming solves those problems by offering (borderless) windowed mode for both your old 640x480 full screen adventure games, and for today's games that ""forgot"" to implement borderless windowed mode.

Ultimately, the application is less than the price of your average Starbucks coffee.

It makes my life easier with the windowed Universe Sandbox ² @1366x768 and stretched it to my 1920x1080 monitor. The framerate is better that way (Intel HD 4000).
Diablo II is played with a mouse and my taskbar autohides. This causes accidentally clicking on your pinned progs on your taskbar, when you move the mouse at the very left side of the screen. If I use BG, then I'd like for the taskbar to show only when I press the Win key, not when hovering with the mouse on the very left. And I don't want to constantly change my windows taskbar settings. I don't know if this is feasible via BG improvement.

Other problems I encountered: I originally intended to use it with Quake III, but Quake doesn't allow me to alt+tab (even in its native windowed mode) and, since the thing you want to stretch needs to allow you to alt+tab to BG (because BG cannot be instructed to stretch it beforehand), that's why I cannot make it work with Quake III.

How it affects the game differ though.

For example, you play Divinity Original Sin 2 Window mode, 800 x 600.
When you use the application it will go borderless window with the maximum resolution available.

While if you play game like Total War Attila

If you're playing on Window mode 800 x 600 then use this application
It will go borderless window but the resolution still remains 800 x 600.


Different game, different effect on how the resolution will change but one this is for sure that this app will make your game go borderless window.

Don't get me wrong I want to give them Matt back but I am not strong enough to give them Matt. I really don't know the first part of kicking an addiction and I really need help.

PLEASE do NOT rate this funny it is a serious problem that I have been having and I am looking to get help, I will update it after I get the help that I need and am cured of my addiction.

Things have really made a turn for the worse, and it doesn't help that so many people find my ailment 'funny'. I don't know what the next step is.

Since creating my review I have come in contact with the developer of Borderless Gaming and he has agreed to be my sponsor in helping me to stop my addiction dead in it's tracks. Wish me the best of luck in these upcoming months.

EDIT 4

Awhile has passed but I have yet to solve my addiction to borderlessgaming. Although I have begun to understand why I am addicted. Its just the idea that I can play a game that aligns with my beliefs. If the games are borderless than how can the earth be round?

Where do I begin to complain. . . well lets start with the fact that the product doesnt actually work right. Not with dual monitors anyways. Sure you will get a boarderless window, but it will stretch to cover ALL of your monitors, not just one. It's total bullshit and COMPLETELY unusable in that state.

Now lets talk about either the scummy or idiotic business practices. First, claiming it's free. Man you might as well be offering us the ONE PEICE ""You want my program for free? You can have it! I left my prgram open source, now you just have to find it and figure out how to use visual studio."" FOR GODS SAKE!!! Don't be a fricken idiot! If you are gonna make a product free it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to actually create it, build it and open it. I was up all night trying to figure out that shit and the only reason I knew about the visual studio thing is because you VERY VERY VERY poorly hid it inside the readme file. FIRST: No one reads those!!!! Second: Learn to press the enter key, you had everything on one line so I had to manually go in and create new lines to figure out what the fuck was going on. Just give us the .exe! We shouldn't need a seporate program just to use your program. Even with all that besides, you keep boasting how ""oh the side bar"" when that too is also fricken retarded! You labled it as a manual not a download link. Like, WTF EVEN IS THIS! No comunication day? If it's not easy enough for a 12 year old to do then you are a very poor at planning out your design. I am 21 and I still struggled with it. I eventually said fuck it and just payed for the damn thing out of frustration. I would NEVER support such short sighted developers if I had a choice and would rather have never gave you a cent for making the free version so convoluted.

It's pretty straightforward: run the desired game/program/application in the windowed mode, click on the appropriate button, and voilà. It can store your favourite applications so that you don't have to do that manually every time you start the game. It is also possible to enable and disable Steam integration which comes in handy if you want to use it offline.

So far, it has been working mighty fine for me, especially in Bethesda games which are notorious for being a pain in the neck when it comes to alt-tabbing and not having the borderless window option in the first place (Fallout 3, Skyrim). No performance issues whatsoever. It also gets updated frequently: I remember that Killing Floor was not supported by Borderless Gaming but now it is.

I recommend buying it on sale, especially since it tends to go for a buck or two.

I am aware that the software is mentioned as being free on on github, this does not change that the software should also be free on Steam with the option to donate if desired, rather than charging you either way as it is currently, lmao.

Furthermore, my original point on the software messing up graphical settings in the Dayz Mod, despite the devs saying otherwise, still stands, maybe comment on that?

They are doing nothing more than bashing the developer of the Product, rather than reviewing the actual product.

It doesn't matter who did what or who is at fault, in the review section of this store page are only reviews ""about"" the Product to be made not some outcry about something else!

Some games have problems running at fullscreen (at least for me), but lack borderless window mode (Dark Souls 3 and Resident Evil 7 to name a couple), making this (or any other) external solution a must to play comfortably. It's a really simple program with no extra features at all, and that's exactly what I love about it - simple and easy to use, it just gets the job done. As automated as it gets - you add the certain app to the list and it runs fullscreen borderless (as long as this tool is running in the background).

One very useful trick not everyone knows about: V-sync is not needed if the game is in windowed mode. Let's take Batman Arkham Knight for example. It runs on stable 60 FPS on my hardware, but cuts to 30 FPS should you enable the V-sync. Without the image is heavily torn every few frames so that it's untolerable. Disabling the game and running it in windowed mode solved it 100%, running smoohly at 60 FPS. And that's where this little tool shines: it lets you run windowed games fullscreen with no drawbacks, literally eliminating the need for V-sync and thus saving a lot on performance.

It surprises me, just how much difference such simple app can make. Definitely a must-have for me for a while now.",1486407251,1486407251,True,2,0,0.525650560855865479,0,True,False,False

As someone that loves to Alt-Tab to different programs all the time, whether that be to change some sound settings for recording, or even to open up Firefox to look something up, this program is a life saver. Having games run in Fullscreen is nice and all, but in some rare cases, Alt-Tab can completely crashes the game. Windowed mode is nice, but I hate having tiny little windows to play games (looking at you crappy RPG Maker games, Vita port games) or having it not fit nicely to my screen resolution, and this makes them fit my screen and not have that ugly boarder.

I have this program running at all times at this point. Steam no longer tracks it (possibly because it boots up before Steam does on my PC) but like I said, I've ran around 40 games with this program and haven't had any problems so far. The only game that had an issue was GTA V the first time I tried to run it, but it works fine now.

The BEST example I can give for this being great to use, is the PCV port of the Vita game Conception 2. The game ran in a tiny window and does not have a full screen option. Thanks to this, it made it full screen and ran perfectly!

Now, I don't do dual moniters or anything like that, I use one screen. So I alt-tab a lot. I alt tab so much, my first turn off for a game is if it has borderless window mode. Most games don't.

Another handy little feature I noticed, is that it doesn't have to be a game. I realised that I can actually get my skype to be borderless. Now THAT is handy. As far as I've seen, it doesn't do the same with google chrome, but I've not meddled much yet.

This is a really nifty tool, and if you can afford it, you definitely should get it. If I had to give one bit of criticism? I dunno. Really, I have no clue. I guess less of a criticism and more of a suggestion, but... I'd suggest adding a personalisation option?

 For people who... I dunno, care about that stuff? Personalise the color of things, and so on. But this gadget is perfect as far as I can tell, if you are looking at this page, trying to figure out if you need it... Get it. This is affordable and useful.

Borderless Gaming is almost as simple as the title of the software itself. The application allows you to make other applications, mostly games, borderless windowed. Borderless fullscreen is a window that is fullscreen, without borders. This fullscreen feature is very beneficial to people who like to use other applications while playing a video game in fullscreen. The fullscreen feature is also very beneficial to people who use multiple monitor setups. There is a built-in guide to guide new users along. Although you can download this application for free, buying it on Steam adds to your library and acts as a donation to the developer, who deserves the money he earns.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
+Simple interface
+Cheap price
+Support for multi-monitor displays
+Built-in guide
+No bugs (so far)

[h1] Cons [/h1]
-Somewhat confusing during first use
-Can be downloaded for free
-Some intricacies need a guide to understand

along with this my laptop also has a weird blue tint when playing games in fullscreen, Borderless gaming again comes to the rescue allowing me to play fullscreen borderless without the tint.

it also makes tabbing out simple, quick, and easy without the hassle of games not liking to tab out, or possibly crashing, or taking forever to tab back out or back in.

My only dislike, is that the app does not stop showing that it is in use. This means your friends cannot join you or your game through steam. This is a huge issue which needs fixing.
The steam application Dimm Drive, suffered from a similar issue but was quickly resolved by the developer. Having this application affect steam functionality is a large issue that needs to be adressed.

At the moment I feel positive about this program, but the app taking presidence over games is a large issue for me because my friends cant join my game/server et al, because steam thinks I'm playing Borderless Gaming. This will result in me becomming annoyed with the application over time.

Apart from this oversight, it is a usefull app. It ONLY JUST gets a recommendation from me due to the above issues. I belive the positive outweigh the negative points, but this may be a deal breaker for you.

Written on: 23 June 2015 (day of release)
Last updated: 27 June 2015

TL;DR:
Works good, no major problems.


TESTED WITH:
Fallout 3 - GOTY:
http://store.steampowered.com/app/22370/

AdVenture Capitalist:
http://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/

Tabletop Simulator:
http://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/

GOOD:
+Does what it says on the tin
NOTE:
Fallout 3 usually crashes on ALT+TAB (when you try to bring it back). Adventure Capitalist is supported by the game itself to go fullscreen using options in its launcher. Tabletop Simulator has this option in its in-game menu screen.
RESULT: 
Adventure Capitalist and Tabletop Simulator worked flawlessly, as you would expect.
Fallout 3 appeared to ""freeze"" when it was alt-tabbed, but worked perfectly when the focus was brought back to it. I encountered some wonkyness when both Fallout 3 and Borderless Gaming wanted focus of the mouse, and it had some issues ""borderlessing it"" and undoing it. This is likely caused due to Fallout 3 itself.
Putting on the steam-overlay and alt-tabbing showed no problems in any of the games. I particualiry recommend putting on the steam overlay before ""borderlessing"" a game to ensure no problems.

+Doesn't mess with steam stats
You will still accumulate time and such if playing other games while using this. You will still get its achievements and such. This program only modifies the size and location of the window of the game you're using it with, nothing else.

+Multi-Monitor Friendly
I have two monitors next to each-other.
Programs like this often ""stretch"" the window so that you can't see the title bar and the window-edges can be seen on adjacent monitors (Title bar visible on screen above main screen, edge of window visible on screens to the left right and bottom, etc).

+Cheap (and free)
Self-explanatory. Please note that this app can also be downloaded for free via git-hub. But as I'm lazy and don't exactly value 5 bucks. I bought it here. Thanks developer(s).


BAD:
-""In-App Borderless Gaming""
As long as this program is first. You will appear as always being ""In-App Borderless Gaming"" and not in say ""In-Game Fallout 3 - GOTY"". This is a minor visual problem that I felt it should be mentioned.
If you launch the other game first, THEN start ""Borderless Gaming"", you will be shown as being in the game. Steam only shows the thing you launched first. (If you then close Fallout, it will show ""Borderless gaming"" until you close that one as well)
EDIT: This can be fixed by checking ""disable steam hook"", (a setting found under ""tools""). and launching the program outside of steam (by say pinning it to the taskbar) then this will not be an  issue.


CONCLUSION:
Buy it.
As long as you have a single game where you would like to have this functionality, you should get this. If a game only has ""windowed"" and ""fullscreen"" modes, then this does what it says. It will allow you to play any game that has ""windowed"" as an option to be played ""borderless"".

Hey there! It's time for another review! I don't do reviews very often as i don't even think most people read the reviews prior to buying; Thus leading to a negative review which could have gone without being posted. Now onto this review itself. What we have here is a very tiny beautiful little piece of software known as ""Borderless Gaming"". It is made by a tiny little man on the moon and this is why i have to recommend it to everyone! Even my cousin whom i hate and the father i never had! (Hi Dad!)

If you are like me, and run a multi monitor setup (Currently running 3x 27"") you know the pain it is to run a full screen game when on your other two monitors there is something going on, that you more than likely will need to alt-tab to use. This is where this tiny magic happens! You just run the executable from the Steam folder, or run it from Steam itself. However, if you are like me, you probably hate the ""Is now playing"" when you don't necessarily need to show people that, ""Yo! I'm running a borderless gaming software for 500 hours, it was the best thing ever!"" No. No you don't. This is where the fancy little option ""disable Steam Integration"" in the ""Tools"" drop-down menu and as i said before, run it from the Executable and not Steam itself, or you will have the aforementioned status update.

How does this software work? You literally launch it, and then launch the program you want to run and move that selected ""Process"" to the 'Favourites' section (Click the arrow ===>). It really is that simple. But now you are probably wondering, ""what about bugs? does it break my computer? can i run 4K on my laptop? No. No. and No. There is a similar product on the market that is free as well (Oh, didn't i mention? You can pay for this 'Borderless Gaming', or get it free, but i think the developer deserves the $3 for it and you can go without a coffee for a day) but i will not mention it. It's an easy Google, so do it if you are so inclined.

I have witnessed very little bugs [read: none] and i have only found one game which it doesn't work for and i can't remember the name so its obviously not a very good game now is it? Would i recommend you buying this? Yes. What about not paying for it and getting the freeware version? How about you pay for it!! Support the developer so maybe he can work on adding more features to it, and possibly have a Donationware (Steam purchase) and Freeware. This is a AAA software for a Indie price. It about as amazing as Half-Life was. Hell, go play Half-life in Borderless!

Stay #BASED

**I would post a few screenshots but i don't know how to make Steam take screenshots of a program. Otherwise i would just post this as an image cause im a fail. I also was forced to run this game in the background for a little bit so i was able to review. I use the non-Steam version and bought this to support the Developer.**

In some cases, the games you run on your desktop (or laptop) won't work properly due to limitations in graphic cards and screen resolution. Game performance gets really effected by quality and, of course, toning down your settings help.

Now, in ""some"" some cases, adjusting your settings for better performance will not just do for itself: the difference between selecting full-screen and windowed in-game starts to play a role in it. The resolution, or the size of your screen, deeply affects how the game will run.

The Borderless Gaming app helps you play games set to windowed settings to full-screen without setting it in-game, and it's very convenient rather to go play hide-and-seek with other programs in the web. To set an example that a game would run really well borderless: Fallout New Vegas.

Some of us game on two, and we come to know borderless fullscreen very well. If you're thinking about going dual-monitor, let me fill you in on why this program is so useful.

You're probably already familiar with the ""borderless windowed"" option alongside the ""windowed"" and ""fullscreen"" options in some games' video menus. For a single monitor, borderless window mode is just that fullscreen mode that makes the game not minimize all the way when you alt+tab out of it to do something else, but it's a heck of a lot more if you're working with two monitors.

You know how when you're using regular full-screen mode and you alt+tab out of the game, the screen flashes a little bit when you tab out and back in? If you have a video running on a second monitor, that flash kills it. Sometimes you can fiddle around and get it to work, sometimes you get lucky and it works the first time, but sometimes there's no help. If you game with 2 monitors, this will eventually frustrate you -- and none of it happens if you get the game to run in bordless mode. It's like a magic switch that fixes all that crap, but unfortunately most games still don't have the option.

A year or so ago, I came across this program on the steam forums while dealing with a particularly finnicky old game. I got a copy for free back then and it's been a lifesaver. It's easy to use and I have yet to find a game that it doesn't work on. When I saw they had updated (significantly from the looks of it) and moved to steam, I had no problem throwing a few bucks at the screen for the amount of pain in the ass this program has saved me. It may not make that much of a difference if you game on one monitor, but if you game on two, this is well worth the money.

I should note that sometimes in my experience, it will cut off the bottom and top of the game screen by a few pixels - not enough to matter, but enough to notice. I should also note that it seems to have settings available to fix this, but so far I haven't been inconvenienced enough to try fiddling with them.",1437701329,1437715123,True,713,17,0.915918588638305664,13,True,False,False
