If its not the fact the car wash is the worst thing to do after 1 go because the dirt sticks on (and not in a good way.) It just doesnt get any better and you will want to just close it down.
Or its the gas station as a whole cant be upgraded unless you complete a set of missions that are very easy, except the get tips part - Meaning you have to serve customers that you have hired employees to serve.
Both just to clearly pad the running time to a crappy 15 hours 

Theres a ton of stuff todo but they get boring fast and there simply is no balancing.
It could of charged to paint walls and fuck of dennis. More tarmacking. More/separate cleaning areas like the picnic areas for staff. But you hit level 5 and thats it. Here more staff and its done. Theres nothing left to do. except wash cars.... You wana do more buy dlc and maybe get 5 more hours
For a game brings out paid DLC still, it feels very unfinished

Ok i have played some more and their is a automatic car wash. Still didnt stop me closing it until i bought it.
The balance of this game is still off. 
The game would be a amazing if they put the actives were done well, but they are definitely have arsed everything-
Like if the mechanic side was more detailed. its just unaligned, slow with maybe 6 different things to do, thats very repetitive with maybe the battery slightly moved. 
If the counter wasnt slow and buggy and not having to clean it every 10 items.
Restocking is just place now, with no detail of currant stock or being able to stock in order
The airbrush (right get this) gives you 300 layers. With 1 fucking decal!!!! or type something. Lame
The can touch this DLC is the only way to change walls or floors.
You cant seem to remove all the random piles of dirt. you just tarmac random strips. talking about that, theres just a ton of floating rocks, just obviously everywhere. 

Its just very half baked. I really dont think this will get better. I bet they will just release a second version with copy and paste with new paint and more DLC",1707218665,1707398843,False,1,0,0.486631006002426147,0,True,False,False

But, yes there was a but at least,the game crashed extremely often after reaching some level in the game, and it seems like they fixed it! 
It is a good game if you like the genre you should absolutely try it out. + New content/updates seems coming pretty regularly so it might be a long haul this one.",1633188003,1707387689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cleaning dirt piles is annoying as the devs are stupid, they rapidly appear and some of the time you can't even see them.
The machine to clean sand goes through gas faster than you eating a pound of beans. It also burns up way to fast!
Painting is a disaster.
Paying your employees a premium to work longer doesn't work most times as intended.
Many other issues but outside that if fixed, this game would be incredible in my opinion. But what's the idiot devs response? Let's make a DLC! A Useless one at that for people who don't give a flying f'ck about what things look like. If things are fixed I may change my review, but the devs will still be idiots who don't seem to care about their player base.

There's definitely quite a bit of fun to be had, but as another review said: it does get stale after a couple of hours.

The game feels really unfinished. Like you're playing an early access game. There are literal tutorials with sample text in there. Drivers getting stuck all the time, cars upside down, wheels still spinning when car is standing still, very little variation in car and character models. I spent most of the game thinking they will fix this, but then I noticed they already have 2 paid DLC's and are working on 3 more (i assume paid) DLC's so I don't think they will fix the wonkyness of it all.

Then there is the degradation in paint that you have spent a long time applying to the wall. Why? There is no need to paint the walls other than to make it look nice for the player. If you want to paint all of your buildings you will be non-stop painting because by the time you are finished you can start over again due to the buildings getting sandblasted by the wind. 

The upgrading feels good and there is quite a bit to do, but things do get tedious kinda quick. I can't help but feel not very immersed if cars constantly roll into the shop with 3 flat tires.",1707327172,1707327172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay, I'll still be harsh, but it's for a good reason.

There are awesome and there are horrible elements to this game. Let's start with the bad.

You thought Klendathu from Starship Troopers had bugs? Boy have you not seen this coding. Truly amazing. Random crashes, getting stuck on thin air, crashes around specific things, graphical oddities, you name it, it has it. Y'know the themesong of Pokemon? Gotta catch them all!

DLC before fixes. Granted, fixing all the bugs is a comical herculean task, not only because they are numerous, but also because apparently fixing a bug spawns at least two others, and fixing that spawns three others, and it's just this running battle against an ever increasing list of issues. But it just leaves a poor taste to offer DLC when your game has more bugs than your average CDProjekt RED or Bethesda title.

Now, onto the good!

The core gameplay is bloody amazing. SOMEHOW they managed to make running a gas station into an interesting task. There are a lot of minigames that you'll be running, and if you don't like them, you can either hire help to do it for you, or, if you just don't want that part of the gas station period, you can simply close that part and be done with it. Okay, that last part is not entirely true, for upgrading the station you have to do challenges, which includes using every part of the gas station, but you can still order NPCs to do most of your work.

The gas station is divided into sections, each of which can be individually shut down. There are the fuel pumps (and yes, you can close off individual pumps if you just want to slow, but not completely stop fueling while you wait for a resupply), the parking lots (also can be just partially shut down if you wish), the carwash, and the machine shop (with eventually two repair pits, and yes, can also be partially or completely closed). The entire gas station can also be closed. There is also the warehouse, but I'll talk about that in a bit.

The fuel pumps are pretty straightforward. You have to try to match the exact fuel amount the customer requests. More pumps mean more cars getting fuel. You can at any time order a refuel of your fuel reserves. You also get a notification when your fuel is below 50 liters. Typical customers order between 10-20 liters, but below 10 and above 20 do in fact happen occasionally. If you run out of fuel, you cannot refuel cars, obviously.

The parking lots define how many customers your internal shop gets. The shop can have a variety of items, just keep in mind, if you stock food, you want to stock every kind of it, because customers get pissy if they expect a certain item, and can't find it. They only look for items that have their shelves in the shop. You have more shelves than you have space for anyway, so it's not a problem, also if you don't want to sell a particular kind of item (like I don't want to sell tobacco), that's also entirely OK. If you put out any shelves at all that is, because yes, you can in fact not put out any shelves, and only offer the bathrooms. When you run out of ONE product, I suggest shutting down either the entire gas station for resupply.

The carwash is unique in that it can only ever hold one car, so it cannot be partially shut down. It is getting water from the sewers, but it is purified by the pump. The purification process is what limits this station, because occasionally you have to descend into the sewers to clean out the trash accumulating in the pool of water.

The machine shop is where you repair cars. A number of issues can be the problem, tires, scratches, broken mirrors, engine oil, coolant fluid, batteries in need of replacement. The tricky part of this is that you cannot buy more ""shelf place"" as in you cannot expand the storage of components, and the components in and of themselves are extraordinarily pricy, but also extremely profitable. Well, you can actually expand the storage eventually, as you buy upgrades for the shop, but you cannot buy shelves as you can for the inner shop.

The warehouse is unique in the way that you cannot close it down, nor would you want to, the customers don't go there anyway, the only times stuff happens there is when you order products for the inner or machine shop. Then a lorry arrives eventually, and you need to unload it into the warehouse, then you can load the stuff into your shelves. If you have Dennis enabled, make sure to close the gates, and only have them open in your presence, because that little prick will steal. Not a lot, but still.

There are also events happening, like a sandstorm, which you need to clean up afterwards, because the sand prevents the customers from using the roads in the gas station, or a party bus, which leaves a lot of trash. Because yes, you need to keep the gas station clean, from footprints and trash.



Overall, the game itself is solid, the artistic value is there, BUT, the technical execution is just comically bad to the point where the game is barely functional. WIthout bugs, it would be a sold 10/10, with the bugs, it's like 5/10, with the dev practices it's a 2/10.",1653084302,1705716554,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, after many updates and bug fixes I can now give this a thumbs up as it is a VERY enjoyable game to play. Trust me when I say it is a BUSY game. So much to do.
You start off with buying a total wreck of a gas station that looks like it's seen one to many disasters and should have been pulled down.
But this is you and you are resilient. It is your mission to turn this wreck of a station into a profitable business.
You have a shop to sell goods like soft drinks, beer, snacks, toys and other bits. A garage fixes customer veichles. A warehouse houses all your stock. Customer toilets keep the punters happy but there are challenges...
One brat of a child will paint grafitti on the walls, sanstorms will make a wonderful mess of your hard work and the party bus (tourist bus).. well lets just say that's something you have to see to beleive.
As I said I gave this a VERY bad review in the beginning but now it undergone a lot of improvements.
I don't think you will be dissapointed if you play this. It really is good and has an excellent tutorial / mission progress so you always know what your doing.

Gas Station Simulator is worth the price, but even a small sale is something to consider it for! I got 43 hours out of the game and while perhaps a good 10-15 hours were dedicated to getting all the achievements I still think you'll get your moneys worth.
I can't say this game is for people who can't handle repeat actions. Once you hit, say, level 6 of your gas station you've really got a constant goal - restock, buy low sell high, keep it clean, steal from cars, etc. After a while it gets tedious and if, like me, you're achievement hunting? Waiting to get to level 10 can really make this consistency a slog. Invest in party nights as fast as possible. 
Still, plenty of fun, oodles of gags and references, and the community and developer are active so it's always updating and providing more content. Invest if you get the chance!",1705183764,1705183764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, when I picked it up now, it's quiet literally unplayable, Starting the game works fine, so does starting a new game, intro plays like normal and all that.  However, as I wake up the next day, I wake up staring at the sky as my house is all of a sudden missing one side of the roof, I can even jump own to the ground where there is supposed to be a roof blocking me, not only am I missing a roof, but the whole goddamn station has no walls, this fixes itself once I press ESC and return to the game.

None of that makes the game unplayable, however, the things that DO make the game unplayable, is when I pull the electricity lever in the tutorial, literally nothing happens, NOTHING, not even a cutscene plays.

And to make things even worse there was only one out of 5 times I restarted the game to make a new game that let me past that section and gave me the cutscene along with the new quest to answer the phone, which I did, then went to the PC in the station, and there I am again, nothing there, tried saving and restarting, still same thing, progression in this game is blocked by an endless amount of bugs.

+ Realistic Gas Station Simulator 
+ Gas Station Customization 
+ Fun Little Mini-Games Included

[b] The Negative's [/b]
- Denis The Tormentor 
- Unreasonable Amount Of Gas Consumption For Player Vehicles
- Minor Game Crashes

[b] The Aspect Of The Game [/b]
[i] You are a man who is driving past a worn down gas station and decided to sell your car to buy the station. It is now your job to turn an old dead gas station into a thriving business! [/i]

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] This game is an excellent time waster and pretty fun and realistic simulator. The story is a little strange but the games strengths are more into running the gas station then story telling. This is not a game you can finish in one sitting but it is a game you come back to every so often to upgrade your gas station little by little. The mini-games while running the gas station are okay but nothing special really that you haven't seen from other games.  [spoiler] One annoyance is a kid called Denis that will go onto your property randomly throwing stink bombs around your lot and actively vandalizing your walls with random crap every so often so instead of calling the police and having the kid arrested you instead through various items from small plastics cups to full blown cinder blocks to ""repel"" the kid though sadly no matter how many heavy items I throw at the kid he keeps coming back. [/spoiler]  Later into the game the grind of having to do everything dies down once you hire employee's to do the work for you and from there on the game get's easy. [/i]

Pros: 
The gameplay is pretty relaxing. 
You begin with manually cleaning cars, and eventually get an automatic car wash. You can toggle manual/automatic if you ever just want to clean cars yourself.
I enjoy putting the gas in the cars.
I bought the Ferris wheel and it is great! I mostly just manage the business and ride the Ferris wheel. 
The reset cars and customers button is a God-send. 
There is some online help if you ever get stuck.

Cons:
The game is so dark! Even buying and placing lots of lights doesn't really light anything up too much. Placing lighting in the apartment does not brighten the place up. I found that painting the walls white helps to see things a bit better.
Some of the minigames are very annoying and frustrating. I don't like the RC cars at all and the ice cream stand is annoying. 
There has got to be a better way to determine what glasses you have on the stands and which ones to place. Visually, it's hard to tell them apart on the stand.

Pros: 

-Addicting game loop.  Fast paced but manageable.  Sell gas, sell product, fix car, wash car, order replacement merchandise, wash, rinse and repeat;  until the store gets too dirty or the paint starts looking bad, then ya close the store, tidy up, and start it all over again.  Remarkably simple, but you always feel in a hurry with something to do.  

-The physics in this game can lead to some seriously funny moments.  Traffic jam going on in front of your store, equip your broom and go ham, lol.

I cannot recommend this game. It is really repetitive and has no really exciting content. There are a lot of bugs that never got fixed, and probably never will. The new dlc, actually, all the dlc for that matter, are cash grabbing content packs that don’t bring any new, lasting content to the game. The shady deals pack seemed interesting at first, but I am not going to buy it. The base game is as fun as it gets. Even now, the new Tidal Wave dlc, seems out of the blue. This has nothing to do with the base game. Looking at the images for that game, I get the feeling that the devs don’t take the original idea of the game seriously anymore. 
So, if you want to get into this game, be sure that you have at least watched some gameplay videos. If you already played Treasure hunter or Food Truck Simulator, you know what kind of games they make, and you can decide if this would be worth your money.

So I gave it another try, and for the most part it's okay, a bit hectic, working the till is really annoying because if things fall in the basket, customers get pissed off at you that they get free stuff... like, just go away already?

The gameplay is basically just busy work, run over there, run all the way back over there, use the slow as hell digger that overheats instantly to scoop sand away. You can turn off sandstorms, but the sand from the beginning is still there. Very annoying. If the digger wasn't absurdly slow, or there were more drop off points, or you could just turn off that feature entirely, it'd be bearable. But the fact that it's required to progress makes it a major problem.

But my biggest issue is that you cannot skip cutscenes. The games story is awful. Some skinhead thug comes up behind you, asks for money, beats the hell out of you and stomps on your face. You cannot fight back, you cannot skip this, you cannot pause it... I wasn't prepared for this when I bought a game called ""Gas station simulator"". As someone who has been beat up quite a lot in the past, it brought up a lot of horrible stuff for me.

I will be refunding this game, and this review largely exists to remind me to never ever buy it again. And if you have similar issues to myself, you should avoid this terrible game as well.
In most games where you get beat up, at least there's a decent chance you can fight back, but this was a cutscene. And on a game called ""Gas Station Simulator""... Why am I getting beat up for running a gas station? Why is there this terrible story, and owing money and the stress that some loanshark is going to stomp on my face? This is stressful as hell, this game is not a good escape from reality. It's not even a very good gas station simulator.

Normally I'd include a message about wishing the devs all the best... but after that cutscene... I hate this game.",1633135880,1702919665,False,2,0,0.521325588226318359,2,True,False,False

""Gas Station Simulator"" is a game that oscillates between being brilliantly engaging and frustratingly flawed. It’s a title that offers a unique blend of management and simulation, but its execution is a mixed experience.

The early stages of the game are its shining moments. Transforming a dilapidated gas station into a thriving business is satisfying and well-paced. This phase of the game captures the essence of building and managing a business, offering a sense of accomplishment as you see your station grow and evolve. However, as the game progresses into mid and late stages, its shortcomings become more apparent.

A key issue with ""Gas Station Simulator"" is its repetitiveness and lack of depth in certain areas. The scripted nature of car arrivals and the predictability of certain events, like the always flat front right tire in garage repairs, detract from the realism. The cleaning mechanics are oversimplified, reducing the complexity of managing the station.

Another point of contention is the game's mini-games and features that seem disjointed from the core gameplay. For example, the RC track, while a fun addition, becomes irrelevant as the game progresses and demands more of your time in other areas. The balance between these extra features and the main game tasks is off, leading to a disjointed experience.

The game’s mechanics and user interface also need polishing. Movement can feel clunky, and the mouse/keyboard controls and UI can be cumbersome. These issues, along with the game’s bugs and performance problems, interrupt the gameplay experience.

On the positive side, the core gameplay loop is addictive. There's a constant sense of things to do, manage, and organize, which keeps the game engaging. The progression system initially offers a satisfying journey as you upgrade your station and hire employees. The addition of decorations and the transformation of the gas station are visually and strategically rewarding.

However, the game’s endgame is where it falters significantly. The sense of progression halts, and managing the station becomes tedious rather than rewarding. Employee management feels inefficient, and the lack of automation in certain upgrades is a missed opportunity to enhance the gameplay.

In conclusion, ""Gas Station Simulator"" is a game with great potential that is partially realized. Its early stages are engaging and enjoyable, but the latter part of the game suffers from repetitive gameplay and a lack of depth in management mechanics. For those who enjoy business simulation games, it offers an interesting concept, but be prepared for the mixed experience in terms of quality and gameplay enjoyment. The game is a testament to the fine line between a great idea and its execution in the world of video games.",1702903899,1702903899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game offers a realistic representation of a gas station environment, from the fuel pumps and convenience store shelves to the assortment of customers and vehicles. The attention to detail extends to the day-night cycle and weather effects, contributing to the immersive experience of running a gas station.

At the heart of the gameplay is the management of every aspect of the gas station business. Players start with a modest establishment and gradually expand by upgrading facilities, hiring staff, and improving services. The economic simulation adds depth, requiring players to carefully set prices, manage inventory, and invest wisely to turn a profit.

The customer interactions in ""Gas Station Simulator"" are a highlight. Attending to a diverse range of customers, each with their unique needs and preferences, adds a layer of challenge and unpredictability. Whether fueling up, purchasing snacks, or utilizing car wash services, customers react dynamically to the player's decisions, impacting overall satisfaction and revenue.

The game's progression system is satisfying, offering a steady stream of objectives and challenges to keep players engaged. The sense of accomplishment derived from upgrading the gas station, unlocking new features, and attracting a loyal customer base is both motivating and rewarding.

""Gas Station Simulator"" also surprises with its creative element. Players can customize and decorate their gas stations, adding a personal touch to the business. The inclusion of a photo mode allows players to capture and share their unique creations, fostering a sense of community and creativity within the player base.

While ""Gas Station Simulator"" excels in many areas, some players might find that the repetitive nature of certain tasks and the occasional lack of variety in customer interactions impact the long-term appeal of the game. Additionally, certain aspects of the user interface and controls may benefit from further refinement for a smoother gaming experience.

In conclusion, ""Gas Station Simulator"" is a standout entry in the simulation genre, offering a surprisingly enjoyable and strategic experience in the seemingly mundane world of gas station management. Its detailed visuals, engaging economic simulation, and unexpected creative aspects make it a noteworthy addition to the genre. Whether you're a simulation enthusiast or a player looking for a unique and immersive business management experience, ""Gas Station Simulator"" fuels a sense of enjoyment and accomplishment that sets it apart in the ever-expanding world of simulation games.

It sucks a lot of games are going the route and not just making their game better. I mean if they make it better more people will buy it but no they make paid DLCs to milk the already fan base they have. I mean they made it a add on free now but they had you editing your shop (you know moving things around) a paid DLC. That should tell you what you need to know about these cash grabbers.  Thats as bad as seeing a game that sells their creative mode as a DLC and I have seen it. This company needs to stop milking the fans and just add to the game. 

Now their new paid DLC is bringing blood cults into the game. I dont want to play that I want to play a simulation about running a gas station not worship a god by making them happy.  I mean if you make them mad they what trash your station? Thats stupid! These people just dont get whats going on in a gas station. I never had to worship a blood cults god to pumop gas. Just another dumb idiot from this game. Planes, gods and editing tools whats next for them to milk?

 I mean first they have an airstrip for planes. You know the kind of gas stations that has planes landing and gassing up. That was one of the dumbest updates of a game I have ever seen. I have worked for gas stations before trust me NONE has airplanes landing and coming up to it. Thats all done at an airport and they are not connected to a public business.



That one free DLC is bait.""Oh look a free DLCs ill go ahead and buy one because of it"". Dont be fooled and conned people. Why didnt they just add that to the game if its free? Its a sample trick like the samples in the supermarket. Its a con to get you to buy it.


Edit: Adding cults to your game is just insulting to the modern mind. Its bad enough games add churches and all now you add pleasing gods and making them happy like im worshiping them. I dont want anything to do with blood cults!

Edit2: They just deleted a post of mine saying it broke rules.All I did was say a new DLC was coming out...now they are censoring the negative reviews. Funny how that happened right after I posted this review. 
My post..""But a new DLC is coming that should make you happy right?..."" Gods now censorship seems like a controlling developers complex.

Pros: - It is fun to make money and expand the operation.  
         -I enjoyed the satisfaction of tidying everything up.
         -As I expanded the business, surprising new avenues of play pop up.
          -Just when I started getting a little overwhelmed, I was able to start hiring employees.
            -Most of the mini-games run smoothly.

Cons: - The graffiti kid is just straight up annoying and keeping up with him gets on my nerves
           -PC resource intensive and I have to have a laptop cooler to play this.  
            -The car wash mini-game is super annoying and I just leave it closed and make money some other way.
            -I appreciated the realism of having to keep things clean, but I felt like the walls got dirty too fast to keep them up.

Finally you can have workers do everything and you just have to re-stock, earning money passively but the upgrades are too expensive, so it turns to a kind of IDLE game

Oddly compelling game play of learning easy mini-games, some of which have some room for skillful play.

I had originally gave it a thumbs down, mainly due to frequent crashes.  There were some game play elements that I felt could be improved too.

I got back into this after trying the dreadful Pumping Simulator.  There's no point in trying that game as long as Gas Station Simulator exists.  GSS does everything better, with better graphics and variations.

One serious improvement that I noticed is, inventory is appearing on the stock buy screen. I think I originally requested this in the forums. This is such a quality of life improvement.  

Painting is still tedious. Though it seems like if you don't do it, it doesn't affect your business. There are just so-many-sections and boards to paint.  I just don't think a mini game is needed for this, or at least be quicker.  But when you do do it, it doesn't fade as fast.

If this game is offered at a deep discount then OK for awhile but DON'T buy the airstrip DLC at any price until you have the station of your dreams cuz it frags basic game.

I stopped using controller and the glitches and crashing stopped.  The glitches I understand, but why the crashing?  Anyhow, without any of the paid DLCs - it works fine with mouse and keyboard.

Original Review:

I like this game, but I hate playing it.  It just crashes and glitches far too often for 3 hours of play.  As I understand it, it wasn't always this way.  I was hoping that if I avoided the DLC (reviews are rampant with crashing), I could avoid the instability, but I was wrong.  I can't take it anymore for such a grindy game.  Your time is the entire resource in this game and to lose it over stupidly random things is unacceptable.  I get it.  They auto-save like crazy by default and pin posts in Discussions stating to save often and contact them directly with game crashes.  It would seem that for, or after, 2 years they are well familiar with the problems just not the solutions.",1697588030,1697737270,True,2,0,0.540404021739959717,0,True,False,False

However, This game takes busy work to an extreme and it feels like everything is designed to be an inconvenience. 
-Gas delivery truck is set up on the same road as the cars leaving so those cars get trapped behind it
-cannot order more then 1 delivery at a time and store items and workshop parts cannot be ordered together
-cars will get stuck on the obnoxious sand piles left by dust storms
-Rudy is a clunky nightmare to use and runs out of a fuel super quickly
-customers buy items quicker then you can restock them at times and I feel like I'm playing shelf stocker sim not gas station sim
- profit margins are so tight sometimes that you feel like you aren't going anywhere fast
- people will throw trash on the ground despite having empty cans, and cans fill up after 4 people use them
- even the paint on the store deteriorates over time so if you thought that wouldn't need management too you would be mistaken. 

That's just the gameplay. Graphically and sound design wise the game is kind of a mess too as christmas stuff was on by default despite it being October which is strange even if there is an option to turn it off why was it on by default? as for the sound. However on the dev team decided it was a good idea to both make the fuel truck block the main road and make every stopped car honk over and over and over again needs to not do sound dev design anymore. I had to turn off the horns 5 minutes in because it was just constant. Which sucks because those horns are designed to tell you traffic is blocked. Like if a car gets stuck on a sand pile because they aren't programmed to drive around the piles like a normal person.

In short I wouldn't recommend this game, and that's not even mentioning the issues I've read in other reviews around the DLC for this game.",1696783069,1696783069,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really like the concept of this game. You run your own gas station and are able to unlock new things later in the game.
There are however a few things that i would like to be in the game.

1. Customising all buildings
Right now you can paint every building but you can only change the structure of the gas station house. I think it would be very cool if that was possible with all buildings.

2. Sandbox/Hardcore mode
I would love for this game to have different game modes. If you just want to relax and design your gas station a sandbox option would be perfect, but on the other hand a version that has lots of challenges would be cool too.",1696230684,1696230684,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At 33.1 hours I reached a point I where I completed all the missions, bought a majority of the upgrades, and started to get bored.  (And, yes, I bought all the DLC as a bundle.  I have completed the DLC stuff also.)

Pro's:
* The method the story unfolds conveniently unlocks more features and stuff to do.
* The over-all theme was well done.
* There is generally no bad choice, making the game very relaxing to play.

Con's:
* CON and warning...  keep many saves files.  There are game bugs that will absolutely not let you continue with the same save file.
* The mini-games get annoying.  I say this about all games with mini-games.  The player should only have to play the same mini-game a couple dozen times, not over and over and over, ad nauseam.
* The game is too short.  Once the story missions are done, the game isn't really open to end-less play.  
* I personally would have preferred more of a manager game.  The overwhelming number of tasks and mini-games, make the game start to become tedious and less enjoyable.  Having more employees and having the employees do more tasks would have been better.  (Yes, I have the Employee DLC.  The Employee DLC still doesn't do enough.)

TLDR: 
Out of the 40 hours I have on record with this game, at least 15 of those were spent trying to get around game-breaking bugs. Over 2 years as a full release, this game still feels like it's in early access with greedy, incompetent developers. Gas Station Simulator is nothing more than a stiff billboard at this point, used to sell more trash games that will never be properly supported. 3/10*

It's been a year and a half since I reviewed this game, and since then I've come back twice to check out new updates. The first was for the Airstrip DLC, which bugged out within the first 20 minutes and I couldn't complete the duct tape tutorial. Plus, the game has shit Steam Deck support, so I was quickly out of patience by then.

The second return was for the recent, long-awaited Employee update. Sure enough another game-breaking bug burrows up and devours any motivation I almost had to play this again. What's hilarious is that there have already been 2 hotfixes for this update, with the 2nd one stating that it fixed the UFO button; yet the UFO button DOESN'T WORK! To put this into context, The UFO Button is a quick-fix-all solution that the devs implemented so players can wipe away all the broken crap that happens in the game over time. It's a nifty little trick that developers can use as a temporary workaround while a game is in early access. Only this game isn't in early access. The developers put this in a fully released game because they are too lazy to actually repair their code in order to prevent the bugs from happening in the first place. It doesn't help that they're already advertising their next paid dlc at the end of the patch notes of this broken update. Also, what happened to the Shady Dealings DLC they announced BEFORE the airstrip one was even announced? Shady indeed...

On top of all that, after 2 whole years the devs still haven't been bothered to bring full controller support to the PC version, even though they've since released it on the Switch. They're obviously milking the success they've had with this game and taking advantage of their player base.

Got about 4 days (20 hours) of entertainment out of this before it really started feeling repetitive and pointless. It's also very buggy and culminated in a game breaking issue where the car wash no longer functions. With ongoing support, I'm sure many of these issues will be addressed, but it's still overpriced, even then. It is pretty fun for a few play sessions, but I don't think it'll ever be worth more than $10. 6/10*",1644542159,1695742737,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Especially in a world where companies like to charge 60-70 bucks for games that sometimes don't even get this much play time. Its not a bad game but it can be buggy, I have had it crash on me once but thankfully this games auto saves made it so I didn't loose really any progress when it happened. I love the charm the game has but really feel like it lacks a few things and I figured Id give some tips here also for the developers!

In short before I go into those tips I want to say if the game is ever on sale I seriously recommend getting it. Its a solid enough of a purchase now and I am having fun still 8 hours in. I would even argue it is worth it at the 20 dollar price tag. It may not be hundreds of hours of experience but its definitely fun for the 8 hours I have put in so far.

Now for the tips to Developers.
- Firstly the Employees (which I know are still in your updates and hot fixes) could use just a bit more work. I am noticing whenever my employees are checking people out they are getting negative responses a LOT. Maybe there is something to the employee system I am not catching but if I have to take over the register every time a tour bus or something comes in because my employee can't handle the line and is getting a lot of things wrong, then there is a problem. They are on working on the register but it seems they get a lot of negative responses from customers.
- Secondly I am going to suggest a simple Quality of Life change. Let us repair the register so we don't have to constantly clean it please. It was a interesting mechanic at first but it doesn't help the repetitive nature of the register later on. A simple upgrade later down the road in terms of progress could seriously help make this more interesting.
- I have seen a lot of car accidents, firstly thank you for the UFO resetter, its great and full of the same character the rest of this game has. All the same though, your AI for driving cars could use a slight rework and would solve so many of these issues. Something as simple as a check to make sure other cars are not on the same road, and making sure they stop a couple of inches sooner when there is something in their way could solve so many of the road issues. Moving the Gas tank is also something I recommend as it further causes issues with the traffic.
- Give us some more tools to mess with the gas station profits please. I have noticed that a lot of the prices of items and gas fluctuate. Allow me to also set up my own prices and control how much profit I get. This can also even lead to a mini game of updating the sign for the new price of gas if you want to add more to it. You could also add a competitor Gas station across the road or something if you ever get time to add more layers to the gas station itself. This happens a lot in gas stations across the US where you can have multiple gas stations competing for the same customers and would certainly fit the Route 66 vibe.
-Lastly, Route 66 is in the United States, I know we are only one of the like two countries that still use it, but in the US Gas is not measured in liters. We use gallons, so I suggest defaulting to gallons for gas. However Id also suggest having a setting to toggle between the two, it is another small change that makes the game more accessible.

I am a 65 year old retired writer, and there is something about that game that goes deep below the surface level. When you first experience the game, it seems fairly shallow with a bit of gimmicks here and there, and npcs that stare at you blankly, almost like you're living in hell. But if you truly get past the basic functionally and delve into the lore of the game, you realize you aren't running just a gas station, you're running the only business for 200 miles any direction. You are the ""buckeys"" of this world, with no competition. The jingle of santa flying over is a nod to humanities love and affection for holidays, the ghost is a nod to jonny sins, who is an artist well know for his song ""Ring of Fire"". What truly tears apart your heart strings is the interaction with your uncle, who at first seems like a philanthropist helping you, but as you delve into it... you realize the truth... the turmoil you've ended up in. You are not casually running a business, you are a slave, an indentured servant, to a man you only get to see once. You will never be top dog, even when you have a fleet of peons below you, you are a pawn in the grand game of chess, you just don't realize it. When you get to the part where your character wakes up out of his oppressive position and the absolute best firefight I've ever had in a video game ensues, you feel truly like you're liberating yourself. When you get cornered, run down into the sewers for your final stand, much like osama bin laden, and grab that SVD, you feel as if the weight of the world is crashing down upon you. In those final moments, where you line up the scope on your uncles head, it's a do or die situation. The man who helped you all this way, should I really pull the trigger? A moral quandary to say the least. When you finally come to, and realize he is full sprint running at your with two golden 1911s, you know he is no longer a friend. He is an enemy. You take the shot, and the game fades to black. While not youtube worthy, if you can allow yourself to imagine a real situation rather than the cheap unity default models, you see nothing less than a masterpiece, an orchestra of betrayal and labor, a tale of a simple man going against his oppressor.  A beautiful much needed story in these trying times in America.

The game doesnt have amazing graphics, but im honestly not expecting the best graphics anymore for indie games (its an imposed limitation that hinders style). Regardless, it looks like a game that is brown and grey at first until you fix it up. That is a plus. 

The music is idk, it didn't entice me within the first 10 minutes so i muted it and played my own music.

Now the game play is just kind boring. Imagine you could have car mechanic simulator, house flipper, and some others in one base game? No what if i told you the developers bought the random 99 cent store with sketchy products version and put it in the game. I just wanted to sell people gas and snacks. Now I'm a jiffy lube balancing car repairs, pumping gas (wtf is this new jersey? they can pump and pay themselves), and selling food, while also having to balance all the stock orders and cleaning on top of that. yes you can close for a bit to be able to do stuff like clean and restock, but the time that can take is immense, feeling as if you are closed as long as you are open. 

Also the way you balance you funds in this game is not that great. Car mechanic simulator has a good style that still has some form of punishment. This game felt as if i could circumvent that quite easily. There is not much challenge from decisions, rather it is just stressful doing everything yourself. 

This game is good, not bad. It just wasn't for me. If you like focused sims like house flipper, power wash sim, car mechanic sim, this game won't scratch that itch.

This game is addictive. I watched Z1 gaming play it and thought, hmmm that looks like a chill game i can play for an hour and drop then come back to.

Boy was I wrong. Honestly I love it. I'm a bit sad that I can't go through levels and go from a run down place to a big multi site gas station. Or even have it just as it is but you can choose the location type. Also, making the car wash automatic or allowing staff to do that would be good. But tbh, I'm just happy with how it is.

Yes the cars can be buggy at times but honestly at this point its kinda part of the games charm...nothing like calling in a ufo and seeing every car in the map getting sucked up and reset..
I would disregard any comments about the game being buggy as it's honestly not as bad as some people try to make it sound in the reviews, and they fix any MAJOR bugs relatively quick in my opinion.
This game manages to accomplish alot for your average simulation game and is put together very well.
The game can be tailored to almost any players needs in the settings,meaning if theres a feature you don't like or cant stand chances are you can just disable that feature in the settings menu.
The tutorial of the game and how it teaches you to play is also very well thought out and was easy for me to understand it does a grate job at not overwhelming the player with too much at one time. [spoiler] Until you get your first party bus...then your probs going to feel a little overwhelmed <3 have fun with that one lol..at least they warn you though  [/spoiler]

This game is amazing all around, and like others have said it really does keep someone with ADHD or OCD very entertained. However even if you don't have those conditions this is DEF worth adding to your steam library.

I will add that I did not pick up the airport DLC because of the seemingly endless amount of poor reviews revolving around the dlc but I DO recommend getting the DLC I did get which is Party Time & Can touch this.
This game was bought during a sale on steam at 30% off 13.99$  plus the cost of dlc.
However I would still recommend this game to ANYONE paying full price to get it. As this game is a rare gem among the massive sea of (mostly bad) simulation games on steam and deserves the funding that it receives.

Drago Entertainment...Keep up the good work! love you guys & your game, and im looking foward to your Tidal Wave DLC release!~ I know its going to have bugs on release, but seeing how promptly you started fixing bugs from the Employee update gives me high hopes that any of those bugs will be swiftly dealt with as your playerbase reports them~! thanks again for bringing us such an amazing simulation game amongst a sea full of repetitive garbage.",1695258706,1695258706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alright! Much better, haven't had any crashes at all now (since they added additional code busters).

A lot more features, and they finally just added an employee scheduling function (which still needs work) that should have been there on day one.

Also, still no useful controller support - not good. This game would EASILY be a LOT better with controller support, and there aren't that many player functions that the entire game couldn't be mapped to a controller - PRIORITY ONE Devs, get on it. This would also be a good basis if you eventually want to provide a VR version, which would be great.

Much more worth purchasing then when I last rated it (still has some goofy UNITY bugs that the devs say are ""unfixable"" - which I half believe, also believe the dev(s) are underexperienced), though there remains some controversy over what should be DLC and what should be base game, but whatever.

I can't wait to see where this series is going.

Would be fun if they put everything in one big game.

It's fun, if not a little dry after a bit. I would have liked to see more in terms of designing the look of your store, managing the ""official"" part of the station (bills, paperwork, maybe a few health inspections), and striving to turn your station into maybe a chain wouldn't go amiss. I would have also liked to decorate, paint, and design my sleeping quarters above the warehouse. Unfortunately, you can't sleep in the bed to progress time or anything like that, so you're always awake and expected to do something-- even if there's nothing to do. The moment you get staff, the game almost goes stagnant; not much to engage in beyond washing a few cars, watching for sandstorms, and refreshing peeling paint-- oh, and also throwing trash at Dennis (throwing garbage bags at a naughty child is a pleasant aside). 

There are cute little nuggets sprinkled across the game. You got a rock n' roll ghost, Santa flies across the sky at the stroke of midnight, and aliens play an integral part in fixing traffic build ups (an excellent, creative ""reset"" for little issues that happen when you have free range on Ruth and idiotic customers that don't obey common sense traffic laws). The game tries to make up for your lack of things to do by giving you little mini-games such as RC racing and a game that's a mix between mini-golf and shuffle board (I think?), but it all falls a little flat after a while. There's only so many times you can race the same course before you get bored. 

The graphics are a lot better than I expected and your movements are smooth. You can pick trunk locks right in front of your customers (who are sometimes police officers) and they just look at you. Also, if you stand on top of them, you can see the inside of their head. Which is wild. And kind of unsettling. But damn, if the developers don't design a realistic tongue. 

There are a bunch of cogs in the game that make it a good experience, but it ins't really for long-term play once you pay Uncle his last loan. You would open it up if you ever feel like, I don't know, using a cash register or changing the oil in a car, but, so far, I'm not seeing how it can progress beyond that point. 

Still, for the first 10 hours or so, it's fun and reasonably paced. It has updates to the different services offered at your store, and, honestly, it itches a part of my brain that relishes in tedious, day-to-day management.",1694282492,1694282492,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As you play you unlock more services for your station that will will earn you more money. You can eventually hire employees to help you run the station. You start off with gas only, and one pump which you can upgrade up to 3 pumps as you go. As you progress, you will have in store merchandise to sell, such as, snacks, drinks, alcohol, tobacco products, toys, ice cream, and more. As you level the station you earn access to other merchandise as I mentioned above, however you start simple with drinks and snacks. You eventually get a car wash, which can be upgraded to a automatic. A car repair shop, which you unlock more repair items as you go. You start with tires, scratch removal, and mirrors. You can unlock, spark plugs, coolant, batteries, and oil. If you get the Airstrip DLC, you gain access to refueling planes, and trading items with them for imported items. Such as maple syrup from Canada, tea from UK and more to sell on your shelves. The game allows you to paint your station and decorate it as you see fit. There is a fair amount of items in my opinion. There are some game features like a kid Dennis who comes and vandalizes your station, and sandstorms which leave sand piles on the station roads that block cars. I found these features more annoying then fun. The options menu does give you the option to turn these off. I played with them on for the start to experience them, but again found more enjoyment in the game turning them off.  Overall, I did enjoy the game. This is one I will come back to as DLC content comes out. Once you beat the story line, you can continue to run the station making money until your heart is content. Though as you do the content becomes stale. It is rinse and repeat in the end.

An imperfect but very addictive chore simulator with an intentionally bizarre narrative angle. The mini games can feel frustrating and obtuse to start, but I promise if you stick with it you'll get into a very addictive rhythm. Even the Airstrip DLC felt like a bridge too far at first, but once I figured out the rhythm it became one of my favorite parts of the game. I've been playing it for a few weeks and I'm still getting new import cargo items to buy and sell in my shop that I've never seen before, which I find to be super fun. It's still rather buggy 2 years after launch, but I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs. Just some quirky moments adding to the already weird flavor. I will say that once you've maxed out your gas station, there doesn't seem to be much reason to play anymore. There's not much of an endgame event, either. Just some brief text, and then the game just sort of peters out on an endless loop. It leaves me wondering (hoping!) that there might be more DLC. There are parts of the game that seem like they were laying plans to develop further, but never did. Why do you have a living space above the warehouse? There's nothing you can do in it besides decorate it. You can't even sleep in your very gross bed, which would have made a lot of sense since there's no way to elapse the time, and very few people come to your station in the middle of the night. I have read that their upcoming Roadside Diner Simulator somehow connects to your Gas Station Simulator game. I think the diner appears across the street from your gas station?

- ((half fixed)) Can't repair cars cuz' the tire and mirror minigames get stuck

- ((not fixed)) Sometimes when you've lockpicked a car succesfully, it just resets the lock and you have to try again

- ((fixed)) Now that i've bought some decorations, my cleaning employee is mistaking them for trash and gets stuck trying to clean uncleanable trash. wow. i can't even remove the trash myself, so no way to fix it

- ((fixed)) Not a bug but somehow the ONLY time the party bus shows up is when i'm closed xd 
^ they fixed it by making it so they go into your shop even when your shop is closed,,, which works, but uh... it's an interesting way to do it for sure. (the station is still open though, i had my repair shop running while i was doing other things and suddenly realized there were 7 people waiting at the cash register xD)



((UPDATE)) 
- did as the dev asked, started a new game and instantly crashed, lmao.

- have to keep switching between controller and mouse cuz some of the functions do not work

- trying to rotate a lamp but rotating it (with my controller) makes me put it back in my inventory for some reason

- big fan of the management tab tho, kudos for that ^^

- during calls with uncle, if i try to scroll through the dialogue it will just jump back up so i don't get subtitles on part of the dialogue xd (and it won't scroll at all on my controller)

- tried to play the guitar in the warehouse and crashed

- changing the tire on cars now actually works, tho it's still kinda trash with a controller... and the mirror still gets stuck lol (on controller) ,,,i'd recommend you use mouse+keyboard for everything in the garage so you don't end up having to reload, but the scratch remover wouldn't work for me without my controller, so honestly, idek.

- upgrading your gas station removes roof paint for some reason

- Some NPCs get stuck outside the station while others have no problem getting in, so they take up parking space until i close the station

- the sponge for the cash register game sometimes doesn't want to scrub, so i have to click randomly with my mouse until it decides to work



TLDR: The game sucks if you use a controller, you have to switch between that and mouse (haven't tried unplugging my controller to play with just mouse+keyboard so maybe that'll work for you), it still crashes randomly, and is overall really janky, but it's genuinely a fun game, i just wouldn't recommend it to anyone with less patience than me, lol.",1653322754,1692625156,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

Pro's:
- The concept of the game is super fun. Getting to run and upgrade your own gas station is really nice
- There are a lot of mini games that you get to play while doing the basic tasks like pumping gas, fixing cars or scanning groceries
- Some might call it child abuse, but I loved throwing trash bags at Dennis
- There are a lot of different items that you can sell in your shop
- Getting to lock pick your customers cars is fun and a quick and easy way to get some more money. 
- (Revised review) The optimization is A LOT better now than it was before. The loading times are short and the fps drops are minimal. I only experienced ""low"" fps during the parties. 
- (Revised review) Free DLC has been added to the game which includes a party area and an ice cream station. 
- (Revised review) Since my last review they added a car wash, which I really enjoyed
- (Revised review) Lots of decorative options to spend you hard earned cash on 
- (Revised review) Steam achievements are fully functional now! 
- (Revised review) Gas station simulator scratches the simulator game itch

Con's:
- [strike]The game is extremely poorly optimized (I have a high end gaming pc that's having a rough time with this game) [/strike]
- The game is filled with bugs [strike]and about 50% of them is actually game breaking. I had to reload old save files so many times that I lost count [/strike] not as game breaking as before. Maybe it's also part of the simulator games charm
- [strike]The game crashes every now and then for no specific reason [/strike]
- RUDY
- I don't see any additional value of the minigames behind the gas station
- The employees are too slow at their jobs (even at level 10. If you want to get all achievements you have to do all the tasks manually.
- [strike]Steam achievements are bugged and won't unlock which makes it impossible to even complete the game at 100% (I heard they will patch this in their next patch..) [/strike]
- HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK
- (Revised review) Some of the late game challenges are actually impossible to complete. (for example: helping 40 customers at the cash register within 6 minutes. Most of the customers buy a week worth of groceries (15 to 30 items) which is impossible to scan before the 6 minute timer passes.  
- (Revised review) I personally am not a fan of paid DLC when the base game feels a bit empty (for a lack of better words)

[strike]I can see a lot of potential in this game, but at the moment it isn't there yet. Maybe with a couple more updates the game will actually be functional and playable for longer than a couple of hours. (I wanted to complete it 100% before writing the review, but it's impossible). Taking all the above into consideration I decided to rate the game a 4/10 :c[/strike]

After 2 years and a lot of updates I decided to give the game another try. I am really glad I did. The game has improved A LOT after my last review. Most of the cons I mentioned in my previous review have now been solved. This actually made gas station simulator a lot of fun instead of frustrating. I did complete the game 100% and enjoyed going after those steam achievements. The last 2 popularity levels were a grind and mainly consisted of running between the gas pumps and the cash register. It took about 20 hours for just the final 2 levels and it got very repetitive. I didn't want to give up so I kept pushing through and I am proud to say that I am now the owner of a level 10 gas station. However, I think €20,- is a bit pricey for what the game has to offer. With a price of €20,- this game is competing with top notch games that offer more for the same price. I want to say thank you to the developers for reaching out to me and taking the reviews into consideration and making changes a lot of us wanted to see. Taking all the above into consideration I decided to rate the game a 7/10 <3",1633376129,1691440273,True,0,0,0.597385525703430176,0,True,False,False

You only slowly turn a profit and keeping employees almost feels useless and you could effectively make better profits by closing a majority of the station.

I recently purchased The Gas station simulator for Steam. I am unable to play the game due to the fact that the font size is far too small. There isn't an option to toggle the size and increase it. 

 

I had to stand iincredibly close to the television screen before I was able to read the prompts or information about my Station. I ended up moving my television much closer to my seat, about three feet away. In doing so, I triggered a severe migraine. I was horribly ill with indescribable pain, vision loss, loss of speech, memory loss, confusion, inability to read, write, or type, I was violently throwing up and I became completely unable to even use my phone to call for help. 

 

Though I do take fault in moving my television too close, I wanted to illustrate exactly how much of an issue the small font size is. After scouring online forums such as Reddit and the actual gas station website, I've learned that there are many users reporting the exact same inaccessibility issue for both console and PC versions of the game. My screen is a 65"" LCD television, and I have also tried the game on a 70"" to no avail.",1690043568,1690043568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------------------------
Story: 
I was not a fan. I don't think simulator games need a campaign as such. I understand that the game needs a tutorial, but the forced handholding was a bit much. One minute I could clean stuff, but now I can't because I have to answer the phone? It was very inconsistent. 

Simulator: 
The game did decently at simulating a gas station. However, as earlier mentioned, it is very inconsistent in what I can clean up and repair. A car wreck right at the back of your fully upgraded gas station is impossible to remove. 
I had also purchased the ""Can Touch This"" DLC because I wanted extra decorations - Only to find out at least 40% was not able to be placed anywhere on the property (chair, gas bottle lamp, etc). 

Endgame: 
at the end, I only had to stock shelves. Being a stock-boy is not what I would consider owning a successful business, but that's just my opinion - we should have been able to hire someone to manage the warehouse/stocking. 

Atmosphere:
 I also did not enjoy the gimmicky scene - Cars visiting the gas station would frequently flip for no reason, blocking traffic completely. Your only way to solve this, is to hit a reset button that have aliens come flying by and swoop everyone up. Cool the first time, but getting whited by an alien ship because of bad traffic AI is not good gameplay. There is also mini golf, but only one lane, even though multiple lanes are buillt. No guest can use this for your profit though. 

The same applies to the RC cars located in the junk yard - fun the first time, but I bought the game to run a gas station.

The good stuff: 

I loved the fluctuating prices in everything, making you rethink to maybe wait on buying fuel a little later, because it might be cheaper. 

The decorations that worked, were pretty cool. 

I liked the employee system, it was nice working up to a point where I almost had to do nothing.

Some mini-games were applied correctly in my opinion (painting walls, repairing cars, scanning items, for example). 

I also appreciate being able to disable most of the annoyances in settings (Graffiti, sand storm). 
The graphics were great, although demanding for a mid-tier system. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Gas Station Simulator is the first game I've ACTUALLY completed all achievements for. It was tons of fun and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes playing simulation games. Remember that your broom is your friend and will help you with those pesky cars that sometimes crash or flip over. lol

It's got some quirks when it comes to collision of items on the belt when ringing out customers. Sometimes you did nothing wrong but an item randomly fly's off the belt or fly's into the basket. So that is incredibly annoying to say the least. There are also some rare occurrences of people getting stuck in the spot they are standing. My recommendation to anyone who has the rare issue here and there. Instead of resetting all the npc's and cars at your gas station sign, which removes anyone who was in your store or other locations spending money. Save the game and re-load first, so you don't potently lose out on making money from them. If that didn't fix the issue, then go ahead and press the reset button. Other than that, I don't recall any major issues that didn't get fixed by re-loading the save. 

One final note, be careful running around with your broom in hand.......you'll find out why if you don't.",1689629813,1689629813,True,5,1,0.542989015579223633,0,True,False,False

BUT 
I dislike this game for number of reasons, some of them I'll name here as major game disatisfiers for me, PERSONALLY:
*NOTE: I have proper specs to play this game. If you point out me having issue on ssd. I DO OWN an ssd when running this game! I repeat myself, I have the proper specs to play this game. I've also tried it on minimum specs that could run this game and still has the same problems stated below:

I have played this game for a span of almost 6 months, the same problems here persists until my latest game play as of 16 July 2023:

1) Loading screen for this game is as long as the loading screen for gta 5 online for me 
2) Lots of bugs and is buggy
3) major fps lag and the game hangs for a long time. I've already dealt with the settings, nothing's changed for the better.
4) small movement by the characters in game causes fps drop and game lag
5) sometimes the sounds and actions are delayed with or without doing something in game

If ever the developers read this, I hope this helps fixing some stuff up. The game has a great potential being one of the best games out there but with all these problems happening.

Edit for Date 2022-12-15: This game is a great game but is totally unplayable. The performance is super choppy on 4 different PC's with specs far ahead of recommended. This has made me a little sour since I have been playing since release. I want to try other products but won't until I know I can trust this game is fixed. I have sent multiple reports and even some in discord before the full version was released.

As of right now I do not recommend this game.


EDIT UPDATE 2023-07-14:
As current updates have rolled it it seems most issues have been fixed and I can enjoy this again. DLC looks good but I'll give it time to simmer.

They actually become the workload because you have to constantly check on them to make sure they're doing what they need to do, call them back from break, or making sure they aren't glitching causing you to pay for nothing. I absolutely hate the fact they don't come back from break on their own/ doesn't show you when they decide to leave.

Also the payment. Please I'm begging automatically take payment from our wallet instead if having to go to the pc to pay to switch them from task to task. Makes the game frustrating to play once you get to the employee unlock and dealing with too many micro""games"". Also in the future if you implement this allow for payment to be taken out even if it means your wallet goes into negative because taking care of the tiny details is too much for what we have to oversee already.

Worked the first time i played. Next time i tried to play the game, it would not load.

On a small downside, the money making system needs some adjustments. It is a major grind to make money for all the upgrades and to still have enough money to re-stock the workshop, buy fuel and goods for the store etc. Devs, PLEASE consider upping the money making a bit for us.

You will have to manage a garage and a car wash on top of all the ordering and restocking. You can get up to six employees to help around the station. 
 The Party Time and Can Touch This DLC are neat. The Can Touch This DLC gives more upgrades, so your bound to be playing longer to get the cash for them. On top of all that, you need to clean up sand after dust storms and chuck items at a kid who likes to hang around and spray artwork on the walls.

Some bugs/ideas:
 The Jerry can for Rudy takes 0 fuel out of the pump. 
 Sometimes when picking up some items in the garage they will go to the mouse like the other times, but then fall down to the floor, teleporting back to the mouse every now and then only to fall back down.
 I doubt many people even care, but maybe a few animation cleanups? (Getting in/out of the car, people taking out the trash, etc.)
 Having people work in the garage for you is way OP, they finish repairing a care in about five seconds when it would take you about a minute. Maybe have them stay working on the car for x amount of time for a certain repair??

Then general maintenance of the place in engauging. Even the pumping gas part is done through mini-games.  There's enough going on here you need to set an alarm or get sucked in. I've only played for three hours and I'm already hooked. If you like occupational games, definately worth the money.  My only request is that the developers find a way to have a Steam Friends invite multi-player option.  Yes, there is that much to do that unless you can a black belt in time management, you're not doing it all. To their credit, you don't have to.  You can shut down parts of the shop and focus on the stuff you want to do.  Again, great game guys.
Still hooked, bought the airport expansion. I like how you're not locked into a set type of station. You can just be a mechanic if you want.  Or just be a quickie-mart.

Gas Station Simulator offers an unexpectedly engaging and immersive experience by transforming the mundane task of running a gas station into a surprisingly addictive gameplay loop. Developed for PC by a small indie studio, this simulation game manages to captivate players with its attention to detail and satisfying mechanics.

From the moment you step into the shoes of a gas station owner, Gas Station Simulator throws you into a world that goes far beyond simply pumping gas and collecting payments. You'll find yourself responsible for every aspect of the business, from managing inventory, fixing broken fuel pumps, hiring staff, and even engaging with customers.

One of the game's strongest points is its realistic representation of the day-to-day challenges faced by gas station owners. Whether it's dealing with disgruntled customers, restocking shelves, or cleaning up spills, the tasks may seem monotonous at first, but as you delve deeper, you'll discover a surprising level of depth and complexity.

The attention to detail in Gas Station Simulator is commendable. The graphics, while not the most cutting-edge, provide a charming and vibrant atmosphere. The gas station itself is intricately designed, with various areas to explore and upgrade. The sound design adds another layer of immersion, with ambient noises and realistic customer interactions enhancing the overall experience.

One of the most satisfying aspects of the game is the sense of progression and growth. As you efficiently manage your gas station, you'll earn money, allowing you to expand and improve your establishment. Upgrading your fuel pumps, adding new services, and customizing the appearance of your station provide a tangible sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep pushing forward.

However, Gas Station Simulator does have a few areas that could use improvement. The user interface, while functional, could be more intuitive, especially when it comes to managing inventory and employee schedules. Some players may also find the initial learning curve a bit steep, as there are numerous mechanics and systems to master.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Gas Station Simulator delivers an enjoyable and surprisingly addictive experience. The blend of realistic simulation, satisfying gameplay mechanics, and a well-crafted progression system make it an engaging and unique addition to the simulation genre.

If you're someone who enjoys games that challenge you to manage and build from the ground up, Gas Station Simulator is a worthwhile choice. It offers a refreshing change of pace from the usual gaming experiences, immersing you in the seemingly ordinary yet captivating world of running a gas station. Prepare to be surprised and delighted as you transform your humble establishment into a thriving business empire.",1687484204,1687484204,True,2,0,0.522332549095153809,0,True,False,False

Keeps u on ur feet a lot always something going on and it becomes a lot especially once u unlock more things such as the garage and begin to have more customers. I barely got to the point where i could hire one employee and that helps a bit. lots to clean up so if you wanted you could just close station and focus on other projects around the land without worrying about customers. Its not really a relaxing simulator if that is what you are looking for, maybe if you close down most of the things at the gas station and say only kept pumps station open or only the register. So if you are someone that does want a simulator that keeps you busy i recommend this one, I love simulation/management things like house flipper or farm sim but i do get bored very easily when nothing happens after a while.",1687481121,1687481121,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can see how the game is addictive and involved and therefore fun enough to make hours pass by like minutes. So 10/10 for content and game mechanics. I do however have to take that all away because of the constant crashing which happens every 20 minutes to an hour if you're lucky. I think there is some severe memory leaks happening here because you see the FPS go down, then a two second freeze just before you get thrown back into your desktop. I could put up with a few minor bugs and glitches, but because this game wasn't sold to me as early access I have to condemn it accordingly. This isn't a polished finished game and you can see by the hours that I've put into it that I have tried to persevere to the end. I'm nearly there with one level to go and finding it now just unplayable. FPS is struggling because this isn't optimised whatsoever. I often wonder if the developers actually bother to play the game all the way to end before releasing it? Do they care? Sorry, but if a buy a car that looks and sounds the business I'm going to be really pissed off if the wheels falls off or the engine ceases 100 yards up from the showroom.  My advice if you read this is leave the game on the shelf for about six months and check what updates have been done. Don't read too much in the positive reviews which seem to be written by players who haven't put the hours in or reached levels where the trouble actually begins with the crashes and crap performance.

EDIT: After several months the developer has responded suggesting that performance has improved. I have reinstalled and even bought the current DLC's which also have glitch/crash problems. I have played to the end of the campaign story with only the final landmarks to install and to get remaining  achievements. There are still times this does crash and there are still some glitches e.g. don't put a dream catcher over the doorway as Dennis cannot run through them. As for performance it runs great, but the problem is I have a new rig with an RTX 4080 and all the other bells and whistles so for judging FPS performance I am now not qualified to do so. As for giving this a thumbs up I'll think about it, but I feel strongly that a game that has issues on release should be under early access.",1634944649,1687398954,False,70,7,0.74310767650604248,11,True,False,False

I have ADHD so this is perfect, you can hop all over the place and do whatever job you want. Give yourself a big ol’ pat on the back for making this game, so many things to do, you can interact with so many objects/things. You can definitely tell there was a lot of work and sweat (probably tears also) put into creating/making this game. I highly recommend. I’m bad about game hopping and usually never come back to most games, they go to their little game cemetery to never be touched again, BUT this one for SURE I’ll be coming back to very soon. You can also make comment(s) on any bugs or recommendations for the game and Chris always takes note showing interest in what you have to say using professionalism and kindness unlike a lot of others who ignore or get butthurt. Again, thank you Chris for helping, I hope for many, many more years of success for this great game for ya! Happy gaming everyone! <3",1687312981,1687312981,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Poor quality of vehicle mechanics I literally listened car horns all the time since they just crash and blocks the road
-Like the first one, Major bugs that ruins your game experience and they don't intend to fix it.
-Awful optimization, lags even though I had a high-end pc
-Unbalanced gameplay, literally the money system has a major flaws

When the game starts and my xbox controller is connected the highlighted menu keeps on spinning and wont stop until I disconnect my controller.  The game freezes randomly and it froze right at when I was saving and lost my file.

-Updated 6-17-23 The game is still fun. But the game crashes.  I used both version of DX12 and non DX12 and every so often. When I order supplies game crashes, when I get a lot of customers, order fuel game crashes.  Seems the more upgrades the game can't handle it?  I constantly have to save the game even before the auto save kicks in.  It is june and I am getting music ghost, santa, customers with snoman hats or santa hats which can be disabled.  Also Dennis can be disabled along with sandstorms.

Game is fun in theory. I maxed out every upgrade possible.  When I ordered more ice cream and autoparts. The little truck icon that spawns to deliver the goods does not appear.  I re-order and says the shipment is on its way. Waited several minutes heard no honking at the warehouse.  Im gonna call it and say it was fun while it lasted. I am gonna focus on other games. 

Once you purchase the Airport DLC it messes up the progression of the gas station.  Once you unlock the airport you will spend a lot of time and money on the airport while neglecting the gas station.  I wish there was an option to add 2 more trailers.

I picked up GSS assuming it would be a delightful jank-fest I could play for a half dozen hours and move on.  What I got was a fairly janky but surprisingly competent mini-game-based, story-driven management game.  The game is mostly just a series of small tasks, ring up goods, pump gas, etc... played through simple mini-games.  What the game does shockingly well is pacing and escalation: while some mini-games remain fairly static, adding new parts and facilities adds complexity over time to the point that hiring your first employee hits that perfect sweet spot: you check off *one* thing you don't want to do, or can even have *something* running while you do non-business related tasks.  It shows an excellent grasp of why this loop is so engaging and provides something devoutly desired: freedom from a task, while also adding it's own extra layer of management.

So yeah, I was genuinely surprised.  It's not just a fun little janky time waster, it's actually a pretty well-designed game in its own right and manages the rare feat of escaping the ""simulator"" brand of ""core gameplay loop ... we didn't know how to expand from there.""

If you really want to play a game like this, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but if you're just curious, this game doesn't have the quality it should have for a released title. It feels early access.

There is a lot to do in the game, but often too much. Progression is slow, you balance ordering various stock, fuel etc, unloading deliveries, fueling vehicles, scanning goods at the checkout, sweeping and painting and emptying bins, and repairing cars for much of the game. There is very little profit, so it is a hard grind of running around to tend to various people. One of the best things this game should have, is both higher profits on selling goods (doesnt have to be realistic prices guys!), and the ability to close portions of the Gas Station. A lot of the time I had no money to pay into the expensive garage goods, so I wish I could have closed it instead of having people constantly arrive, get annoyed, affect my score and leave.

I dont mind the kid graffiting, its a funny bit that can be toggled off, but please change it so we just click on him once to stop him. Throwing things is a nightmare and he moves quickly.

The game is very buggy. Picked up items often go into the floor, or will still have their gravity so you have to drag them around. Lots of animation glitches with people sat like theyre in cars when leaving the shop. I had a car crash that meant I reset the cars with 2 deliveries, it then spawned 4 delivery lorries after the reset, with 2 being empty.

As other people have said, the performance is quite poor. Whilst my laptop didnt crash, it did overheat, which it doesnt do with any AAA game, it also gitters like mad sometimes.

I wish there were less painful tasks to do, and it was more fun. If employees were easier to manage, like having a scheduel of when they work and have a break so you can rotate employees or close sections of the gas station. No climbing into sewers to empty it often. The price of everything reduced, especially the early garage items and fuel. The devs really needed to get some people to sit down with the game, write everything that doesnt feel good, is boring, and bugs... and iron it all out.

Right now this is not a finished product, and sadly isn't worth the full price either. I really hope the devs will listen to advice though and improve the game's progression and performance. The game looks nice and has a great sense of humour.

Update: 17/06/2023 and there's a lot of jankiness still. There's a lot more things that need to be fixed than performance and crashes, whilst I didnt experience issues with them, the balance means the game is an endless slog of boring and repetitive tasks.",1644110852,1687020845,False,43,2,0.700072050094604492,0,True,False,False

Initial review:

Kind of wish I waited to buy this game either on sale or after they fixed their bugs. I feel like I'm still playing a beta for a full release price. $17 USD is quite steep for all the crashes I've experienced. I lost 3 hours of progress because the autosave feature didn't work and my game just randomly crashed. It's quite a relaxing game, but it's currently floor sweeper simulator more than anything. Employees are just stupid and need to be told what to do at all times otherwise they just stand around and take up my revenue. The amount of bugs I experienced was quite a bit. Let's list them off:

-Traffic build up in parking lot for no reason. NPCs would refuse to move forward causing a massive traffic jam and constant honking. I had to turn off the SFX in my game to mute the honking. Turns out the current way to fix this issue is to wipe the population off your lot by closing the shop. 
-Constant crashes 7 hours into the game. I was spam saving every 3 minutes out of fear I'd lose progress like that one time I was playing for 3 hours only for the game to crash and the auto-save feature to have suddenly stopped working.
-Autosave feature stopped working 7 hours into the game. I have to manually save now despite reaching checkpoints in my storyline.
-NPCs driving invisible cars into my shop and creating traffic in my store while also clipping through walls.
-Lock picking cars that are in your workshop doesn't work. It shows I am able to do it, but the minigame for lockpicking the car doesn't pop up. Not sure if that was supposed to be that way, but I'm guessing that it was not intended to be that way.
-Can't upgrade my gas station anymore. Won't give me the option to upgrade anything but the parking lot. Whenever I click the arrow to upgrade the toilet, gas pumps, or other things the bottom just says ""Parking"" without the option to actually buy/upgrade anything. 
-As of 09/19/21 (after an apparent update) my game no longer opens. I will get stuck in the loading screen for several minutes and it freezes up my windows. I can't alt+f4 the game. I can't ctrl+alt+del because the task manager stays behind the game window making it inaccessible. Super frustrated with this issue because it means I can't play it at all until it gets fixed or addressed. I'm not sure if the devs are aware of this issue. 

Overall I think the game is pretty good, but the bugs are making it impossible to play (literally). I say everyone planning on buying this should wait until they fix the bugs and the devs decrease the floor sweeping simulator by at least 70% because the constant sweeping is just RIDICULOUS.",1632057715,1686864108,True,0,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

No but barely -  I've enjoyed myself some, but there's a lot of elements that range from annoying to wtf.

For starters, the painting.  Seriously - I'm on day 15 and I've had to repaint the interior of my store twice already.  (The exterior gets painted more regularly on account of the child vandal who draws dicks on everything.  The painting is anti-fun.  It takes 15-20 minutes to fully paint the station and it starts deteriorating in another 20-30 mins after that it seems.  I'd like to paint the garage and the warehouse, but by the time I get done with all that I'd have to start over 

Things get way too dirty way too fast.  I can't go through an order of 10 items in the store without having to clean the belt twice.

Speaking of the belt and the convenience store, the physics is *way* off.  Like, I'll pick up an item to scan and the item behind it will sometimes go flying and I'll be penalized for that.  Working in the convenience store portion of the game is anti-fun, and is one of the jobs I 100% have an employee working whenever possible.

Employee AI is a bit off, especially if you have someone assigned to clean the store.  More often than not I find my janitor wondering around stuck against the door to the warehouse far away from his assigned duties.

Also, and I realize this is nitpicky, but the game doesn't really have a setting.  The distributor you order things from says it's in Arizona.  I just hired someone whose bio says they just moved to Texas.  To add to the confusion, the California Highway Patrol stops by all the time (seriously...to have so many cops crawling around it seems like I should have been caught breaking into my customers' trunks or maybe caught that little brat that keeps spray painting dicks on everything).  It's like, pick one, man.

The thing I enjoy most in the game is picking up the garbage.

First and foremost, it's bad.

I'm not sure who designed or playtested this but it feels like they played it to make sure it worked and didn't do much more to play the DLC to see if it was fun. 

I've completed the DLC to completion, i've upgraded everything. Here's my thoughts;

1. What's the point? Trading with these pilots makes sense early on when you need blueprints to upgrade the airport. But once the airport is fully upgrade there is no reason to trade with these planes, and apparently you can't just turn these planes away whenever. You need a skill, some upgrades let you turn them away more often but who cares? When i ignore these planes it only effects how likely they are to accept a worse trade, but for what? I don't want they're trading, like ever. It's an arbitrary system that does nothing for me and doesn't make any sense

2. Upgrading the airport looks nice, that's about it. I didn't see any benefit to upgrading the airport because I simply see no reason to interact with the trading system.

3. The old guy in the airplane is SO MUCH WORK for what...blueprints? I already get enough blueprints why do i need to rescue this idiot every time he visits. Not to mention the vehicle mechanics are the dumbest thing i've ever seen. Who has ever driven a tow truck that overheats when it goes more than 10 miles an hour? 

This dev just gets worse and worse, with all these DLC's and games they are trying to make they're forgetting one big thing. These games need to be fun.

Original game is still fine, but my review will turn negative until this dev learns to start stretching themselves so thin. It's a real shame.

Positives!
1. This game is perfectly balanced, it's fun and rewarding when you plan ahead and consider ROI (return on investment).
2. The story is fun and light, not too seriously but gets slightly stressful (in a fun way) in the sewer
3. this game is quirky and you can tell the devs had a fun time making this game
4. Everything has an animation (I.E. when you reset all cars and customers there's this whole animation and even that happens).

The bad
1. This game will crash, you wont lose much time but it's slightly frustrating.
2. The random events are not rewarding (except the party bus [Which drops FPS]), if the random events were rewarding I would keep them on. As of now they are just annoyances I keep off. (positive is that you can switch them off)
3. This game is not a BETA (early release) and there are game breaking bugs.

Suggestions?
1. Allow a setting to choose how often auto-save occurs
2. increase the range for customer and vehicle reset so that ALL vehicles get reset.

I'd still give this game 5 stars, I had SO MUCH FUN playing this game. I would 10/10 times recommend it to anyone who likes Simulator games. This is an A tier Sim game.

(Edit at 40+ Hours)
This game has gotten some really awesome updates to continue the grind. Main points?

ORIGINAL REVIEW:


Over 50 hours in this game but only about 10 hours worth of enjoyment in between all the game breaking bugs that never seem to get fixed. The main problem isn't the game itself but rather the dev team behind it. They are inexperienced, don't communicate well and they don't seem to know how to fix the bugs that they have claimed to have already fixed at least once. They even included a Reset Button in the game itself that your character can press if the AI gets itself all wrapped up in the environment, which it will. There's even an achievement for being launched into the air as if they couldn't figure out how to fix the physics so they just went with it. While it sounds funny it's not when it constantly happens to you while you're just trying to enjoy the game.

If you're willing to tolerate a ton of bugs, poor performance and two-bit developers then this is your game. I however can't recommend the game in it's current state. This is not an EA game. It was fully released 9 months ago and they still haven't fixed issues that have been present since day one even though they have already released a paid-for DLC with another in the pipeline. IMHO these are the types of games that you should avoid in order to send a message to developers that continue to think that it's ok to release buggy messes then proceed to ignore their community.

While I enjoyed some of the game play I would return this game in a heartbeat therefore I can't in good conscious recommend this to anyone. Instead, check out something like King of Retail or even Drug Dealer Simulator.",1656082605,1686500358,False,7,0,0.588654398918151855,2,True,False,False

So in what era is the game setting?
My guess is sometime after 2004, since there is a glimpse of a 2004 Harley-Davidson Softail.
But where is this gas station?
According to a fan wiki, it is set in the middle of the desert between Nevada and California. But here's the rub; there are a slew of Fiat 126's in the game, but this car was never introduced in the USA. Icing on the cake: the Fiat 126 is actually banned from driving on the road in the USA for being unsafe. So for my brain to be more immersed, I set it in Cuba since in Cuba has a lot of old classics still driving on the road...plus the Fiat 126. But there's another rub; Cuba has no deserts in terms of vastness as portrayed in the game nor that populated.

With the Devs now announcing a DLC that seems to add some things that should just be in the game, and apparently another game almost identical to this this one its starting to smell like a cash grab.

DRAGO Entertainment please finish the core game and make it smooth, fun, and less frustrating before trying to milk your customers. Work on the controls, the crashes, all the bugs with movable objects, the animations, the ability to throw things away without it being frustrating because it wont fit in the dumpster, the repetitive nature (no I do not want to repaint everything once a week for...reasons). If you fix and smooth out the base game and don't get all cash grabby I will change this review.

Thanks for responding to my review, that's pretty cool. I just played for several hours and its still a very early access game.

This and other technical issues don't entirely ruin the game, but kind of demotivate, stress and irritate us players.[/b]

[b](+)[/b] Very nice graphics (UE); cars and objects are beautiful and detailed;
[b](+)[/b] Broom is the most powerful tool in the History of videogames (I would dare to say);
[b](+)[/b] Be aware of overwhelming non-stop action at all times (if business open): run like a maniac all over the places, even with employees. However, I'm not sure if it's positive or not.

[b](-)[/b] UI could be better. Glitchy and funky menus: scrolling the cart shopping list sometimes does not work properly; if click faster 2x on Decorations > Landmarks options they got stuck; etc.
[b](-)[/b] Too tiny font size, specially on employee screen and there's no option to change it;
[b](-)[/b] Painting is the most rare, slow, dull and boring thing I ever see in simulation/renovation games;
[b](-)[/b] Airbrush tool is bugged to me: can't deselect it, can't select any other tool nor TAB works anymore;
[b](-)[/b] Car wash is terrible: game almost freeze when fire water gun with nozzle option; automatic feature sometimes does not work properly, requiring quit to main menu and load again (or simply do not use it);
[b](-)[/b] Some areas are dark as f*ck and light decorations ""may impact performance"" but do not illuminate anything (or too little);
[b](-)[/b] Can't access the toilets for renovation or find trash. I only found some trash later on with the vacuum;
[b](-)[/b] Warehouse upstairs is pretty much useless, can't put anything there; can't customize either warehouse or workshop, it's kinda of meh;

Edited:  But, they broke it.  Don't bother.

Edit #2:  Ok, I'll revise this review again, to say, yes.  Because, if it isn't a game breaking bug, talk to Dev Kiki.  He/She/They will work with you, if you work with them, to solve any problems you have, if they can.  And they do try.  I appreciate that enough to adjust my review, again.  
  So far I haven't run into any game-breaking bugs.  Just like Fallout 4, which I have almost 7 thousand hours of game play in, there are workarounds for most bugs in Gas Station Sim.  If you ask, someone usually has an answer, and a work around.  That may not be a solution or fix, but you can still play the game and have a good quality experience.

Let's get straight to the point, I'll just say some things that ruined the game for me.

- Game is unbalanced, this is a MAJOR issue. When I bought the game I thought let's just chill and put some gas and stuff, but no. I could literally write a whole essay about this. You CANNOT relax in this game. It IS (BARELY) possible to manage the tasks and the customers but you will be always anxious running here and there.

- The airstrip DLC. What is this? a parallel whole business to manage even tho you can't manage the gas station? This is an absolute mess, nice concept but TERRIBLE execution. If you want to focus on the Gas station you are forced to JUST IGNORE the Airstrip AND VICE VERSA. Every time that old dude pays you a visit he ALWAYS crash his airplane and you have to go like an idiot and close down the station and pick him up with some junk ahh tow truck and don't even get paid. This DLC is TERRIBLE. You don't even have the time (in-game) to check it out. Or forget the gas station while you are at the airstrip.

- Trash. 1 customer is enough to make a mess in your store. Customers throw litter on the floor and if they throw it in the trash can it goes halfway full BY 1 CUSTOMER, so not only you have to run here and there to service customers but every 2 minutes you have to empty the friggin trash cans so they don't give you a thumbs down for stinkyness. SUPER annoying and unrealistic. 

- Gameplay. Little things here and there make it even harder to enjoy this game. Having to manage every employee. Who's resting, who's working, who need payment, who's gonna clean, fuel, fix cars, cash register etc. and all these while customers are waiting. This whole system needs to be rewrote and make management easier. Also the total number of 5 employees are not even close to enough if you thought about going to check the airstrip or chill a bit and decorate or something. If their work time is over and they have to rest that's it. You have to handle the whole business by yourself. Also you are the ONLY one who have to buy stock, restock shelves, buy stock for the garage, restock garage shelves, get the delivery from the truck and put it in the warehouse that the driver couldn't do, order fuel, go open some valve when the truck arrives like the driver couldn't do either. clean garbage buy upgrades get the bulldozer and clean, go refill it every half a minute cuz it rans out of fuel and much more stuff. It's nice for a game to keep you busy but this is unbearable. Really annoying that ALL these responsibilities are yours and only. Employees should AT LEAST order stuff that are out of stock and restock shelves, mabye manage some other things here and there.

- Lack of upgrades. Your station reaches level 6 or 7 and that's it. Tasks are over, your grinding is over and now you just run what you made. It took me 9 hours to reach the maximum upgrades of the game. Should have more stuff and more upgrades to make your business run better and without all this running from you.  

- Storage, Warehouse seems like a big building. But the storage capacity is SUPER LOW and all the time you have to buy stuff get the delivery and restock while all your employees might be resting. Gasoline. You start with like what? 300L? What gas station on earth has so little gasoline capacity? Yes you can upgrade it but it's not much. Super unrealistic and another reason to be anxious. And for god shake make the driver open that valve and do his job and also the warehouse delivery driver to do the same! 

CONCLUSION:

Although the game has nice features and tons of stuff, it doesn't feel to be complete. Some games on early access are much more enjoyable and fulfilling. This feels like it's made for you to just throw your money away, with the Airstrip DLC you become SURE about this feeling. I really like the concept, but I did not enjoy the game at all because it didn't let me. It's a shame because a lot of work have been done in this and I really liked the environment. I'm dissapointed, bad work, SUPER unbalanced. I wish I could refund it and get my money back.

Unfortunately my tl;dr is still entirely correct. The car wash quest feels like the developers apologizing for forgetting to put some video game in their video game. You feed trash to a chubby alligator, creating one more manual task only the player can do until they time-sink enough progress to automate it. Then you settle into the grind. Some quality-of-life improvements have made the game less jank, but it's still jank. I was genuinely in the mood to play today and settled in for a multi-hour session while listening to podcasts. It has crashed three times in an hour. 

DOUBLE UPDATE: if the car wash DLC was an apology for forgetting to put 'game' into the game, the Party Time DLC is an apology for not balancing the popularity system, making the last few achievements require over a dozen hours of grinding just to get popularity points. Also: you basically have to go into your settings and manually turn off all the ""fun"" add-ons they tacked on over the past year. My first time back in the game since 2022, it looked like a bad Gmod map. Every customer had Christmas hats on. The ghost of Elvis playing royalty-free butt rock floated around my gas station. Santa flew over never night. There's a gaudy UFO eternally hovering over the ""party"" area. 

It feels like DRAGO left a bunch of empty space open with the idea they would add more stuff later, but then had no real vision for what to do with said open space, so they made a habit of putting the first thing that'd come to mind there. Giant dauchsund-snake in the hills? Sure. $60,000 giant rocking chair that has no effect on traffic increase? Sure. Dinosaur tourist trap you can't even walk over to? Why not. The game just starts to look actively tackier, and that's saying a LOT about a game that has MULTIPLE Elon Musk NPCs walking around. 

On to the original review: 

Gas Station Simulator is secretly an Early Access title that was released as a full game. The fact that there have had to be such drastic updates and balancing tweaks done within days of the first drop should be a big red flag. They also seem to be prioritizing fixing content visible to the people playing in the first couple hours (e.g. streamers, YouTubers, and not-simulator-savvy journalists parachuting in for a look but not committing to a full game). The biggest example so far is them claiming to have fixed terrain clipping through the gas station floor. DRAGO did indeed fix that, but only the piece of terrain visible through the floor if you haven't spent a few hours upgrading the station. As of this review there's still a jagged polygon of ground poking through the floor in an area only accessible after two upgrades (where people who can still refund the game likely won't see). 

tl;dr: while this has far more polish than most shovelware ""simulator"" games, this is, at the end of the day, one of those shovelware titles cobbled together from mechanics and ideas seen in other titles by the same developer/publishing company. 

The fact DRAGO, a tiny little Polish developer, will release six ""simulator"" games in the next year should be evidence this isn't the fun wacky sim game you heard about on Kotaku. The only people who'll be genuinely entertained by this haven't tried out simulator games since Playway started flooding the market with House Flipper clones.

Developed by DRAGO Entertainment, this intriguing simulator offers players the chance to experience the ins and outs of running their very own gas station.

Gameplay:
Gas Station Simulator delivers an experience that is as quirky as it is immersive. You begin with a dilapidated gas station in the middle of a desert, and it is up to you to bring it back to life. From refueling cars and repairing engines to restocking shelves and cleaning restrooms, the game challenges you to manage multiple tasks while continually expanding and improving your station. Its in-depth management mechanics and the variety of tasks keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Audio and Music:
The sound design in Gas Station Simulator is surprisingly detailed. From the clinking of cash registers and the hum of car engines to the chit-chat of customers, the game effectively recreates the bustling environment of a busy gas station. The soundtrack, while not particularly memorable, serves as a pleasant background that doesn’t intrude on the gameplay.

Story:
While Gas Station Simulator lacks a formal storyline, the game does an excellent job of storytelling through gameplay. Your progression serves as your narrative as you turn a run-down gas station into a thriving business, creating a satisfying sense of achievement.

Difficulty:
The difficulty in Gas Station Simulator lies in the juggling of tasks and keeping your customers happy. As your station grows, so does the complexity of your responsibilities. The game also features a day-night cycle and random events which can add unexpected challenges.

Price:
Considering the depth of gameplay and the amount of content, Gas Station Simulator is priced reasonably. It offers good value for money, particularly for fans of simulation games.

Critique:
While Gas Station Simulator offers an engaging experience, it isn't without flaws. The game could benefit from more diverse customer interactions and tasks. Additionally, some players might find the early game a bit slow before the gas station starts to expand.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Gas Station Simulator is a quirky and immersive simulator that successfully makes the ordinary task of running a gas station fun and engaging. It offers an in-depth management system and a variety of tasks that ensure the gameplay remains fresh. Although it has room for improvement, the overall experience is a satisfying and enjoyable one. So, roll up your sleeves, grab that fuel pump, and get ready to jump into the extraordinary world of ordinary life with Gas Station Simulator.",1684590460,1684590460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's always something to do at the Gas Station! Very addictive gameplay, quirky atmosphere, and has a bit of everything most simulator games have: maintenance, employee management, running a shop, customizing your spot, and multiple things you gotta keep an eye on.

Review 2 years later (I think):
This game is so addictive.. the DLC compliments things nicely, and there's different games coming out soon that will expand more, like a Motel and Food Truck.

I played this game after seeing it advertised and watching a youtuber 100% it closer to when it launched.  It is an oddly addictive game and if you just play it to enjoy it, it is quite fun. I love how over the top the cut scenes are and it makes some of the early on grinding worth it. Also how the game just throws achievements at you for the first five or so hours of this game is fun as well. It is fairly realistic as you have to spend money to make money, sometimes with very little profit margin, rather than some simulators where after a certain point you are just endlessly making money. The AI pathing and things like that could be slightly improved however it is still a fun game and looks surprising well graphically for what it is. Decorating is super fun and I love the interactive decorations, it just sucks most of them serve no real purpose and just halt your progress. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a fairly mindless little game to play and have fun with. 

In all my reviews on games that I 100% I will mention whether I recommend this 100% or not. If you are looking for a grindy simulator achievement, this is the one for you. It is not as grindy as it used to be with the free party time DLC (before that people were grinding well over 100+ hours for level 10 popularity). Depending on how you go about it, it should take you 20-40 hours to complete, and most of that will be grinding the popularity levels, grinding one of your employees to level 10 in all skills, and paying off uncles loan.  Most other achievements are just thrown at you for completing certain tasks and buying upgrades.",1684170197,1684170197,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

The micromanagement of every little thing (paying employees, ordering goods for four different sections of the station, assigning employees every single time to the job I always have them do, having to turn on and off the sections of the station based on the reset time of the individual employees, making sure there's enough available water for the car wash), 2. The performance of the game is... mediocre at best. You can tell it struggles. 3. The have all these little elements to the station (mini golf course, monolith, remote control race cars) but none of them have any actual purpose beyond little Easter egg add-ins. 4. You have this loft thing that get bigger as you unlock larger warehouse space but you can't do anything with it. 

Am I saying that I want the game to manage everything for me? No. But seriously, the game becomes a chore at a certain point. Employees should have shifts, they should have assigned tasks, goods should be ordered automatically (at least to a certain extent), I shouldn't have to keep shredding trash to make sure there's enough water for the automatic car wash, I shouldn't have to turn on or off portions of the station, it should be based on whether or not an employee is working there.

They added DLC and it kind of sucks. The only one that really matters is the party one, but its weird. There's a countdown and a bus pulls up with people and they rock out then leave. The popularity of the party is based on baskets that you fill with random items. If that confused you then you are not alone. I have no idea what they were thinking. 

The game, as is, entertains you for about three hours before you start getting bored with having to manage everything. Obviously it's about managing a gas station but elements of the management should advance and some of the little tasks should be automated in the end game. If they made it that employees were paid and given a schedule then this game would easily be great.",1645221507,1684121235,False,1,0,0.516728579998016357,0,True,False,False

- delivery vehicles freeze meaning i cant get fuel or trash removed which also means you have to start a new game
- customers freeze at fuel stations so i can't refuel them 
- objects being flung every where when i throw them
- objects clipping through bins and walls

one more thing:

- the animation of customers can be really annoying they look like the game was rushed and they just keep clipping into each other

This game here is sort of fun, still a lot of bugs, but playable. Instead of fixing the games already out, they plan on building a whole universe here, which isn't bad if you would listen to your community and care about your games and that sadly isn't the case. They dump out announcements with false promises, start developing a series of other games while the games already out, are still lacking a lot of care and love.

And to top it all off, now you have to buy two more games to get new features for existing games like 'memorable customers' which should be part of the core game, since there isn't anything memorable here except that annoying Dennis. We are not even talking about a DLC, but an entire new game, probably also riddled with paid DLCs.
Plus there will be penalties for certain aspects of the entire universe those games are taking place, which already sounds like they were rushed out the door. For instance: In Gas Station Simulator you get the objective to break into your customers car trunks as a side hustle which is non optional. Also there are challenges you have to do in order to increase your fame which is breaking into trunks. (Fame is needed in order to get more customers into you gas station and to progress further in the game)
Now they want to penalize it in their other games, losing customers in the motel or dinner.

So much to do, fun challenges, fun in general and it's easy to understand.

The only thing that needs fixing is the AI behavior. 

For example: I have encountered cars that was flipped over and caused a big traffic jam. I know that there is a reset button in the warehouse, and that you can flip over cars with your broom. But still...

And another example is that when you put a shelf in the open, the AI can get stuck in the shelf and you need to redecorate. Which is a bit frustrating.

Conclusion: As I said, I really like this game, but the AI needs some fixing.

-it's scuffed as fvck
-full of bugs, I mean you get stuck on literally anything, NPCs get stuck, cars get stuck, hitting an item on the ground at an angle, sends them at MACH 5 speed in the atmosphere.
-at the release of airstrip DLC, all my in-game achievements got reset and I got bombarded with notifications the whole game. 
-the game is incredibly badly optimised. It goes from 60 to 200 fps constantly.
-why bother adding decorations? If you place 20-30 decorations on your fully upgraded gas station, the game is barely playable.
-after mid-game (popularity 6-7) the game gets kind of grindy. You really need to put in those hours to afford things. Even though it's kind of stupid, as having employees and automation for some modules should mean an easier experience, but no.
-the mini-game with RC Car describes perfectly the state of the game. Try going through both courses without losing your minds, I dare you!

And the cleaning person is annoying when they stand around and do nothing while the station is getting dirtier. The cleaner can also soft lock when you tell them to go on break they refuse and they will still be ""cleaning"" and will never go on break even when their stamina is zero. 

I can't recommend the DLCs either as they really don't do much for the game. The only DLC worth getting is the Party Time which is free.

The inputs on controller randomly stop working, and you have to save and reload to fix it (though this doesn't always work). Some minigame elements do not work with controller, causing you to fail if you do not have use of a keyboard and mouse, and even then, keyboard and mouse is not reliable and can randomly stop working, too. At gas station level 3, the game railroads you into completing DLC missions, which has elements that are unbound to the controller and cannot be bound via the options. The DLC is even buggier than the main game. Even if you disable, uninstall, or do not own the DLC, the game prompts you to complete it, breaking the game and preventing progress.

This sense of drudgery has no shortcut, either, despite a ""loan shark"" mechanic. Which I didn't appreciate being forcibly introduced to. You don't have a choice: your first loan is imposed on you, impossible to pay back in time, and ends with a fairly vicious, unavoidable beatdown. But even if you go ahead and take out the biggest loan you can after that, you're only slightly accelerating your ability to make more money than you spend on the business. It's really only useful for the occasional emergency bailout, so I ended up avoiding it entirely.

Another annoying mechanic is the kid who will periodically come around to deface the place.  Welcome to a new layer of pointless drudgework, which serves only to interrupt the actually useful drudgework. You're supposed to hit them with a random object, usually a bag of garbage or something, so he runs away. Well, he doesn't. He just goes to the next target point to keep on defacing, so you have to hit him multiple times with garbage that will bounce FAR away after you hit him with it. You are NOT allowed to just use the damn broom that you use to sweep the floor and which is on you at all times, for no apparent reason. All of this means that you will end up re-painting your station quite a bit - oh, and that's also a boring, shallow minigame about keeping a marker ""in the green"" (supposedly representing paint roller pressure).

I think what decided me against playing this any further was that when it came time to make improvements to the grounds, there was zero choice involved. I could buy, or not buy, the single improvement for a given area, like ""tombstone car displays"" and palm trees. The big lovely sign out front? You don't even say yea or nay; the game AUTOMATICALLY renovates that for you, like it or not.

After six hours of gameplay, this just seems like a chore, with no indication of a breakout point where it starts being fun (or at least open-ended). If I'm going to take on what amounts to an actual job of pumping gas, scanning groceries, and slinging tires, then I at least want a SEMBLANCE of creative freedom regarding the place I bought expressly to renovate.",1682909835,1682909835,False,3,0,0.544827580451965332,0,True,False,False

If you've played Weed Shop, you'll have this game down within a few minutes, however, the more you play, the more you notice features missing. Yes, you grind your way to automation and employees, but damn, you have to micro manage every little aspect! More automation please!

A warning for new players. The AI in this game is dumb and you cannot schedule shifts. Each time someone finishes a shift you'll be dipping into the PC to find someone who's not resting. You'll also have to chase the cleaner around as they are  more than useless, even detrimental. If you're not already fed up of cleaning up after the cleaner, your shop will be sprayed with 'NASA rockets' by the local kid, which adds nothing to the game... and when you've really had enough, a sandstorm blows through every 60ish minutes and all the cars get stuck... In a buggy, non comical way!! How do you fix it? Using a awful skid steer that has enough fuel to last 2 minutes. You'll be spending most of your time pushing cars out of the way with your broom, to hit the pile 'Just right' to get the button to scoop said sand pile.

The game is good... It could be up their with Weed Shop, if only the devs added quality of life features, like scheduling, more employees, automatic product purchasing, a warehouse employee to unload the truck, automatic shelf stacking... and got rid of stupid things like clearing up after spray paint, sand storms, and having to dip into the sewer to feed the alligator every 30 minutes. The devs think it's a 'fun way' to slow you down. It's not fun, it's repetitive and annoying.

I understand why they added these 'annoying' features. I get they are there to slow the player down. But, it's only take me 15 hours to complete the game. That's it, 15 hours... done. Is there more content? Yes. Is it DLCs? Yes. Should it be base game content? Absolutely!

If you get this game on offer, it's worth it. If you're looking for a game that kills a weekend, this game is for you. If you want a game that you can happily manage, semi-AFK while watching TV... This is not the game for you. What you need, is Weed Shop.

Devs, stop trying to 'slow us down' by adding annoying features. Give us automation and remove the astonishingly 'over 
tuned' brutal and repetitive tasks. The whole point in a business simulator is eventually being the boss and watching your employees work while you adjust the plant pot in your office!",1682895474,1682895474,False,4,0,0.546498715877532959,0,True,False,False

There are several little mini games to complete tasks such as Checking Out customers, Filling cars with Gas, or maintaining the Mechanic shop.
The Car Wash I would say is the least mini game of it all, as you're free to tackle the dirt in any way you like however it does feel reminiscent of Power wash Sim but a clunky attempt.

To max out the gas station it does feel a little bit grindy, the good part to this is most of the way to the max level, you have goals to complete or story missions to complete, so it doesn't feel totally tedious but it's there.

Not all is perfect in this game, it can get a little buggy.
Sandstorms should be optional in gameplay settings as it is an annoying mechanic, creating sand piles which can lead to cars getting bugged out. Luckily there is a reset functionality incase NPC's get bugged out 
(kinda ridiculous changes couldn't have been made to negate the button entirely but oh well, ai will bug and you'll use the button eventually, its a norm for gameplay too)

On a 5800x 3070 ti with 32gb of ram I barely average 60 fps, optimization is still quite bad but it is playable.

Overall though, the slight bugs aside, its a fun game. Not as much of a Simulator as other Simulators go, as many strive for a more realistic approach, I would say this game is a bit cartoony and doesn't take itself too seriously while also giving you things like Employees, inventory management, product management as well as fluctuating prices for said product.

Was just walking in place by the drivers door and wouldn't do anything.  So just like my previous review I have to stick with this game is a cash grab bug and I can't recommend it.

That's just 10-15 minutes into the game and already I couldn't progress again.




[ORIGINAL REVIEW]

Game is just a cheaply done money grab.  Game crashes constantly and since it barely autosaves you constantly have to restart progress from way back.  You constantly just run around doing the same tedious thing over and over and over just for a little bit of money which you then lose instantly trying to keep stock up.

If find it on sale it may be worth checking out, just be sure you manually save often, but don't buy for a full price or you will be bored quick and wish you had your money to spend on a game that has more fun to it than just a couple hours.",1632077542,1682731283,False,3,0,0.475353360176086426,0,True,False,False

Gameplay could use some smoothing over too, the station needs cleaning too often and it becomes more annoying than fun.

Update:
As of April 28, 2023, I've booted it up again and managed to play for an extended amount of time without any mishaps. 

Further thoughts about the game:

1. With the new DLCs, I still find myself being stretched thin trying to keep everything stocked, dealing with traders, and generally keeping things running, even with hired workers.

2. There seems to be a lack of ceiling lighting options. The station gets very dim at night and it's not easy to see things.

3. I think there is some confusion over the final negotiating card in the air strip dlc and how to unlock it. I've finished the upgrades for the barn, but I have yet to unlock this card.

Overall, it's gotten better than the last time I've played, and I hope it will only keep improving.",1642171969,1682627097,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

EIther the DEVs cannot fix bugs, they're too lazy too fix them, or they think we're too stupid to care. None of which are good. So no, save your money and grab Planet Crafter instead.

Edit: Don't buy into the BS posted as a comment from one of the devs. They've fixed nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch.

-Funny car flips with the mop.
-Easy access to close all parts of the station with numerous ways to make money.
-Having staff to help increase profits without running around crazily.
-Achievements and leveling for the gas station as well as the other businesses such as the car wash and the workshop. 
-Party bus is great, as well as the party spot. Party spot helps increase popularity pretty fast.

Meh:
-Dust storms make it annoying to get rid of sand piles to avoid traffic buildups, though it does give challenge.
-Gas tank storage is in the way of shop customer traffic and causes lots of horns when getting gas delivered.
-Repetition of customers, understandably but still sad.
-Staff suck at cleaning the shop and bathrooms, take forever to do so, and do not seem to empty trash which irritates customers.
-Staff also do not help increase popularity which is fair but would be nice if you had all working and it increased because you had all rather than it more likely decreasing popularity.

I've only been playing for a few hours and I've encountered several game-breaking bugs including being unable to level up my gas station (the button does nothing when clicked), being unable to unscrew tires and stuck in the repair animation even after ""resetting character,"" being unable to clean the conveyor belt, dirt piling up inside of the terrain which impacts cleanliness, and more. On top of all of this the game has absolutely abysmal controller support and sometimes the game will give tutorials with half in controller support and half in keyboard support on the same window. This game feels like alpha phase. The devs pushed this game out knowing that it was incomplete. This is the second worst controller support I've ever experienced in a game with controller support.

Okay so it's been 2 years now I think, figured I will take a look at the game again since they released a DLC for it.
It's so ugly...so so ugly. I have a feeling it made things even worse then it was before. And just for a bizarre comparison, picture playing Cyberpunk 2077 on 720p with FSR/DLSS on UltraPerformance... that is how bad the game looks with everything on highest quality. The textures look horrible and there is out of this world POP-IN.

Bugs bugs bugs everywhere, first 5 minutes of the game and by my count I have encountered 8 bugs already by NOT even looking for them. I have a feeling that they have just decided to start working on other titles and DLC's without looking at the game and it's code at all.

After doing some investigating it turns out this has been a problem with the game for some time. Pretty big problem!

What you lack in story, you gain in mystery as you walk around and find random things that are part of the game.  I like this game for the same reason I like House Flipper: simplicity.  You run a gas station in a part of the US I'm very familiar with: outside of Vegas.  Although still glitchy and not everything is customizable, enough of it is to warrant the price.  Try this game if you like other simulations that aren't too complicated to enjoy, and yet could benefit from a spreadsheet on your second monitor.

A major con that can be fixed, is how often my game crashes.  I don't have a slow rig, and take great pride in my computer's ability to play very large games (think Sims 4 including all expansions) very well.

- Lots of stuff to do,
- Lots of customization (like paints, decorations, tile, etc.), so you can really make your station your own.
- A good bit of humor. 

But, there are some in game issues....

1. Until you hire some help, you'll literally be doing EVERYTHING at this place. It can be overwhelming;  Pumping gas, tending the register, keeping up inventory, cleaning up the place/picking up trash, general maintenance (sometimes offsite a bit), ordering merchandise and fuel, washing cars, fixing cars, running vandals off the property, unloading trucks, etc. etc.

2. Graphics are a bit dated, but it is an indie game, after all.

3. Unfortunately, there are some minor bugs. Nothing super bad, just mildly annoying. For example, every once in a while, you'll get out of a menu, and suddenly your field of vision will get stuck at crotch level and you can't fix it until you reload the game. Sometimes, employees that work the register will just stop working and stand there doing nothing. I once got stuck in a dumpster for a few seconds, too.

With car horn set to ""off"" they still honked constantly. One of my hired employee's went missing and when I tried to tell her to do a different job from the in store PC she told me she was busy and couldn't do that. Eventually during my second play session I had a CTD. While not a terrible experience, I still can't recommend this game.

Not a terrible game but it has enough bugs to get frustrating. Half the time i try to pick up trash it says it's in my hand and I can throw it but it's still sitting on the floor where I tried to pick it up. Once you do throw it, you can't switch to a different tool such as the broom until the game is done telling you how far you threw the trash.

I played on another steam account on my old pc; i7 7700 cpu/ GTX 1080TI gpu with 16g RAM. The game constantly experienced framerate issues, especially late game. I ended up writing a review at the time and even went to the GSS discord server to try to see what was going on- that was 2 years ago. I ended up buying a new pc; an i9 13900kf cpu, 4070TI gpu, Asus z790p motherboard, 32g Titan RAM, all on a firecuda ssd (8g read/write) 

I say all this to inform you all that even with the top of the line pc, it really doesn't matter. The game still experiences frame rate issues, it constantly crashes whenever you get gas services going while having more than 2 parking lots(too many cars jam and just crashes the game), the game informs you too many lights will crash the game, cars get stuck on everything from the smallest pebble to the NPC that drives it. Sometimes car tires get stuck on the fuel pumps so you have to go to the warehouse to ""UFO"" the entire map away then wait 4 minutes just to have a decent amount of things to do again, just for the game to crash 10 minutes later.

 Its a fun game, don't get me wrong- but the aspect of doing chores for a game then it crashing and deleting the last 15 minutes of progress every time sends me the wrong message- especially when the game is considered ""Finished/complete"" with an absurd amount of game breaking glitches. I usually don't write reviews, but people need to know what they're in for. 

You have about 2-4 hours of fun game play before the entire game shits out its own ass. I give this game 4/10, buy it on sale for probably $5.

Now...the bugs...lot's of issues that need to be resolved.

The potential is there, the Dev's need to take a step back and look at the reality of the situation before they lose the chance to really have a gem that is quickly becoming tarnished and devalued by the gaming community.

Releasing a DLC for the game that really should just be part of the base game has angered many folks and is seen as a straight up money grab. Fix the bugs BEFORE you look to hit our wallets again.

I really hope these folks turn this around and I will be watching as will my twitch community and I will re-evaluate the review at a later date. If No Man's Sky can do it, so can you folks...pull your heads out of the clouds here and really look at what is happening before it is too late.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ok after coming back to this game to see if anything had been fixed and if the dev's listened to me and the rest of the community ... I am saddened to say...not much in the way of fixes....

Issues in just first couple hours of a new game:

boards cant be turned when taking off windows because they somehow end up behind the window after you peel them off the front, then you cant turn objects too which need throwing away to get through the doors

the garbage guy will collect garbage and do animation as if bending down to tie a bag but there is no bag. 

The people when you over fill say ""its worse then before"" makes no sense

single person in cop car ""i was worried we'd stranded!"" ...who is we??

so many cop cars, lets get more variety in vehicles/people...

the awning over pumps can paint the roof but not underside

person at cash register: ""I was worried we would be stranded!"" I mean what?? by ...not getting your order done at the register...? come on

part of hose is missing when connecting to refueling truck and main tank, the end of hose connecting to truck has a section right at trucks connection that is invisible/missing

car leaving seem to float above the ground driving off

Objects fall through floor

Objects in mechanic garage like the mirrors fall when you first grab 1 to put in hand to fix car with have to grab off floor then before going to fix car...

These are all simple things to fix and should be fixed by now before any DLC was introduced let alone another coming down the line.

Add some more variety in people, vehicles coming to gas station in early stages for example, add new voice lines pls for the love of gamers everywhere...pls!

Putting things in the garbage bins around the property is a pain to say the least to get them into the bins when big awkward pieces, this still feels like it should be an early access game here.....

Do NOT buy unless you getting this for a hell of a cheap price in its current state.

If things change I will adjust my posting....has a lot of potential that is being wasted sadly by the devs wanting to make $$$ by expanding their library of titles connecting them to this main one but not getting this one right first, just look at their latest offering, food truck simulator to see they have learned no lessons here at all, what a mess that one was and is...should have been released as early access both and stayed in early access till in much better shape, you would have had a much kinder review and response from me but also many others.

Sept. 15 2022
=======================
April 7 2023

Not sure why the devs reached out to me for another look at the game beyond some minor changes it still has many glaring issues. I have to ask if they sat down and played the game themselves? Right off the bat you have issues staring you in the face.

People have their heads clipping through roofs

You can not rotate items to get them through doors easily

You can not paint the underside of the awning for the gas pumps

Glowing green dirt trails are really needing to be removed and gone back to original setup when using broom, there was no need to add this unsightly additional change.

People do a weird leg kick with both feet as they open their doors and get set to depart

Gas delivery hose connection at truck still has invisible section and looks janky as all hell

The people put their legs through the seats as they go to sit down to drive off

The vehicles start moving away from pumps and a couple seconds later the engine sounds are heard

People grab from the top shelf only 1 time then head to register, I had nothing on my top shelf and yet they showed up with many items to buy...

The bull dozer is janky and awkward to turn beyond what you would expect


This just in the first hour of playing not even getting to the warehouse I just had quest pop up for when I called it for the night on the game. Gotta say I am disappointed here, really am. You did some optimization passes I can tell, GREAT!! How ever, so many other glaring issues...why were all these left unfixed and then you reach out to me as if its a polished golden apple?

This game had such an amazing concept and possible future to it and a ""series"" but the devs got carried away with making all these spin offs and left this behind in the dust with so many problems never addressed. <shakes his head in sadness>

Look again folks at the mess you left here and really fix the glaring issues...Unless the devs reach out personally to me to ask for help in a deep dive into all the issues in order to fix them with some compensation, I am not going back to this one, I am just really saddened to see it still in such a shape.

Awful. The game is absolutely terrible. I wasted a lot of time trying to overcome stupid and grindy tasks, bugged AI, bugged minigames, bugged basic mechanics, badly designed features and mechanics. I've really tried to find anything fun beyond all this terrible things. And I didn't. Don't repeat my mistake - do not waste your time on this hideous game.


Old review (18 March, 2022)

This is a very badly designed game with lots of bugs. It won't be fun or interesing. You will feel absolutely tired after playing this game. There are lots of chores you have to do. All the time. Workers help is insignificant. Traffic is very high. It's always a rush. This game is filled with badly designed minigames which require no skill, present no progress, and filled with bugs. It's a chore not a game.",1647621527,1680898341,False,3,0,0.442348003387451172,0,True,False,False

The game mechanics are very realistic and players must be careful when planning their business. They will have to keep track of their expenses and sales, manage their employees and make sure their customers feel comfortable. Players can also invest in new equipment, such as fast charging stations and car cosmetics, which will help them improve the customer experience and increase their profits.

The game's graphics are great, with detailed vehicle models and environments that look very realistic. The controls are fairly simple and intuitive, so players can easily get into the game and start having fun.

The game also offers many challenges and tasks to keep players engaged in the game, although some of them can be quite difficult. However, this just adds another dimension to the game and increases its play value.

Overall, Gas Station Simulator is a great choice for those looking for a realistic and fun business simulation. With a large selection of equipment, realistic graphics and many challenges, this game will provide many hours of fun and business success.",1637787332,1680876839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's been my go-to game for a few weeks now when I just want to focus on a task and be rewarded with incremental progression. It is a buggy mess at times, but hilariously the devs included tools to help you combat this, including a broom that can flip cars, or a ufo switch that resets all cars and npc on the map. The decorating is fun without being too time intensive. The devs were even nice enough to give you the option to turn off a really annoying part of the game if you don't want to deal with it. There's a lot hiding under the skin of this game too. There's little mini-games everywhere, you can play guitar, race rc cars, or just try to set high scores by lobbing trash across the map. It really is a great game to help you zone out and just chill. Do recommend. I was pleasantly surprised at how often I think about playing this game.

Not so much a gas station simulator, more a collection of mini games with a gas station theme. And that's fine - there's plenty to keep you busy, plenty of customisation available and a few simple management style mechanics such as keeping stock levels and buying at optimum prices. It'll need a bit more content before full release - there's not much to do or look forward to from Level 6 onwards aside from grinding the same stuff you've been grinding before but this time with nothing new to look forward to as a reward.

At this price point, there was really nothing to criticize, so I gave it a positive review, hoping that the developers would continue to update and improve the game.

However, despite the game's terrible optimization, the developers chose to release paid DLC instead of fixing the bugs in the base game. Signs of their lack of enthusiasm for the game were evident, as the game would only run at 30fps with a 3070Ti graphics card, and there were frequent lag spikes. It seemed that they were either selling a barely functional game just to make money or simply ignoring the game altogether. When they released several DLCs without addressing the game's performance issues, I changed my review to a negative one, so that other players could be aware of these problems before buying.

Unexpectedly, in 2023, the developers replied to my review, asking me to try the game again and explaining that they had made improvements. With a little bit of trust, I gave the game another chance and found that it had indeed been significantly optimized, with some quality-of-life improvements as well. Overall, I think the game is pretty good.

My advice to the developers is to take your game seriously, as that's the only way to achieve long-term success. Players are smart and discerning, and those who love your game are more than willing to support you.

I looked through the release notes since I last played and nothing meaningful was added except DLC as far as I can tell.  But I played through the game anyway, which is still buggy and borderline unplayable.  I had to reset my character twice and the world a handful of times.  I hit a bug bad enough that upon reloading the game, it crashes.

This game has such potential, but it is still in beta as far as I can tell.  They are now adding DLC to a broken game.  I don't recommend picking this up unless you want to do some quality verification for the developer.",1670698114,1680131515,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

Game play is very laggy, at best. Also, there is this very annoying question mark on anything I look at...it just floats there, and I cannot click on it or remove it or anything. Still stuck on moving sand piles ad nauseam. I REALLY wanted to like this game. I REALLY wish I could get a refund, as I will never play it. 
**********************************************************************************************************

I bought this game after playing and enjoying the demo. I should have realized that there is a reason you cannot use the front loader, ""Rudy"" in the demo.
The ONLY thing this game is letting me do is removing sand piles after sand piles, driving them somewhere else, and then driving back to the gas station, to fill up with gas, and then rinse repeat. I cannot do anything else on this game but this. Other than that, the game crashing at least twice before it will start. 

IF you want to buy this game, based on the demo, buyer beware. It only lets you play the fun parts of the game, but not of the endless sand pile removal requirement. 

At this point, I cannot recommend this game at all. In fact, I've requested a refund, even though it's been past 2 weeks.",1665687618,1680130930,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a sweep the floor-game. A limit on number of employees (also they're inefficient and need constant assignment and reassignment) makes it so that you can forget about being business smart. No. Just work work work work work.

Edit: DON'T BUY THE GAME. In light of comment by developer, that didn't really answer my comments, I skimmed through the news of the game and found nothing that adressed my initial complaints. But I did see a lot of marketing, and suspect that the devs also use comments as marketing. They try to make my review look old, butit is not. I won't be bothered testing the game again until it's made likely to have been drastically changed.",1655930922,1680097440,False,7,0,0.580813586711883545,1,True,False,False

-----------------------------------------------

Reviewed this late last year and was quite disappointed by the performance but after being informed by a developer that performance has been improved I thought I'd give it another go and thankfully, the performance is much improved. There are still times when it will struggle but overall it's been improved to a point where I can change my review from Not Recommended to Recommended.

A common phrase I've heard about people who play this game is ""It has no right being this fun"" and I have to agree, you'd think working in a gas station in the middle of the desert to be quite boring but Gas Station Simulator is quite the opposite and is incredibly enjoyable",1665333046,1680004168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spark Plugs are labelled inconsistently in the Delivery Screen and also are awkward to pick up from their holder.

There's no snap to grid/wall function and it's way too easy to accidentally pick up things, even worse there is no cancel/undo function. 

Workers don't remember what they did before going on a break and don't have a task queue system so if you want them to stop serving a customer on the cash register, you have to spam press it until they actually finish the current customer. 

Scrolling on the delivery order menu is bugged so if you need to scroll down to remove something, good luck. On that note actually, why does it need to be a pop up window? Why can't the order menu have both products and the current basket on the same screen, there's definitely enough screen space to do so.

Pathing is also bugged so if you have a larger shop and place ice cream freezers in the middle, the customers will get stuck on them and can't path around them. 

Picking up items is awkward as sometimes they won't actually move, or you can't rotate larger items to get them through a door. 

Also the garage aspect is extremely frustrating, why on earth does practically every car need 2-3 tyres replaced at the same time? There was even a run where I had multiple cars needing all 4 tyres replaced. Keeping up with inventory for this part of the game is an absolute nightmare. 

It's such a shame as there is a good game buried in this but it really needs a lot more polish but it doesn't seem like they will do it.

And even when the game did run somewhat smoothly, the gameplay was boring and repetitive, with no real challenge or depth.

I like the concept, and the graphics and concept are really well done.  It catches me the same way Civilfixation does -- I just want to keep going for that one little goal more, and I like the organization and the challenge.  I do wish there was some kind of a short guide to let me know what some of the employee reactions mean -- I've seen them have speech balloons like the ones that the customers have, but I'm not exactly sure if that's an indication of lack of morale, hating what they're doing, or what.   

As someone who lives in a duststorm area myself, I have to give the creators credit for thinking of something that was right on the money.  I do wish you had a pellet gun or something to shoot at Dennis!

I understand that crashes were common when the party bus came by; apparently, there's been some work done there, because while I have a moment or two of very slow bogging, it snaps back.  The game stability does still need some work, though; I have experienced several game crashes, though the autosave has generally been fairly close.  

I see that ice cream vending is an option for the employees, but I don't yet see how to do that.  I'm in search of the accolade where you get your employees up to level 10 on everything.  BTW, I liked the hiring process and the backgrounds, too.

Great potential game however I strongly recommend people wait a week or two before buying and playing. There's many bugs, autosave breaks after a few hours in the game, bugs stop progression needing a full game restart (7 hours gameplay gone), not to mention the hours lost due to the autosave bug. Items getting lost under the ground, had at least 4 game shutdowns today so far. The game itself is awesome and right up my alley but i'm pretty resilient and kinda ok with starting again but i'll tell you what, most wouldn't have my patience and will refund the second this happens. Devs released an update today to fix some of the bugs but i've had one shutdown and the need to do a full game reset since performing this update.

Give it a week or two and check back into recent reviews. I'm marking a negative for now as people shouldn't encourage even an early access product let alone a $30 game with this many bugs to be released.

This game is walking a fine line between utter brilliance and complete incompetence. It is filled with great ideas but there's something off about all of them. The best way I have to describe this game is; you wished for a gas station simulator, and the monkey's paw curled. 

Easily the best parts of the game are in the early stages. Building up your station from a smelly shack and turning it into a profitable business is well done, engaging and paced really well. Once you hit mid to late game, you start to notice some weird ticks and the unholy amount of bugs. 

The way cars arrive to the fuel pumps is scripted. If I fill all three up at the same time, they will arrive a few minutes later, all together, at the same time again. When a car arrives for repairs in your garage, the front right tire will ALWAYS be flat. The game tells you that you have to keep the bathrooms clean or customers will complain. This only amounts to sweeping the floor free of dust as you never actually have to clean the bathrooms themselves. Theres an RC track located outside the gas station. Im not sure why its here because once the station gets going, you will never have time to use it. On top of that, even with employees, the game starts to get frantic the more you add to it, because employees cant do everything and once you open all possible parking spaces, the cashier job is essentially endless and youll be ordering more product multiple times a day to keep up with every customer buying a weeks worth of snacks over and over. 

These are just some of the things Ive noticed. I notice more every time I play. 

I really want to stress that I am in Drago's corner. I want to see them do well. I think they have some great ideas but it is very evident that not much care went into making this game. Several years on and it is still very rough. It is full of pre purchased assets, some of which don't really go together. For example, on your newspaper stand, you can sell crisp fresh newspapers right next to a crumpled magazine that looks like it was dug out of the trash. Im also not sure what year it is as every single person drives a classic car from the 50s and 60s from both Europe and America, but Im also surrounded by relatively new tech such as computers and automatic car washes while my uncle wears a suit from the 40s, while I sell modern day styled snacks and drinks. I know Ive seen this circuit box before. Ive seen it everywhere, Ive turned it on countless times in phasmophobia.

The biggest show of lackadaisical devving is the Christmas event. At the time of writing it is currently March and despite a Valentines day event coming and going, the Christmas event is still in full swing. Santa has flown over head more times than I can count and Ive gotten so used to the customers wearing festive hats that Ive stopped seeing them. Its March, Drago. I know we are playing a country hick and they typically dont take down the christmas lights but can we please put santa out of his misery? 

My biggest concern with Drago is that they dont seem to focus on one game and making it good. If you look at their store page they are working on about NINE games at once. While they appear to be using the same asset bundles between them, theres no way there can be any quality between that many projects at once. Even AAA companies only work on one or two games at once. Not NINE. This is on top of the games that they have already released, like this one, that still needs polish and boast about upcoming features. Drago, please just slow down and focus on one at a time. Releasing half baked games, like food truck sim, is not going to hold a fanbase for very long.

Edit: After writing this review, Drago announced that they are ""proud"" to be working on even more projects. If you look at their store page there is now a whopping 12 upcoming games. This is on top of the 3 they have already released. These games are sitting at mixed except for Gas Station Simulator and feel more like early beta to even alpha stages instead of finished games. Now they are working on 12 at once. Remember that scene from Spongebob where Neptune challenges Spongebob to a cook off and Neptune pumps out a pyramid of burgers but they are all nasty, meanwhile Spongebob cooks a single one and its so amazing it moves Neptune to turn him into a god? 

Go watch Spongebob, Drago.",1677785199,1678402115,True,67,2,0.873466908931732178,0,True,False,False

more bad things such like being arrested for picking a lock or getting caught by a customer.

I would love a deli section in which can be run by us like in food truck simulator but a deli in the station that can be run and take orders!

A lot of reviews talk about the many glitches but the vast majority of them are just silly, like this one customer who got stuck standing on the soda shelf. She stayed there until I closed the station. A few times a delivery truck got stuck and I had to reload from an earlier save since neither the car reset button or restarting the game helped, but it's customary to save often since no game is glitch-free. A lot of people don't like the party bus but it is one of my favourite things! Being able to shut down the repair shop, the car wash , and even the fueling stations from the PC is extremely useful when the onslaught of customers arrives. I don't want to give any spoilers but there are moments of zaniness and unexpected occurrences which add a delightful quality to the game. I play on PC and the controls all work perfectly. The devs thoughtfully added some in-game fixes for when certain things go wrong, like reset buttons for cars, people, and some of the equipment. 

I have severe PTSD and doing repetitive tasks to build up the station helps alleviate my ever-present anxiety, and this game serves that purpose for me extremely well. The feeling of accomplishment when completing an upgrade and redecorating is gratifying and keeps me coming back to the game.  The graphics are gorgeous too. The desert environment is stunning, and it's obvious the devs took a lot of time creating it. The whole atmosphere takes on a liminal quality during the twilight hours, and sometimes it's a bit spooky, which I love. I don't have any significant complaints, but I do wish there was more of an immersive story, like perhaps getting to know some of the clientele.

Things I'd like to see.... Holy balls, but picking up certain things in this game is tricky, especially with larger items.

So far in my gameplay (I'm not sure about later on, I've been looking up as little info as possible on the game and am pretty much guessing how to do everything or following the in-game tutorials) I can't change the look of the register at all, the only thing you can change is how people line up for it.

My main issue with this game is that it's core gameplay ""cannibalizes"" itself over the time: When you start a new game and are left alone with that gas station, there is a lot of stuff to do: fuel cars, handle the cash register, repair cars, bring the trash out, etc -- that's the ""weird job simulator"" part of the game that is actually fun. However, once your gas station attracts more customers, you are more or less forced to hire employees, which perform these simple tasks for you -- and now all that you are actually left with is the ordering of fuels and goods (food, drinks, car parts) at the lowest price possible, which turns the game into an actual ""trader simulator"" and unfortunately, this economic part doesn't really feel fun to me and it is not possible to let an employee handle this trading stuff...

Some activities are fine with the controller. Some, like the checking out minigame, are impossible. You can't really navigate the main menu with a controller. Trying to go through the computer menu with a controller is so hard; selected items are very subtle so you don't always know what you're selecting, trying to order quantities of anything is a nightmare.

Mainly - the bugs and the absolute grind fest this is. While I really enjoy the multiple different things available to do, the amount of times I've had glitches happen is frustrating. The party area with the free party DLC causes the party bus to frequently get stuck, depending on where you place your register the queue can very easily break. I had my line going through the bathroom stalls at one point.  You can't place the shelves however you want to or customers or your own employees will get stuck walking into them, forever. I can always tell when a party bus is arriving because I immediately start experiencing lag spikes. And nothing is more frustrating than when the game crashes, again, for seemingly no reason. I would also love the ability to add and remove items from the shelf without having to remove and replace the shelf, because once you put something on the shelf there's no way to take it off otherwise. The amount of times I've accidentally pressed ""place all"" is absurd lol.

I really do love this game. There's so much to do and I love to watch my gas station grow and manage my employees, and there's a large variety of things to do. But because of the prominence of bugs I'm forced to put the game down for a while. Might come back in a few months. I notice the devs are releasing DLC here soon and I've wish-listed it, but I'm hoping they crack down on the bugs, crashes, and glitches first before releasing them.",1675699574,1675699574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I’d have absolutely no problem with giving a positive review if they were fixed but they just aren’t. There’s issues that can range from being from the last update or can easily go as far back as over a year ago, if not more.

(These are not in the order of importance.)
First issue is that some settings automatically revert themselves upon a game reboot/startup. I have to shut the “Car Horns’ option off every single time I load in, and yes, they can get pretty excessive at times. The options will even show that they are set to your desires but are still reverted.
Second issue, very random game crashes. It tends to be at low intensity moments, which of course seems weird. There are “guides” telling you how to lower the chance of crashes but I shouldn’t have to do the Macarena and pray on my tippy toes that the game won’t crash from something that hasn’t been resolved for over a year. This is a issue for a large amount of players, not dependent on your PC specs.
Third issue, the “Bus Party Events” cause horrendous lag spikes lasting as long as 45 seconds. Doesn’t sound horrible but it’s every time without fail. Yes, you can shut them off in the “Gameplay” section of the Options menu, which I suggest. I unhappily ran with them on because I needed as many customers as I could get for various achievements.
Fourth issue, achievements are random on when they decide to count to Steam. It’s like Stevie Wonder is sitting there with a “Yes” button and a “F*ck You” button, and he just slaps them like crazy not knowing what they do. There’s an achievement section in the game showing players that they received them but it’s not well communicated to Steam, thus resulting in the game saying you have it but Steam saying you don’t.
Fifth Issue, the “Late Game Challenges” are broken and very unbalanced. The challenges are great for helping with “Popularity” achievements but are about useless. Ol’ Stevie must’ve had a hand in these too… Some Challenges will just not track your progress whatsoever, others have such high demands with such a low of a time limit it ends up being impossible to do them at all.

There is probably more to say on the issues with the game but those five mentioned are the ones that really applied to me during my play-throughs. Do I expect every game to be a polished masterpiece? No. But seeing their efforts being put into DLCs, at least 3 new games, and not into long lasting issues in the base game causing some players to drop the game entirely, seems a bit off. Seems like they're putting their effort into DLCs/games that can get them more money and not attempting to resolve issues in the game that cause highly negative user experiences since that itself isn't profitable in the short term.
If you're wondering if you should buy this game, I'd suggest you wait for a sale or give it a healthy time frame so that maybe the issues are patched/fixed, if they ever feel to do so.",1675292533,1675639159,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Gameplay-wise: It's enjoyable. It is what it presents itself as - you operate a gas station in the desert and work to build it up to hire a staff and serve more customers.

Within 10 - 15 hours, you're pretty likely to do everything there is to be done, so it's probably good to acknowledge that before purchase. 
[strike]Performance-wise: this is where this game fails. I can't explain what the issue is other than poor optimization(?). Running on a i7-12700, 32gb RAM, and a 3070ti. I've watched performance counters, nothing is being maxed (CPU & GPU show no more than 20% utilization). Starting a new game nearly crashes my pc, once it loads in the game is extremely sluggish and stuttering frames. This is when I'm trying to use med-high settings - and I'm getting barely getting 30-40fps. 

I do hope they keep trying to work on it and it improves, but in its current state, it's barely playable.[/strike]",1663455483,1675006301,True,0,0,0.511494219303131104,0,True,False,False

The number of little bugs/crashes here and there quickly accumulate into frustration. Stuttering between menus, loading/unloading characters in and  out of the scene (the bus event), empty delivery trucks backed up as far as the eye can see. The game actually has a button to ""fix traffic"" which is nothing more than a clever way to cover up a huge bug they weren't able to fix that causes traffic to back up, cars and your excavator sitting on top of light poles for no reason, glitchy.  If there weren't so many bugs there's actually the appearance of a good simulator progression. The most frustrating thing is there are small minigames to complete activities that RELY on smooth performance to do them correctly. if you don't, your in-game rating suffers. That's VERY  annoying.

I continued to play after this review since I did pay for the game after all, which I regret. The stuttering performance in this game is so overwhelmingly frustrating, I'm done with this game. The dev team NEVER should've considered releasing any DLC until the core game works.

After paying off the final $5,000, the game froze so bad I'm not sure if I missed a cut scene that simply didn't load. Afterwards, a device appeared in my parking lot that just generates trash which doesn't make any sense at all. 

There are also numberous moments where there isn't a customer in sight and suddenly a challenge appears to serve 40 customers in your store within several minutes. I can't quite remember the amount of time but it's laughable. Days will pass without seeing anyone until you ""reset traffic"". Delivery trucks get stuck miles away for no reason.

But here we are.
Graphics 7/10 - Ran this game on all ultra graphics (AMD Radeon 6600XT Mech 2x GPU) And it ran amazing and clean- Until the party bus arrives, then it goes from 51 FPS down to about 15 FPS. But other than that, I rate it a 7/10. Great style to the game.
Gameplay 7/10 - It gets repetitive after you get a handle on things. The incremental change with each upgrade makes it a bit tougher but it also makes it a little bit more boring once you get employees. However, It kept me busy for 14 hours. Between the stocking groceries and ordering gas, and then executing shifts between employees and maximizing profits through a changing price market I think it's one of the most entertaining Sims I've played recently. Plus the Garage is nice touch. It's like Car Mech. Simulator. 7/10
Story 6/10 - It's a fairly straight forward single player story. You play a guy who sold a car to buy a gas station. And Apparently, works for or with the mob. Not too many twists that throw the story off but nothing that sets you on edge. Just focus on your business. Simulators don't really NEED a big story-line to work with, But this one had more potential I feel. 6/10
Conclusion 7.5/10 - Gas Station Simulator DEFINITELY is worth a try if you enjoy Simulators that don't involve 3rd person top down view. It has a fair bit of Logistics involved. If you like to deviate from the story and run an absolute hole-in-the-wall station, or run a clean little desert jewel. You can do anything you want to your station and the future is completely in your hands. It's definitely for an audience of +10 years old and beyond, and it's a great game to get lost in for a little while. Might even be worth the 2nd playthrough.

Pretty good sim, with some bad sides.

The endgame is pointless. You can get up to popularity 10, but after popularity 7 there is no point. Your station stays the same level, you can't upgrade anything and I desperately needed more warehouse space. It's just grind for an achievemnt that takes too long because everything becomes too repetitive. 

Sometimes during endgame you get impossible challenges. Like serving 40 customers in the store in 5 minutes. It's impossible to do and just makes you feel a bit frustrated because challenges are one of the ways to get popularity. 

The game has glitches like items going through floor, which is not that bad. What got me frustrated is game crashing a lot. I had to start saving my game every 10 minutes just to try and keep my progress going. Just felt painful. 

In the end devs cared about th game enough to fix my biggest issue - crashes. For last 2 achievements I had game running non stop for hours and didn't have a single crash. Feels really nice to see good changes.

While I didn't play it like a goof, I enjoyed the 30 hour journey it took me to ""complete the story."" I still have a few more things I can do in the game (popularity levels). I will come back to mess around in it. I had a lot of fun, but I'll preface that I don't mind hopping in a ""simulator"" game to zone out and chill.

While this game can get hectic and has it's flaws, it was definitely worth picking up during a Steam sale.

Yes, the game has a good amount of jank to it. Yes, it crashes. No, it doesn't have a ton of progression depth. Yes, vehicles and customers get stuck pretty frequently. Attention: There are a few reset buttons around. Every in-game day or so when I had a lull in customers, I'd press the reset button. Not only does it fix stuck vehicles, it corrects a memory-leak issue that causes crashes. It was crashing frequently until I searched for this solution.

This game also has the quirkiness and charm of the ""did we really need to simulate this"" vibe like Barn Finders, but that presentation is far more polished and gets sillier. BF is ""better"" but GSS created more laughs in the jank dept. This concludes my TED Talk. If you'd like to read some gameplay mechanic spoilers and rant, continue reading.

Rant:

The register checkout minigame can be nightmarish to operate and I found myself avoiding it fully when I could hire more help. The item physics and incredibly small workspace made it annoying. You WILL accidentally knock something off the conveyor belt or into the basket before it can be scanned. I've never seen a customer get mad IRL when they got an item or two for free... it would have been nice if you could boost your popularity by purposefully giving items away for free to the detriment of monetary loss and no tip. Also, the NPC help is much, much quicker at completing each task with the trade-off of less money made. The math doesn't lie: it would take me about 3 seconds per item scanned. It's not uncommon to scan 10+ items. It would take me at least 30 seconds compared to the NPC's 10 seconds or less. They clear out crowds quickly and still make a good profit.

However, the hirelings are slower at cleaning and don't do car repairs well. Pathing issues, glitches, and doing the bare minimum repairs even at higher stats. I found myself putting NPCs on register, fueling, and cleaning duties (later, when I had more help).

Words of caution: DON'T move your shelves with product on them! The items can disappear and you'll lose what money you paid for the stock. This will likely come into play as you upgrade since you'll have more floor space to work with. So either let the shelves sell out, manually move EVERY item, or eat the cost. I've done all three.

Also I'm very grateful that the devs allow disabling of certain features. The car horns let you know if you have a delivery waiting, but OH MY GOD there is far too much honking. I couldn't be sure, but it seems like they honk at you if all spots are full or if there is a traffic jam too. It's quasi-useful early on as you get a feel for the layout, but of course you're not going to have everything opened up early on. Seriously folks, I'd estimate at least 1 honk per minute...

I also recommend disabling a few ""events"" once you've experienced them a few times. It doesn't hurt achievements. I turned off the holiday content and some detrimental features. The detrimental stuff is pretty frequent and I had a sandstorm, the graffiti brat, AND the party bus all arrive at the same time. After experiencing each event dozens of times, I realized they brought no fun anymore and only adds more monotonous play time. 

I also ended up turning off ""warehouse theft"" about halfway through bc I realized it was a time-sink feature. This game would have benefited from better progression. AKA, don't like having to manually unload the truck (NPC can't do this), how about an upgrade that unloads for you. The items could have had more depth and stats too, ie a way to track and stock popular items.

So, there it is. I enjoyed this game enough to write a review, but am surprised I had notes on improvements. That means I liked it enough I had feedback to make it better. If you buy, I hope you have fun with it too!",1672876995,1672876995,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm still a kid, playing with whatever I can buy with various magazines in my local market or what is available on websites online. I'm enjoying all kinds of genres - racing, shooters, RPG, small platformers, or adventures, but the most fun I'm having is with small flash simulator games - carwash, mechanic, pizzeria, etc. I can play for hours but they still don't last for long, or I have to start a new game very often. I wished someone made any of those games into full AAA polished titles, with cool mechanics and amazing graphics.
Back then it didn't happen.

Today, in 2021.
I became tired of big games, with lovely graphics but too many half-baked mechanics. I'm stuck with my favorite online title, a few older RPGs, and one or two relaxing indie games. Most of the time I don't even play, sometimes watch someone else playing new titles to see if they will catch my eye.
On one afternoon Gas Station Simulator did just that. When I saw the constant struggle to clean up, handle clients, and somehow make a profit on a sandy piece of land I figured that maybe someone finally made my dream come true. I jumped into the game and was not disappointed!

This game is very honest about what it offers to the player. You are managing your gas station, there is barely any story to it (in my opinion there is no need for that). You're supposed to jump into the game and get pulled in into a whirl of duties. The graphics look pretty, all buildings and items look neat, humans... Let's say they look believable. There is enough customization with wall paintings, shelving, and decor. The sound design and music are nice, it reminds me of all those movies about Route 66 and deserts around California and Arizona. It gets a little bit monotonous but most of the time I don't actively listen to it so it's okay. Game mechanics are polished, fun, and just spot on. Probs to devs for actively fixing bugs and problems and for being self-aware - some bugs are turned into achievements! It's also great that they rather publish multiple small fixes instead of making players wait for a month for an enormous one. 
Gas Station Simulator also has some hiccups and problems. It's a rather short game, with a quite bad optimization and plenty of annoying glitches. They are not game-breaking but they can make you irritated during long sessions. Employee management is pretty bad, they are not always worth using for certain tasks. Rudy is slow as hell, which makes it unbearable to operate.

Overall I'm in love with the game. It brings me the joy of gaming I remember from my childhood and hopefully, it will bring me a few more hours of fun.",1632764795,1672655437,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

If you like Simulation/Management games, this is a solid purchase.

Car Horns can be disabled, voice acting for Uncle is good. Not much ""Story"", but most sim/mng games don't have much, anyways. I'm very much looking forward for their Diner game, I really hope it's got as much character, and good mechanics. 

*The bugs that are there aren't too bothersome. 
-Model Animations are a little clunky.
-Party Bus is still pretty heavy on rig. 
-Items on conveyor bug out sometimes.

[b]I've been bored and refunded on several simulator games. This game is staying in the library, if not simply because the time I'm planning to spend playing it would disqualify me from refunding it.[/b]

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Interesting, if not nostalgic mini-games that ""Nintendo-Arcade-Minigames"" lovers will enjoy thoroughly.
-Random event(s) that will shake up the hum-drum of the (few) grindy-ish parts of the game.
-Simple to grasp,  it's not intimidating to jump right in. (This game would be excellent for a new PC gamer, or for existing gamers who are trying to migrate a spouse or family member.)
-Lots, and lots of tutorials & information, of which you can return to at any point throughout the game.
-Realistic (I use this word liberally). It has a good repetition to it, with customers noticing if their favorite items are missing from your shelves. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Information for shelving content isn't available in-game, from what I could find. The game doesn't tell you an exact amount of items per shelf, but it matters! If you want to be able to 
calculate exact amounts for what you'll need to buy for your store's inventory, you'll have to utilize the wiki.
(I decided to use my real-life notepad and write down these values, which further suggests the need for such a feature in-game. Additionally, the wiki can be annoying to locate due to the Roblox-knockoff's success.)
-The paint DLC allows you to paint the buildings using a paint roller. This feature is fantastic in every way except one: once you click a wall to start painting, you cannot change the color or exit the process. The only way to 'move forward', so to speak, is to paint the wall whatever color you had selected, go back, and paint it again to your desired color. 
-This 'con' contains direct game spoilers. You have been warned. 
[spoiler]This con is more of a complaint than a real con, but it still counts because it affects gameplay, in my opinion;
The skidsteer/excavator has a turbo function that overheats the engine, which you then have to cool? I understand the need for a nerf to the skidsteer because the designed usage wouldn't take very long to finish up, but if the overheating feature was removed and the fuel was depleted a bit faster, the same goal would be accomplished. Besides being unnecessary to gameplay, it's just downright unrealistic. Real turbo diesel machinery is far more reliable than any other, and this is very well known about. [/spoiler]

The engine itself still heavy and that's a fact, but what was initially 25fps low settings now became 50-55fps, a huge improvement. The visuals took a bit more of tanking, doesn't look too gorgeous when you tone it all the way down, but hey it definitely works much better and that's a huge positive

To be more specific, try to buy the game and the Can Touch This DLC for around $10 - $15; if you are into the simulator games. 

For the good:
The game itself is alright. It's not awful, but it's also not amazing. I will say it feels less grindy with regards to money when compared to some other simulator games. I'm also positive you can't really lose money when buying and selling products. Meaning, you will always generate a profit since your cost of goods sold (inventory cost) should never exceed the sale price of that product; or, at least, I have never seen it exceed this value. As a result, the game seems pretty forgiving or not punishing; but, if you wanted to put more thought into your choices, you can still buy things that are on sale for a better margin. Some of the mini-games are decent (cashier, car repair).

For the bad:
Some of the achievements are just god awful to grind out. More specifically, the popularity level 9 and 10 are just insanity. For reference, I think a maxed out party spot event maybe fills 6 - 7% of the bar while going from 9 to 10. I've seen developers claiming that the spot should give around 500/600 popularity when maxed out. However, with the items and spot maxed out, I was gaining around 220 - 300 popularity per event. I can't fathom how they are able to get double the amount I'm getting when my upgrades are maxed; and the spot refuses to take more items (gives the text claiming the basket is full). Furthermore, it seems that employees can't generate popularity; but (maybe) can lose it. I don't really understand this choice; and the developers should really consider changing as it becomes quite tedious to try to do all jobs when trying to max out popularity. In my case, I tried to do the cashier and fueling job at the same time; which is fine. However, the popularity gain for the effort was just a joke. Please tune down these levels. Even level 8 can be rough; and the grind requires insane amounts of time even when doing tasks yourself, keeping things clean, and using the party spot.

While on topic of the party spot, we can talk about the Party Time DLC. There are probably other things added; but all I can recall is the party spot and ice cream stand. Given the above paragraph, I will talk about the latter. The ice cream stand just feels silly, in a bad way. The location is just terrible. You have people crossing one of the two main paths of your gas station to get to and back from the stand; which causes cars to stop and cause even more jams. This means that it may take longer for a customer to get in and out of your location; and that may mean profit loss from other areas of your gas station. Without doing extensive testing and research (which isn't worth it in my opinion), the small gains from the stand just don't seem worth it due to it's location. Furthermore, wouldn't other food choices make more sense? Haven't you made a game that has cooking in it with products like burgers? So, wouldn't those food make more sense at a gas station? Overall, with the DLC, it just feel like some sort of public relations ordeal. They give this ""fix"" for the insane amount of popularity needed while giving us a free DLC. I know what you're saying, but it's free. Sure, but half of it feels like a fix for an existing issue; which it doesn't even fix. And, the other half just leaves you wondering if it's even worth it. Doing the mini-game for the stand is fine and all for a couple of times; but after that, it's sort of just meh. 

Lastly, I would like to talk about the Can Touch This DLC. The price is small; which is good. However, some of the content feels like it really should've been included in the base game. For reference, the DLC allows you to double the base game's max  warehouse space, adds gas station floor space, and adds 50% more to the base game's max gas storage tank. The warehouse space feels like a necessity in the base game. There are plenty of times where I have had to split orders; which feels bad when I can just do one large order. I'm not going to dwell much on it; but I do believe everything that wasn't cosmetic should've been free. If people want to support the game, which it seems like those people exist, then just offer the cosmetic stuff as the DLC. Warehouse and gas station floor space is just extremely valuable; and it feels bad to have those things behind a pay wall (even if it's small). 

Finally (even though I said lastly earlier), there are some strange ""fixes"" that have occurred. From my experience, I would argue that the game is far less stable than when it came out. The game will just close randomly at non-consistent times. You can even tell the game is crashing because the FPS just randomly tanks in a weird pattern. It's like the game is trying to gasp for air. They claimed to have fix car pathing to prevent jams; but they still jam rather consistently and in ways that make you question your surroundings. Trash still goes through the floor. People get stuck on everything they can think of (Displays, outside decor that is placed by the developers, even the front door, etc.). Overall, I just don't know what happened to the stability. You get 60 FPS for the whole session; and then it just randomly tanks. I think sometimes the culprit is the party bus. Other times, I'm not sure. 

To summarize again, try to get the game on a discount. The concept and game loop are fine; but not amazing. There are painfully tedious achievements and questionable practices with the paid DLC. If you like simulator games, try to get the base game and the Can Touch This DLC for $15 or less. I don't think the game deserves full price.

Best wishes.

The gameplay was smooth and intuitive, and I found myself really getting into the role of managing a busy gas station.

One of the things I really enjoyed about Gas Station Simulator was the variety of tasks you had to manage. From filling up cars to repairing cars to restocking shelves to checking out customers at the register, there was always something to do. The game did a great job of keeping things interesting and challenging, and I never felt like I was just going through the motions.

I also appreciated the attention to detail in the game. The various customers you encounter all have their own unique look, and the gas station itself is full of little touches that make it feel like a real place.

This game is a lot of fun, and I sincerely enjoy it. There are some game breaking bugs though. If there are two items on the conveyor belt, and they touch each other, one item goes FLYING off and you then fail that mini game. The conveyor belt itself is also super buggy.

- Very poorly optimised 
- Frame rate issue with party bus
- grind from 8-10 is kinda sus

Game is easy to sink hours into, achievements are easy to get and there's only 1 that would require a restart in game,  it's not too challenging you're overwhelmed, but also not too light that you get bored easily. 
with the ability of hiring help, you can do what you want, and what you're bored/tired of doing you can get someone else to do. 
popularity 7-10 is basically just waiting around for parties and lil popups to get population 
8-10 popularity it's more afk than anything, just check in every 15 minutes and switch your hires up to handle everything and order a few things. 
The popularity leveling especially from 9-10 you're just waiting for parties to start to boost you up 15-20% otherwise it takes so long to even get up 1%.

Does have a fair bit of content though, between several different car repair options, car wash, shelves/scanning, fueling cars, adding decoration, pretty fun. 

there's a bunch of minigames to play in the mean time so it's not too bad if you have to afk a bit. 

There's also options to turn off a lot of things that doesn't affect achievements,

- Car Honking

- Long term play(Over 1+ Hours) is very buggy; It's clear this wasn't tested as much as it needed to be.

-Short term play (Under an hour at a time; seems to be fine)

- Customers become stuck on decorations; when they can't leave after a certain amount of time.
It crashes my game entirely.

- The Paint roller is very buggy; You also can't stop painting once you've started.
Something along the lines of picking paint then trying to click Esc or something else makes it so that you just start auto running everywhere.

- Dennis becomes annoying as he spray paints quite a bit.

Comments:
Love the game itself but the bug testing was not done properly. 

I've had issues with other Movie S.A Games/DRago entertainment as well. Basically the same issue.
Poor long term play bug testing.

Highly suggest releasing games in Alpha or Beta and using community testers if you can't afford to spend your own staffs time. Which is understandable. But proper testing needs to be done, otherwise it's just going to hurt you more than help you.",1664901179,1671133025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The otherwise mundane tasks of working the cash register, filling gas, and fixing cars gets very addicting at times. Sometimes I'll get into a groove of running around during a surge of customers and it feels nice. It is very buggy though. There have been times when cars have gotten stuck driving the wrong way or flipped upside down. My whole gas station can grind to a halt as one car gets stuck in an awkward position blocking everyone else from entering or leaving. I wish it were easier to fix than nuking the whole lot and removing ALL cars and customers because ONE person got stuck. When I saw that button I knew it probably had to be a band-aid fix for the cars always getting stuck and being impossible to individually fix. The party bus gets a bit annoying at times too. I always know they've arrived because my frame rate TANKS making the game nigh unplayable. I'll try to adjust my graphical settings to see if that helps. Carrying objects will have them falling through the floor or just not following you properly as you walk around with them. This happens often but not always. Dennis is pretty annoying as well. When he comes around I have to run to find something to throw at him, but after throwing once or twice, his hitbox would cause the item to rocket into space so I have to run and find something else. It may sound like I dislike the game, but I do very much like it. I just wish these bugs weren't so frequent! If it's on sale and you're into these types of games, I'd say to pick it up.

Overall I enjoyed this game. It took what would have been an otherwise boring and mundane chore and turned it into something fun and pleasant and rewarding. Every time you fill up a gas tank or every time you chase Dennis off feels successful. Random events and spontaneous humorous tones help drive along a narrative. Yet at the same time this game is endlessly stressful. Mind you, the point is likely to stress you out and keep you focused and constantly moving, yet certain aspects of the game really make you question how much fun you can have. For one, constant bugs and crashing is annoying in any game, but in such a fast-paced environment as this losing ANY progress is demoralizing. Further, environmental issues and upkeep despite your best intentions push you to the limit. For example, I HATE RUDY! I HATE THAT STUPID PIECE OF EQUIPTMENT! Never have I had a more uncomfortable and unenjoyable time as the time I wasted hauling around dirt with that thing. 

That is, until I discovered how annoying it is to paint. You have to paint ever section of the gas station, garage, and warehouse piece by bloody piece. Then the roof, then the poles and panels. It is so boring. And half the time my game crashes so I end up losing my progress. Additionally, many pieces (such as higher up walls and doors), the paint does not change color no matter how many times you coat it. Really ruins the purpose of painting to begin with. 

Another, I HATE REPAIRING THE CARS! It takes forever, barely pays out what you put into it, and constantly forces you to return to the garage whenever parts run out (which is every five minutes). Another, if you accidentally pick up a piece of merchandise from the shelf, it is IMPOSSIBLE to put it back. now you can only put it in the trash or leave it on the ground. Even worse if you pick up a car part which can run up to $90. at least with THAT you can use it if you don't lose it. 

Finally, I HAAATTTEE washing cars! I know I can turn the car wash off but it is the most degrading, unfun experience in the game. Combined with the fact you're unable to assign an employee to it, and my frames more than HALVE - it sucks. It's really bad. 

Overall, I reccomend the game despite its many, many shortcomings. As a final complaint, for the amount of time you acutally get out of it, this game should be $20 maximum. $30 is absurd. I spent $15 on sale, but again it costs too much. The 12 hours I dumped into this finished the game and now lets you go on endlessly, but I really can't take much more of it.",1670173046,1670173046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like management sims, you will get something out of this - but this is a pretty soft recommendation, because it has some incredible grind to it - and some pretty odd mechanics. Let's run through some of them.

Cash Register: In real life, if you accidentally drop an item into the basket without scanning it - you simply take it back out and scan. For whatever reason, this ruins your customers day.

Car washing: BRUTAL. Awful. If you have ever player powerwash sim, you will find this truly punishing. Your blaster sucks, you cannot upgrade to auto until end end game. Some cars refuse to be clean. And worst of all, you cannot assign your staff to this job. I closed my washer for most of the game.

Lock picking: Why? It is so out of place, I would rather not rob my customers. You don't have to do this of course, but why is it even in a mechanic. Very weird.

This is minor - but I don't appreciate being forced to carry rubbish. They go out of their way to make your rubbish bag look as disgusting as possible, but you can't empty your rubbish unless you fill the bag.

But most of all - this needs waaaay more automation to it.
Managing staff is pretty annoying, I would really like some sort of schedule implementation.
Let me assign staff to stock refilling.
Let me assign staff to order items when they get low.

I also experienced random framerate drops even though my setup is more than plenty to handle the game on the highest settings. And lastly the controller support is really underwhelming.

All i can say about Gas Station Simulator is this: If you are interested in a simulator style of game and you only want to buy 1 game in the style, this is it. The addictive and entertaining gameplay loop of managing a progressively larger and larger gas station will keep you glued to your chair for hours. The customization and freedom the game offers when it comes to decorations and layout of said gas station is insanely deep. I will say that there is a slight performance issue that caused some frequent crashes when you start to get later in the story but, nothing a fresh install didn't solve.  In conclusion, this game is a master class in what simulator games should be and I am excited to see what Drago Entertainment has in store for the future.

I do recommend this game, but not at this moment in time. The achievement system is a total mess. I've counted 16 achievements so far which I should have received, but never did. There are occasional game crashes as well and random drops in frame rate. Overall the game content is amazing, but what is the use of having amazing content at the tips of your fingers, and not being able to enjoy it?

21 Oct, 2022 (UPDATE)

Almost a year later and some things have changed. Hardware-wise, I've gone from 750 Ti to Rx 6600 XT and i7-3700K to Ryzen 5600G. It feels like all they did was add more content to the game rather than focusing on optimization, because fps is still trash... YES, the crashes have been fixed, somewhat. When using normal mode instead of Dx11 Mode, It does still crash, however, Dx11 mode fixed that for me. Still getting employee chat screen-hanging bugs when talking to them and afterwards pressing ""Esc"" instead of the close option on screen. Now, for the fps issue. The real question is, do I have a shi**y system, or is your game made shi**y? Hear me out, God of War, Forza Horizon 5, GTA, Red dead 2... we can all agree, they look pretty good with the settings turned up. SO, to make my point, why can I run all of the above mentioned, above 120 fps at high settings, but in YOUR game I have to play at MEDIUM (Which looks terrible btw) and if I'm lucky, I get away with 60-70 fps, that is ofc if it's not lagging all the way to sub 50 fps... which is the case 90% of the time? It's not the end of the world, but it's almost the end of 2022 and high refresh monitors with variable refresh rates are become more affordable. Even with variable refresh rate switched on the game looks and feels laggy. I'll check back in another year, maybe by then they might have learned a thing or two about optimization and client satisfaction. Still, game has potential in the right hands...",1635491160,1666372312,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I don't write reviews often, but I just love this game so much. I saw Markiplier play it a while back and I decided to get it for myself and I was not disappointed. It has quickly become my comfort game. Since I began playing they have made some MAJOR improvements, and it has made the experience overall more enjoyable. Some of the more notable improvements are being able to turn on and off each individual station (the garage takes up so many resources it's nice to be able to shut it down for a while), the speed of the delivery truck, and being able to hire painters to paint the whole station.

The game naturally has the jank that most simulator games have, but it's done in a way that the perfect brand of charming shines through. Unfortunately, I don't think I would play more games like this simply because the experience would be extremely difficult to recreate. However, I will eat up whatever dlc comes for this game until the end of time. Keep up the good work devs!",1665902026,1665902026,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting off with a worn down gas station, that needs cleaning, renovating, painting etc. To hiring employees to do all the work for you. Or well - most of the work, you can't truly automate your income here.

You need to keep track of stock, products, car parts, fuel. Earn enough money to buy new stock, as well as upgrades for your station.
There are events to keep you on your toes, like a nice young kid named Dennis who will annoy the heck out of you from time to time, ruin your freshly painted walls with graffiti, and you need to throw items at him, (Yeah don't ask), to make him leave. Not only that, but sandstorms can 'cause problems, as they bring piles of sand onto the road, which requires removing using an old excavator named Rudy.

I personally turned those features off in the options menu, which I'm glad you can, because they were just annoying to deal with, given everything else that needed to be done already.

Overall, I enjoyed this game from start to finish, but my ADHD brain helped with that, always needing to do something or another, preventing me from sitting still was rather therapeutic.

Wash car, check on store, are there still enough glasses and hats? Damn, almost sold out again, gotta buy new stock, wait, how about fuel? Alright fuel is good. Let me check the car parts in the workshop, Car wheel stand already empty??? Time to buy new ones as well. Employees need paid, fine, I'll do that in a minute. Hey John, can you handle the register real quick? Thanks, I gotta head to the warehouse to drop off the new supplies that just came in.

But that's all positive talk, but that doesn't mean this game is perfect, honestly, it's far from it. There are bugs, glitches, crashes that can absolutely ruin your experience. Certain aspects of the game are also rather awful. One of the biggest gripes I have, is that you can place shelves and decorations, anywhere in the store. However, the way you place said items is god awful. You can rotate them, but it's so scuffed that you'll never be able to place shelves snug against the wall, there's snapping for wall decorations and shelves, but anything on the floor, yeah no. AI also isn't great, both your employees as well as customer AI can be a pain to deal with, cars getting stuck, customers getting stuck, your employees not doing correctly what they're asked to do, or just stand there dumbfounded, forcing you to give them a task again, or move things out of the way so they stop walking into them. Thankfully it wasn't enough to stop me from playing, though again, it soured my experiences a bit.

In the end, I had fun, and might come back to start a new game, as I personally would give this game a 7.8 out of 10",1665836571,1665836571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I reached the end of the story before I quite realized I was getting there, because the gameplay loop was so low-level - I never felt like I reached the end of the tunnel to get to the good stuff, I was just in the tunnel the whole time.

The game has quite a few bugs, including soft locks and frequent random crashes.  They solve the soft locks by including a reset button that clears all cars and customers from your lot, which is like... yeah it works, but it's an obvious work-around.

I have beaten all of the game contents which was  a bit of a bummer. I am mixed about recommending it, it has quite a few bugs still and since opening the car wash I have dealt with a ton of crashes. With some nice perks, like throwing things at Dennis the Little Menace, who would be in Juvie for vandalism lol.

Pros:
- The interface is good and easy to understand.
- You get to decide where you want shelves, which shelves, whether you want to add decorations.
- You can paint all the buildings and change the material of the gas station.
- You have the ability to choose what events you want to deal with.
- Can move cars with your broom. Love this.

Cons:
- The lighting is atrocious and lamps don't do much to increase it either. At least give us the option to buy more ceiling lights, please.
- The crashes. I had one in the beginning after launch then none for most of the game until the car wash. It may not be the car wash itself, it very well could be Gustvee causing the crash. Either way I cannot play more then ten minutes right now without my game crashing. It sucks because I haven't even done DLC yet.
- Disappearing items. Garbage is a big one that does this. I can pick up a bag and sometimes it'll either get stuck or vanish. But I have had that happen to stock items as well.
- Items that are set on magazines & newspapers, or too close to other items, that just fly off.

Overall though, I enjoy it. It has quite a bit of working parts and a little bit for everyone. Even though I hated working in a gas station, I do enjoy building one.",1664929627,1664929627,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the constant crashes are a huge problem. Yes, the game autosaves, but not often enough, so I frequently lose progress. 

The game is really glitchy. Like Bethesda glitchy. There are workarounds, but it's annoying to have to reset my customers and traffic during a rush because some idiot got stuck on the lightpost trying to get out of the parking lot. 

Also, this game keeps you really busy until you're not. I was running around constantly during the first 20 hours just trying to keep the station afloat, and after I hit the 20 hour mark, I got bored. There are minigames to keep you busy, but I got bored of those quickly. 

I wish the cleaning/restoration part lasted longer. That's my favorite part of sim games and I felt like I got the station cleaned up way too soon.

All the mini games with pumping fuel or running the register are nice and easy. The customization is simple, would love to see more but I like what it offers. It be cool to able to put decorations inside your room above the warehouse, but you'll almost never be in there. I'd like to see stuff like a possible cafe added, mainly after playing Food Truck Sim. Either a built in cafe or at least shelves/stands for selling warm food like hot dogs, pizza, nachos, basic gas station food. Maybe even a soda fountain since most gas stations have those. My only complaint is really just with the car wash, I'd like the upgrade costs to be nuked a little. I can't really complain because the car wash is pretty much free money, nothing to stock or refill I mean, but 8,000 for just a level 4 upgrade seems high.

Graphics performance is not great for looking so low rent.
The physics are ranging between junk flying off into the distance, trash bags falling through the map, or occasionally causing CTD. It auto saves pretty often though, but it's also crashing more and more often now as I'm progressing which is getting a little annoying.

Doubt it'll stay installed after playing through it, as there's not much replayability.

Like when you let someone clean the gas station, instead of doing their job they just run into some shelves. Some NPCs just float around like they are driving a car but they are not. But overall a very nice game.

Update Sept. 25th 2022: there has been a big update with performance fixes. However, the game is still unstable and crashes. It is a bit better, but still broken. The shredder in the sewers is not working either anymore. Trashbags get stuck every time, and you have to remove them manually. So you pay $8,000 to upgrade your car wash and add the shredder for nothing atm. The minigame for the icecream stand (new DLC) seems to be broken also. I can't make ice creams myself it seems, and have to hire someone to do it. Also the party venue doesn't add anything to the game. Just a way to get more popularity points.

Old Review:  the game description says that is recommended a gtx 900 series for best graphics, my computer is a i7- 9 gen and have a 1050 TI GPU, and the game in medium preset, in Full HD (1080p, 100% texture rendering) don't go above 30-40fps, and often suffers lagspikes/freezings droping the fps to 30-25 out of nowhere, also sometimes it just go to 15-20fps without reason and stays liek that for something between 2 to 5 minutes, i played this game in the past, and it was WAY better before, don't know what the devs did, but they turned the game worse, is cool  that the game have new content, but the game is unplayable now so i can't even test and see the new content added...
i will change this review if the game goes better in the future, for now i will just refund it.",1662899019,1664005704,True,0,0,0.508771896362304688,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately I had bugs breaking the game on the 2nd time I loaded it up. I looked for what was going on, did a dev update break? Did Windows 11 or nVidia driver updates cause a massive rift in Gas Station Simulator? I could not figure out what happened between everything working normally as it was designed to do and then become unplayable the second time I booted the game. I did file integrity checks and nothing was wrong as far as that goes, there were no updates from anywhere from the time of installing the game to the next time I loaded it up. Maybe Dennis did it because I surely could not figure it out. 
I really want to try again with the major update and I don't want to be disappointed. I will recommend this game but I only got 2.2 hours before I had to uninstall it. It just was not playing nice, the belt broke on the register and would not stop so all the groceries were hitting the ground. I did not make any changes to key mapping so why that happened is beyond my comprehension.I painted the inside walls and start painting the outside and go to the warehouse to get a delivery. I come back right away and everything I put paint on reverted back to how it was before painting at all.
I don't know if anyone else experienced anything like this but I was highly confused as to what was going on. Maybe they fixed it with the new game engine and it might be worth another try.
So I recommend Gas Station Simulator for the concept which is unique and fresh. I can't recommend the version I was on before the major update only because I had broken game mechanics that made the game unplayable for me. YMMV but I've played lots of early access titles so I am aware of weird things happening. My machine is highly capable of running pretty much any game I play even if they are not optimized well.
 TLDR: I love the idea of GSS and want it to be a great experience, hoping the major update has fixed some issues. Buy it if you're adventurous and love a challenge because from the game play I've seen this title is going to keep you occupied for hours. I also wish listed the next titles, the Roadside Diner and The Motel sims so I really want this major update for GSS to be the fix I need to be able to play GSS without the game breaking bugs.",1663804117,1663813341,True,1,0,0.506849288940429688,0,True,False,False

First of all, the employees are dumb asf, they should be able to turn off or on an option that allow they to re-join to their respective last job by themselves , they should be able to autorestock from the warehouse and should be an option to recive all the trucks. 
The time that you spend in the garage is absurd, it should be less torturative that. 
The werehouse should give you more max cap, is hard have stock in all with the space.
The progression is not good enough, you feel like despite you upgrade your station there is not much more cash, keep all the shelves (garage/store) fulls and with the fuel tank in the upper half is something utopic. Feel like the employee always must be in the cash register, thanks that the garage and the fuel do not have queu, 3/4 of the time you put there, they're chilling just there. 
There are a lot of crashes.
There is something extremely wrong, and that is the desing of a tool like the paint brush... omg, 10 min in that thing and you're going to have a mental breakdown. 
There are a lot of glitches, someones funny, others kinda annoying.
The physics sometimes are... cuestionable... mainly in the cash register, there is annoying cause somethings make you throw away things that were too close.
There are others few minor errors but were not big enough to make a difference. This games feels more like an early access, idk why  but until just now i thought it, i cant believe that is not a EA.

You get to make orders, restock the shelves, handle the cash register, clean, refuel and many other parts that come with owning your own gas station. The game itself has been really addictive so far and I personally enjoyed it all. 

Pros:

• Let's you improve the property which gives you something to look forward to.
• The interface is simple and easy to understand.
• You can decorate however you please and put the shelves where you want.
• It keeps you on your feet but lets you close and open whenever you please.
• It lets you turn off certain events you don't wanna participate in.

Cons:

• I'm not sure if this is a common issue but it crashes A LOT for me.
• Grabbing certain items makes them either disappear or get stuck.
• Horn setting is available but it would be better if you could only keep important horns (reminders for the warehouse etc.)
• Employees should be able to restock from the warehouse by themselves.
• Lack of decorations and options to make it your own.
• No sprint.

There are a few things that I wish would be changed about the game to make it a lot better. The amount of sand being brought in after purchasing the roads, the lack of sprint and the horns but even with the Cons outweighing the Pros, I'm recommending this game. Just for the sheer fact that it's simple, addictive, let's you be somewhat creative and the price is not too much to ask for the hours you're going to spend in it. 

I think this would also be [b]REALLY FUN[/b] in multiplayer. Have your friends replace the NPC workers.

Gas Station Simulator is enjoyable enough, however the amount of bugs is why I can't recommend it;

Trash falls through the floor when you pick it up
Cars get stuck easily (you can smack them with your broom and they have their own reset button)
Warehouse running out of shelving space despite having zero product in stock
Regular crashes
Some staff go on breaks seemingly whenever they feel like it

The worst one so far being that I pay %400 for fuel, the guy shows up, I open the pipe to let in the fuel and BOOM the hose disappears and the guy drives off leaving me with no fuel. Now I have no money and customers waiting at the pump. Yeah that's real fun.

Low and behold there is no console to script the game for me to fix any bugs I might run into either, To mod this game I would have to download a cheat engine to get money and fuel cheats just to pay me what I was owed. 

I tried reloaded the save right before the guy shows up to pump but it was the same issue every time. After reloading for a 3rd time the game crashed.

I will no longer be playing this game and I wish I could get my money back.",1662475495,1662475495,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because it's fun as hell! The manic running back and forth between fueling cars, ringing up guests, fixing cars, washing cars, ordering products and supplies, it gets the blood going! 

As a fair warning, here's what's going to piss you off during the game:

- Dennis
- The sponge on the conveyor belt not working and the belt getting so grimy it doesn't move
- The highlight area in the repair mini games not working properly so you just end up removing the same bolt over and over
- The game stuttering and you drop an item into the basket at the conveyor belt without scanning it and losing your streak
- The ugliness (seriously, the character models are hideous)

I played and reviewed the ""Prologue: Early Days"" version of this game before the full game came out a while ago. Dennis has come by many times and spray painted what look like giant flying hairy penis's (lmao) on my Gas station, so I was happy to see that they added the ""Dennis Defense System"" at the end of the game, which was funny and unexpected.

Some of the things they added are the Garage and Car Wash. If i'm being honest, the Car Wash really could've just been DLC, but I do like the fact that you don't have to pay for water. You do have to clean the thing out to get the water pressure back up, which requires you to go underground into the sewers and pick up these Trash Bags that somehow made their way into the water and feed said Trash Bags to this Alligator that for some reason is just chilling there. The Garage, aka the Workshop, I don't have any thing to say about.

I also like the bus full of dancing people wearing Alien and Dinosaur masks that stops by, I remember seeing my first one and just thinking ""lmao what the hell!""

Not a bug, but I hate the Dust Storms. the game does start with a bunch of piles of sand that you have to get rid of using a tractor that eats fuel WAY to fast, but its kinda annoying when a Dust storm come by and puts a few down.

I was also surprised to see that you could pick the locks on the trunks of peoples cars, I remember when I saw the objective to pick 10 of them in 10 minutes for the first time, I didn't see it until I had like 3 minutes left and then panicked because I thought the Uncle was gonna come beat the shit out of me for not doing it on time, lol. ""Hey Nephew, you didn't break the law by picking 10 locks on the car trunks in 10 minutes, *punches Nephew* give me all of your money, NOW!!!""

Their are some flaws that I hope get fixed:

1. The shelves that you buy can totally hold WAY more items than they do. The items on all shelves should be a little bit closer together, the Newspapers should stand upright like the bags of chips do, the Ice Cream things I think should hold a bit more, and the one that makes the least sense to me is that the bottom shelve on the Alcohol stand is completely unused, which I don't get.

2. The lag is super annoying and it only seems to happen when their are a lot of cars and people around, which is often.

3. I sometimes have to click on something like 15 times in order to get it to do something.

4. Sometimes the camera will just randomly look up at the sky or down at the ground or just turn around by itself for no reason. I doesn't constantly happen, and isn't really that annoying, but its really weird.

5. The cars will just glitch out for no reason, like I purchased a truck full of toys, which was like thousands of in game dollars, when it decided to fall through the ground. I know theirs a few red buttons to reset the cars and trucks, but its weird.

Those are all the flaws.

Their is DLC for this game, and at the time of typing this, there is only the ""Can Touch This"" DLC, which just adds a few more expansions to the Garage and Warehouse, some new tools and the ability to change the materials the walls are made of, whereas as normally you could only paint the walls. Its only $3 or less if you get the bundle, so its not a huge waste of money, but I could care less for it. They are currently working the the free ""Party Time"" DLC which hasn't come out yet.

If you like time and people management games, it's for you. If you want realism, nah.

It's supposed to set on Route 66, but having actually driven the length of Route 66, I can confidently say that it represents the worst, saddest part of Route 66. The fact is, this is the gas station that's gone under and fights for a second chance, as very commonly seen along the route. The many ""Mom & Pop"" businesses that collapsed due to big box stores.

You get a rundown gas station and with the help of your uncle, set to turn it into a thriving, fully-functional gas station.  First, he teaches you the importance of laying the foundation of your future enterprise, communicated through a payphone and email. Gradually, he gives you tips on refurbishing the buildings, buying inventory, opening to the public and managing the logistics. Since he fronted you the money, you'll inevitably have to pay him back...or else.

Throughout the reno, you can upgrade the windows, paint, arrange the shelving, add workshops, turn it into your very own Gas City, complete with minions. It's truly a test of how well you can manage people, time, and inventory of a moderately-paced business while dealing with the occasional disaster.

The bugs are very minor. My ""issues"" are gameplay and mechanics-based.
-The dialog and response system falls short and is often nonsensical. ""That's just what I'm looking for"" is a common response after you pump someone's gas. I don't understand that response placement. The next time that I'm in Oregon, I think I'll say that, just because.
-If you don't scan an item or it gets knocked off of the belt, the customer complains about you trying to cheat them. Maybe they're uber-honest and want every pretzel to be paid and accounted for. I can respect the honesty, but it doesn't make sense that you'd get a thumbs down for an object defying physics and launching another across the room. That's usually not your fault.

[spoiler]-There's a lockpicking mini-game that you need, once. Afterward, it's useful for stealing change. I spent ""hours"" picking locks because why not? I pick the police cars, I picked the cars being fueled, I pick the cars stuck behind other cars. People don't care about the money in their car, but they want to make sure they paid for that bag of cookies. I think it'd be more practical to have a ""Press 'E' to open car door and steal money"" option. Continued lockpicking doesn't gain skill, nor are there consequences if someone sees you. All-in-all, the picking portion is a waste of time when there's little to gain by doing it and you have a never-ending supply of picks. [/spoiler]

It's not all bad...
-I do appreciate that the employees are not super talented ultra beings, though. They make mistakes, like everyone else. ---The employees also drop customer items, they're slow, they refuse to service the second car in the repair bay, etc. Just like IRL.
-The animations during vehicle repair.
-Subtle nods to other games.
-Painting is oddly relaxing.
-I like logistic simulation, so there's that.

 My rational mind struggles with this game, but I still play it b/c in its ridiculousness, it's fun. I like stocking items, seeing 3 instances of Generic Cop at once and scolding him for buying alcohol while in uniform, [spoiler]getting kneecapped (off-screen) when I don't repay a loan in a timely manner,[/spoiler] and running around checking on the workers, filling in where I need to, etc. The game has a lot of directions it wants to go, but never fully reaches any of them. It's the alphabet soup of PC games. I can see that the devs are very responsive to the players, so I hope some of the loose-ends get tidied up, within time.

Good = Active and responsive Dev team + some genuinely funny animal & NPC elements/interactions [spoiler] Dennis/party bus/sewer beast [/spoiler]

Bad = Poorly optimised, brain damaged AI, broken pathing, broken challenges, broken physics (can be fun for a laugh) + many many bugs
Ugly = Multiple reports of different crashing issues (Unreal errors, game won't launch, memory leak freezes, and more) with a noticeable uptick for Car Wash DLC users

Opinion = It's not a BAD game, but it's not especially GOOD either. Very meh. 
Most of the mini games/puzzles are copied from other games that just play better because they are focused. There IS stuff to do, but it's very shallow and repetitive, quickly devolving into push broom simulator.

I will revisit this review after the long promised patch and/or new DLC.

Restarting my PC, Running the game as administrator, deleting/re-installing the game, and updating all my drivers did not improve gameplay. And when I attempted to verify the game's files things got worse to where it won't even start. It just gives an error message saying that it could not be started. Deleting and re-installing the game does not even fix this. So now I am stuck with a completly dead game with no way to refund since it has been so long since I originally bought/played it.

They are good for your average sim game which is to say they are okay.

Gamplay
It is fun but if you don't like minigames this isn't the game for you, it can get very hectic with 5 different things to do at once. Thankfully later in the game you can hire employees to do what you don't want to do.

Audio
i mostly play while watching youtube but it sounds fine 

Audience 
pretty much anyone can play this game. Theme wise you probably want to stick to teens up

PC requirements
You don't need anything too insane the game runs fine but i do have a higher end system

Difficulty 
The minigames are fairly easy but it does require some attention. Economically you start off a bit strapped for cash, but as time goes on your typical economic snowball starts rolling 

Grind
The game does get progressivly more grindy requiring more tasks to rank up

Story
there is a story, but its not the reason you would play this game. I will say the 50s theme is really nice, except for when its broken by you having a computer. 

Game time
I am about 8 hours in and there is still many tasks  left to do. 

Price
buy this on sale 

Bugs. 
has as many bugs as any other sim game which is to say they are there but the game is playable. I will say after about 4 hours the game just crashed on me.

It feels a little scammy considering the first 8 hours of gameplay are USUALLY the 1st-2nd stage of sims, which is the case with this one as well. However, the depth of upgrades basically ENDS after just the first 2 upgrades. After which the game devolves into a grind simulator. Sure, you get more room and extra shelves. But after you get the car wash, the gameplay loop is repeated endlessly. Nothing new is really added, which really sucks. There's not enough customization. enough depth, enough individuality to make it worth it's $20 price tag, when sims like Weed Shop 3 are far better and cost less.",1659522759,1659522759,False,3,0,0.541967511177062988,0,True,False,False

Good:
Job wise, you start with a normal gas pump. then you sell goods (like food and drink), then a mechanics shop where the parts you buy are expensive but the pay is great! You get also upgrade to get additional gas pumps, goods to sell, and thinks to change out on cars. There are more businesses to my knowledge, but I've yet to unlock them.

The game also features well designed building mechanics, resource and staff management, and building customisation.

Bad:
Only two issue I have, are that the RNG based product price system can be annoying, as I had to wait maybe an in-game week for a good price on tires, though once I did get a good deal I basically bought the entire stock. And I'm currently in a loop where I can't afford to get the third upgrade because I'm always buying resources. Though I'm sure with time and investing in cheap products I'll be out of that situation soon.

The game can be very grindy and time consuming, even if you are getting fairly consistent deals on products/parts. I just spent almost an entire day playing it, and I'll probably have to limit myself more, either by playing less in a day, or playing less days in a week.

Feedback:
I know ""this game should have co-op"" is probably a very over used, and generic statement/request. But I think it would fit really well for this game. Either make the host wait until they unlock employees, and you can have a friend take the employees spot. Or a special ""co-owner mode"" where both players own the business together, and the game essentially functions as it normally would, but co-op. Having one player focus on one side of the business and the other focus on a different side would be good fun and require decent teamwork as to not have one player screw over the other buying buying 40 tires. I can definitely think of a few friends who would be down for that if it existed.

Also, screw Denis! Little brat!

The low overall score is a result of the game-breaking bugs and crashes that occur, even on a newly-purchased Alienware with AMD Ryzen 9, Radeon RX 6800 XT, and 32gb of RAM. The game crashes without failure. Guaranteed to crash within 10-15 minutes after I load my game at this point (I have just paid off my debt to the Uncle).

DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING until the developers have confirmed these crashes have resolved!

So i know there is a long awaited update about to be released for this game but i want to get this off my chest. #1 When painting with the roller, if you accidentally click on a piece that you don't want to paint you should be able to cancel the painting prompt rather then having to paint said piece a wrong color and then paint it again because there is no way to cancel. #2 The automatic car wash is broken, it works most times but..there have been quite a few instances where i would get stuck in the first portion of the wash and have to close the wash and then reopen for it to even do the animation and still wont complete the cycle. #3 I cant have more then one employee cleaning the station because they both battle each other for the same footprints on the floor and for the same garbage on the floor and nothing more gets achieved as a result, as of right now the only thing i can have more then one employee doing is pumping gas. #4 You should be able to place shelves and other like items on the floor and have it be perfectly aligned with the grid, all my stuff is mismatched because the game itself will NOT let me place items straight. (It's really annoying) #5 All my plants for decoration shrink in size every time i log off and back in again, it only fixes when i pick up the plant which turns it back to full size and then have to place it again. #6 The graphics constantly skew on me meaning people walking will have their feet stretched out or there head and things don't render properly being that vehicles pulling up to the station will have no rims on the vehicle (i'm only playing on medium graphics). #7 The optimization for this game is terrible, (for me anyway but running on a 1070 GTX) 40 + hours in and i'm yet to get decent frames. Other then that, really great game, super addicting and just flat out great to have fun with. Those are the main things i have issues with playing this game daily. The early days prologue ran better then the full version. If most of this gets fixed with the up coming update then that will be fantastic but until then i have a hard time playing the game at the level i'm at because of all the bugs and glitches and non rendering and the game just not recognizing that something that should be working is in fact not working.

There isn't some story to write out my dissertation and vent out lamentations over my failure at professional writing, so instead here are some pros & cons

[h1]Pros[/h1]

+ Looks nice (non-human things anyway)
+ Simple at first, lots of depth later
+ Mechanically concise and fun
+ + + Filling gas was reliably fun
+ Really have no issue with how your store grows
+ - - Notable exception to this; I really hate sandstorms. They're just frustrating and not fun to me
+ Gives a solid 15-20 hours of guaranteed content depending on how quickly you adapt
+ + + And obviously if you want to devote more time you can, just you will have NEW things in this span

[h1]Cons[/h1]

- Relatively low ceiling, I wanted heavier rushes, more complex problems, etc.
- - - No reason to expand shelving. I wanted refrigerated walls etc. My favorite part of working a gas station
- - - Additionally, modernity in general is lacking. I get it would be difficult but...
- Seems to have memory leaks, went from 200+ fps maxed to stuttering 40 fps toward the end of my 15 hours
- If you know how to mod, New Vegas crashes less than this.
- Employees need a lot of work
- - - Employees get stuck OFTEN and require firing to reset
- - - Employees are severely limited, let me tell them to work the car wash, promote one to be keyholder and tell others to go on break, make it really something interesting
- - - I feel there are many more ideas for employees off the table here; laziness meter, hustle, yada yada.

[h1]Ambivalents[/h1]

o Humans look rough but they grow on you
o Cashiering is a grab bag of ""That was really fun"" vs. ""The game fucked me""
o Dennis is just annoying and really doesn't serve a purpose that I could tell

A great game. I played the free demo and the actual game itself but the game is great. As i said in the other review on the free version I would love it to be a multiplayer it would be honestly the best thing ever to play with your friends, especially when you expand your gas station in the real game so much by adding more fuel stations and car wash etc. It gets quite hard to keep up with everything so the game is less enjoyable at times and even stressful. I know you can hire staff to help you out but they get tired in a couple of in-game hours (so a couple of min in real time) and you basically work alone most of the time. You also do earn money quickly but as quickly as you earn it as quickly it disappears so the money is quite an issue sometimes. Id love to see multiplayer mode in this game for around 3 players per game. I love how you can customize quite a bit of things. Also the DLC for the price IS SO WORTH IT.
NOTE: you do need a decent PC to run the game normally. I run a brick (sh?t laptop) and i have trouble playing the game even on the lowest settings.

I'm unclear on why someone would enjoy being a gas station employee.

- Cleaning up 25 bags of trash, in a row
- Mopping dirt off the floor constantly
- Picking up piles of sand and dumping them 10 feet away, over and over, forever
- Manually filling people's cars with gas like a basic b*tch from the '50s

Honestly you spend more time on menial labor than you do on, you know, running a gas station. Why do games always shy away from the business aspect in simulations?

I alt-f4ed out of the game because all I wanted to do was to clean up and maintain the gas station, not play some arbitrary mini-games that take too long and is too easy to screw up. 

It feels like punishment on top of punishment for playing the game. During the tutorial section that has you cleaning up all the trash, I was starting to think ""oh yeah... I'm gonna love this game"". It's a similar feeling to when you finish a section of a house in PowerWash simulator. I had all the little trash cleared out and the floor all swept up while running out to fuel up cars - I was digging it.

Then that creepy ass kid shows up and paints graffiti on the walls in the middle of all the other crapI'm trying to get done around the gas station. But to get the kid to go away, you've gotta throw something at him. Well, I don't have anything to throw at him because I JUST THREW IT ALL AWAY. So first I feel punished for trying to clean things up and not keeping trash around to throw at this kid. Then after the kid goes away and I try to paint over the graffiti, I've gotta play a mini-game that, if I screw it up (and I'm given several chances to do so PER WALL SEGMENT), I get punished again because paint gets splattered all over the ground. So because I cleaned up, I didn't have anything to throw at this kid who gives me another task to perform where I'm going to make a mess that... I have to clean up. Cleaning up = you'll have to clean more, but keep trash around = you won't have to clean as much.

Been following this one for a while now. Bought it this week but $hit, it's like the game doesn't want me to enjoy it...

The core gameplay loop is very, VERY fun. As the other reviewers say, it's pretty addicting. You just lose track how much time you dump to the game. There's always something to do, paint, figure out, organise exc. Progression was fun, as soon as I started to get bored from chores, employees unlocked. Balancing cash between gas, repair shop, products you sell, and upgrading your gas station was really, really enjoyable. If I saved some cash, I'd buy some decorations and slap them around the station here and there (more on this later). I played the game so hard, pretty much finished the story in 2 days. It was so satisfying to see a broken down small store with single pump to become a jewel of the desert with multiple employees running around, fixing cars, fueling, cleaning around, and selling stuff from the cash register. With the DLC, I really made an eye candy of a small business in the middle of the desert.

So why the negative review then? Man, the game needs sooo much improvement on QoL, movement, mouse / keyboard / UI annoyances, bugs and performance. It all comes back to my comment, ""it's like the game doesn't want me to enjoy it"". My pc is everything above the ""recommended system requirements"", but unfortunately, on medium settings I could barely pass 25, 30 FPS. Everything gets so much worse once you upgrade your parking lot and gas pumps, because all that means you get more cars and more customers. Gahhh damm, playing this game on 20 FPS avarage was still fun. I can even ignore the weird upside down walking - sitting in the car animation but walking in the shop - noodle arms and legs NPC's.  But around Fame level 7, $hit just starts to hit the fan too hard and game crashes VERY often bc there's so much going on. I wanted to push on, unlock and fully upgrade everything, but crashes being often as they are, I just gave up.

On the matter of DLC and customisation, I personally think it should have been included in the main game, but for the enjoyment I got from the game, I immediately purchased it to support the devs, especially since it was discounted. Unfortunately it doesn't really offer the customisation levels I expected. You can't paint walls with one click, or copy paste it on a different wall. You have to click, select the tile you want to install on a wall, seperately, every time. Considering there are 3 seperate buildings you could paint at the time of my progression, you can imagine the pain. There are some other QoL and freedom limits as to what and where you can paint that just makes customisation a pain in the a$$. You can't put decorations wherever you want too, there are specific spots and you can barely see them from all the shelves and other stuff in the shop. When I finished it, it looked kinda good, but man, it just drained my soul. 

Reason I went into this much detail was, hoping if the devs would see this review and act upon it.

Pros
- Perfect if you've got a few hours you need to waste as it definitely eats into your time
- The concept is great.

Unfortunately, that's kind of where the pros end... Now for the cons...

Cons
- Does not work very well with a controller. It's EXTREMELY awkward and half the mini games, like checking out customers and working on cars etc, the controller doesn't function at all. It's extremely janky. The controls for driving vehicles, is disgraceful. Forward/backward AND steering with the analogue stick? Are you kidding? This isn't 1996! Why is there no accelerator on a different button as standard?!
- The graphics aren't great... I'm able to play games at full 4k, with ray-tracing and everything and it doesn't even bother my PC. With all the graphic settings set to max, they still looked... Well.. Awful. Definitely not ''epic'' quality as the game states. More like 720p, 1080p at best.
- As many people have stated, the game crashes to desktop. A lot.
- Items flying up into the heavens... Funny at first but gets annoying SUPER quick
(EDITED: - 3/7/22) - I've recently discovered that sometimes, the mouse will stop functioning completely. You'll be clicking on stuff and it just won't do anything.
- Don't even get me started on object rotation... My OCD is FURIOUS with this!

At this point, I can't recommend the game unfortunately. Even after their ''hotfix'', there was nothing ''fix'' about it. Not when so many people are still mentioning the same issues. If these get sorted, I'll consider changing my review but until then, I really wouldn't bother, even while the game is on sale. Unless you REALLY want it. It's a shame because it has great potential.

Do you literally run a gas station, including pumping gas, stocking and scanning energy drinks, checking oil, and throwing out the garbage? Yes.

But do you also throw poop and broken beer bottles at annoying children? True.

Does your store sometimes get visited by roving bands of aliens and raptors who buy a ton of stuff but also make a huge damn mess? This does happen.

Do you at any point make friends with a crocodile? You're not gonna believe this, but yes.

12 hours playing this game may seem like a lot, but it really isn't I have yet to unlock everything, but I am getting there.  This game takes you through a story like setting, but you're still pretty free to make your own decisions throughout the game.  This is an old gas station which the main characters uncle used to own I believe.  It's something like that so that could be somewhat wrong.  Anyways the uncle pops up here and there giving you money in the beginning and tips and tricks that you can used to help yourself throughout the game.  It's a good thing to have the money just handed to you in the beginning, but the uncle wants that money back eventually.  You're in the beginning of the game so it's actually pretty hard to pay him back.  The uncle has his people, as he is sort of like a mob boss.  

Other things that happen are sandstorms and a lot of them.  This is an annoying aspect of the game to me but being in a desert this makes sense because it would actually happen if this was real life.

My most favorite aspect of this game is that there are minigames incorporated with everything that you do.  Like the workshop has its own minigames, which you can unlock more of as you move on throughout the game. 

There are other little challenges such as fixing the water pressure and making sure you have enough stock.

This gas station is on the same side of my building, therefore it's our go to place for snacks and gas, but not any more that's without a doubt! I've truthfully never encountered worse customer service in my life, it's as if the people who own it / work there, hate their customers. Time after time I've left here with a bad experience.

- a month ago my tire was flat, so I went inside to ask them to turn the air on, and the man said I needed to pay one dollar which shocked me because no other station has ever charged for air. I had to fill the air though and said okay then I'll pay with my card since I don't have cash on me. He said I can't pay with card for only 1 dollar. He literally didn't help me out at all, what has humanity come to? I would've just turned it on if I were in his position but he didn't. Thankfully a kind gentleman and his wife heard the conversation & paid for me. Then the very next day another woman in front me asked for the air to be turned on & he did not charge her at all & turned it on for free. When my fiancé asked him why he didn't turn the air on for me the day before, he said the lady goes there all the time so he didn't charge. Well guess what we are also there all the time, and that was clear DISCRIMINATION!

The experience I had today made me know for sure that from now on I'll NEVER go to this place again. Unfortunately I don't have water at home & rely on bottled water for drinking. This morning I realized I was all out, so I took my dog out for a walk and decided to quickly stop inside and purchase a bottle. My dog is actually a certified service dog, I carry his identification card in my wallet at all times incase of issues. As soon as I stepped in I quickly grabbed a bottle of water and took my money out to pay, and instantly the worker shouted at me saying ""NO DOGS ALLOWED IN HERE I WILL CALL THE POLICE AND YOU WILL PAY 300 DOLLARS!""

I have never been so humiliated, who does this guy think he is shouting at me like that? It is completely unacceptable and disrespectful. He could have informed me politely by saying in a calm tone that they don't allow animals inside, then I would've showed my dogs I.d. Card.

I was raised to show respect to everyone, however the people who work here clearly have no respect or common curtesy. I will never give them business again & I will tell every single person I know not to give this place business.

It's a fun game with more to it then you think, and that makes it a fun game.
At the start,,forget sitting there casualy sipping you morning coffe having a zen moment.. Aint gonna happen, there's stuff to do ^^ Well you can, but customers will stack up, and that's probably not a good thing in the end.
I'd call it a management game along with the simulator tag, a light vanilla one, but still, the aspect is there managing employees, filling up the warehouse with things being sold and so on. 
Also chasing that lil pest Dennis that keep tagging your station. My favourite weapon of choice it to throw a big a** sink in his head when he comes running. Usually does the trick.
You clean up the place, level up to unlock more stuff and buildings, level up you reputation being a nice capable station owner and so on.

Are there bugs? well not bugs per se as far as I've seen, more quirks that annoy me. like some cars ""hitbox"" are so big so when refulling you have to run around them to get to the pump, trash can't be rotated making it a frustrating throwing it in the containers if it's large trash like planks and what not.

(A little edit before reading below..it came to my attention that there is a option to turn off car horns for sweet sweet silence, though some honking could be nice, but not every 5s ^^ So me calling it HonkSim22 still stands valid ) ;)

AND this is the part making me call it honking simulator..
All customers in this game are total a**hats with ZERO patiens or respect, so when that poor guy that refills my gas is at the back is refulling, he is blocking the only way out (God forbid they'd drive around him) hence they run their cars straight up his ""Trallalaa"" and honk their horn every 3-5s or so and guess what, on a busy day the cars stack up behind him.
My kingdom for a shotgun ingame to go Falling Down on them in true Michael Douglas style.
Also that delivery guy at mu warehouse,,he is also a total d***, honking while I'm opening the door..dude the door can't open any faster, chill!
*Breathes heavily with blood pressure closing in on 230/130* ;)

That said.. Fun game, worth the money and they are still doing updates and a second DLC incoming.

=============================================================


I'd hold off for now, there are some serious issues with the game currently.

-Game crashes to desktop intermittently
-Frame rate crashes are common
-items will fall through the world
-during some mini games items will freak out and penalize you because of janky physics interactions (think g-mod)
-No way to sell/remove excess placeable decorations or shelves
-Pretty much everything was a pre-made asset based on the lack of congruity in design
-All the honking, I swear Bangladesh, Egypt, and New York combined couldn't match the amount of honking in the game
-It's supposed to be in america but it uses british terms/units for things (Bathroom/Restroom is acronymed as WC for Water Closet, fuel is done in liters, not gallons, etc.)
-You have no inventory management tools but are expected to manage inventories for goods
-Shelving units hold very little for their size due to sheer inefficiency of space usage which makes no sense for a convenience store
-a can of snuff (chewing tobacco) takes as much room in the warehouse as a replacement car tire as the ware house stores based on individual items, not on number of cases of goods
-You can't clean the walls, you can only repaint them, and they get so dirty you have to repaint them like, every 4 days
-Lots of misalignment issues (Shelves can't be squared to walls, the tire mini game has holes in the rotors to 'screw' the lugnuts into that don't align with the holes on the old or new tire, some walls extend past where they are, etc)
-Trash and dirt can generate in areas customers can go to but the player cannot (namely, inside bathroom stalls)
-garbage cans fill up in a way that makes sense for game mechanics, where as the dumpsters you put the trash in are 'let play jenga with wonk physics and no item rotational controls for placement!' which makes some larger pieces of garbage and trash nigh impossible to get rid of without taking an absurd amount of time
-Removing/placing lugnuts place a cheap electric drill sound, like the kind you use to drive screws, which is just plain silly
-Cops drive around with their lights on at all times
-Delivery drivers for shop goods get out of their trucks and wait for you to put everything in the warehouse shelves PRIOR to moving to get back in the truck making it take at least 2x as long than it should for unloading based on how small of quantities you can actually order in due to how the warehouse works",1632070335,1653455031,False,1,0,0.485446006059646606,1,True,False,False

1) Optimized performance
2) The ability to close the workshop on its own or to lower workshop supply prices.
3) Being able to paint bathroom stalls, you cannot reach the inside door frame of a bathroom stall after it has been bought or pickup trash from inside the stall, this is annoying to me even though I cannot see it.

After buying this game I thought I'm just going to nip and have a quick go to see what it's all about, that's where my first mistake was, many hours later I finally managed to save the game, close it down & go to bed, once the sun had come up. 

It's surprising how addictive this game is, from working the checkout and scanning items through the till, to sweeping the floor and emptying the bins, and taking them out to the skips outside, not to forget to remember to go outside and fuel up people's cars. Not only remembering to do all that you have to remember to keep a check on your stock levels for fuel and items in the warehouse for your shelves. 

Then when you level up enough you get to add the workshop to tackle cars, from flat tyres, cracked mirrors and scratches on the paintwork. Once you level up more items get added to that like coolant and oil changes, too flat batteries and spark plugs. It can get very busy at the gas station but luckily help is on hand when you get to the level to employ staff. 

It was a massive step once the carwash became available, washing your first car and paying gustaf a visit down in the sewers. And once you hit the right level you can flip the switch to turn the car wash to automated, and watch the money roll in. 

One thing to watch out for is Denis running around graffitiing your walls, definitely keep an eye on him and have the paint brush ready to paint over his lovely artwork. 

There's so many more things I could tell you about this game, but the one thing I will say is go buy it and enjoy it for yourself because you will lose a lot of hours playing it.

At the moment I would gladly like to recommend the game on sale (I purchased at a $16 price tag). Although I cannot recommend at full price. Mainly because of the DLC. Now I wouldn't be bothered by the DLC if they didn't lock progression like gas station levels, employees to hire, and popularity levels behind the paid DLC. Those are things that arguably should be added as free DLC. Honestly the other things sold in the DLC are worth the DLC price alone so making progression free would only encourage others to buy the DLC (because really the only reason I'm getting the DLC is for the cosmetic options). Now let's talk gameplay. It's a very fun minigame fest/ management sim. Some minigames are great like working the register or workshop, but others are tedious and annoying like painting (Seriously. The bigger your place gets the longer you'll spend playing that boring minigame of just pressing RMB to keep a marker inside a green zone while you stare at a wall. I'd rather have that minigame removed entirely since it slows down the gameplay way too much). Managing your store is good as well, but there is still one really annoying flaw with cleaning. The floor blends footprints too well. Had so many times when I couldn't fill my cleanliness meter because there was one footprint I could not find and it drove me insane (a simple fix would just be to either change the default floor or to highlight dirty spots when you pull out the broom like how it highlights trash when you pull out a trash bag). Placing things can be pretty annoying as well (please add an option to snap objects in 45-90 degree angles as well as snap to a grid so it can be easier to make everything line up straight). Now for features I would really like devs to add if they actually end up reading this: First if we can get an option to play music playlists over an intercom from youtube or your own personal library so you can play your own music while you work (becasue who hasn't dreamed of being able to control what music plays at work lol). Second is to add Multiplayer some day (I know that's a giant request but it's sad simulator games don't take advantage of multiplayer since that'd add so much more meme potential and longevity alone). Lastly An option to not have everything open would be nice. I don't care for running a workshop as much as I do care for running the station so If there was an option to just close the workshop and keep the gas station open (or vice versa) then that would be great.

The early stages can be addicting enough, but quickly becomes extremely tedious.  As you upgrade your Gas Station, you would think the money would come in faster, but it is the opposite.  You can not keep up with all the tasks, cannot hire enough people fast enough to tend to the many tasks, cannot maintain an inventory of fuel or goods, and you certainly will not be paying back any loans on time.  The economy and mechanics are a mess.  For example, after opening the Repair shop, if you run out of inventory or cannot get to the customers in time, there is no way to close it until you recoup some money, hire a Mechanic or get inventory.  You are just stuck watching your popularity go down.  The Devs needs to play test and polish, but instead they add DLC that is equally broken.

You don't/can't sleep, and the customer traffic is insane. You can hire up to three employees, however you, as the owner, must act like an employee, even after you complete everything. Emptying trash and cleaning floors, and painting walls. Your gas station? You can't afford doors. I mean, this seems to be the only reason they didn't include them, because they aren't available. In the Desert, with sand, that gets everywhere. Employees can only work so long, and there are too many items to manage for it to be fun later, but at least you can enjoy it early. Bugs are there, however nothing absolutely game breaking at the time of this review, and can be kind of funny seeing someone float through your building like they are driving a car. More building expansion and employee hiring are badly needed to make the game worth it. Despite this, it's worth it for the beginning, just don't expect satisfaction at the end, just chaos.

Edit: After Car Wash and latest patch.. Adding more complexity to chaos does not make for a satisfying experience. Garbage ray gun... was an addition to the game and has a net 0 effect on game play. Removing the need to paint, and adding inventory data from your warehouse are welcome additions, allowing the ability to not have to wait for drivers to exit delivery trucks is a step forward. That said,  the end game is still tedious without the ability to hire a manager, work with employee shifts, or hire an additional employee. An automated ordering system needs to be added to another warehouse level. Product diversity needs to be expanded.Allow users to customize their own apartment.. not that they can ever use it. ADD DOORS. Yes, this will limit your view of the front of the store for fuel customers, and yes, it will limit your view on the back door for deliveries, however you get notices of customers and deliveries, plus employees can do it later. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY ADD DOORS. Limit the sweeping, you're in a desert without doors... YOU ARE IN A DESERT WITHOUT DOORS WITH STRANGELY FREQUENT DUST STORMS. I would buy a 99 cent DLC that just added doors, nothing else, just doors with a wonderful little chime when customers enter. Is this hard? Why is this so hard? WHY WON'T YOU GIVE US DOORS?

I have been playing on the Steam Deck with a community controller profile too. It plays pretty well on that platform too.

I spent a half hour simply painting and cleaning the buildings of my business yesterday. Somehow, that's enjoyable. It might just be my new zen activity.

I'm not a geek nor hardcore gamer.  And like most, once the latest update was released I shook my head and cussed them out.  Well, apparently I shook my head and screamed long enough it jarred something loose. 

Other than 1 crash after achieving a level upgrade and while not having experienced EVERY bug people are ranting about since the latest update, those I've experienced (guess  over 50%) CAN be overcome and I dare say ARE part of the game. 

It requires thinking totally outside the box....or having dementia.  Logic and common sense don't always apply. If you can remember that, it's a game changer.

My opinion of this game has gone even higher once this method to Drago's madness was understood.

 There is a fine line between insanity and genius.  Drago crosses the line on both sides.

Since my first review and the developers response, the product has changed and.

Drago Entertainment has addressed the criticism and defused the mechanics as far as can be seen. With the version 1.0.2.46397 is also the CrashReportClient.exe disappeared.

Whats left? Social platform ,- and advertising remains and they are optional... I have not to mention that companies like Facebook (inclusive Instagram), Twitter and Co have their own mechanics to track users with pixels and Cookies but in this case users must take action to activate them.

Unfortunately, Drago Entertainment do not respond to a request made. Thus, a hundred percent statement on current mechanics is currently not given

The game play is fun and addictive. Everything in the base game is easy upgrade without too much grinding if any. However my main problem is the car wash they added in the update. It IS a grind.

The game is fun, I would give it an overall (if you like simulation) 7/10. There are some tedious/odd behaviors in the game, and there are some features in dire need, like most games, but overall it's decent if you want to spend $20 on a game, as I feel it's worth that. 

Tedious features: 
- Limit of 5 employees but none can do stocking/procurement (ordering) 

QOL features needed: 
- At least 2 more employees; 1 for stocking continual on the shelves and 1 for ordering, they can work in the warehouse, gives it more use 
- Paint that lasts longer (I live in AZ and we paint our houses about every 3-5 years, not every 3-5 weeks) 
- Fuel trucks that don't block traffic 

Nonsense existing features: 
- Fuel trucks that block traffic flow 
- Customers that complain and ask if you're ripping them off when you give them free items 
- A car wash that has a dirt path on exit (literally no sense made here)

I found many angles of the game oddly satisfying, and there is a baked-in sense of humor to most things. It is 100% a Dad-Game/Time Waster. If it weren't for the complex mechanics of the game itself, it would have no issue being a mobile hit. Unusually, this is not to it's detriment.

You can min-max the hell out of this game. I think it's theoretically possible to handle 4-5 employee tasks by yourself. Having employees merely takes the weight off so you can attempt a 24/365 station.

That being said, very buggy, very crash-prone. Most players do not recommend you try to run the station for longer than a few days before closing to ""reset the cache"" of the game, basically. The game does auto-save regularly, and the game loop itself lends to crashes not having much impact on your fun.

Look up the best-performance settings for this game if you want to play it. The stock graphics settings had the frame rate so choppy I almost gave up then and there.

I recommend playing it if you're into mindless task-sinks, but look up the setup for graphics/performance/errors, this will crash, and the frame-rate without is abysmal.",1650757102,1650757102,True,6,1,0.57545769214630127,0,True,False,False

The main issue is that the game runs terribly, even on low graphics you'll often have the game get sudden stuttering that requires tabbing out or a full restart to fix, otherwise you play a slower and slower powerpoint until you can't even open the menus.

Basically if you want a decent game, and have a modern pc with plenty of spare RAM, you can probably enjoy this. If you have a pc a couple years old with other games installed you might want to steer clear, especially since the gameplay is a less-polished house flipper, with minor mechanics such as toy car racing or lockpicking which you never use after the tutorial.

Edit: So since my refund was refused despite the technical issues I've been playing some more, and my opinion has been expanded. Firstly lockpicking can be used on cars for tiny amounts of cash that frankly aren't worth it, deliveries take forever and supplies are so expensive that backlogging wheels or other car-repair parts is pretty useless. The car wash takes forever, and is highly unsatisfying compared to Powerwash Simulator that it takes the mechanic from, dust-vision included. (They didn't even change the colour.) Repairing vehicles feels very clunky and slow despite trying to make you feel like it's against the clock with it's countdown. 
BUT
Unlocking the ability to hire workers to perform tasks FOR you is certainly a saving grace for this game, but that made me realise...this game is so unfun that the best part is having the game play itself for you...
Guess I'll keep playing to get achievements and will note down any changes in opinion later.
Also I'm playing on the lowest graphics settings, NPC's will sit down in midair and fly to their car, or have parts of their flesh clip to other parts of them, such as hands to foreheads or hair to feet. The game still will freeze and even be unresponsive when loading a save, and when most of the mechanics are reflex based the freezes are a big issue. The progression of the game is FAR TOO SLOW. You should be hiring people and getting the business moving twice as soon at least!
Edit 2: Just had a crash-to-desktop for no discernible reason...yay.

Edit 3: Nevermind 11/10 ||the spaceship crahses into the airplane.||
The reward for completing the game is useless because it provides a defensive tool against a problem you can just...turn off in settings? 
Honestly this game was a laggy repetitive mess, if they aimed for a management simulator they seem to have talent in designing that, but as a first person experience with minigames this was extremely dull and buggy.

Gas Station Simulator is a really fun sim game. The premise is simple, you buy a dilapidated gas station in the middle of the desert, you slowly restore and upgrade it by serving customers, earning money and upgrading your facilities to unlock more services. It's starts off basic, you clean up the small building by picking up trash, throwing it out into a large skip to be collected and taken away, you sweep up the mess, and restore your gas pump. Now you can serve customers, you have to arrange deliveries of gas and then manually serve each customer to make a profit.

As you progress you expand your building size, you can add a shop where you order goods, stock shelves and serve customers. Meanwhile you unlock decorations for your gas station, expand the building size, add toilets, add more parking spaces to allow for more customers. In the later game you unlock a garage where you can perform maintenance on customers vehicles, and lastly you unlock a wash station with a power washer. Things become very hectic by this point so you unlock the ability to employ staff who you can instruct to automate different jobs like operating pumps, cleaning etc.

The game has a lot of breadth to it but not a lot of depth, there's a lot to do in different areas, but each task is relatively simple. Management doesn't allow things like setting prices and balancing books, you just order goods. Most of the manual tasks to pump gas, wash cars or serve customers are simple yet enjoyable mini games which take less than a minute. Most of the fun comes with the sense of progress as you expand and improve your station from a dirty run down hut to a large well decorated efficient station.

I got about 25 hours out of the game to finish the main storyline and unlock everything. People have mentioned bugs like crashing, I only had 1 crash to desktop. People also mentioned performance, it ran fine for me in 4k max settings and the game looks really quite nice for a sim, however I do have an RTX 3080. Performance does dip later in the game because there's way more customers and buildings unlocked but it wasn't significant for me, there's a lot of graphical options to lower if you have an older PC. There still is a few minor bugs, nothing game breaking. People also complained about painful loading times but again for me with a good PC they were very fast. If you have an older PC then I'd recommend trying the free demo first to gauge performance.

Definitely worth the asking price for fans of sim games.",1650373712,1650373712,True,1,0,0.520573079586029053,0,True,False,False

The problems are technical, well and a really negative business practice.

Ok the game is HARD on your GPU.  My 2080 Super sits at the power limit 100% of the time at full tilt.  It delivers a steady 60fps but jesus your hardware works for it.  To put it in perspective, no other game taxes the GPU so hard.  Not satisfactory, not Elden Ring, no any other unity game Ive come across.  The devs really need to work on engine efficiency here.  
Then there are the glitches, bugs and the like but I suppose they can be expected for a early access game.  But there lies the issue.  The devs are announcing DLC for a game that is not yet released.  Worse the DLC is just parts of the game design currently missing from the game as it is now.  

This could be a good game but right now it is shallow with many facets missing, it's not anywhere near done.

I would rate this game a 9/10 only for the purpose of it having a few bugs which frustrate me quick a lot. 
There's some extreme lag at times which is annoying when working the till, repairing cars etc. But the worst lag is when I am using the car wash, it makes washing cars take ages!
There's also been a good number of times where I am scanning items at the till and they just fly off of the worktop without me even touching them. This causes a nasty reaction from the customer!

Pro's:
Keeps you intertwined for hours. (I played this for 4 hours straight when it was done downloading.)
There's almost literally everything you can do in this game.
The graphics really do actually look good. Even on lower settings. (Mines is set to medium to not kill my laptop)
All around it's an amazing experience playing this game. I really can't say much more besides it's Fantastic. Litereally no other words to describe it. Honestly. Sims like these are the best to play. Specially something like this.

Now for the hard part..

Con's:
There's no running, which sucks when i have like 10 cars sitting out and i have to try my best to get to everyone of them at a steady walking pace.
The LMB doesn't always work when it needs to. I had a perfect 40 car gas line. The one time, i had everything perfect. And it didn't click and went over so i clicked more times and it finally worked.
Ruby doesn't always work with controls, runs clunky and doesn't always pick up the sand. I'll hold the button, and it won't work, I'll let go and click 100 times then it'll work.
Sand doesn't always get picked up or go away after three times of picking it up. Like in front of the car wash. I tried picking it up but none of it has moved anywhere.
The glitches with the NPC's cars and objects. Take a tire off then go to pick it up and it jus fall's through the floor. I don't know how may tires i have in my workshops floor, but there's A LOT at this point.
Picking up trash or anything like that doesn't always work when it need's to. It does the same thing as the tires in the workshop. it jus fall's through the ground. Or flips around like it is goat simulator. That get's old when trying to clean up the station.


Other than that. Everything about this game really is amazing. I actually really love this game and I'm NOT giving it up. AS i said in the Pro's, this game is fantastic. I mean that. Jus those few thing's would be great if they got fixed. If you guys are already working on a patch for them awesome. If not. 
Please please PLEASE come out with a patch for that. This game is wonderful. I apperciate that you did make it and again, I'm never giving this game up. I watched Markiplier play it and i wanted it. I hadn't heard about it till then. Thank oyu for making this game. It really is awesome. Jus please Please PLEASE make a fix to those things. THis game would be 20% better. It's already 3,000,000% amazing. So the 3,000,020 Would be even better.
Thank you for making this game and I will suggest it to people more regardless of Con's.

The endless amount of bugs and extremely unbalanced gameplay makes this game in to the fantastic and enjoyable experience that is today. Alligator, yes alligator, the one true alpha animal in the entire animal kingdom, but you as a mere gas station owner is capable of taming it by giving it trash. Yes trash, the same trash that you throw your greased up avocado toast paper towels in, that trash. But it does not matter what you throw in the trash since the aligator will eat it all. And then there are the sand storms, yes the sandstorms from the good ol days back in Ohio plains, the ones that you as a child used to play in, the ones that scratched up your parents cars pain job, which caused it to rust. That old sand storm. But this time my nemesis mr sand storm does not destroy the cars, instead it somehow lands underneath them and lifts them a couple feet above ground.  And then there is uncle, a wanna be gangster, who inreality just wants to be your uncle. He does not want to beat you up, but when you do not pay him up, then he is not able to pay for is mothers medicine, and that is why he has to beat you up. 

This is a formal complaint against the employee named Max. Max has recently begun eating the trash, we can no longer tolerate his disrespectful behavior. We wish that he stops eating my trash and instead starts eating his own trash. Thank you for cooperation. If you do not feel like cooperating i will personally can UNCLE and tell him your adress. You might have heard that i recently called uncle a softie, well i was lying. Uncle is the most brutal man in the world, he is capable of destroying the entire world with a snap of his fingers, he is more powerful than spiderman, ironman, robloxman and even thanos. He is litteraly a god, he can create worlds without blinking he can destroy entire religions without thinking,  he is even capable of inverting your entire DNA without even knowing your original DNA structure. He can call upon Jesus and Moses and Mohammed, and together gods prophet shall together become the holy trinity, more powerfull than all buddist gods together, more powerful than Thor and more powerful that lego. And you might not believe me, and that is to you to decide, but my advice is to listen to my words or else....

DNS or domain name server is a server that is used for converting ip adresses and domain names. It is split into two groups, forward lookup zone and reverse lookup zone. Forward is used for converting domain names to ip adresses, while reverse is used for converting Ip adresses to domain names. When you request an adress the DNS server checks if it has it, and if it does sends it back. Then the adress is saved in a DNS cache in your local host. If it is not capable of converting, then it is sent up the hierarchy of dns servers and then sent down through the different layers untill it is found. For this to be possible a route has to be found. The most common routing protocoll used today for routing is BGP or border gate protocoll. It finds a relatively fast route to the target destination and then send the IP packages. For all this to work everything has to be split up into some sort of categorization, and that categorization is called the OSI modell.
It is split into 7 parts.

I like the gameplay, but I can't recommend this game in its current state. When things are going well, you'll keep playing the game for hours. However, you'll quickly encounter many bugs that may take the fun away or even block you from progressing. These bugs include problems such as you not getting the fuel you have paid for, customers not moving at all (thus blocking the gas pumps and the garage, forcing you to ""call the aliens""), and of course crashing. There are a lot of less severe flaws such as pathfinding issues for both the employees and the customers, but they don't prevent you from enjoying the game.

In summary, I don't recommend that you get the game yet. If you want to buy the game while it's still on sale, don't go over the 2h mark in case the bugs start, well, bugging you. Then you can save a bit of money and get a good game for a good price if they ever fix it, and return it if they don't.

Ps. I'll change the review from negative to positive when the game is stable on my PC. After all, it is a good game when you disregard its issues!

Update 17.3.2022

I tried another run after a long break (five months), but couldn't even get my fuel refilled (one of the first tasks in the game). It upsets me that bugs are nowadays such an issue everywhere.

Please ignore the play time as most of it wasn't timed.  Easily triple or more that amount.

You can turn off the two annoying aspects of the game too, which is nice.

There's a zen quality when you get in to the groove, and because the customers don't ask you stupid questions, or otherwise annoy you, retail is a relaxing but fast paced waste of time.  Throw on a play list or audio book and enjoy.

There's a story too, which you can still enjoy even with the background sound of the aforementioned options, however the sound track is worth listening to for a while.  Not too long.

Not unlocked the car wash yet, but now that I know how to hire a second and third member of staff, it'll be far easier to get through.

Watch a few streams and make up your own mind.

Seems the publisher/developers have other similar games in mind too.  One to keep an eye on I reckon.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] 4/5
I played through the short story. It's nothing too fancy, but it is what you'd expect from a game like this. The game can feel tedious in a bad way at times, but mainly when you're using the register and the damn item didn't scan, or you somehow caused another item to fly off the screen before it was scanned. [b]The game is buggy at times, it may crash occasionally. That doesn't stop the game from being enjoyable as long as it works.[/b] Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good sim game or a game to chill on. Just watch where your broom goes, you could send a car into the next dimension.

[b]Graphics/Appearance:[/b] 5/5
The graphics aren't cutting edge AAA graphics, but for a sim game like it this, the graphics are pretty adequate. The interfaces are easy to use, but my main gripe is that when I'm purchasing outdoor decorations, the game takes a bit to respond. Overall, though, I don't have many complaints about the game.

[b]Audio:[/b] 3/5
The ambient sound and music is great, but the voice lines are very commonly repeated and are slightly annoying at times. I understand the game is probably developed by a small team, maybe even 1-2 people in total, but sometimes hearing the same ""Super!"" line from the same voice actor, two customers in a row gets a bit old. Also, the horns. The excessive horn spam is honestly the worst part of the game. I don't mind a horn or two here or there, but hearing 4 or 5 cars honking endlessly because the fuel truck is refueling my pumps makes me want to bonk these cars into another dimension with my god broom.

[b]Challenge/Management:[/b] 4/5
The game isn't super challenging, but can be a bit stressful when you got yourself a party bus and the 30-40 people that seem to appear out of thin air are creating a mess of your floors and emptying your stock while you also have several cars to refuel and a car to repair. Having employees is a must. I would like to see a shift manager eventually though. Having to figure out if my register still has an employee on it by walking through the building and seeing 6 dudes in line isn't fun. It would be nice to see a feature where I can enable an auto pay (so long as I have money in the bank), and employee 1 can work days, while employee 2 works nights.

[b]Variety:[/b] 4/5
Sim games either have a lot of variety within their topic of choice or not at all. GSS has a decent amount of variety right now, but teases more (maybe a later update?). There's just enough to enjoy, while not being too much where it becomes overwhelming. Just make sure you keep your shelves stocked.",1631995217,1645901743,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Balance-wise, the garage feels like a waste of time and money as you progress, and failing to pay loans isn't as punishing as rewarding if you're broke and your warehouse is empty.

The first 10 hours of the game are pretty solid fun. You'll get to take a gas station from nothing to a fully functioning hub including a garage and lots of products to sell, and you'll have employees running tasks for you too. 

Sometime after that it gets a bit grindy, and you'll start to notice lag. Turns out the more you unlock your car park spaces, and the more customers you therefore get, the laggier the game becomes. There's definitely an issue here because it gets laggier and laggier indefinitely, until you hit the ""reset customer"" switch at which point you're back to a smooth 120 fps. Major bug - needs fixing.

At around the 13 hour mark you'll finish the main quest, but there's still plenty to unlock. However, the game just seems to be incomplete at this stage:-
- Random ""challenges"" to help gain station rep are either impossible (serve 40 customers in 3 minutes?! with one kiosk?) or broken (get 40 tips in 5 minutes - practically impossible but the tips you get don't count so it's always 0/40 anyway)
- Station rep after level 7 is about 1% per 20 minutes, and there's nothing new or fun to help you grind (seems the challenges could fix this, if they worked)
- The car wash is, unfortunately, just not enjoyable. Even at level 3 it lacks any real fun factor; and the money you get from it doesn't scale upwards at all despite it being the most expensive thing to upgrade.

Here's my suggestions to the devs, to make this game 100% stellar:
- Add player progression i.e. skill tree. Even the employees have skills to level up, so it seems an oversight that the player does not. Ideas off top of my head: [FUEL] Increased income from fuel tips, lower fuel consumption. [REGISTER] Belt gets dirty slower (levels 1-5, 5 is no dirty belt at all?), increased income from tips. [MAINTENANCE] wider brush radius, larger bag / bin capacity, faster painting, slower car wash blockages. [MECHANIC] Lower component prices, increase tip income (nb i'm not even sure you can get tips yet, but make it possible if not), Add #chances to lock picking. [MANAGER] Reduce staff payments, increase walking speed, accept warehouse deliveries automatically, unlock product auto-replenish
- Let staff get tips too, from say skill level 7 being 50% change to 90% chance at level 10. 
- Add recycling bin at the garage to either get a small income on used up old tyres/garage components (when you order trash pickup) or randomly generate new components every so often
- Add an extra kiosk on max garage upgrade
- Make the car wash more effective with each upgrade, and give better income from the customers. Add a sponge/bucket to pick up to quickly wipe in a large radius.
- Add crouch to the game, or lift cars up on the car wash a little.
- Add the capability to clean walls which can be levelled up and is much faster than re-painting.
- Have painted, clean walls influence garage reputation gain
- Allow outdoor decorations to be placed freely (except on ""roads"")
- Add auto-replenish feature - accessed from computer. Can set parameters like max price per product, only buy product when price is green, % shelf space to fill, and an overall ""min cash in bank"" setting to make sure player account isn't emptied. Can also drag/drop products to prioritise which to buy when cash is low, and set a schedule/trigger (1 delivery per... or deliver when stock is...).
- Fix challenges, although with the above changes they might be more viable anyway. But some of them don't work at all so review them and overhaul.

The reason it was on my wishlist was actually because of Josh Strife Plays, who interviewed one of the employees/owner I think of DRAGO about another game. I personally am not really attracted to the whole route 66 theme. But I do love a good simulation game and therefore bought it.

Whilst writing this review, I still don't know what rating to give this game. I had fun, but I can name a mile of negatives. So here we go with my + and - list.

Positives:
+ Its a solid simulation game with a good theme
+ There is some story, but not real deep
+ Every task has a fun mini game
+ You can decorate your own store
+ Gameplay loop is nice, you'll lose track of time
+ Very satisfying to go from a dump to a nice running gas station

Negatives:
- They opt for realism in a lot of things, like the painting job of your walls will fade over time/get dirty. So you have to repaint them. Which is fine, but the walls have a clear line of sections where you paint. So you pretty much end up with walls always having these very obvious lines on them. Either give the line a fade, or don't make the paint fade at all.
- Speaking of the painting of the walls, you could say just repaint them. But you barely have time to do so. You almost always get overwhelmed with tasks. You think to hire an employee, but you're very limited in the amount. And you can't make the employee ""do whatever is needed"", only 1 specific task.
- The menu's for getting decorations and features is very confusing. It's easy to forget which menu is which and buying the upgrades is very slow. Plus you have 0 choice in what types of decoration you buy (at least outside of your shop). It's just padding to spend money to 100% the game.
- I've no idea why lockpicking is in the game. Maybe it's just me, but I just don't wanna steal things in my simulation game, or at least have a choice to. I didn't lockpick at all aside from the tutorial, so I have no idea if it gives benefits.
- Cleaning cars takes ages, so I just closed the car wash as soon as I completed the quest.
- I'm very easily scared, thus why I like to go for simulation type games. I know there is a sense of realism and probably won't be scared. Game broke my faith by me having to go in the sewers and hearing a growl not knowing what it is, then later I saw it was a crocodile in the water. After I HAD to move through the water. Scared the shit out of me, was debating to quit.
- Theres still some bugs, like a lot of the time when I pick things up, they don't move with my cursor. I fix it by repicking it up. Not that bad, just a bit annoying. Also sometimes the trash just dissapeared into the ground or something, not sure if that was a good or a bad thing. And the grey haired people look like they have glowing white hair, even though I have max settings.
- Cash register mini game makes NO sense, why not have the basked on the other side of the register? Well, to make the mini game actually have some challenge to not have it fall in. But if it does fall in, it's given for free and you lose money, but that's not the only thing. If you give away stuff for free, the customer is UNHAPPY? Why? Also I failed the minigame several times because of the item just getting yeeted into oblivion without  me doing anything.

I really really want to give this a positive review. But I think I just can't. There's better games for lower cost. Even though I dislike early acces models, it would've been more fair on the game if it was early access, cause that is what it feels like.",1645308749,1645308749,False,34,2,0.652888119220733643,0,True,False,False

The beginning of the game is pretty interesting. It's fun to grow your own gas station and increase customer satisfaction.
序盤はそこそこ面白いです。自分のガソリンスタンドを大きくして顧客満足度を上げていくのは楽しいです。

The problem comes after level 6 or later. It's the same thing over and over again, and you want to hang your head and I want to know, ""I can do this forever and never get a dime? and the feeling of fatigue only increases. There is no growth, no exhilaration, no fun things.
問題はレベル6ぐらいを超えてからです。同じ事の繰り返しで、「これを延々やっても1円も貰えないんだよね？」と疲労感だけが増していきます。成長も爽快感も楽しさもありません。

You have to visually identify and order the missing products. It is not possible to order shortages in bulk.
足りない商品は目視で見分けて発注することになります。不足分一括発注のようなことはできません。

We have a maximum of four employees (I mean two or three people short of a proper shift). I don't know about American labor laws, but this is terrible. 
従業員は最大4名で、適正なシフトには2人か3人足りません。アメリカの労働基準法は知りませんが、これは酷い。

Below average. I don't think I will play again unless there is some major update.
平均以下。何らかの大型アップデートがない限り、もうプレイしないと思います。

[Edit]【追記】
First of off, there was an error in my first review. You can hire up to five employees. I apologize about this.
まず最初のレビューに誤りがありました。従業員は5名まで雇えます。誤記をお詫びします。

Now, in the most recent version update as I write this, a car wash was added, but there're no particular replay-ability features ""a crocodile"" in the basement (and car wash). But still it just repeats similar things endlessly.
さて、これを書いている直近のバージョンアップで地下のワニ（と戦車）が追加されましたが、含めて特にリプレイアビリティはありません。似たような事を延々繰り返すだけです。


どうせ延々と同じ事を繰り返して楽しみたいなら、例えば、アメリカのある（ニセの）町の警官になって車両事故を処理したり強盗の調査をしたり、ヨーロッパ（あるいは、アメリカ）中を走り回って荷物を届けたり、自動車工場で次々に車を修理しつつ自分の車を買うための貯金をしたり、といった方が楽しいです。
If you're just going to do same thing over and over again, it would be more fun to be, for example, to be a cop in an american (fake) city and deal with car accidents, investigate robberies or aggravated assaults, and/or drive around Europe or North America and delivering packages, and/or save up to bu your car while fixing customer's car after another at the auto shop.

Ability to add custom music to radios

TL;DR Pick it up at a low price. Hours of fun. A buggy mess

I've been playing it a lot over the last few days. In that time i have fully upgraded everything and have all staff members and i have really enjoyed my time with it, however.. its buggy. Really buggy.
In the time Ive been playing ive had about 10 crashes, 3 on the last 20 minutes of playing. 

The physics are fairly broken, things dropping through the map when trying to pick them up and the AI (calling it that is a bit if a stretch) is terrible. Ive had to move stalls around simply because a character couldn't figure out how to walk around something.

There are other things i could mention that need to be improved but in all honesty, i dont want to put you off from playing the game as, even with these issues, i have had a lot of fun playing it. i just hope the developer gets round to fixing these issues.. which is unlikely as i believe the game is now finished.",1644166322,1644166322,True,1,0,0.514018654823303223,0,True,False,False

The game is really fun especially if like me you have ADHD and want a game with so many things going on you will literally never be bored even with 5 employees. However it does have a lot of problems, I read a review where someone said it crashes a lot and it does-- a lot. It's always without warning,  fortunately the game auto saves a lot (which might be why it crashes but I'm not a techie so I can't confirm) so when it does shut off literally without warning you can usually get right back to where you were. 

Quality of life wise there's not a lot of diversity in NPCs which is understandable I would rather they fix their optimization first, but it'd be nice to see some more color around there. Both in NPCs and the people you hire, it seems to be the same old guys in rotation every other minute so I'm not sure how 'randomized' it's meant to be but it doesn't seem like it. Also varying ages would make sense? For example, from someone who lived in rural Texas, these are exactly the places teenagers hang out and cause a mess. It would also make use of the dining area you construct for decoration. Also more variety of decorations would be nice, and for the NPCs to stop getting stuck whenever you do add a standing decoration otherwise it's not worth it to decorate at all. 

The uncle quests are alsooo... like it feels like they wanted to put an actual subplot to the game but didn't really carry it through. Like it would at least be cool to break into someones car and find something questionable and do a drop or even have the option to report it. There's also no consequences for literally breaking into someone's car, I wasn't sure if there was a consequence so I did it right in front of a cop and the npc just stood there. 

I hope they continue to add more updates and add more upgrades to the gas station so it gets to Bucees level but I'm not holding my breath. I would recommend it foorrr people who have nothing to do and enjoy a lot of multitasking where you don't have to think too hard or people who like breaking games because glitches abound. Otherwise I don't know if it's worth it with the amount of times it just shuts off without warning. There's no 'mixed review' option so I'll give it a thumbs up bc likely I will continue to play it but it's a wavy thumbs up at best.",1643722256,1643722256,True,1,0,0.514018654823303223,0,True,False,False

Update 01/29/2022:
After playing on the new update the Car Wash update is the only other big update i can see happening. There Nozzles seem broken. I have also lowered my Graphics to the lowest they can be and even then i still get FPS drops like crazy. Which is weird b/c i can play games like Battlefield and Rainbow Six Siege on high with no FPS drops.

Nothing can be done about this except for the universal Clear all vehicles button. Which provides a clean sweep of vehicles through a kewl Alien Abduction.:)  3: Trash bags constantly fall through the floor and have to be picked up again..  Annoying but not a deal breaker..  4: One of my workers when he is designated to clean the station gets stuck on one of my peices of shelving and wont move, unless you send him or her on break.  Can be fixed by moving the shelving but its hard to find room for everything without having at least one unit that gets in the employees way.  5: Last but not least above level 5 gameplay starts to lag sometimes considerably, sometimes even freezes, crashes completely and you have to restart from the previous save point.. Very annoying!  I'm Level 8 now and can't wait for the car wash DLC to be released and hopefully many of these bugs will be patched along with that release as well.

If you're easily flustered or frustrated, this is definitely not the game for you. If you're not great with time management, it's not the game for you. You often have to juggle which tasks to accomplish first, or ensuring your people are rested enough to be able to cover (some of) the tasks for you.

You have to keep track of your product; I can't tell you how many times in my first hour I'd realize that my stock was out, or that my fuel was too low to finish off that car, causing me to lose my accuracy bonus.

The game encourages both speed, and efficiency, leading to dozens of mini games where you're really only competing against yourself, trying to find that balance of moving quickly, while moving accurately. Go to fast, and risk losing popularity when you accidentally knock an extra item into the basket, or overfuel someone's car. Go to slow, and you risk your work piling up behind you, leaving to play a very frustrating game of catch-up.

But, if you're into this type of game? It's beautifully well done. It's got everything a person can ask for: good graphics, environmental factors, easy ways of correcting glitches, time management, product management, mini games, and more.",1642983575,1642983575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first the game looks really fun, getting ride of trashs and slowly customizing your shop, cleaning it, making space, painting walls, opening gas station ... yeah it's really addictive ! But then you will slowly lose your smile playing it, not because of the difficulty or the too many customers, but because of the lags !!!

The lags and crashes are the only issues i got playing this games, the more you unlock parking lot, the more you gonna lag.
And sometime the game will randomly crashes for no reason, or Fatal Error from nowhere (happens to me while in Menu AFK) 

To end it, the game is good and well though for several hours of gameplay but after a while you may be bored, and for people not running with a good config, you gonna suffer a lot from FPS issues. :)

There is a planned update to add the car wash fairly soon. I will say that this a fairly good game.

However, at this time I can't recommend it right now, due to 2 major factors:
1. BUGS EVERYWHERE: Yes, there are bugs in this game. A lot of them. The sheer number of them could almost be comparable to that of the console version of Fallout New Vegas when it first launched, and many of these bugs are more evident than others; examples include item duplication, employees staying in place after payment, employees nowhere to be found when tasked with cleaning, lightweight objects clipping through the floor when picked up, and the first pump no longer being used after the Gas Station is upgraded to Level 5. I've also seen some achievements not unlocking even after meeting certain requirements during game progression.
2. PERFORMANCE ISSUES: This game is poorly optimised, and it becomes more and more apparent as you progress onward and approach endgame. You'll start to see framerate drops as your station becomes more popular and more traffic arrives, which leads to lag spikes in the framerate as well. The worst case scenarios are when the game crashes. I've had this game crash multiple times in under 6 hours during one session, and it gets especially annoying when I'm in the middle of repairing a car when the game crashes.

Don't get me wrong, Gas Station Simulator is NOT a bad game; it's actually quite a lot of fun. It just needs more polishing, that's all. It feels like it should be in Early Access until most (if all) of the bugs are fully ironed out.

""Gas Station Simulator"" is exactly what you'd expect from reading the label. You have a gas station, and you have to run it, clean it, manage it, and generally tidy the place up to get better customers and more money. Everything is mini-games, but that's okay for a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. ""Gas Station Simulator"" occupies the same mindless calm niche that I'd put ""House Flipper"" into: no real failure states. Even running a terrible gas station or not caring about trash/reputation/inventory will still get some money and some way to advance. 

As a counterpoint, the novelty of mini-games in a mostly brown environment wears off. Sure you may have a lot to do, but none of it is new and innovative. Leveling up gets you different types of shelves, more paint colors, and more random decorations to buy. Maybe my expectations were too high for a game admittedly about running a gas station. 

One other issue is framerate and performance. A game coded in Unreal should NOT have the rendering issues and lag that it does. The developer has said that a major hotfix is coming. That's good, and LONG overdue. It's very frustrating to have the game decide that a good time to experience input lag and disappearing items is right in the middle of a complicated cash register event. 

Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Yep. I'm glad I bought it, and I plan to play a little while longer to grind through some achievements. Would I recommend it to others? Sure. A good sale price plus the expectation of 15-20 hours is a fine position for your wallet. Is it deeper, more intuitive, or have longer staying power than ""House Flipper""? Nope.

The game provides a fairly hectic simulation of running a gas station; where you must balance manning the pumps, working the checkout, restocking, and performing car repairs in the attached garage. As you progress, your station attracts more and more customers but you also unlock various upgrades to make things easier, as well as the ability to hire employees who can each take over a particular duty for you.

The individual tasks each have a small mini-game and these are fun and mostly quick enough to not distract too much from the overall goal of keeping things running smoothly, although repairing cars often involves multiple steps and does get a bit tedious. There's also a lockpicking minigame to break into trunks that can earn you a bit of extra cash, but it suffers from a bug where you can often get kicked out of the minigame for seemingly no reason.

Bugs are, unfortunately, one of the two main reasons I can't recommend this game. It's crashed for me four times in less than 6 hours, and I've had issues with objectives not triggering, items being duplicated, physics glitching out, etc. etc. that really soured the experience.

The second reason I don't feel able to recommend the game is the structure of progression - upgrades to your station are gated behind not just a money requirement but also a checklist of tasks. The game will ask you to refuel 100 cars, serve 250 customers, etc. before you have the option to advance, and these really drag the game down to a tedious grind. Clearing one of these lists will unlock a handful of upgrades before you're presented with yet another list with even higher requirements. This also prevents you from specialising because you need to complete all of the main duties a specific number of times at each level.

If these objectives could be toned down and/or removed to allow for a more organic upgrade path, and if the bugs can be ironed out, then I think this could be a great game; at the moment I just can't recommend it.",1642114383,1642114383,False,3,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

Slowly upgrading your gas station and all the services related to it is very nicely revealed to the player. You are never overwhelmed, but you DO feel the need to rush sometimes. There are a lot of safety escapes to use if you are overwhelmed and need to catch your breath. 

The game is polished, and balanced. There are a few things about it, but nothing is a deal breaker. You really do feel like you are trying to manage a gas station, and are thankful once you can hire employees to help you. 

Tiny little details that the devs should address come up, but nothing serious. The voice acting isn't always great, and there are TOO MANY POLICE cars! And they drive around with their roof lights on. That is silly. You can break into the trunk of a police car while the officer is standing there. Also silly. The people don't look great. Too many with purple or white hair and ridiculous facial hair. Since everything else is so nicely laid out, tone down the weirdos coming to the station for service.

Every day the sun rises and sets, the people come and go, all you have to do is sell them petrol and snacks or maybe repair a car. You can eventually hire staff to do the grunt work for you and upgrade the gas station itself.

But off in the distance you see some big city. At night the tower blocks light up the sky on the horizon. 
And the people drive in and the people drive out, but you yourself can never leave the gas station. You can never escape to the city.

It's got this weird liminal vibe. Like you're a ghost trapped there. 
It's weirdly addictive and calming and I like it a lot. 

There are a few Easter eggs to find already, however there are some parts which are still being developed.  The traffic flow and customer paths occasionally glitch and have to be reset with an in game button. The walls get dirty and need to be repainted which I find annoying. Also I'd like to be able to shoot Dennis or make some sort of trap for him.... it'd be way more satisfying than just turning him off as a feature.

You have to rebuild The Dust Bowl from the ground-up with your own hard-earned cash (or your uncle's, if you want to take the route of putting yourself in his debt) and take on duties such as managing inventory, hiring & paying employees, increasing your reputation, and leveling up your warehouse, garage, and the actual gas station. 

You can also decorate (almost) to your heart's content, with a shop to purchase shelves and both hanging and standing decorations. My only complaint with decorating is that you cannot change the floors whatsoever, and your only option with the walls is to paint them. You can't change the lights beyond purchasing wall or floor lamps, and you're stuck with the drab windows you start with. 

Some reviews are complaining of game-breaking bugs, but I've only noticed minor ones, such as customers zooming through walls, exiting the gas station sitting and floating to their cars, or their feet stretching to an inhuman length when they walk. The only bugs I've noticed that can be frustrating is not receiving the rewards from challenges and the fact that completing certain actions doesn't count towards the goal at all - such as repairing cars. So, yes, the game has a fair amount of bugs, but I personally have never experienced any crashing or anything of that sort.

You do build your business as it goes, hire employees, keep things operating, but the game play is much more akin to those games that challenge the player to keep up and not fall behind - like the food ordering games.  Only the mechanics in this one are customers waiting to have their vehicles filled, their snacks rung up, their cars fixed in the garage, etc.  

With all that being said, I NEVER found the game dull or monotonous because it does not give you time to feel that.  It is far more accurate to describe it as an intense game as you scurry to and fro in order to please all your customers.

1) Instead of listing the number of days you have owned the gas station just give us the day of the week
2) allow us to set up a work schedule for our employees so that we aren't rushing to the computer every 20mins and also allow us to pay our employees once a week not every single day.
3) add in lottery tickets for customers to buy.
4) increase the prices for the tobacco and alcohol products (im from Canada and all Im saying is that these prices are dirt cheap yes Im aware its a game but still)
5) Considering that this game is based in the states switch the gas from litres to gallons (anyone from the states please correct me if I'm wrong but you guys go based off of the gallon not litres)
6) Fix the challenges. Everytime I successfully complete a challenge and get the reward I am no longer able to complete anymore challenges unless I close the game.
7) I know i'm probably going to regret saying this but increase the employees wages. I'm sorry but having 3 employees on at the same time and having them at their max level for their respective tasks that I have assigned them should cost a heck of alot more then what I think its 390 something. Also for the employees who are maxed level on all tasks should become a supervisor.
8) Not sure if this is possible but I would like to see the employees be able to stock the shelves, fridges, etc.

I was actually buying it ironically because it sounds like a boring or bad game... but the second I started playing it had a weirdly addicting effect. I have only had it a few days and have spent an absurd amount of time playing it and am already at level 5.

Pros:
- Super addicting and easy to learn.
- Intuitive mini games for every task that makes it feel accomplishing.
- Good story line for a simulator, introduces you to the game, and sets the feel for the game early on.
- Pretty dang good graphics for a simulator.
- Really good soundtrack, very relaxing, and upbeat when needed.

Cons:
- Can be very hard on your system, low-medium graphics will be good for most systems though.
- AI is kind of lacking, but it is early access you can't be too hard on the AI.
- Pretty unstable, in my experience the game crashes quite a bit.

Most of the cons are simply because the game is in early access and will likely be fixed or lessened by future updates.

Overall this game is great for it's price, I would say, if you are into simulator games like this I would strongly recommend it, however if you aren't into this type of game I would suggest waiting for a sale to see if you would like it, it definitely isn't for everyone.

Non-Game Breaker Glitches:
- Flat tires have a tendency to fall under the floor of the workshop. Not a game breaker.
- A busted up car wash with no use whatsoever in the game. Maybe in a future patch?

Extremely Annoying Glitches:
- Sometimes one of the tire lugs will not highlight, not allowing you to mount the tire. Only fix I have is exit the game and reload. This will cause a loss of the new tire.

- The cash register is extremely buggy (i.e., Sponge won't work, items not getting credit when in the basket, items shooting of the belt and landing in unreachable locations). This is, in my opinion, the most broken element in the game. This can be a deal breaker because, aside from the gas pumps, the register is the most used item in the store! Honestly, the only solution I found for this is grin and bear it until you get employees ans then place one at the register indefinitely.

So I played it for 12 hours and maxed out the lvls on everything. It is not bad but keeps crashing once everything is maxed out. There is no room to grow so once you beat the lvl 5 store lvl and its addons to lvl 5 its pretty much done. It does make the time go by super quick, I thought I played for 1 hour and turned out to be 5 hours. I wish there was more to do great start just some pretty big flaws at the end. Yes there is a few glitches and fatal errors which in fix#4 says will be a thing of the past but is still occurs, here and there with graphics.. Like if you miss by over powering I sent a wooden plank to space and never saw it again. Was very fun to watch though... Def a decent game for $15 would be a lot better to expand or try multi player where they have a station down the road or across the street and you fight like today. What is your name? Tony!

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?

original review:
1. AI is cheating. unreasonably fast. one corner cant see him anymore.
2. Connection problem. Connection suddenly broken in the middle of the event. Also, sometime it shows ""unable to join the session"".
3. Is a great game.

It has a view collision bugs and some of the tasks/mini games bug out but is expected from a indie game and also considering there is loads more to come that it will all be polished out eventually. I hope there is more customization in the future and you can snap shelves to certain degree/straight.

The UFO feature is genius to help fix the main bugs without losing anything, having to wait or even restart.

It all becomes very repetitive and boring.

I have the feeling this was created by the same makers of Prison Simulator, with the same bugs here and there. Also the game crashes from time to time when there's no indication what caused it. I have a brand new gaming laptop with 32 GB RAM and an Nvidia video card with 6 GB memory and two SSDs so I doubt the problem is my hardware.

People sometimes just move in a sitting position. Then you've got Dennis but his sounds are originating from weird positions. When you try to find him based on listening to his laughter, you're not going to be able to spot him. Also staff sometimes get stuck. They're running but they're not moving, and they're not getting on their destination. Then one of the garbage container keeps having flies, even though there's no junk in it and there's nothing you can do about it. The garbage bins inside the shop get filled very quickly and it's almost impossible to keep clean. I spend more time cleaning, because when you assign two employees to clean, they both move to the exact same spot of dirt, cleaning the same spot together all the time.

Sometimes vehicles get stuck when one car and one truck try to drive in at the same time and they collide. 
Then you have to bring in the UFOs to fix the situation.

One of my biggest disappointments was that you can't renovate the carwash. I thought if you would remove all the sand there, the game would allow you to upgrade your station with a brand new carwash. That would have been fun to service. Unfortunately, it's junk and it stays that way.

Refilling the fuel tanks causes the driveway to be blocked, causing a lot of angry cars to sound their horns all the time. Same with the garbage collection. The shop could have been worked out much better, with some typical diner style cafeteria that you can find on those american routes in the desert.

There's still so much space around the gas station, I'm surprised they didn't do more with it. However, if there were no bugs in this game, this would definitely have the potential to be a great first version of gas station simulator.

Some gameplay adjustments could make the game much better.",1640628381,1640628381,False,1,0,0.46534651517868042,0,True,False,False

But so much is missing here. There’s no plotline, no characters, no mystery to solve or meaningful goal to reach. You just run your gas station to make money to buy a bigger gas station.

There’s also no real simulation here, in the sense that you can’t make meaningful choices. There’s only one path to develop your gas station. You can choose your paint color and decide where to put the newspaper rack, but none of it matters. To progress you must satisfy a series of arbitrary goals. No matter how much money you’ve got, you can’t buy another toilet until you’ve sold snacks to X customers and put gasoline in Y cars.

The actual gameplay consists of dashing from station to station doing minigames that range from cute to bizarre. It’s perfectly normal for a customer to drive into your garage with three flat tires, and then drive out again a few minutes later because you didn’t service them fast enough. In the world of GSS, side-view mirrors are made of fragile glass that frequently shatters, while the owners of filthy rusted pickup trucks are willing to pay big bucks to have scratches buffed out of their door panels.

GSS is silly fun for the first dozen hours while you scramble around learning all the minigames and ordering more potato chips. But then you realize that there’s not much more to it.

The premise of this game is that you inherit (or buy, I'm not really clear) an old gas station along route 66 with the plan of restoring it in order to make some money. Through a series of events I won't spoil you end up owing a debt with paying it off being the end goal. 

This game will force you to multi-task and I like that - there's literally no down time unless you manually turn off the ""open"" sign stopping the flow of customers momentarily. This gives you a chance to catch your breath and perform other tasks around the property such as picking up trash, re-painting structures, re-stocking supplies, ordering fuel, decorating the interior, planning expansions, etc. 

All of the actions you do to run the station/workshop come in the form of mini-games. Unfortunately these can get repetitive very quickly - once you gain the ability to hire employees you'll ALWAYS want to have someone on the register or repairing cars. This lets you run around doing the slightly less annoying tasks like re-fueling or keeping the interior clean. Efficiency is key. 

On the negative there are a lot of bugs, so many so in fact that the developer added a dedicated car reset button which comes in the form of a UFO. 

Let's run down a few: My delivery truck has gotten stuck in the warehouse more times than I can remember. The clean command for your employees just makes them run into the wall. There's an issue when trying to pick up objects (ex. a trash bag) where the game will glitch out or won't register it unless you drop the object and THEN pick it back up again. Sometimes customers will use the car driving animation indoors. 

Minor annoyances, nothing game breaking.

Another big issue is that there's no real punishment for unpaid loans and you can exploit this to accumulate cash quickly. You're allowed to borrow $1000 at once - if you fail to repay in time a short unskippable cutscene will play showing security camera footage of some unhinged biker busting up your shop. It doesn't matter though, you might lose a couple of items from your inventory or a  small amount of popularity with the locals but that is ZERO deterrent because the punishment is so weak. Plus you can immediately take out another loan letting you stack with no real repercussions. 

This took me about 20 hours to ""beat"" and I use that word loosely because you can keep playing indefinitely after completing the main narrative objective. I didn't feel the need to 100% this but you can add another 5 hours for completionists.

Overall for $16 I've more than gotten my moneys worth. Gas Station Simulator isn't the most polished game but it's one of the most addicting I've played this year. Worth it at full price and a no brainer on sale.",1640422859,1640438101,True,12,0,0.675972938537597656,0,True,False,False

Employees don't make any sense and have to be nagged to do anything. No scheduling system. IRL they would be fired on the spot.

Everything is geared around making you do more chores. 

It needs a LOT of common sense QOL enhancements to make any kind of sense.

Progression is on rails. There are NO decisions to be made in this 'simulator'. Everything is on rails and you progress when the game wants you to. All you are doing is 'chores' to get to the end. There is no management aspect at all here.

This game could have been great with some QOL and maybe some additional sites. Why not allow us to own more gas stations and use the starting gameplay we have to get that station up and running and on its feet. All it would need is some more big picture management type stuff, a central HQ you could setup, etc. 

This game could be awesome and a lot of fun but it keeps getting in the way of itself. It doesn't know if it wants to be a simulator or just meaningless chores.

Hopefully the developers add more diverse content (there's a broken car wash on your forecourt that can't be used, for instance, and a huge plot of land spread over your station that doesn't really ""do"" anything) but I can't deny I had genuine delight with this.

Ever since i got this game i have been quite addicted and haven't stopped playing it in the short time i've had it
It's one of the most interactive and realistic simulators i've played, it's been very enjoyable!

Graphically it's not bad at all, some models looks a little strange at times, mostly the human npc characters models but the surrounding area looks nice, along with all the interactable objects and mini games
There is some physic issues where Rubbish bags after emptying the bins or other used items falling randomly through the floor to the abyss below and other clipping problems, but it's not big issue's or gamebreaking 

Although i did once leave a car on the platform thing and shut the station for one night in which the car was trying to drive off whilst on the platform so i tried putting the tyre back on for them and then the game crashes and closed so be wary 

There's plenty to do, Missions, keeping the station clean and stocked, managing your staff, warehouse and more! You can fill cars with gas, you can man the tills and serve customers so if you really hate retail like most of us do then this might give you PTSD
You can fix cars in the garage, changing tyre's, adding oil, batteries, mirrors and so on
You manually order in what stock you need and there is plenty of stock to add around the station you also manually order fuel as you'll run out eventually 
Why am i still typing, just go and play it!

I've genuinely really enjoyed playing this game, you get addicted fast, the gameplay is good, soundtrack/music is okay it's better when the party bus rolls into town and gives the desert some sort of life although i would like to know what drugs they've been on!

It's fun! worth a good play

This is true especially in the beginning of the game, since you don't have any employees yet. Buying product and restocking your shelves is pretty satisfying. And most of all, watching your money go up to buy upgrades so your money can go up even faster is fun.

Later in the game it becomes more so micromanaging than multitasking, since you'll eventually get employees which automate a single task out of 4 different tasks. Once you get 2 employees you can automate car repair and the cash register, the two most time draining tasks, so you can focus more on keeping your numerous shelves stocked and upgrading your gas station.

However, as fun as it is the game is a bit buggy. The register minigame especially can bug out and make an item spawn weird and fly off the belt. If the customer buys too many items the items will be difficult to fit in the basket, especially if stuffed animals are available for them to buy. The game consistently crashes after playing for 30 minutes to an hour, especially later in the game you get. Just recently got to day 36 and my frames have started dropping hard. The game seems to break more and more the longer you play it.

 Sometimes picking garbage up the bag stays behind, and you still have to throw it to pick it up again since it glitches out as if it were picked up. Excavators can't push cars but my broom can, if i try using excavator to push a car, the excavator flips very rapidly upside down. 

cars don't seem to be able to rout themselves they drive 1 designated route and that’s it... and until they complete the check point for that route, they maintain it... for example, if i push a car with a broom next to the street, they still drive to the last point they were driving for before they got interrupted even if that means backtracking and driving to the dirt road first to follow it back to the street.

Why does giving a free item upset customers? Also why does even 1 missed item not count towards objectives that require ""x amount of transactions"" to be completed... they still paid... I still got money... the transaction completed... so the task was completed... 

The pillars in the center of the store, in front of the register, they aren’t aligned. Yea i know, you can't unseen it now that I pointed it out. They aren’t. That is very bothersome. I’ve never been in a building where they weren’t aligned like that lol just saying.

why so much damn garbage, i get it, I get it, customers are messy but I work in a grocery store that’s more busy then this, and garbage cans don't fill up literally just 1 or 2 minutes of real life time, before it fills up and customers begin complaining the place is filthy... what in the world? And then those dancers every single step leaves a dirt print this is pure insanity. 

Shelves can't be placed or snapped to a grid and the rotation of them doesn't even allow them to be aligned with the walls they are literally just a fraction of an inch un-aligned no matter how much you try to align it.

Last but not least... doesn't appear employees get individual tasks... I was hoping I could have 2 employees clean when the dance crew arrived but they literally overlap and intercept each other’s movements as they clean it looks sloppy and weird.

overall this game is super addictive aside from the bugs. bugs can be patched with time of course, if you can tolerate bugs for a short duration, id recommend this game any day as it has a lot of playability.

The game does crash sometimes, as many other reviews have pointed out. But the game also autosaves a lot, so you probably won't lose any progress from a crash, you'll just get annoyed. Ultimately, with currently available content you'll get to a point where you've finished everything you can, have a ton of money, and nothing left to do. At all. The game provides end game ""challenges"" that aren't engaging enough to keep playing (pick 10 trunk locks for a hundred bucks.)

This game is absolute blast if you love cleaning, reparing, serving customers running things like in life.

I was bit hesitating to buy it becuase as a woman I admit I dont enjoy that much gas and cars but oh boy how I was wrong.

Give me that juicy gasoline hoes and let  me fuel your car, sir do you wanna repair your car, say no more. How about some refreshing beverages, let me mark it for ya.

PRO:
lot of different  kind of minigames
reparing car, 
managing staff
supply check
cleaning
decorating
sand storms
that little punk Denis -I tossed a poop at him 
Devs are working on  few bugs
Party bus -never seen lizzard buy so many red hats and cooking magazines

CONS:

Closing the gas station and sending everyone on a break will give you time to decorate, clean, and set up your station how you like it. I enjoy it so far and am continuing to play it. 
     There are some bugs I have noticed, for example some time picking up trash or an item it will kind of ""lag"" and jump around behind you, so you have to drop the item and then pick it back up. I have also noticed sometimes the delivery driver will not leave after you take your items at the whare-house, I tried resetting all the cars with the provided button, but didn't seem to work.

(become richer than uncle, invest in the stock market, etc)

there are things that annoyed me though. i'll list them as follows.
-the game needs optimization (i run at 4 frames per second on minimum settings and crash to desktop frequently)
-delivery drivers getting out of trucks and taking to much time to leave after I've unloaded/filled my stocks/tank. (it would be better if they stayed in the truck and leave as soon as i'm done.
-no BB/paintball gun tool to pelt Dennis with when he commits war crimes. (i would appreciate an upgrade system from lever action to full-auto BB/paintball gun)
-no upgrade system for the cash register. (it is a chore to pick up the items and go all the way to the left to scan them then put them in the basket on the right, where instead you can buy a handheld scanner and hover over the items to scan. then they fall into the basket with minimal effort applied. especially during the ""party bus"" events)
-some shelves are unpractical and feature minimal storage to the space they consume by existence alone. (the newspaper, ice cream freezers for example)
-The floor and inner roof of the station are disgusting and i really want to replace them. (at least paint them)

Having Covid has given me a great opportunity to play the game recently and i am having so much fun the game play is great! After finishing the Main Story I thought i would be able to chill but nope as you progress the game becomes more of a challenge with each popularity rating which is great. Lots of extra upgrades you can do to your Station as well as decorate and Paint it to your own desires . The mini-games are a fun alternative too.

If i can give any bad points which are hard to come by i may add is that with more popularity comes more dirty customers they come in with there mucky boots and throw trash everywhere it becomes more of a chore and takes up 80% of your time keeping it clean just to keep the disgusting customers happy. And asking your employees to do it is like getting a baby to clean up just doesn't happen they just get overwhelmed with the amount of footprints and rubbish that doubles within seconds.

In conclusion Gas Station Simulator is definitely worth the money and you will enjoy it hours on end A++

I had to do a review on this game and i can say it will be a very good review.
I have played this game for 1 or 2 days and i am very addicted to this game as it does have that kind of addiction if you love simulator games.

I have nearly every simulator game ever released there are just a few i don't already have so i consider myself a PRO when it comes to a review on a simulator game and i can honestly say with hand on heart this is one of the best simulator games i have ever played and enjoyed 100% this game you could put in the top 10 of simulator games.

There is so much to this game it appears endless so don't be fooled by first impressions of short promotion videos or any reviews that tries to troll this game as this game is so much deeper then it looks.

Firstly you start off in the game with a run down very basic gas station your goal is to build your gas station up to be the best and most visited station by customers of course this will take some time to achieve as everything is based around money and popularity from your customers making money in this game is no easy task but it can be done in the end.

in real life i own a company with my husband and there is a golden rule to success and that is Location, Location, Location so you are on rout 66 a very busy highway out in the desert and the customers will come thick and thin depending how beautiful your station looks like.

There is also 3 other rules to success in a station just like any business 1/ You need to look after your business in the beginning 2/ 2nd year the business will look after itself and last the 3rd year the business will look after you those are real life facts but this is a game and anything can happen in a game and anything is possible the sky's the limit in this game.

You will be able to upgrade your station as you progress and unlock more features and other buildings that are vital to your success....BEWARE as you unlock more you will be rushed of your feet as you will need to take control of the many things a station offers such as car repairs and a grocery shop and the fuel pumps and later i believe will be added is a car wash I hope you can hire staff in this game as you can't do all this alone (it would kill you in the end....Joke)

The graphics is very good and sound is great too i am running the game on max settings right across the board with no issue i have never had the game crash well not yet anyway but there are still a few things in the game the devs need to iron out as like in any game in this day and age i only found 2 issues so far and that is when you pick up an item sometimes it can vanish below ground level until you release the item and then pick it up again such as a rubbish bag the 2nd issue is the window boards to the warehouse windows when removed are too large to dispose in a skip so the boards need to be made smaller so they will fit into a skip better my suggestion to the dev's is to have these boards half their size and use 2 of them to board up a window so when they are removed they can fit into a skip very easy.

You will be playing this game for months and months maybe even longer but one thing is for sure that when you start playing this game you will get hooked very fast on it just like me lol.

This game as i said is one of the very best simulators i have ever seen or played so far and i hope the dev's will patch it often and add much more DLC and release DLC packs for this game as i think it is worth it as they got a GEM of a game here in their hands.

I hope you will play this game and enjoy as i do as i am sure you will as i rate this game as a 10 out of 10.

Good luck
and happy playing in your new business adventure.",1632340309,1637931392,True,5,0,0.483313828706741333,0,True,False,False

1. A goal
2. Wierd story
3. Throwing things at a kid in order to stop him from painting on your gas station,
4. Easy tasks. 
It's a simple game to pick up and a simple game to leave. That is the charm of it and that is why I really like it.
Sure there are some physics I would love to be fixed howevere,
1. Things just bouncing off with a simple touch from the conveyer belt.
2. Dirt that can't be cleaned when people are in line.
and I would really love it if the paint didn't degrade so fast on the buildings. I mean I painted it white and had to repaint it 2 more times and it still starts to look like when I arrived only in color... 
Other than that. 8/10 would play again. 

Still a good game and would recommend it for a nomination on steam this year to show that it is a good game.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1637905216,1637905216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game captures the Southern American aesthetic pretty well in my mind, and I like the concept of mixing late 50s culture with early 2000s technology. The customization upgrades give a real sense of accomplishment when you finally pay for them.

Random crashes even on my higher end PC (I built it 8 months ago). I have no problems running the other games I play on this PC that are out of early access. I wouldn't suggest it unless you love those issues. Also the further you progress in the game the worse the problems get. Sometimes the random crashes (they have no error code just closes to desktop) cause you to lose your progress. These companies appear to care more about money than their player base. Just look down the page. There's more games to be released soon. Seriously?? Fix the current games before you pump out others. Make customers happy unless you want to lose them to something that could have been easily taken care of. Don't ignore the players.


Update: DO NOT buy this or even install it!!!!
I took my PC to the local shop to have it looked at because I was having issues with my new PC. According to the computer tech the game damaged Windows.

You have to balance employees and budget to make sure you can afford these people while making a profit. FYI don't take out any loans, its too hard to pay back, just like in real life.

What I don't like... the load time is horrible. On a AMD Ryzen with 8 cores, a NVME drive, a Nvidia GTX 2080, it still takes anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes to load. Unacceptable! My second issues is the 3D object, especially the delivery truck. The rear wheels becomes the turning wheels and the chassy temporarily separates from the box every time it leaves the warehouse. Also, occasionally, the customers leaving the gas station are seated outside their vehicle as they pull away.

3D glitches aside, I still think this is a fun little game. Its not for everyone, but I think it worth a play.",1637719830,1637719830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it goes beyond busy work. There are many tasks to perform on a daily basis such as inventory management, human resource management, and gas station operations. When there are dust storms you have to make sure the sand piles are properly disposed of otherwise the dumb customers will get stuck.

That's one knock on this game is the customer ai, but then again, if you spend enough time around gas stations in the real world there is not that much difference.

My only real criticism of the game is the fact that the paint you apply to the station fades far to quickly, and the little brat that comes by and spray paints your station. It's almost impossible to stop him unless you happen to be holding something to throw at him, and are by some chance outside the store. Most of the time you are too busy to catch him. Eventually he will run out of places to tag and go away. 

Another criticism, and maybe I missed this, is that you cannot tell what your inventory is when it's on the shelves. You can only see surplus in the warehouse. It would be so much easier if you could have an overall inventory.

Ett bra simulator spel där dina arbetsuppgifter är att sköta om en bensinstation där du sköter antingen själv/anställda till att sköta Affären, Tanka bilar, Reparera bilar, Städa. 

Du får fixa din logistik själv som att beställa produkter till affären, verkstaden, Bensin, sophämtning. 

Det kan även bli sandstorm i spelet då får man ta sin lastare och flytta på sandhögarna som uppstår annars fastnar bilarna på dom.

You can fix your logistics yourself, such as ordering products for the store, workshop, petrol, garbage collection.

There can also be a sandstorm in the game then you have to take your loader and move on the sand piles that occur otherwise the cars get stuck on them.

Am I losing my mind after getting that much crashing? Probably yeah, but let's be real, this game is just purely fun and addictive.

Alright, you buy the game and install it, first thing you do is clearing trash. We all hates cleaning, but GSS makes it just nice enough to be on the tiny fragile line between stupidly easy cleaning job and fck this is annoyingly real. Cleaning/taking out trash is actually my fav thing to do, so satisfied tho it could be a little bit more trash to clear out.

There is so much to grind in this game. You're busy 99.99% of your playing time to cleaning, taking orders, receiving orders, fueling, repairing cars, ect. That 0.01% free time is when your game crashes. Oh wait, the game probably hangs and crashes a thousands time longer than that, so for sure you got some time to relax your ass and your eyes, how thoughtful of the developer. Fortunately, grinding in this game is satisfied, especially for ppl that getting crazy about a tiny stain spot on a shiny clean floor like me. It could become boring after sometime, but definitely not after about at least 20-30hours on records, that I can confirms cuz I this is my second account that I bought GSS. 

Plus, aliens. You got buses that come from the eternal universe filled with aliens who probably so high on weeds or whatever visiting your random gas station for shopping, sure, because why not. Don't worry, those very nice and high aliens guys are definitely on your side, because every time your customers or those not very skilled truck drivers fcked up your game, there is a red button to summon your universe friends. Just hit it and in a second they will come on their very cool UFO, and bam, taking every bit of stupidity away to their universe....What else of a friend you could ask for.

Definitely recommend this to kill some lots of free time, because this is addictive af.",1637356178,1637356178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously though, I was in the crowd that was like, ""how good could a GAS STATION simulator be?"". WELL.... Pretty good. For $20, I'm amazed at the quality of the graphics (they're not the best, but they're GOOD for this price point) and how robust this game really is. I played it for 3 hours straight when I first got it, and I NEVER play a game for 3 hours straight. It just keeps you coming back for more, and every time you level up your station, more thing occur that change the way you play (I'm talking to you party bus people...). 

Prices are dynamic when you buy products, so you need to make sure you not only have enough money to buy them, but enough storage space, and if that is the price you want to charge in your store (the higher the price you buy, the higher you sell it for). It's a little difficult starting off with the products, and the garage, but be patient, the further you go, the more money you'll have in your pocket to buy enough stock.

Everything about this game is great; the pace, the graphics, the old school environment, etc. If you like simulator games, then you will for sure become addicted to this one. I can't recommend it enough.

So, I do like a lot of details about this game.  It's cute.  Fun little sim.

Borderline unplayable.  It says I've played for 4 hours.  It's crashed 20 times.  Today alone, I started it up again after waiting for bug fixes, but it's crashed seven times.  My partner and I have been running through everything we can to try to make it work, but nothing does.  Uninstalled and reinstalled.  Verified the files.  Updated the graphics driver.  All of those usual things, none of them helped.  I saw someone say limiting the amount of saves the game uses helps, but not even that.  Deleted everything except the single save I try to use.  Just hitting the escape button was the most recent crash cause.  Why?  No clue.  Didn't even give me a crash report because it was stuck for ten minutes straight without closing.  Used task manager to close it.

This game doesn't work.  I don't want to refund it because I do want to play it.  Or try to.  But don't buy this game.  It's not worth playing like this.  This is unacceptable as a full release game.  This came out in September.  It's been over two months, and it is still in a release that is unplayable.  The longest I can go without a crash is 30 minutes.  Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to crash.  It always kicks me back around 5 minutes from the last time I crashed. I have to constantly save to not lose data, and just hitting the escape button to go to save was the reason it just crashed.

The game will crash a lot, mostly when there are a lot of customers, as the optimization is really bad, so save frequently. 
The best tip i can give you is to buy merchandise, and gas, when the price is low, few products can be an exception.

Once you unlock the garage though(around 2-3 hour mark), the game transitions to an absolute grind. New unlocks previously were generous and frequent, now they're locked behind grindwalls and give little reward.
By the 5th hour mark, you'll gain the ability to hire three employees for your gas station. When employees get tired they rest but they don't get back to work automatically, you have to make them get back to work. At first I thought this was gonna be annoying, how am I going to juggle having to do all this work AND keep my employees working too? However at this point the game requires very little input on your part. All you'll be doing now is cleaning, restocking and making employees get back to work... Over and over again. So the game went from being a grindfest to a waitfest...
Sure you can pick locks, but they provide little reward. Sure you can go race with the remote car, but it gets repetitive quickly and offers even less reward. I'd painted every building, I'd cleaned them all out and refurbished them. There was nothing left to do but wait for my employees to grind out the ridiculously long 'challenge' so I could actually progress.

This game teaches a few things like inventory ordering, time management, and employee positioning. It falls short in that i never really need to buy anything, nor actually upgrade any of the decorations in order to advance and succeed. I could have playd this entire game without once painting a single thing. Never even got an achievement for painting, nor cleaning.....much less earning tip etc. I somehow reached level 10, having accumulated over 1200 tip refueling, and never got a refueling achievement, nor the first achievement for serving the first customer in the store. 

There are things this game needs....like the ability to manipulate the terrain and remove excess junk. There's literally rubbish that sticks around the entire game. You never see anyone using the basketball court, looking at the wagon...or anything else you might add. More stuff that makes no sense to add unless there's some point to it....other than adding more stuff to a desert that already has enough rubbish everywhere. 

I didn't much like painting every 10-15 days....so i just stopped and only repainted when the mood hit me. Seemed to go ok with the game....and didn't make much difference in customers showing up, or not showing up.

Party bus was fun :) I got rid of a lot of overstocked items with them. Just have to be sure to keep yourself on trash can duty when they first arrive. As soon as you hear the party bus music...empty the trash, and immediately stock every shelf with everything you have. These fools will buy a lot of stuff. I kept large shelves, and specialized my shop to only sell plushies and toys on large shelves, 3 hat racks with men's hats on one, women's on another, and costume on the last. Then 2 pastry stands with donuts in one, and cupcakes and cookies in the other. This made inventory easy peasy. One look at any shelf and i knew what needed to be ordered. Takes a load off of the rest of the junk. 

A double loaded workshop is best.... your warehouse for these items is literally the workshop itself. just like large toy and plushie shelves which holds 90 items each, the workshop extra side holds a double to the main side. The AI only draws from one side at a time, so its easy to determine what needs to be ordered first. 

Other than that....happy sweeping and shelf stocking. That's pretty much the role of a gas station owner as far as this game is concerned, other than filling in when your employees are resting. You have 5 employees, no reason for you to ever do anything other than stock shelves, empty trash, and sweep the floors.

You can also hire up to 5 people that work for you, and assign them to jobs.

What might sound boring at first can turn pretty addictive fast.

BUGS I encountered: Some walls can NOT be painted after you upgrade the Gas Station. One time a car toppled over, but there's a reset button for all cars (an ufo sucks them im). Two times I got stuck myself, but jumping alot helped. Overall nothing game breaking.

Oddly fun, I wish there was more to do. I have unlocked everything at lvl 5, all decorations, all 5 employees have at least 1 skill at lvl 10. I have played basketball, raced rc cars and finished the very short campaign.

I wish that there were a couple things implemented. 

I wish there was a way to set a schedule for your employees or at least when they got tired and stop doing a task they would tell you.
I wish i could get the ruins of the car wash up and running, that would be a cool thing for the 5th employee to do.
Let me have more employees so i can always have someone resting and someone working once i get to that point.
There should be more tasks your employees could do. There should be a manager position where he orders goods, tells Dennis to go away, and unloads trucks and fuel tanks.

I wish there was a new game plus option where i could sell the station and maybe get the money from it to start over or perhaps keep the upgrades and notoriety but have to start everything else over. Some reason to continue playing. 
Maybe once you get everything fully automated with 12 different employees that rotate around the clock (fuel, register, clean, cars, car wash, manager x2) you could get a new station with different themes and have money from the first station help fuel the second. I would pay extra for DLC's or whatever would get the devs to do this.

Either way I got almost 20 hours of enjoyment out of it. A dollar an hour for a game if pretty good in my book considering i've spent $60 dollars on games i played for maybe 5.

Either way pretty good game, devs please add an update to the content. Thanks!",1636497421,1636497421,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

There is no end of day summary, the game just keeps going. It is quite easy to say ""I'll just clear the register quick"" or ""We'll fuel these cars than quit"" and then keep going for another hour.

Gameplay wise it does start a touch stressful because you don't have any additional employees but at least you have to unlock and expand your gas station so you aren't doing everything from the get-go. Once you do get to the stage where you can start hiring employees the game gets easier in a way because you can just focus on managing the stations inventory and appearance. The employees don't work forever though because they do have to rest which means you do have to get your hands dirty again once in a while.

I have 47.6 hrs into this right now and it WAS fun (for me) to play BUT....! The last update killed the game (for many) in that it crashes all the time now. Some can only go a few minutes others maybe 30 or so minutes before the crash, but it's constantly crashing now. I'm hoping the devs may fix this but don't know as their not saying much (if anything).

Right now I cannot recommend this, even on sale, it's not right to suggest for others to buy a broken game. If it gets fixed I'll update this but for now, Don't Buy.


Update - Changed To Positive:  
 I was able to eliminate the crashing by changing/lowering some In-Game graphics settings, since then, no crashes. There is some patching that still needs to be done and some folks are still having various issues but in my case (grabbing the broom caused the crashes) it seems okay now.

Game runs fine on my integrated gpu (vega 8) with only 8 gigs of ram. Reasonable frames at reasonable settings no stutters but crashes as mentioned. Overclocking made the game crash on the loading screen but removing overclocking and verifying file integrity fixed the loading screen crash. Overall I really loved the game it has a lot of content and really addictive.,1636188618,1636188618,True,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

My bugs, or stuff to change:

If you try to grab a trash bag a few times the trash bag is gonna fall under the floor and if you drop it like in 1 second when its  under map then its gone, (I d k) if there is a way that stuff will spawn on the map again, maybe later in a patch. 
(Not important to patch)

If you do have a shelf site ways from middle in the gas station, (N P C) don't go around. 
(Not important to patch)

If you have a employee, that is cleaning and there is painting on the floor (happens if you go over the green skill check) and there is a shelf on top the painting, the employee going to be stuck, and just run in a freeze position.
(Not important to patch)

If a employee is fixing car, and you try to repair with the employee, is gonna mess up, I tried just once to help a employee, car in the workshop, car went oil, glass change, and a wheel, I choose the wheel, then I started, because of the employee, the car was ready (not really finish, but the games says it was finish), it drove away and I was still in the wheel change mission. (Idea to fix that: Cannot repair while on they specific car is a employee or you can help, but the game should check what got repair from employee and what is doing the player)
(Important to patch) 

If you try to paint at the toilet house, you can't paint the inside to toilet the wall where you go out from the toilet. NPC just can open the door and go there, but player not. (Idea, when the Gas Station is closed, the player should can open the toilet doors).  
(Not Important to fix)

Something with the sand to remove, the game didn't said to me, where should I put the sand, and I restart the game, it was then empty and I could get sand again, but it said nothing again, where I should put the sand again, then I watched a YT video, and by a YT Guy, it showed him the way. I can't say if that is just for me so. (No idea what here to do, just for my device or just a random bug, (I d k) here)

So but thanks for the game, It is awesome, is not a big problem with these type's of bugs they I meet. I will say that the game is playable and there is a few times, crashes, happened often. So I hope, I could help here the team, and you, who is wasting his time in this here to read.
