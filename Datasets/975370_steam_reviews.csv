It is a little confusing at times, so if you don't like to look at guides online you might find this frustrating. In my opinion the real fun comes after learning the mechanics of the game. There is a YouTuber called ""Blind"" that makes short tutorials for literally everything you could possibly want to know. After you know everything that is possible and how to survive, you can start playing the real game. It is kind of hard to classify Dwarf Fortress as a game because there isn't an objective. Part of the fun is losing your fortress. For me, losing in this game is actually very enjoyable. The enjoyment comes from the story of ultimately, demise. The game creates a story for every fortress, and the player has a decent bit of influence over it. Some things just happen though, and that is what makes it fun. The unpredictability amazes me, it feels almost real in a sense. Kind of like evolution/life simulators like ""The Life Engine"". Life comes with boons and curses and Dwarf Fortress simulates this in a way that no other game has done.

 There is a documentary on YouTube about it from a channel called ""ThatGuyGlen"" (the video is called ""How Two People Created Gaming's Most Complex Simulation System"") that goes into more of the history of the game if you're interested. In short, Dwarf Fortress was created by two guys, and the game itself has been in development for 20 years or so.

My only issue with the game, as I have kinda said before it that it takes time for it to be fun. Some funny/interesting things happen regardless, but the mechanics are hard since this game was coded eons ago. I've played 49 hours of Dwarf Fortress as of writing this review and I still have a lot of things I don't understand. That being said, I still find enjoyment with this caveat. There are infinitely generated stories that you can mold in Dwarf Fortress. Right now I have a mayor that got his position stolen from a lazy guy that is good with words. As soon as the new mayor was in office he demanded three earrings to be made. I have no idea why he wanted this, but next time I log into my fortress I'm gonna investigate. Last time I checked he wasn't wearing them, but I didn't check his spouse. 

So far I haven't really recorded any interesting things happening other than that and this naked goblin priest that has been staying in my fortress for some time. I swear he doesn't sleep, all he does is go to the different temples I built and prays all day. I kinda find him suspicious. I'll see if I can update this review after I get some more funny and thought out stories at a later date.

With nearly two decades of dedicated development, Dwarf Fortress is easily a contender for being the most detailed fantasy-themed simulator in existence. Among the many windows hidden throughout the interface you will find colorful details like the tears coating your dwarve's eyes, the exotic thread of a shirt, or the names and parts of musical instruments that are different with each new culture. Every (highly customizable) world you generate is riddled with its own organically grown characters, towns, and mythical beasts. All of this lore is documented in a nice and simple text-based interface that allows for easy perusal.  

Be prepared for frequent wiki visits once you are familiar with the basics, which the built-in tutorial goes over well. As the developers strive to ground their fantasy world in realism, certain mechanics that are simpler and more intuitive in other games may come off as slightly more esoteric in Dwarf Fortress. Unlike crafting games like Minecraft, where the player digs up “iron ore” and smelts it into iron ingots, non-geologists may be shocked to find no such ore in Dwarf Fortress, for in reality, “iron ore” is a category of ores that are rich in metallic iron. Instead, in order for your dwarves to smelt iron they will have to keep an eye out for deposits of magnetite, hematite, and/ore limonite. Mercifully, the in-game descriptions note the applications of each mineral.

Chances are, if you're considering this game, then you've put an hour or two into Rimworld. If so, then the learning curve will be much less steep, but still a workout. A lot of the challenge will be learning the interface and remembering where everything is. 

After all these years, perhaps the most miraculous aspect of this game is its developer's ability to stick it out so long and see their visions made real. I look forward to the plans they have for the future and the continued development of the gorgeous pixel art.",1675802346,1708582984,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The deepness of simulation is just unparalleled. Sometimes a bit strange like you shoot a wild animal which then starts to vomit all over the place... But it is a gem no quesiton about it, 

However the capitalized steam edition.. it is just standard game studio thing: someone wanted to make money doing minimal effort done on the ascii version and it does not really add too much to it. Your eye no longer hurts from the characters, they added sprites thats it. 

The the UI is a joke. I know it is a very complex game with a lots of items, but the problem was never the complexity but BAD underdeveloped interface. Most of the data is not visible. I understand this is more like an ant farm thing than a Sims-like micromanaged style but basic information is missing, search bars missing, categorization is wrong or non existing. 

- There are bugs mentioned like 10 years ago still there, like someone being late on production get slaughtered by the guard captain. I could agree on some beating, a few broken bones, some XP for the doctors to level up, but killing? 
- cannot really see what is going on above like 50 population, total lack of overview features. Cannot see who is dying due to lack of medical treatment, according to wiki there WAS medical overview, its gone. 
- Military overview is a joke
- Mouse scroll switches Z level instead scrolling a list if the list is not scrollable, very annoying. 
- item categorization is a nightmare. Like honey needs a jug, but jug counts as a tool an not the thing it is in so combined items are handled wrong. Hard to see what is where... someone found important to categorize based on the material of the bin... so trading screen is a pain too. Who cares what is the bin made of? Seriously? But dwarves put all sort of stuff in one bin so storage is a mess, it shoudl be categorized based on content. 
- economy does not really work... I have like thousands of stuff in wares but cannot really sell those because the trader just do not have interesting stuff like musical instruments, books, seeds, animals.
- The speed of the game is just insane, need to slow down. Like I released my soldiers from training for a while, the captain soaked up some booze and beated the crap out of the first civilian they saw in the inn, like smashed their head to pieces, and walked away covered in blood in like 2 seconds. What the heck. Later some rogue axeslinger came in and wasted like 5 dwarves by the time military reacted and took it out. There are some alerts but need to find out from hundreds of lines what alert I need, search is missing from most of the screens.
- work order screen unusable after like 50 lines and no categorization. And there are those things already having build in standing order like sort of automated like the kitchen. What? There should be a categorized way to order certain amount of items to be kept in a storage and thats should be it.

Before long you learn the path a piece of hunt takes to become a leather water skin and why you would even want one.
The dwarfs dig into the mountain or down into the earth on your orders. 
You learn why the embarking map warned you about aquifers. 
More dwarfs come to swell your numbers, so more food, drink and housing is required.
You learn what a gelder is if you didn't already know.
Thieving kobolds or monkeys take what little wealth you have, maybe its time for some military or maybe some traps?

Trade carts come- its fine to just remove the trade depot and claim all the stuff isn't it?

If only you had a moat, or siege weapons, or more military than whatever just got slaughtered before the gates of your fort. 
You figure out how to lock the doors, but without outside access, food and drink becomes scarce, and madness fills the stomachs of your dwarfs in its stead.
It is not long before the end is clearly inevitable.

The next time your fort floods when you mess up a moat digging project and the next after that seems plagued with murder and violence. Why can't they just all get along?
Did that felled tree have to crush your woodcutter? Why is the wildlife so aggressive here? The river swells up with the spring thaw and your fisherdwarf is swept away!
Guides talk about how strong volcanoes can be, but the second you embark next to one it's already erupting!

The blood of past fallen forts, now darkened dens for even darker forces, is all but lost to you. 
But the experience you gained from running them gives the next ones a better chance to not meet the same fate.
No worries though, there are plenty of other ways for a dwarf fortress to fall after all.

As described above, Dwarf Fortress is a very chewy colony simulator, with so much in your control, and a deliberate amount more not in your control. The story is shaped between your goals for your dwarfs and the often unforgiving generative nature of the game itself.  It has a dedicated community producing guides and discussions on best practises or just sharing stories. 

If you like the colony manager genre this one is an obvious win. If you read the old ""Boatmurdered"" story (or similar) and want to make your own doomed fort, you're guaranteed to get your dollars worth even just learning the game enough to make a story worthy fort. If you're looking to get into the colony sim genre then you might as well start here.

I'll always have the tale of the time one legendary warrior stood against a full army of goblins and won or the story about the three headed fire breathing chicken frying two squads of dwarfs before they even got close enough to hit it.

And you can have your own stories with this very affordable legendary colony sim, you only need a bit of determination to learn the mechanics and some patience with your dwarfs that really are trying their best with the tools before them.

I don't mind high difficulty and steep learning curve, i don't hate loosing as long as i can learn from it and do better next time. But this game difficulty comes not from it's complexity or requirement of some serious problem solving skills, in many ways the game is very simple, even primitive, and what automation is  available is not that difficult. The difficulty comes from:

- Incredibly unfriendly UI, which lacks information and a lot of quality of life features that you don't even expect can be missing, like ""check all"" button or mouse wheel scroll (some lists are scrollable, some you have to drag by hand).
- Game being very obscurantists about how things actually work and why something happened. I would say 80-90% of what you need to know to play is not provided by the game. This game is basically unplayable without a wiki and wiki often hides crucial info (if it's even there) between some unimportant minutia, potty jokes and real life pictures of stuff. Often you have to hit search engine in hopes to find what you looking for.
- Often running on some weird logic, on the level of ""90s quest game"" weird.
- Insane amount of micromanagement with no real way to automate most of it.
- Bugs

For example, imagine you set up your new colony and set your woodcutter dwarf on some trees to get logs. Then you see some urgent alert ""something collapsed on surface"" and an icon of battle. You go there, see your dwarf in pool of blood and nothing around. You look at the log and see him fighting a tree (and loosing). So, what happened? Was it some sort of tree monster? Did your dwarf go insane and got into a loosing fight with tree? No, after googling a bit i found out that if a ground under or near the tree is sandy, the game registers a ""cave in"" despite it not happening and tree that usually falls safely, now falls with lethal force. Is there anything in the game that would warn me about it? No. Was there anything on the wiki on pages on trees and woodcutting? No. Is there a convenient way to check tiles under a tree? Not really. You have to check by hand every tree before cutting it or just bear with it and change your woodcutter once or twice a year.

Another example is farming. To farm you basically need muddy floor, to get muddy floor you need to make it wet. No, of course you can't just make a designation or zone on this farm plot that would make dwarfs spray water on it. What you do is you make a room above the plot, carve some of the floor from that room and either set up a pump (which is not really an option at the start) or designate the area without a floor as pond, then your dwarfs start to run around trying to fill it with water, making room below wet. Of course if you make a single pond zone, then only a single dwarf would do that, which means that the room will dry faster than it will water it, so make like 10 of 1 tile pond zones to do it quickly. Of course inside the game there is nothing that would teach you that you need to do that. And the whole way is incredibly counter intuitive. It feels more like workaround that somehow made it's way into final release.

The problem is that game is full of such ""workarounds"" and different mechanics working together in unpredictable and often weird way. It is such a hack job. It doesn't feel like something that was polished for 20 years. It feels like something that was rushed in a couple of months by a noobie dev.

As it stands, dwarf fortress steam edition is a major step in the general development of the game.
There have been a lot of quality of life decisions which make this game much more accessible. I was not sure about the graphics initially, after years of playing with the ASCII interface but I am amazed at how well these new graphics go well with the general setting. The reworking of menus is also a great improvement.

The game in its current state is  missing a few features like adventure mode, full keyboard bindings, the ability to easily bring up combat logs, a more obvious notification method to let you know your dwarves are being slaughtered, and sometimes the multiples clicks to achieve repetitive tasks. But I have blind faith in the developers who are going to relentlessly put out updates over the next years, even decades.

I have known about the game for years, read about it, watched some game play and it looked like fun.  I loved the idea behind it and the depth of the simulation and it's right up my alley in terms of base and city building type games.  Plus it has dwarfs and as we all know dwarfs are the best fantasy race.  The issue was that I could never get past the ASCII graphics.  A week ago I found out that it was now on Steam with pixel art graphics which I'm a big fan of in games like Stardew Valley.  Steam said I'd love it so I went and got it, honestly for 20 years of development the price was a giveaway anyway.

I've had so much fun already and it's only been 15 hours.  It's addictive and I find myself randomly thinking about potential new fortress layouts, new ideas for rooms, how to optimize my industry etc at various points throughout the day.  I don't know how many more hours I will lose this game, but I know there are many.

10/10 will recommend!

Long before I even had a steam account. Do I play it today? Not much as I want too. This game ""dwarfs"" Rimworld (which I consider a masterpiece as well) and every other colony game out there. Without DF, there is no Rimworld. This game is so deep with so much depth (no pun intended). It starts as a complicated embankment of 7 dwarves where a new player will be fumbling the controls and the mechanics. Then opens up into the most complex world simulation in gaming history. Seriously.. if you need entertainment, just look up 1000 ways to have a fortress die in DF, check out the one player who manage to build a fortress in hell, or the incredible adventure stories where a player steals a necromancers book and creates an army of the undead. How about just read the simple narriation of two humanoids getting into a fight without weapons. You'll be blown away by the amount of detail involved in just a simple brawl. Now imagine that complex little brawl scattered across a massive battlefield with dwarves, humans, elves, and goblins are all ripping each other apart. Actual insanity.
If you have the patience to learn this extremely complex game, do it. Be warned, its not easy. The games slogan is ""Losing is fun"". You'll spend hours learning to play, then die over and over.
Another fun fact, DF was one major inspiration for Minecraft. Although they're very different games, Minecrafts Developer ""Notch"" has explicitly state this.",1707289789,1707290270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The beautiful core gameplay is all here, and all the depth, story telling and complexity that comes with it. HOWEVER, at this stage I can't recommend it yet. 

One big issue is crashing. In my first 10 hours the game probably crashed 12+ times, and I only started playing post the initial crash fix on Dec 8. 

From a UX/UI perspective the game still sucks. Don't get me wrong, its a MASSIVE improvement, however it hasn't been polished yet. There are loads of tedious/clunky UI issues that need to get fixed. Inconsistent behaviour, bad menus, poor navigation and sorting options etc. etc. Lots of little, obvious improvements to be made before this game is a recommend. 

On the bright side, unlike most games these days you already know that these changes will come in time, and at that point this game will be incredible. However, especially if you're a first time player, just wait a bit for these problems to get ironed out. It will make your first play through SO much better and remove the constant unnecessary frustrations that could ruin your experience with what is an immensely difficult game to get into.

Complete rip-off.

BEWARE: UNDISCLOSED EARLY ACCESS TITLE

They asked us to vote on this Early access title for Labor of love and its not even eligible! lmaooooooo
MANY more MONTHS since release.... Nothing has changed...
This game is actually an Early Access title. It released with major bugs. It is still missing a major mode: adventure mode SEVEN MONTHS past release. A recent Q&A on YT the dev was asked when we can expect Adventure Mode and He couldnt even give a guess as to when it would be complete. Before completing this steam port they are touting a new update that will get this game ready to be ported to linux... a lot of good that does anyone who already paid for the steam version.

Multi threading was introduced but is only ""experimental"" aka is still in BETA... (ANNND its not even needed, unless you have a REALLY old CPU. My cpu is NOT powerful and has had ZERO problems running the game).
They have decided to play with pixel art graphics instead of actually doing any real programming to finish the game. Now dwarfs will have randomized faces... Will pause for applause.....

***NEW UPDATE***
Devs are travelling or some shish and we got Hippo Pixel art. MoRe PiXeL aRt!!!

****NEWEST UPDATE***** 
Devs got covid after going travelling. Couldnt even do pixel art this time... SMFH.

Currently dwarves cannot pick up Ammo so crossbows are melee weapons. There is no recorded history of your fort, no event log to tell you what just happened. Dwarves will be drowning ect but you will have no idea, why and are left on your own to figure it out... if you ever do. (with the amount of bugs its hard to tell when something isnt working correctly because of a bug or because you didnt set it up correctly) When you create a world, an entire history is generated for that world but it loads in so fast that you dont have time to read it and cannot scroll up to see previous events. Its a completely broken feature. All it does in actuality is randomize how large or small the dwarf/goblin population is. You can create a world with 1000 years of history that you cant read about. (you can in the free version) lmao.

These are all features that are available in the free version but NOT available in the ""Premium"" version.

By the time you realize all of this the 2 hour return window will have long passed. Save yourself the money and time. DONT BUY.

Once you realize nothing can attack walls and doors and you learn you can grow food indoors, seal off the deep underground and you will understand the only thing that can make you ""lose"" is an impossible to prevent Vampire settling in your fort and killing/turning everyone. You are invincible until a vampire comes. Then you auto lose. Thats not fun.

Community Hub shows only 800 people are playing Dwarf fortress while its most obvious competition: Rimworld has 20,000 people playing. There's a reason for that.",1670344873,1706562739,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

So one of my megaproject forts was draining a volcano, and I had gated off all of the drains with floodgates so I could remotely turn on and off the flow. Was making last minute tweaks to the exit drain off the map (this was about 25z levels down). An elven caravan came by selling giant tigers, and I scrambled to buy a mating pair so I could create a massive army of trained giant war tigers because of course I did.

Now giant tigers are carnivores so I couldn't leave them cooped up in their poor cages so I just let them roam free because literally NOTHING in that biome could even come close to harming them.

As I continued smoothing the floor for the drain (not necessary just an aesthetic choice) I accidentally broke into the cavern below me and quicker than I could seal it up a cave troll broke through!

Now I had no prepared militia that could even stand up to such a threat, so I retreated hoping to escape with my stoneworker's lives. The terrifying troll crushed one's skull in a single blow and began chasing after the others. After a few ticks it broke a floodgate holding the lava back, and as it ran down the wall it just kept breaking floodgate after floodgate. My two remaining stoneworker were running towards the stairs but I knew that no door in the fort could stop the howling regenerating menace bent on splattering my poor remaining workers.

Suddenly out of the staircase, the female tiger sprang through the door and confronted the cave troll. I was hoping with all prayers to Armok that she would be strong enough to take out the menace. 

They traded blow after blow, knocking out teeth and crunching limbs. The poor tigress was getting the worst of it but she did not give up and kept the troll busy long enough for the lava to catch up with him. He died sizzling and she tried crawling away but was soon also lost to the hungry wall of liquid death. 

But she bought us time to close the door, and later crews would come in to obsidian cast and clear out the mess. 

That fort survived only due to the brave sacrifice of that beautiful giant tiger. I built a statue of solid bear fat soap in her honor (oldbeards know how sincere that is).

I have played Dwarf Fortress in nearly every form since 2009 and it remains my most played game by hours by a LONG shot.

There is so much richness and detail lovingly given to nearly every facet of this game, it is truly a work of passion by a very small group of incredibly talented and mad-in-the-most-beautiful-way individuals. 

To be honest, I prefer the non-steam version and am a lot faster in designing and designating that it's all muscle memory for me and most any feature can be used with three keystrokes. That said I bought this immediately when it became available because the Tarn and Zach deserve every penny for their life's dedication to such an amazing, deep, and constantly surprising title.

Dwarf Fortress, hands down, is the most fun game I have played in a least a decade, and it is right now, my favorite game I have ever played. The learning curve is steep, but the thing is, you don't need to know all of the mechanics to enjoy the game. I didn't know how to build mist generators until like 300hrs into the game - I didn't miss out. 
That's kind of the thing with this game. Most games are, to use a popular term that's often applied to another studios games, as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. Dwarf Fortress right now, is a reasonably sized ocean with extremely deep depths. Yes, it's a colony management game at the end of the day, but how many colony sims generate in depth personalities, likes and dislikes, favorite minerals and colors, for each and every single one of your colonists not to mention the visitors that you will often see in your taverns? How many games, generate secret plots that run under your nose without you knowing of it - a plot that you will have to expose against your empire, an underground crime ring, or a smuggling operation etc. How MANY GAMES PROCEDURALLY GENERATE up to 500 years of unique history and world? How many games simulate every single part of your inhabitants body parts, or their current thoughts, or memories from past and present which define them as people? How many games let you deal with vampires secretly sucking the blood out of your dwarves, which you will have to weed out, and how many games let you deal with the dreaded, almost game ending scenario of a werewolf infestation, literally playing a dwarven version of John Carpenters ""The Thing""?

Not very many. And none as good as this.

To add, the game also simulates liquid movement. You can create running rivers inside your 20 story deep fortress. And you can use the very same river to generate water power - given that the water is moving of course. The liquids in the game have up to 7 depth, 3 being waist deep and above 3...well, let's hope whoever is in there has good swimming skills.

On the subject of skills, every inhabitant is unique, they are good at many things but not suited to all things due to their personality. For example, you do want a soldier who is a master swordsman. You don't want a soldier who is a master swordsman but cowardly, however this does not mean you cant utilize them effectively, a lot of things in this game are completely viable. For example, you can have the perfect soldier and leader to lead your squad, but, they do need to be good at explaining their skills to train their soldiers. 

On the subject of personality, I have never had the same dwarf be generated twice. Never. Some dwarves are very...normal. They just want to work, and eat, sleep. Other dwarves, well...some people can never be pleased. I have had recidivists in my fortress that you wouldn't believe. Some of them never even confessed to their crimes. A lot of them went insane in prison. I had a vampire who served at least 13 years without release in prison, for murder - he was a serial killer. No one is the same. Everyone is unique - and everyone is made of flesh. Losses are inevitable.

And since losses are inevitable, you can create descriptively detailed graves or coffins for your good dwarves which have passed away in the heat of battle or who drowned, or were hit by a platinum rail cart and vaporized. You do not HAVE to detail these yourself, the story is already generated and their deeds are known across your fortress. Dwarves will carve our descriptions on their own, and some are quite heartwarming. If you do not bury your dwarves, they will haunt you, and some ghosts ARE violent, and others are just scary. Bury your people.

Bury them, because they will die in battle. You can equip dwarves with the strongest gear, but we all run out of luck eventually. When I was settling the Mushroom frontier underground, I assigned my top men to guard the settlers. Things did not go as planned. I was attacked by bird warriors with spears and shields - some quite formidable. We did manage to repel most of the attacks, but injuries piled on top of injuries and the strength of my men dwindled. I found most of them dead, literally surrounded by over dozens of corpses each. They secured the escape of our civilians at their own expense. They were all buried and memorized. That's what's pretty cool about this game, a lot of people will have different experiences when doing things. It generates stories like this one. Its a colony sim at its core, but i would say a good chunk of it, and a good chunk it is, is story generating. That is why i think this truly is an infinitely re-playable game.

Each injury IS simulated, and they will need to be treated, but not always. Sometimes, I THINK, they will heal on their own. but you need to set up a complex production chain to make soap and bandages. To make soap, you need to melt down fat, you also need lye, then you need someone to combine these two materials to make soap. To get fat, you need someone to butcher an animal, and melt down its fat. Of course, you CAN use oil. Then you need to produce chains and tables, to produce traction benches. The reason i bring this up, is because this is what you will need to do most of the time. The caravans only come around so often. 

On the subject of skills, your dwarves are quite skilled. But, your dwarves are not mere workers. They need to drink, eat, and have fun, and of course, follow their passions in life. They will need to pray to their gods which you have to build temples for, and eventually, they will ask for a guild meeting area, in which they will meet occasionally to spend time and train others and themselves. Skills CAN be improved, but they can also be forgotten if not used semi regularly.

On the subject of defense, you will need to defend. You will need to, or you will die. This can be done in a lot of ways. You can, just have a standing army, but you can for example, carve a moat out and place a retractable bridge. You can also, dig a very deep hole and place traps in a way where it makes enemies crossing near it, fall to their deaths, or if not to their deaths, their eternal suffering either inside the hole or in your cages after you capture them. You can for example, build a railway, place railcarts on it, and place swords inside them - and place a stop track at the end of the railway to stop the carts and launch the swords from them, killing anything in their way. You can also build a railcart trap, where they spin infinitely and vaporize (you will literally see them fling away and their body parts will also fly). You can build moats and high walls, but there are flying enemies. 

And there's a lot of variety between species, especially with mods. But even vanilla offers a lot of variety. There are not just  dwarves populating the world, of course. Elves, goblins, undead, skeletons, vampires, werevolves, kobolds. Most of them can settle in your fortress if you give them permission, but not all of them will straight up tell you who they are (werevolves for example). You get access to information, but not all of it.

On the subject of jobs, there's pretty much as specific and either as mundane or exciting as real life. Someone can be a pump operator for example, others can be bards. Some can be singers, dancers, entertainers. Others can be cooks, cleaners or fetchers, miners, woodcutters, rangers. It is a LOT to take in, and it takes time to understand a lot of...anything in this game. The UI is not very good, or intuitive. There are of course, certain occupations which demand a bunch of work to please, such as nobles or leaders. They will generally demand more things, and interestingly, some of them will also dish out orders of their own, for example set up a quota to produce a certain item or export.",1706296592,1706296726,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I tried Dwarf Fortress a long time ago, I knew it was a game I would  as I enjoy colony based games and the depth and complexity of the game intrigued me but the UI was not very user friendly back then and I just ended up dropping it because of it. Now the games UI is understandable, it makes learning the extra systems very easy and it all just ""falls into place""

The new UI actually resembles Rimworld and even Prison Architect quite a bit, which is fair, given how much both of those two games lifted from Dwarf Fortress. It's the circle of life.

When first I saw this game several years ago, I thought to myself; that such a complex game would surely be perfect for me, were it not a colony simulation. My personal tastes do not naturally lend themselves to the hearth of a dwarven city, nor do they lean to the meticulous resource management of a ""Story Generator."" When a year later I picked up the game for myself, I was sorely mistaken. That this game truly is not just perfect for me, but perfection itself. The dwarves I had grown to know throughout my years grew more and more personal to my eyes, with the individual unit of this game born of a more rich storytelling environment than that of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. In mere minutes before my eyes I watch the creation of living, breathing life in a simulated world. I watched the rise and fall of nations, the discovering of dark secrets, the unleashing of beasts beyond our comprehension. No other game captivated me so, for the stories of ""Dwarf Fortress"" are not just simulation. They are truly alive.

I initially was displeased with the game. This was no doubt due to my ignorance and lack of wisdom at the time, for until then my life had been devoid of Dwarf Fortress. I would not understand the complexities and perfections of this masterpiece. All I saw were small ASCII glyphs written over my screen like hieroglyphs over stone. I did not know the dwarves I commanded on a personal level, not yet at least. I did not understand why exactly my fortresses would crumble into madness when I did not produce enough alcohol, nor did I grasp the laments of an aquifer's challenge. The game seemed foreign, benign, and in fact haunting to me, as I poured over what information I could access with my limited knowledge. This changed all in one simple action, when I first examined the Legends file of my very first world. I read for hours of the adventures of heroes of a bygone age, the rise and fall of aforementioned nations. No detail was spared as I continued reading tirelessly, seeing finally what great stories unfolded before my weak, unknowing eyes. In that file was the collective joy, fear, strife, pain, sadness, failure, success, romance, and life of an entire world. One that was generated in only a few minutes. Those who have not read as such have not truly given this ""game"" a chance, for in this magnificent masterwork is the potential to shape simulations detailed enough to live in yourself.

And now I hardly remember those distant days, when I did not know of the dwarves in their fortresses. When I had not been blessed by the sheer impact of such an impossibly beautiful creation. Those days feel so sad now, as though before experiencing Dwarf Fortress I had not yet experienced the joy of storytelling. I had not known how a ""make-believe"" character could love, nor how they could hate. For what can men do against such reckless hate? The wars and stories of dwarves against goblins, dwarves against hippies, dwarves against men are too detailed perhaps, for one who lacks the will. The level of detail of this game has given me a wonderful appreciation for the art of storytelling. For all the world is made of stories.

C.S Lewis once said that if you do not feel a love for this world, perhaps it is because you were made for a different one. This is the world I was made for, for this is a world comprised entirely of stories. No matter how often I repeat the statement, the worlds of Dwarf Fortress are as complex as any. Tolkien would have been proud to see his concepts of dwarves and elves (perhaps not the elves...) tuned to this incredible canvas for the painting of tales beyond simple imagination.

And like any good story, Dwarf Fortress is full of joyful successes, and harrowing failures. I have lost many wonderful fortresses due to many a circumstance. But when I continued on after my defeats, I learned why the folk who delve into this game say that ""losing is fun."" I tracked my legendary swordmaster from my first fort of the Steam release using the Legends file. He started a group of bandits after my fortress fell, creating a name for himself as a king of brigands. His skill was absolute, as his mastery of the blade felled the strongest of giant elephants. I started anew closeby to where I thought his camp to be, and gained wealth enough to become a barony of the land. Shortly after my wealth and lands grew to that of a county, and after that; the legendary swordmaster returned to me. A messenger of his came to me stating that he and his campsite wished to join my lands, so that he may return to his homeland. Throughout this journey I learned much more about the world itself. My legendary miner had become a talented bard who roamed the world in search of stories, much like myself. He took residence in one of my fortresses as a permanent entertainer in fact, so that he also would return from the ruins of his civilization. Thousands more stories were told and found in that world of dwarves. And I had not yet been able to experience the Adventure mode, for even at the time of writing this, it has yet to be fully furnished for it's release.

Such a beautiful game has never before been made, for the ideology of losing being fun, with loss being only as part of a story as victory is foreign to most who would call themselves ""gamers."" The thought that my own personal failures, in game and in life would not be insignificant amazed me. That my losses would bring me to a greater height, that they would become apart of my own story... Such a thought turned my life from a search for purpose, to a search for stories. I now look for stories wherever they can be found, for our world is also comprised of stories and tales, some of which go untold. The history of this world is richer than the worlds of Dwarf Fortress, and there are stories told over the course of thousands of years which can be found in the world which we are so fortunate to dwell in. Stories are everywhere, in every person you meet, every site you visit, every piece of art you see, every scientific law you experience. Everything is a story. And those stories were made of losing before they were made of winning. 

I sit here now ready to embark once more on a new adventure in Dwarf Fortress, there and back again. I wonder what else lies out there in Dwarf Fortress, and what lies out there in this world.

Once you get a good grasp on how to keep your colony thriving and learn about most of the game's many sub-mechanics, you will begin to understand why people talk about this game with so much praise despite its flaws.

Concerning the flaws. I find it problematic that a big part of the community sweeps them under the rug. I won't do such a thing so let's address the main problems before we go to the good stuff:

- This game lacks a ridiculous amount of information on how to manage your colony. The tutorial barely covers a quarter of the core content of this game. I hate, hate, hate games that force players to rely on wikis. The wiki needs to be in the game, period. The game needs pop up info bubbles that are triggered when certain things happen for the first time. The game needs a codex. Many windows such as Dwarf profile require additional info for us to understand what's even going on.

- The user interface is very difficult to understand. There are many icons that do not explain visually what they exactly do. It is also quite ugly even for a 2D game.

- The game relies heavily on the modding community to make obvious quality of life content which is by definition wrong in my opinion. This includes the UI, visual polishing of the game, diversified icons and more.

- The game needs some animations and additional sounds to make it more lively and real. Animations shouldn't be too hard to do. Just 3 sprites for a dwarf drinking some ale could do the trick. You always hear the same sounds on loop on different floors depending on what you built. It's very annoying in the long run.

- The sprites move from one tile to the other. That is a problem, not just an aesthetic but also a practical one. Don't get me wrong - you will get over it after a short time though. It's all good up until you have a dwarf army and want to see the progression of the battle, or when you want to figure out the traffic movement of your dwarves when they are traveling from one place to the other to figure out if you could do something better to make them work faster. You can kinda guess their movement but it's just not fun. It is also very bothersome when many dwarves are on the same tile - for example during combat - and you're trying to figure out who's who.

- The game has so many features that some fall flat when you explore them and their impact on the game is minimal and more anecdotic than anything else. This is similar to Rimworld or Crusader Kings for example. Sometimes I wish those games would have more engaging stories that would be scripted. I think there could be room for both types.

- There are optimization issues with this game when you have many floors with many dwarves. The game will lag on your computer even if you can run current highly demanding games if you widen your fortress' map upon creating it. That is not normal and needs to be addressed.

There is also one thing that I believe falls between the positive and negative depending on how you view these types of games: The heavy randomization of things leave very little room for actual event structure, so it's just random things happening once in a while. Do not believe the Youtubers who come up with elaborate stories of their colony, they just make things up. That's not wrong per se but it can mislead some people into thinking there's an actual story here. A series of random events does not make a story unless you want it to.

Now for the good!

- Your fortress is just a small square in the huge world map where many things have happened, are happening and will happen. It's very fun to make a fortress and then move on to a close location and interact with your past colony and things like that. The game generates its own lore which is pretty cool.

- You will realize some dwarves are very likeable and you will be attached to them and will want them to be happy. Usually they are the most helpful and competent dwarves but sometimes they may also have been subjected to a specific event that you witnessed and then you took a liking to them. The dwarves all have their own personality, talents and needs. It's very fun to look at their profiles and figure out what kind of persons they are.

- Digging and building is extremely addictive and the same can be said about collecting, harvesting and storing stuff. There is always something to do. The progression of your colony is optimal and heavenly satisfying. It is in my opinion the main appeal of the game and the appeal is so grand that it makes you forget the flaws of Dwarf Fortress. It is just legendary fun.

- If you played Rimworld - it is Rimworld on steroids: much bigger but also jankier and much more unpredictable. I highly recommend it for Rimworld veterans.

- I like the music, it's different from your average fantasy game.

- Years... No, DECADES of modding just in case you ever got bored of this game.

- When you buy it you feel good for supporting the lifelong dream of people who worked for a long, long time on a game that became a benchmark of its genre.",1705874452,1705875618,True,73,1,0.813643813133239746,5,True,False,False

Dwarf Fortress created the genre of the survival wilderness settlement sim but you must be patient to deal with many bugs and the worst UI that was ever devised for a game. The Steam version is okay with some improvements but also some steps back with no adventure mode yet and some new bugs. I will warn you that this game is not for everyone, you will have to read articles and wikis to understand how to do basic things. You cannot directly control the dwarves except for telling the soldiers where to go. You will eventually get the hang of it, build an amazing underground fortress and your colony will just stop working when you ultimately get too many dwarves or a bad mood spreads and makes everyone go crazy and destroy the whole colony. In the meantime there are so many things to explore, worlds and histories to procedurally generate, strategies for survival, trying to settle in different environments like wastelands near a necromancer or a jungle with elves. There are some challenges like getting through that freaking annoying aqueduct and figuring out how to keep the water or lava from going into your main hall by using pumps and reservoirs. There is even a static defense challenge to solve because you will get invaded by goblins and worse. The game is 3D, in a sense, because you can look at horizontal slices of square tiles and step up and down through layers, from the top of trees into the sky and down into the earth with natural caves and unknown horrors.

Overall, Dwarf Fortress is a fascinating and flawed game that has tons of features. The UI is tedious to use but the game is cutting edge in procedural generation of history and makes a decent sim management game. I personally prefer Rimworld, which was inspired by this one, but I'm glad I bought this game and gave it a chance even before it came to Steam.",1705755239,1705755239,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Outside of that, this has brought back some good memories.  Also, I can actually kind of tell what I am doing this time around with the graphic improvements.

Edit of my review follows: 

200 hours into this and still loving it, I am posting that edit just for the people that are bit sour about old DF fans posting reviews.

Let me tell yeah I like:

1. the fact that dwarves have back stories, values, things that motivate them
2. the items actually matter and have histories
3. x/y/z building access sets this game apart from other similar colony building games
4. hours upon hours worth of designing a robust and unique city
5. the monsters are cool, the forgotten beasts are always random
6. aquifers are a challenge but fun to work/design around if not slow
7. the layers of rocks and minerals actually matter
8. virtually everything in the game in terms of a raw resource is usable and has a purpose

Things that need improving:

1. some bugs every so often, like a block that drop and hit something...when that block was removed via a dwarf years ago...strange little things like that
2. adventure mode should fix this, but in the current game you don't really get to truly explore the world outside of your respective fortress, expect this to change in the future
3. i would really love if making dyes were slightly easier and there be more dye variations...maybe a mod might improve this point
4. i would love to see the inclusion of ships in the game, but i know that might be asking for too much",1671010594,1705210100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am new to the game, and it seems interesting, but it is so janky I can't even say. I quit multiple times just because I had to Google out my problem instead of playing the game. Later I came back (with some Google help) and solved the issues I had. I am not talking about challenging and interesting issues to solve in game, but rather stupid quality of life things to manage your colony. 

Few examples/problems I have at the moment:
- You cannot reduce size of any zone you add, like what the hell. You expand home zone where it safe for you dwarf, and dear god, do not miss click. You will need to select full map on multiple Z levels, but you cannot reduce the size of the zone. Now my dwarf can go to caverns, I just don't care to manage the zones. 
- Stuff happening or not happening for no apparent reason, like hunter not hunting (still trying to figure out), dwarf being sad (I think because his friend died, but I am not sure)
- Bunch of bugs, when Googling you will find help explaining that there is this or that bug which you need to avoid, this is a bit ridiculous.

That's just some problems I have now, many I did solve already, so I can figure it out, but it is annoying as hell. 

BTW, I did watch around 3h of tutorials and I google every issue I find, so I am getting by. However, this is far from the experience you would get with for e.g. Rimworld

In the 5 years of its lifespan, the dwarves turned a hill in the middle of a dense forest into a busy industrial facility.
The only thing the fortress was lacking was trained soldiers and weapons. Allthough they did successfully defend against the occasional goblin sieges. In the year 55, a goblin siege had just ended with the dwarves victorious and drunk (as always), but the atmosphere would soon be crushed by an ancient dragon whose name is still unknown. The dragon rampaged through the fortress, killing all residents (children included) and leaving behind just ash and piles of gore.

Knife-ear killing simulator, now featuring an official tileset and a perfect soundtrack!

I've been playing df since 2018 and this just gave it a new life. This version is alot easier to stream to friends and have them understand what's happening on my screen.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The developers are truly astounding people, and I purchased and played this game because of them and them alone, and I have not been disappointed.  This game has been a development of love and dedication of which most people will never be able to understand or comprehend.  It is also a game of depth of which most people will not be able to truly appreciate on the level that it actually deserves.  Being an old school gamer, the graphics are never as much of concern to me as they seem to be to most.  I am quite content re-playing FFIII and FFVII over and over these last couple of decades.  
I recommend this game to people who can do three things:  Have mountains of patience, have the love of puzzles to figure them out to some degree, and who to those who can spend at least a little bit of time looking up the development and evolution of this endeavor.  
In the first 36 hours I have lost quite a few times and re-tried as much.  I have learned a ton and have not even been able to delve into the underlying generated story.  I am a beginner, and I have so many solutions that will cause so many problems that I don't even understand yet, but that's okay.  Because I'm going to lose. The fact that I already know this should say a ton about the game.  I'm a builder, I'm a planner, I'm a great person when it comes to work arounds.  The depth is astounding, just don't get hung up on the graphics.  Also: this was largely the works of two people.

While I appreciate the diversity and complexity of my dwarves, I find myself bashing my head trying to figure out what to build when I encounter X situation and where in heck of the array of menu build options that exist.

Unless you've been playing this game for the past decade like many of the reviews, you'll have to watch hours of tutorials just to keep your colony alive as the cues in the game aren't enough. Tooltips or a first timer colony advisor like every other game would have made sense to implement. Building is a chore in this game. Do you want to build multiple bedrooms? You'll have to walk through the nested build menus each time to build a bed or a door and get a prompt for the material type, e.g. species of wood or stone. There's no mechanism to build multiple items for example (I mean minecraft does this DUH) and you'll be forced to worry about the material type EVERY TIME, which is mind boggling to me. At least, there's no way around this I can tell or observed in a video. And while I admit it'd be great to have all the doors be the same color or whatever, but they could have instrumented that functionality in the UI.

The learning curve was so incredibly steep caused by the vast game mechanics, shortcut only - keyboard control and ASCII graphics. Yes.. ASCII graphics, look it up kids!

As it was free I was willing to go the extra mile, reading on Forums and looking up videos.
Almost 20 years later they released it on Steam, and best of all they took down this steep learning curve!

Visually recognizable sprites, tutorials, mouse support are all there now. And sure the game mechanics are still vast so looking up a 15 minute video will still help you but you can actually start enjoying the game straight away.

When I heard this game to steam, I didn't even think about it. Instant buy only to help these 2 brothers that created this legendary piece of gaming history.

But it the end I think the purchase is actually standing on it's own. It IS worthy the money and the game with all it's upgrades is as awesome as ever.

It is a bit cheesy to say, but this game is truly easy to play and difficult to master.
You are in control in what environment you play, how you want to play and what you want to achieve.

It is awesome as a colony builder type of game, and maybe even more as a story telling game.
Buy this game, be part of something amazing and get engulfed in it's absolutely massive size.

My hours don't reflect my time with this game as it would be in the hundreds. And you can count on it that many hundred will be recorded on the steam version as well!

1) The Alerts system makes it difficult/annoying to view combat, so I just don't read combat scenes anymore, which takes away some of the silly fun of the OG desktop version. I think it would be cool if the current alert system remained, but combat alerts were more streamlined, listing fights in one tab rather than having to navigate to every individual fight.
2) Can't play exclusively with keyboard anymore. I am ill quite often as of late and I find it annoying that I no longer have the ability to lay in bed with just my laptop. Now I have to bend my arm in weird positions to play with mouse+keyboard and it hurts my wrist. Mouse isn't as precise as keyboard, too, but it has been made clear to me that the old shortcut system is never coming back. :C
3) Some of the sprites are missing, don't make sense, or are lacking. No baby dwarf sprites, but troglodyte and gorlak babies? The toad sprite is just 4 incomprehensibly-shaped pixels, but the frog sprite has a full icon? Why can't I see my dwarves eat anymore?
4) Canceling a build if you mess up the placement of a workshop or construction causes you to have to navigate through the entire menu all over again. This was less annoying when using keyboard only, but I wish pressing ESC removed the building placement and/or just moved you back one step in the menu rather than closing everything.
5) MANUAL SAVES SOMETIMES DON'T WORK!!!!! I learned save files will fail if using a symbol (e.g. !, @, #, /), but sometimes completely normal saves won't be remembered in the game itself, so I have to navigate to the Steam folder in my system and manually make the game load that save file.
6) In relation to my last point, I wish it was able to see the REAL WORLD date & time of saves, so I don't have to remember if I named my save ""AAAAA"" or ""AAAAAAAAHHH"" and can just go by the latest date.
7) Military menu UI is horrible. Two big red X's and one of them cancels a squad's action, while the other DELETES the entire squad (good luck if you're training peasants and can't remember their names). They're right next to each other!! LMAO!
8) TOO EASY TO CHEAT. I accidentally destroyed my Trade Depot while trading in one game and the merchants left all of their goods behind. I don't remember if this was possible in the OG version, but it bums me out when I accidentally cheat and didn't instead crush the departing merchants with a drawbridge or something.

Okay, that's all. I still really like the game and look forward to the new adventure mode for this steam version. I recommend the game to anyone who likes micro-managing ant farm simulators, but it has a high learning curve and you WILL need the Wiki or Reddit open to learn how to build things.

At first you'll be drawn in by the charm and seemingly innocent premise, but the trouble soon begins... 

The most glaring issue with the game is the complete opacity of any of the underlying mechanics by which the game operates. The in-game tutorial is totally insufficient to explain to you how anything really works. Your hope ends up resting on your ability to constantly google ""dwarf fortress how to ______"" and hope that there is a fellow Autist out there who was masochistic enough to have brute forced the issue in the past and was kind enough to post about it. But that's just it, you never know if you're getting good intel or not. Everything I read online just seems to be people's 'best guess' about the nature of things. 

Why is it that you can smooth a floor, but sometimes you're unable to engrave it? Why does my water-mister, which has worked flawlessly for 4 seasons, suddenly start flooding the Dwarf-Hold? Why is it that anytime there's a fight with monsters that every member of the military and anyone in the vicinity gets PTSD, goes crazy and starts beating the shi* out of everyone else until you exile them or put them in a cage? Why did I spend an hour painstakingly making a mine cart shaft 20 levels up to my main workshop just so that the dwarves will fill the minecart AND THEN JUST PICK IT UP AND FRIGGING CARRY IT UP 20 LEVELS INSTEAD OF USING THE MINECART TRACKS???? Are the game designers actually so sadistic that they want me to build 100 consecutive z-levels of fluid pumps in order to actually use the magma?

Not going to lie.  The game intimidated me for a long time, but the graphics overhaul of the Steam version made it feel more accessible to me.

It's definitely worth the effort, but be prepared for frustrations with the UI as you learn the various quirks, and if you are a a detailed micro manager like myself, you are probably going to want to review the wiki and various forums for info on the regular because you will constantly have questions about pretty much everything.

Secondly, I whole-hardheartedly endorse this game, but with one big caveat: It has an extremely steep learning curve.

Dwarf Fortress is a game where you will fail many times before you succeed. It does not hold your hand and does not do tutorials. You will be thrown in the deep end and it can seem overwhelming. However, with persistence, the Dwarf Fortress wiki, and some guidance from the wider Dwarf Fortress community (see r/DwarfFortress or the Bay 12 forums) a player will find themselves slowly mastering the many layers of interlocking systems that make up this game.

Once you do start to have a handle on it though, you'll find that Dwarf Fortress is one of the most complex and rewarding colony-simulation games out there. You have to make your own fun, but it's such a wide sandbox with so many things to explore and exploit that you'll never run out of options. If you can tolerate pushing past the learning curve, you're going to love this game.

I could have sworn i didn't play this version that much... yet.
 over 400 hours in the course of 3 weeks i think is not that much, right ? RIGHT ?
Over 600 hours now...

If I could convince anyone to buy any game; I would probably convince them to buy Portal 1, or perhaps Portal 2. I would never even so much as mention Dwarf Fortress, despite it being the best game I have ever played in my entire life. There is something undeniably special about the game. Its cult following and impenetrable user interface (at least for the non-steam version) might make it hard to get into, but if you can stick with it, very soon; you will find that Dwarf Fortress is not hard.

There is one button to do anything, you could play this game on a controller with some very liberal rebindings and only marginal sacrifice to certain controls. I'm sure someone has already played this on the Steam Deck, even. And even beyond the controls, the actual means of surviving is simpler. Funnily enough, copy-cat games in the vein of Gnomoria often have this reverse flanderization effect, where they exaggerate the difficulty and make everything more complicated simply because it's what people expect from these types of colony sims now. They expect that BECAUSE of Dwarf Fortress.

To continue using Gnomoria as an example, in Gnomoria, to make a pickaxe, you first need to make a workshop, then you need to make a wooden shaft, then you need to make a pick head, then you need to assemble it at a workshop.
In Dwarf Fortress, to make a pickaxe, you first need to build a wood furnace to get charcoal, then build a blacksmith and make the pickaxe from there. That's two steps compared to Gnomoria's four.

Even then! That's not complexity. That's just steps. Something having a lot of steps doesn't make it complicated! (dont google the definition) Making your own fresh coffee has a lot of steps, but any idiot with running water and an annoying personality can do it, the difference is commitment. Dwarf Fortress is a game that requires a lot of commitment. Because it isn't complex, it isn't challenging; it's frustrating.

We've all had games that make us want to break things, depending on the type of person you are, Dwarf Fortress may or may not be one of those games for you. You might start your first embark, you're excited to see what all the rage is about, and then before you can even adjust your eyes to the adorable pixel art style -- your fortress has crumbled to its end. While you were trying to figure stuff out, all 7 of your dwarves were eaten by ravenous NBA sized hippos. Shaquille O'neal type hippos. If you try again, you might just give up because it simply isn't fun; nothing is happening. Everything is going too smoothly, and there's no excitement at all. I don't mean to victim blame; but both of these outcomes are the fault of the player. Environments in Dwarf Fortress aren't binary options. 1 doesn't equal good, 0 doesn't equal bad. You might embark right next to a Necromancer's tower just because you don't know what it looks like, or you might settle in the lovely Peaceful plains of Babykillingtonshire where unicorns roam and leprechauns grant wishes. The challenge, even though it's rarely ever explained to you; is completely up to you. 

The challenge in the game comes from the papier-mâché slap-fight combat. Imagine if you would that you were playing Silent Hill 2, but it was the Sims, and there were 200 James Sunderlands walking around that had the same level of hit-points that the average civilian has in Arma 3, Sunderland #199 accidentally got a bad ending, so he loses his mind and bicycle kicks Sunderland #40 down a well, or throws him into a flowing stream of magma. The combat in Dwarf Fortress is so miserable that it's a blessing that you have no direct control over it. It's clunky and desperate, and even an encounter with an angry cardinal (the bird, not the popes-to-be) can feel like it has a life threatening impact. Because it does. The fights can go on for minutes of in-game time, but minutes in-game are fractions of seconds in the real world, so while it might look on the screen that your Legendary Hammerdwarf just got creamed by a giant Murderdeath Killthug made of solid bronze in less than 30 seconds, he actually held out for almost an hour in a one-on-one fight with a beast as old as time.
On one hand: THAT'S FUCKIN' SICK!
On the other: You just lost someone.

Dwarf Fortress has really made me feel for losing characters more than any other game. You'll never feel like they're real people, and you'll never acknowledge them as anything more than a statistic, but it's like having a critical component of infrastructure go missing. You're mad about it, you're not sad. You don't go ""oh no, interstate-72 had a family"" or whatever, you go ""I NEEDED TO GET TO WORK ON TIME YOU MISERABLE BASTARDS!"" Maybe the drafted soldier that just got turned into a comically large puddle of raspberry filling was a legendary crafter who made awesome artifacts regularly, or maybe he wasn't a soldier at all, maybe they just kicked your chief of medicine into a brick wall and he died on the spot. He was your best doctor! Who knows when you'll be able to replace him? All the time spent managing a replacement could be used elsewhere! A doctor might not even show up in the next migrant wave, and everyone else is already specialized into a profession because you spent two real-life hours staring at the labors screen like an autistic little freak-creature, trying to make everything perfect, only to have it all undone because your doctor decided to haul the tattered pants of a dead soldier that had fallen trying to fight the beast. Or because your soldier kept landing glancing blows on a monster. Or because of any number of things.

This is fantastic! I've always loved Dwarf Fortress, but its absolutely uncontroversial that the UI left something to be desired (Tarn adams has always said so himself). In fact so incomprehensible was this game that its difficulty had become as famous as the game itself. But this.... I cant believe I'm saying this.. well I'll just say it;- Dwarf Fortress is an intuitive game now. Well mostly intuitive. You will DEFINATELY need to do the tutorial, and yes that applies to us old-school dorf herders too. The UI is *completely* reimagined. So you might have some muscle memory issues with keys not being mapped the way they used to be. Hopefully that'll be something the community might be able to rectify.

The game is colourful and attractive in an indie pixel art sort of way. Its now largely mouse driven, and there are a few things where that mousing might seem a little tedious, but don't worry there are still key presses to help out. 

So where could it be improved? I think some accessibility work could be done. Just some simple things like tooltips on buttons. It also wouldn't hurt to do another iteration over selecting from lists and perhaps a bit more tutorial. Theres still a few things I'm yet to work out.

But other than that, I'm genuinely enjoying that. Oh and the main Sauron of my world just abandoned his goblin army because he's far too enammoured with wrestling and foot races with Dwarves. Nutty game.

I also realized that losing ISN'T fun.

The core gameplay is there, but the tutorial explains almost nothing. Information necessary to play is entirely hidden, and the interface is obtuse, and lacking features that have been standard for decades. You will have to read the wiki to figure out how to do things that should be simple, like building a roof.
Some features don't even work right. Want to search a workshop menu for something you know is in there? It might not show up. Want to build a couple lengths of wall out of pine logs? The logs will have moved to a different location in the list, and you'll have to find it again, every single time. To top it all off, the standard font hurts my eyes on my laptop monitor, and there's no way to scale it up, which was hard to figure out, since the menu has about 15 scaling options that do absolutely nothing in fullscreen.

People talk about how it's cool that two guys have been making this game, and only this game for 20 years, but I think they would have benefited a lot from some broader experience. Other games heavily based on this one have already resolved many of these problems. It's still a good game, but it needs a lot of work. I only recommended it if you have a high tolerance for jank.

If you're a new player, bear in mind that even with mouse support and a smart UI, the game is still probably one of the most complex you might ever play. In this regard, you'll have a lot of UI learning to do, and it will most likely be overwhelming. I personally believe that a good design justifies the absence of compromise. In this regard, I think you should play past your struggles and find the masterpiece behind.

If you're an old player, missing the full keyboard control will bother you. As of today there are no options allowing to play the classic game in this instalment, which, well, is a bit sad. Relearning how to access this or that menu, or do this or that action with the mouse is a bit tedious. It is also slower because a few clicks across the screen takes more time than just a few key presses across the keyboard. It is a small problem, but when you're used to that fast navigation you get with full keyboard, it feels like the time you get to do things without is just unnecessary. Aside from that, it's your good ol' Dwarf Fortress, without the many mods you might be used to play with, but instead with new features softening some of the rough edges of the experience.

1. For no reason I can think of, my (literal) hole-in-the-wall tavern begins to attract bards, many of which start to request citizenship. Us being a polite and neighborly fort, they're let in. 
2. This attracts even more bards, even more of which want citizenship. The population of the fortress is about 1/4 bards by autumn.
3. Since I can't think of anything to do with all the bards, they get drafted into the Gears of Softness squad (the name is ironic), currently our only military.
4. A kea and several macaques interrupt the woodcutters. It's war! 
5. The bards turn out to be effective and terrifying fighters, despite not being issued weapons. They charge halfway up the mountain to beat the kea to death, punching, scratching, and gouging it until it's no longer recognizable as a kea. Then they go back to fight the macaques to the death with their bare hands, gouging out eyes, shattering skulls, exploding lips, pulping tails, tearing sinews, and other family-friendly fun-time activities.
6. While engrossed in the battle, I forget to get camel leather for a herbalist who went into a Strange Mood, and he goes violently insane, charging into the tavern, and, presumably using some kind of kung fu, kicks a farmer in the spine, breaking it in one blow, then attacks a parrot woman and elf spearman who were visiting, beating them to death before the Gears of Softness show up and rip his head off with their bare hands.
7. Since I've become slightly afraid of the murderous horde of bards, they're reassigned to digging out a  tomb for the herbalist, parrot woman, and elf while I try to figure out how to treat a broken spine, because the mangled farmer crawling around the fort is beginning to unsettle the dwarfs.
Final rating: 12 out of 10 psychopathic bards.

The richness and detail of every aspect of every randomly generated world you play in is astonishing, a true marvel of software engineering. They truly feel like organic worlds with their own unique histories and politics and mythologies. The game can generate fantastic narratives out of the blue, and it becomes incredibly hard to pull yourself away from them.

The gameplay itself is hopelessly addicting, too. I remember when I first got the game I had already sunk something like 30 hours within 3 days of playing. Managing your forts, building them up from ramshackle camps into towns into a true Dwarf Fortress™, decorating your rooms, accommodating immigrants, fighting off ancient beasts from the depths, running an economy, it's classic civ sim gameplay, and by God is it fun. Even if you grow bored with a fort, you can just abandon it and start a new one. Maybe you make one next to a volcano, or on a glacier, or in the desert. The game has so much variety and content to offer, it's truly one of the most bang-for-your-buck games out there. The only reason I haven't given it a perfect score is because the adventure mode isn't out yet, but once that happens, you can be damn sure I'm coming back for more.

Dwarf Fortress is a true passion project and an unadulterated marvel of game design that's been in development for something like 20 years, and it shows. It's games like this that show the utmost potential of games and the indie game space, and it's games like this that need all the support and attention they can get. So play this game. Do it now.

Zones, workshops and common areas all seem like the same thing in different menu's. Also why isn't the stockpile a zone? Or the farm plot?

Not really sure what to do, there was an autumn trader but no clue what to trade for.

I think there is a lot of hidden game-play depth, that does not really capture you without a steep learning curve.

1.) You enjoy solving problems.

Reason: The game is unforgiving. There are no mechanics to help you in a time of need, what you see is what you get. If you made the mistake of embarking in a Haunted Biome, and now all of your fisherdwarves are now zombies because they just so happened to be fishing when the zombie fog rolled in, then it's up to you to deal with it.

In my own personal experience, I embarked at an Untamed Wilds on a Freezing temperature island. The first few months were normal and uneventful, however, once my dwarves started to get settled in, we were attacked near-constantly by pissed-off giant puffins and osprey who would constantly dive attack any dwarves unfortunate enough to be walking along the surface, and just generally giant animals like elephant seals and giant wolves, etc.

It got so bad, that my fledgeling fort of 22 was brought back down to 9 dwarves. I had to wall off the fort and keep my dwarves inside at all times, praying for a migrant wave, all the while making the best armor I could and training my army to expert levels. Six months later, when I had enough dwarves to brave the outdoors again, I made sure that at least 6 dwarves were patrolling the whole map at all times, fully kitted out in steel armor and weaponry. Two directly outside the fort, and two on the western and southern edges. I have a military squad of dwarves that have killed about 87 giant dingos, wolves, osprey, and puffins combined. The fort is now populated by 160 dwarves, and while a dwarven child happens to lose his entrails on account of a giant osprey every once in a while, the deaths are way less frequent than before.

2.) You enjoy reading and learning about things past simply playing the game.

Reason: A lot of mechanics in dwarf fortress aren't explained in deep detail, and you'll likely need to visit the wiki at https://dwarffortresswiki.org/ to get a better understanding of things. If you're the type of player to pore over a game even when you're not playing it actively, then Dwarf Fortress is a good fit for you. 

3.) You have a somewhat vivid imagination

Reason: Dwarf Fortress is mostly a simulator over a proper game, per se. It would be like comparing early Minecraft to Terraria. Most of what you'll be seeing are simple sprites, but the textual descriptions are very rich, and if you are able to use theater of the mind, that's all you really need.",1671232449,1703406516,True,0,0,0.507420837879180908,0,True,False,False

While it's impressive with what they have managed to do here, I personally feel like this game isn't really in a finished state, much like the Dwarf Fortress before it, it is still in a constant state of development. Because of that, there's bound to be issues.

While I am getting used to the new interface, it feels fairly clunky to me and there was several times I needed to look online to figure out how to do something. For example, in order to build bee hives, it's under work stations --> farming and then under that you'll find bee hives. But bee hives aren't work stations! I had to look up a youtube video just to figure this out. 

(Update 02/20/23: The GUI needs a lot of work in my personal opinion. Last night was the first time I even considered having guards and it took me forever to notice the little blue flag stand on the right hand bottom. Why is the GUI designed like that when the majority of the controls are in a different location? It doesn't flow well at all, I suggest the developers spend a couple days playing SimCity 4 and then redesign this game's GUI)

The shortcut commands you may be used to with the free version of Dwarf Fortress aren't implemented well, some of them work, some of them don't.

When zooming out the game lags like crazy.

Dwarfs will sit around idle doing nothing even though there are piles of jobs waiting to be done. 

(Update 02/20/23: I am convinced that there is some sort of bug with the game or something I am simply failing to understand. At some point, every game, no matter what, all my Dwarfs just stop doing anything at all. I am willing to admit that I may not be understanding something properly with what's going on with the game, but I sure wish there was some sort of way to insure Dwarfs follow job orders. Doesn't matter how I handle their labor or if I have them locked in or not, they just do feck-all.)

At the end of the day there's a lot of need for polish and quality of life updates. Like, why do I need to click + every time I want to add something while setting up my embankment? Why can't I just type the number in or hold the mouse key down?

This isn't a finished product by any means, even if they are charging as if it were.

While I am enjoying myself I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.

As I continue playing, I am enjoying myself less and less. I am considering going back to the free version, which is disappointing if I am being honest.

I assume they felt pressured by the community to finally release something after all this time and it just wasn't a ready product. I hope now that they are bringing in this income, they can dedicate more time to making this a worthwhile edition to play.

(Update 12/22/2023: So first things first, I was always under the impression that this version of Dwarf Fortress was just like a graphical update. It is not. Instead it is being developed independently from the free version, as it stands right now the free version is the best version, not only is there content that is unavailable on the STEAM release, it just runs better. Once my population hits around 50 or 60 the game suddenly takes a massive dip in speed and begins to lag horribly. Meanwhile I've had upwards of 200 Dwarfs in the free version and have had no problem still playing. If I am being honest this is the worst version out of the two and I have some serious doubts we will see it improve any time soon. 

For whatever reason this version is much harder to mod as well. With the free version you can just go right in and start editing files, changing what you want. Stone beds? Ok. Stone Bins? No problem. Starting with cave crocodiles at embark? Why not? But with the STEAM release they've made it significantly harder to do this.)

TLDR - The only ""Value"" added to the STEAM version is the tileset it comes with and even that isn't great. Development is now being split between both versions, which doesn't make any sense to me. If you are a old player of the series and want to support the developer, that's one thing, but as it is, this game is *not* ready for prime time.",1675612257,1703230784,False,8,0,0.510385751724243164,1,True,False,False

Soon your dwarves develop tools and walls and a military to stave off hungry crocodiles looking to eat kids and doggos and the problems start to scale. Some distant monarch wants to make someone a Baron. Distant travelers visit their home to steal citizen's art. Some folk want fancier rooms, and call for citizens to be beaten for breaking laws.

It's interesting how it prompts to mind the desires around things like personal property, fear of outsiders, a disdain for the dangers of nature. You can tell that the designers find something like the whims of a baron to be ridiculous.

For all the joy there is in following a dwarf's journey, it's in that wrapper of colonialism. As dwarves dig deeper, extracting wealth from the earth, they'll likely find a vast cavern filled with bountiful food, towering mushrooms, and those inhabiting the place. I'm at that stage with my latest fortress attempt, and recognize a family of troglodytes living down there. I suspect if my dwarves intrude in this space, there will be conflict with these people due to the way the developers programed them.

The question it's asking a player isn't particularly subtle. Are you going to go into this space even if you wind up having to kill off the inhabitants? Lets say you move past them, there's huge z axis, but odds are you'll just find a space filled with different less dwarf/human creatures. Do you need to go there? I think depending on how you are roleplaying this dwarf society, you might not. I really enjoy playing in these spaces, the virtuous and despotic, in grand strategy games like stellaris and crusader kings.

I think at certain point, playing as a decent dwarf community, as a player should retire, or leave content on the table. My current goal is for all of my dwarf inhabitants to have decent rooms, and enjoy enriching lives. I built a scriptorium, have guild halls, taverns and places of worship. I'm working on installing a small underground pond. I think I can get there without bothering to do raids and claiming caverns. I can figure out a cruel fortress in a different session, and I'm sure it could be fun in that abstract awful way.

I appreciate the space of possibilities, and that if this was a TTRPG roleplaying session I'd probably try and broker some co-existence, but I understand there are limits to digital design. The intent is the fun of having a threat in the mob of little minions who attack from under your home. It would be neat if there were updates that allowed you to attempt (and even fail) at a more interesting form of a peaceful solution - than just avoiding and ignoring them.",1703125613,1703125613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the type of game that will reward you more the more time you spend learning about it. Think colony-style Minecraft with a fully simulated world. Less intuitive, but much deeper. It's the kind of game you could easily spend a lifetime playing - or 10-20 minutes, if you can't be bothered learning how it works.

Right of the bat, here's what you should do; go to the Dwarf Fortress wiki and open up the quickstart guide. If you think spending a few hours/evenings calmly and methodically going through this little guide with a cup of tea or two while you play sounds like a cozy time, this game is definitely for you. If you sigh just seeing the index, it probably isn't. If your first feeling is ""this might be worthwhile"", keep reading because the same goes for this game.

The learning curve is quite steep, but it is very much a logarithmic curve. If you've ever played a Paradox game, this is nothing. But if you're new to games with a lot of gameplay systems given to you at once, you should know going in that this game can feel pretty overwhelming initially. Much like a Paradox game, it's not quite that the game throws everything in your face, it's rather that it doesn't. You're provided with an overview of a ton of different options to choose from, but you'll still find yourself thinking ""what should I do now?"". The answer in Dwarf Fortress usually is ""anything you want"", but when you don't know what ""anything"" entails in terms of game mechanics yet, that doesn't help you.

You don't need a manual to play the game, but I personally found that you pretty much need one to get started. So if you already know from taking one look at that quickstart wiki page that you will not be going through it, I'll be honest; you may want to search for your gem elsewhere. You don't need another game wasting space in your steam library, and while you'll see that the reviews for this game are stellar, this probably isn't the ""must-play"" game for everyone the way a game like Minecraft is. Dwarf Fortress is a 10/10 for the player looking for a unique but at the same time specific kind of experience. A sandbox that responds to every single one of your actions with opinions and/or consequences. (Yes, every single one. You can read more about this elsewhere).

It's not a coincidence that the community motto is ""losing is fun"". You can't win, as there is no win condition. The gameplay loop is essentially trying out a random idea and seeing how it plays out. The prize you get for playing is the stories and experiences you will encounter along the way. That may sound boring to you, and it may sound boring to a lot of people. And maybe it will be, to you. But you'll read plenty of those interesting little stories just here among the reviews, and if you find any of them interesting, this may be a game for you. Games don't consistently stay at 95%+ positive on steam without reason after all. So if you're on the fence, I'd say it's worth a try.",1672231730,1703034900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With a flourishing food supply, abundant water sources, and a formidable cadre of trained guards, I took pride in the fact that my fortress had remained untarnished by the grim specter of casualties. Little did I know that fate would soon put my defenses to the ultimate test.

A sudden alert flashed across my screen, disrupting the tranquility of my well-fortified haven – ""Thief: Child Stealer."" The very essence of my security was about to be challenged. With unwavering resolve, the dwarves rallied, ready to confront the impending threat. The malevolent figure, a goblin child-stealing thief accompanied by two sinister goblin lackeys, advanced menacingly toward the fortress gates.

In a heartbeat, I sounded the alarm, summoning all dwarves behind the safety of the gate and swiftly raising the drawbridge. A handful of dwarves, including the gate guards, found themselves stranded outside, entrusted with the crucial oversight of the marksdwarves stationed in the gate towers. The well-being of the children took precedence above all else. The militia of Kolsherik, resolute and determined, swiftly dispatched the three goblin thieves. As the drawbridge descended to welcome the remaining dwarves back within the fortress walls, a collective sigh of relief echoed through the air.

Days passed, and the dwarves began to notice a conspicuous absence – a one-year-old infant named Aban Stigazezum. She had vanished without a trace during the chaotic events of the goblin attack. Despite meticulous inspections of the defenses, the mystery surrounding Aban's disappearance remained unsolved. I was certain there were only three thieves, and I had witnessed their demise. I knew where their lifeless bodies rested.

Half a year later, the fortress and its inhabitants had moved forward, albeit with an unsettling undercurrent. One night, as I surveyed the guard towers, a strange sight caught my attention – an ethereal, naked green dwarf standing among the regular guards. Hovering over this otherworldly apparition, I discovered it to be none other than Aban, returned as a ghost with a silent determination to exact retribution on those who had allowed her abduction.

Aban's ghostly presence glided up and down the guard towers, traversing between floors and through walls, occasionally haunting the guards stationed at the front gate. Perhaps she held them responsible for the lapse in security that led to her tragic fate.

After enduring several months of disconcerting hauntings, I finally found the time to construct a tomb. Although I lacked a physical body for a proper burial, I fashioned a memorial slab, personally etched to commemorate Aban's spirit. It was an offering to lay her to rest and bring solace to my guards, who had internalized the lesson from that fateful day. They vowed never to let another thief breach the fortress's defenses.

As the engraved slab found its place, Aban's ghost seemed appeased, finally finding peace. I read the inscription aloud, the words etched in stone bearing witness to the tragedy – ""In memory of Aban Stizgazezum / Born 102 / Crushed by a drawbridge in the year 102.""

And so, with a poignant acknowledgment of her fate, Aban was laid to rest, her spirit finding tranquility. The fortress had weathered a storm of both corporeal and spectral challenges, leaving an indelible mark on its history. The lesson learned was etched not only in stone but in the hearts of the dwarves who vowed to guard their sanctuary with an unwavering vigilance. The saga of Aban Stigazezum had become an integral part of the fortress's lore, a tale of resilience, loss, and the enduring spirit that lingered beyond the veil of mortality. 10/10.",1702730453,1702813001,True,149,57,0.91624826192855835,0,True,False,False

However, it's important to address the elephant in the room: the UI/UX. While the core gameplay is captivating, the user interface and experience are, frankly, in dire need of improvement.

Game is very intricate and detailed, but it is very finicky and there are a lot of bugs that can make it very annoying as it feels like you have to hold its hand to do specific things. For example, if you have cut gems and put them into a bin that is also in a stockpile, when you try to trade they will not show up in the trader screen. You have to create a dump pile, dump all the gems in that pile, then unrestrict the pile and move them before your dwarves try to put them back in that same bin (because there is no button to simply remove items from a container).

I have played a lot of the other colony sims out there, but while DF may have inspired them and you can feel its DNA flowing through them, DF is still the best. The other games have prettier graphics, and if you want a more traditional game, they are probably more satisfying as they are designed to throw regular curve balls at you.

Dwarf Fortress excels in simulation of a living breathing world that generates interesting stories and just feels so much deeper than any other colony sims out there.

It takes a while to get used to the main needs of setting up your colony, and there will be googling involved, but the more you learn, the more you can't help be impressed with the depth of the game and you are fascinated to learn more and to watch your fortress grow and hopefully thrive.

This is a genuine passion project for the developers that has been worked on for 20 years, and will be worked on for the foreseeable future.

I watched a few tutorials here and there and that's all I really needed. Figuring out all the UI and how systems coincide is the major thing. Most things are done automatically if given the basic infrastructure and from there it is optional but recommended to multitask and refine your fortress.

Food, Booze, and Shelter is all that is really required for survival and most of everything else can be taken at your own pace. you can change the game speed and customize almost every part of the experience from the embark screen and game settings to what type of wood you want a bucket made from.

[Tales of legend]
Many forts and something happened which I could have never prepared myself for. I've had really chill taverns up to this point, I just let everyone in never had anything besides the occasional bar brawl. A master fighter dwarf monster slayer came in one day while a human was trying to steal a prized possession.As soon as I take care of the thief, this monster slayer goes berserk on my entire fort. I can only speculate what caused this, were they in cahoots? did he just get too drunk and carried away in a brawl? Either way, this guy killed 3 trained military squads with copper armor, countless wardogs, a heard of yews, and the remaining hundred or so dwarves. I was only year 4 and had over 100k value in my fort, halls of marble and gold doors, multiple priceless artifacts, and there was no way a goblin army or dragon was getting into my lava moat. None of it mattered, 1 bloodthirsty dwarf hell bent on plundering my treasure reduced my civil society into meat and pulp. 10/10 losing can be fun.

Chaos out of simplicity. Regardless of how skilled you are or where you make your fortress it is randomness born from rigid simplicity first and foremost. Dwarves can get clumsy or unlucky sometimes or a werebeast can slaughter everyone. A fresh migrant with certain talents and stone cold vigor could even stumble from the woodwork and defeat the danger like it was a normal tuesday. You just never know what will save or doom you and the adventures along the way are special.",1685832442,1702231493,True,1,0,0.511111080646514893,0,True,False,False

I was merrily settting the training schedule for my newest marksdwarf squad when I got the notification that some goblin childrensnatchers had shown up at my fort. Now you have to know that our civilizations were at peace at this time. So I /could/ just close the doors, wait for them to get bored and piss off or I could go for some ""live"" target practice.
I let loose my squad of rookie marksdwarves, who proceeded to turn the poor gobbo's into a pincushion. Well, briefly anyway. Because after releasing a volley of bolts that turned the first goblin into something resembling a very red swiss cheese and put the second goblin on the floor, they decided that shooting wasn't very fun. So they mobbed the survivor by kicking and punching him into a bloody pulp.
A month later the first of the goblin raids showed up. Signaling we are now, indeed, at war. Though I did not mind as they very kindly started walking into my cage traps. They are now the newest target for my ballista operators in training.

I'll probably update this review later, but I wanted to write it now to bring up a relevant topic: The Steam Awards! I feel like Valve should add a feature for devs to put a ""Game Release Date"" in addition to the ""Steam Release Date"" that they have, so that when games are brought over from elsewhere you know when it actually released. The reason this is relevant to [i]Dwarf Fortress[/i] and The Steam Awards is because, due to the game being [u]brought to Steam[/u] this year, it can be nominated for most of the awards, despite not even releasing this year! What's much worse, however, is that it [b]CAN'T[/b] be nominated for the award it would actually make sense to nominate it for, Labor of Love, even though Dwarf Fortress has been around for 17 years! This has led to a situation where players were asked to nominate it for Labor Of Love  [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3880475983251700376?l=english], but can't actually do that! Of course, you could try to argue that, considering the addition to the game compared to the free version, the vote pertains only to the [i]Steam version[/i] of [i]Dwarf Fortress[/i]. However, that statement wouldn't apply to many other games that get ported to Steam, so allowing developers to set the true release date of their game would still be a beneficial feature to have (and also eliminate the possibility of something like a retro game getting Game Of The Year long after its been released!... though I gotta admit, I do think that's pretty funny and It'd be neat to see that happen at least once before Valve decides to fix things.)",1701977494,1701977494,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It feeds on our deeply human need for structure, and the dopamine rush we get when we set up our structures effectively, exactly to our liking. This is about the need to optimize, and our frequent failure to do so in our day to day lives. In this game, you have the power to make one tiny change and see it almost instantly propagate out and feel its effect. There’s no end to how interesting that is to watch, especially when there’s so much nuance - so many layers. 

Just by setting up a few work order automations for clothing, I can watch everything turn over. I see the clothing changing on the dwarves. I stop seeing them complain about wearing tattered clothing. Happiness goes up all around. 

Dwarf Fortress just sucks you into all those details. Now that everyone’s getting new clothes without any more effort from me, why would I just make them normal clothes? There’s a new layer to uncover, and we start making dyes and embellishments. And this rabbit hole we just went down is only one out of hundreds. 

Structure. Ask any teacher; our human brains desperately need it. This is a game that richly rewards you for experimenting with the building of many intricate structures.

1. Badly optimised. Your lategame forts will play like crap. Don't hope for huge populations.

2. Terrible lack of QoL features. You want to mine a large area made of damp stone? Be ready to painstakingly assign the order over and over and over because your dwarves don't like mining damp stone. This is only one example - you will find several dozens like this.

3. The UI/UX is stupid. e.g. if you open a window with a text input but forget to click on the textfield and start typing ,you will trigger keyboard shortcuts that open/close other menus. Again, just one example of a dozen. This is especially troubling considering that this Steam version was made specifically to provide better UI/UX.

4. Settings don't make sense by default. Dwarves will not dump rotting items by default. Why?

5.

My original problem was not being able to see units very well on a large TV screen since I could resize the menu easily enough and utilize magnification to enlarge it 4 fold, but with my proper resolution selected (3840 x 2160) I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to better see my units up close even when fully zoomed in. But by selecting a lesser resolution, I was able to get a closer view and this rectify my visual issues. My apologies to the 2 devs for my initial negative review. I am leaving it down below as a placard eternally displaying my ignorance of what was a relatively simple fix. It's not like dropping the resolution is costing me graphically with a 2D tileset lol.

Thumbs up, guys. I got a loooong way to go to get better at this generative masterpiece. That said, highly recommended!

BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW TO BE DISPLAYED UPON MY STEAM ACCOUNT'S PILLORY. PLEASE DISREGARD!

""As someone with a very large screen,  I cannot get past the fact that  I do not have the ability to zoom in closely at all. With max scaling and settings adjusted to my monitor's width/height, and with the + button hit as many times as possible to the point that it's grayed out, and despite utilizing the advice of multiple sites, I still cannot get a closeup of a dwarf. They all look like little bugs on my screen. Even when viewing a dwarf's profile, their profile pic is the same size as their unit on screen. I'm not looking to zoom in on 1 tile, but at least a small cluster of tiles would be wonderful when I feel like getting up close and personal with my units or perhaps surveying a room that I crafted or witnessing a closeup of the unholy beast that some carefree dwarf on autopilot released from its cave prison before it knocks my fort's dongle into its USB port. 

Armok may very well be aloof and distant most of the time, but I don't want to be looking down from my domain above saying ""What is this? A fortress for ants?!"" In my opinion, this makes the game so distant from my POV that it's unplayable. Yes, I [i] could [/i] play it. Yes, it's better than staring at ASCII art. And yes, the interface is very visible and actually tweakable to where it's perfectly fine with 3840 x 2160. But as for the visuals of the game itself, this isn't gonna work. I gotta give this a hard pass. This is a ridiculous visual impairment for $30 spent. And I won't play it until it's fixed.

Let me just say in the game's defense that its mechanics and dynamic narrative set it apart from the pack. Watching someone who is very knowledgeable of the game engage with it proves that it is one of the richest experiences you could have with a game of this genre. In fact, this may very well just be its own genre because it's so unique. Seeing the eyes of a DF influencer light up because something entirely new and never experienced by that person happened again for the umpteenth time is contagious. But honestly, I have a better view of the action when watching THEM play than when I play.

I know the brothers are still working on it. I know it's their life's work and they ain't gonna stop until they're in the ground. But if it were possible, show a little love to those of us who wanna play on the big screen. Give us some kind of option to go beyond the defaults.""

Caravans were space and I situated myself in between 3 necromancer towers in a terrifying forest. I made a clever retractable bridge trap with pressure traps over a deep chasm (11 Z deep). Some of the zombies and necromancers died from the falls, but most were stuck there. Fun fact, the zombies were aggressive to one another due to belonging to different towers, thus taking care of each other in the progress. In the mean time I have dug deep to the first layer of caverns, and waited for my first Forgotten Beast, so I could send it in the pit and have some fun with the zombies down there.

Color me surprised when Iminu Forgotten Beast has appeared and came up to the surface through a side tunnel I dug specially for this situation. I prepared my army to lure it and theeeen.. nothing happened. I was bewildered, but as I drew in closer and read the Beasts's personality, my jaw dropped: 

""Iminu - It has a great musical sense, a very good sense of position of its own body and a sum pf patience, but it has a large dificit of willpower and really poor focus. It dislikes receiving advice, preferring to keep its own counsel. It is often sad and dejected. It doesn't handle stress well. It finds helping others emotionally rewarding. It doesn't cling tightly to ideas and is open to changing its mind. It doesn't often feel lustful"".

This was my first encounter with a peaceful Forgotten Beast that was 400+ years. I decided to leave it be outside and share the same space. It never tried to enter my base and just hand around the river on a far corner of the map. This game can really surprise you with some twists and turns! 11/10, best immersive experience of any game I ever plaid with robust and believable creature personalities.

Old Review: This is one heck of an amazing game that I am learning as I go. The moment you think you have things under control, you discover there is a new depth of complex mechanism that expand your gameplay. Here you have to play smart and innovate your production strategy. Combat is fun, but easily avoidable, at least so far, I haven't managed to go on a full scale war yet, so I do not know what will happen later.

There are some drawbacks to this game though. Being so complex and worked for so many years, there are inevitable bugs, which are being fixed in reasonable time. But one thing to be fully aware is that the UI is far from perfect and it is easy to get lost into how many way you can build or deconstruct various things and it takes time to get used to it. Second of all, the tutorials describe things very loosely, hence why I recommend watching youtube tutorials that go more in depth. Third of all, there are hidden/invisible mechanics (which I personally love) that you have to research via the Wiki in order to find how to utilize.

Sometimes the way your dorfs act will not make sense, but in reality it's because we don't fully understand the mechanics and their logic. I will give you guys one simple example: Refuse, Trash Stockpiles and Trash Area. This was very confusing for me because they all sound so similar but they really work in very different ways, and even be able to combine them in useful ways. I almost lost a fort because my dorfs didn't dispose of the bodies and everyone was going insane from all the rot that was floating in the air. Hint: You need all 3 of them and extra Hint: Get a Pit Disposal as well for live intruders. There is just so much to cover in this game and even with my 100+ hours i still feel I am in tutorial mode by trying to understand how this game works!

I highly recommend this game, because for me personally I feel it has a hint of the Black And White games in it, which i loved a lot!",1674524336,1701398254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Conceptually, the game is simple. You build a fortress for dwarfs. Each dwarf has their own needs that you have to fulfill to make them happy. This is pretty much just building rooms, putting furniture in rooms, and feeding them. You then prepare a military and defenses for any inevitable invasions and watch as your fortress grows. 

Actually playing the game, it's quite complex. There is a major optimization aspect to the game.  Do you use your iron to give your dwarfs better rooms or to build gear for your militia? Do you train more militia members or do you use them for farming? Where should you put your tomb? Your tavern? Your temples? You are going to get invaded, how do you prepare your traps? How many militia dwarfs are enough? 

At the same time, the game can be super relaxing. You play a true overlord role. You order commands and watch them be carried out. It's immensely satisfying to see your dwarfs construct a grand hall that you've just designed. Sitting back and watching your fortress work is breathtaking. The intricacies breath life into the world and create a truly immersive experience.

**Edited after a couple hours of playing: 

This version is the best iteration of DF. 
For anyone on the fence, its worth the 30$. But maybe just watch some other people first to get a good feel for the game. Kruggsmash is a great intro / storyteller for DF.

The game is still very much DF we all love, where my soldiers defend against the goblin horde with their month old babies in their hands. They still go fucking wild over something as mundane as mist, and they routinely lose it when they cant get any silk for their intricately decorated wooden earring. 
What sets this above .47 or .40 is the the QoL upgrades. 
Before if you wanted to make a bedroom for your dwarves (my current fort has 200 so imagine this process 200 times), you'd have to go into 'zones' select bedroom, arrow key to the top corner of the room, enter, key over to the bottom, enter. If you didnt do this, you would have dwarves sleep on the floor or in dorms. They hate dorms.  
Now, you just click ""Multi"" under the bedroom selection, then drag over an entire area with properly set up bedrooms (bed/door) and it will automatically set up all those rooms individually.

***Editing now after playing for nearly a year:

With the addition of DFhack being available via steamworkshop, I don't think you will find a better time for a more accessible Dwarf Fortress. Easily the golden age for this game. 

DFhack will fix some of the later game issues that only godly PCs can handle (FPS death, autobutchering, discarded owned food bug, and underground breeding caverns that rock performance)",1670372856,1701194113,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is THE building sim game.  Extremely in-depth, down to individual eyeball temperatures.  Which might actually be relevant - just don't think too much about it.

You've probably heard of this game and maybe already played it.  The Steam version has been streamlined and still may feel a bit archaic but is many MANY times more ""playable"" than the standalone.  Downside: With greater simplicity becomes less ability to ""easily"" fine-tune.  Example being setting roles for your Dwarves.  Rather than assigning them roles, they instead do everything by default and you must go in and say ""Only allow checked Dwarves to do tasks"" however it DOES handily sort the list, with the most skilled Dwarves up top.

The original is still available for free if you want to give that a try before you buy.  The Steam version GRAPHICS and UI look pretty good and while I miss the OG guitar soundtrack, the new soundtrack isn't bad at all.  Not much of a nitpick, since you can just mute the volume and listen to whatever you want, be it the original on loop for nostalgia or even an audiobook.  It's a good game for that:

To describe what the game feels like to play, imagine you're playing sim city but the citizens are actually simulated. This is more akin to creating your own ant farm than it is a colony sim. Imagine Dungeon Keeper on a much larger scale

You at no point directly control your little dudes, but build it and they will come. Build a craftshop and line up some orders and they will craft. Give mining orders and they will mine. Build a tavern and they will drink until they punch each others teeth out. Hope you have a hospital, or at least a coffin ready for the pour guy who hit the floor.

You don't even need an imagination to make this game work because the pixel art is great and literally everything that happens will be in writing somewhere in the game.

Annoying for returning players, perhaps, but a non-issue for new ones. Besides, it's not like any of my complaints can't get fixed later. My biggest gripe is (as of writing) not having dfhack.

[i]Dwarf Fortress[/i] is a simulation game that puts you in charge of a dwarven colonial expedition. You’ll not only need to feed and shelter your dwarves, but also build a sustainable economy and strong defenses to protect against invaders.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
While there are many games that draw inspiration from [i]DF[/i], none bring the same level of complexity, for better and for worse. Things that most games would gloss over or simplify, like temperature or water physics, are handled in a more realistic way. All of these small details are relatively unimportant on their own, but the interaction between them is what leads to so many unique moments. For example, cats cleaning their fur and drinks being spilled are two mechanics that most sim games wouldn’t include because they are mundane and don’t add much. Yet in [i]DF[/i], these both happen, which can lead to a cat dying of alcohol poisoning if they spend too much time in a crowded tavern. It’s not a game-changing system, but it creates interesting events and stories, which is what [i]DF[/i] is all about.

Managing your colony is the core gameplay loop and what you will spend the majority of your time doing. You designate areas to mine, buildings to construct, and items to produce. Your primary concern is survival. It’s not particularly difficult to subsist, but thriving is your true goal and where most of your fun will come from. You could simply dig underground and wall your colony off from the outside world, surviving off underground farming for eternity, but that’s boring. Instead, you might try to tame a wild jaguar and domesticate the species for use as war cats. Or maybe you’d like to set up a gladiator arena where you pit captured enemies against your strongest soldiers. You can even become a hub of culture with a huge library and tavern, attracting visitors from far and wide. The possibilities are nearly endless, making it an amazingly varied and replayable game.

[h2]Presentation[/h2]
This is the dark side of [i]DF[/i]. It’s unrefined, clunky, and will inevitably suffer from performance issues. The steam release fixed many of the UI and usability issues, but it still needs a lot of work to be on par with the industry standard.

Visually, the steam release looks decent. Compared to the old graphics, it’s an insane upgrade, but it can’t compete with more modern titles. The sprites look amazing on their own, but as a whole, the game still suffers from issues with readability. That being said, the new graphics have an excellent art style and add a lot of life to an otherwise text-based game.

Instead of a persistent soundtrack, [i]DF[/i] alternates between ambient sound effects that give a nice atmosphere, and traditional music tracks. It's a bit of an odd choice, but it's certainly better than the silence the free version has.

The most disappointing problem is performance. Eventually, your fortress will become so big that the game can’t handle all the different systems running at once. This results in persistent FPS drops that slowly make the game unplayable. Thankfully, the ride up until that point is magnificent and there are certain techniques that can help mitigate the problem (like keeping a low colony population).

[h2]Future Content[/h2]
Typically, I don’t factor future content into my reviews because I’m focusing on the product you are buying today, not on what it could eventually become. This is a rare exception because it has been receiving constant updates for over a decade and shows no signs of stopping. Steam Workshop support has been added, enabling the already strong modding community to grow even more.

As for official content, the developers themselves consider the game roughly half-finished in terms of planned features and mechanics. No one knows what it will be like ten years from now, but it’s clear that it will certainly be improved from its current state.

[h2]Verdict[/h2]
It’s difficult to review a game that has been in development for twenty years without inadvertently glossing over some major aspects of it. It’s best described as a colony simulator, but that doesn’t do justice to the sheer number of elements that can come into play during the game. At times, it’s an absurdly complicated game, but that’s all part of the fun. It won’t click for everyone, but I would still recommend this game to anyone who enjoys colony sims. You are almost guaranteed to lose your first ten colonies in embarrassing fashion, and it’ll be a blast.

Dwar Fortress не нуждается в представлении - игра воистину с безграничными возможностями, настоящий Майнкрафт от мира стратегий, сложная, забагованная, непонятная, но в то же время невероятно увлекательная, атмосферная, продуманная.

Раньше приходилось сражаться с тысячей сборок, графических модов, десятком сайтов с информацией, непривычным и совершенно не интуитивным управлением. Сейчас же остался только поиск информации - игра по-прежнему отказывается говорить, как в себя играть, однако выглядит и звучит просто волшебно, а управление приблизилось к современным стандартам (пусть и далеко не вплотную).

В итоге даже ветераны старых Фортов откроет для себя игру заново.

The first time I opened this, I was immediately overwhelmed by the UI. I couldn't figure out even half of what I was doing. Everything was going ""fine"" and then I start wondering why everything is suddenly going completely wrong. I didn't even know automation was a thing until much later.

After 3-4 fortresses delving into utter chaos, I started looking at videos, then the wiki. Things were going better, but nowhere near what you could call ""well"".

Cool, now my dwarves aren't utterly livid, let's keep going and see what happens. Surely nothing could go wrong now...

WRONG!

now I'm getting completely devastated by random bouts of chaos, lack of combat trained dwarves in tow. Sure, I tried military, but I didn't know what I was doing and didn't set things up even relatively properly. Squads weren't using available gear, they weren't training, and they were still roaming about dwarfing around. Surely this is supposed to happen, right? No. Chaos ensues.

Much video and wiki research later, I figure out I'm doing things completely wrong. Now things are going better yet, but still very rough.

I'd say, maybe 10 fortresses later, after even more research into things and more bouts of chaos, I finally started getting the hang of things. At this point most things are running smoothly, most threats are being neutralized. 

Dwarves will be dwarves. If you don't cover all your bases, you're in for a very bumpy ride.

Now dwarves are still funneling themselves into the heat of combat to pick up dropped items... Population dropping quickly, devastation in the works. Don't mess with the savage wildlife unless prepared, things can go south immediately LOL. I sent one squad of dwarves to deal with this annoying source of endless alerts, and dealt with it. Immediately after, the fortress is attacked by giant insects.
Now for the fun part: This was in a ""terrifying"" biome, which makes for huge loads of fun. You think you've dealt with your problems? Nah, they'll come back for more. Tombs set up? Of course, why wouldn't I... (aftermath omitted for discovering your own ""fun"")

So, that fortress got destroyed by angry insects, the fun experience of a ""terrifying"" biome explored after this absolute bloodbath, learn from some more mistakes, optimize automation, and again, further improve longevity.

Now, I can easily prepare a fortress for at least moderate longevity, let's try an island.
Isolation makes dwarves happy, can confirm, never got destroyed after about a decade and I got bored and went to another fortress due to lack of chaos. Migrants were swimming across this massive body of water just to live in my fortress.

After enough experience, I can now easily prepare a fortress for longevity in nearly every biome I've decided on. I have yet to try a hot/scorching/cold/freezing area, and I still want to try a glacier at some point. 

Now I have dwarves killing werebeasts while they're strangling my geese, and most of the time they seem to be sharing their booze with the animals in my pasture.",1698919047,1701085982,True,7,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

You play as a group of settler Dwarfs out to do whatever it is YOU think Dwarfs do.

Forget to create a tomb for your Dwarfs and have the dead and their corpses pile up until everyone in the fort is dead, enraged or sick. The lack of direction initially might daunt someone new to this type of game, but simply 'playing' gives enough story to you if you pay a little attention and learn what you like and how you like to do it. The emergent storytelling is some of the best I've had the fun of playing, very funny moments, always surprising.

 This game is arcane to begin with, but persevere and you will learn. When you get stuck, go explore what the online community can offer or help you solve. First fortress flooded, second raided because you didn't set up any military, all part of the fun.

The mechanics of the game allow you to really push your creativity. From designing fort layouts to creating strange systems and machines. The steam version art style is very charming, and the game simulates so much more than you might think initially.

This is a storied and legendary game, made by two brothers through pure passion for, i believe decades now.
The depth of this game is incredible, the worlds oyu can make? immense.
Every dwarf is simulated, has wants, need, family and so on. they age, and history goes on. the wordl, the entire world, also has history. empires rise and fall, artifacts arent just generated, they are created, by someone, through the history generation of the world.
For those who want to try it without paying, the game has always been free, and is free online. it is just the steam version that is possible to buy.
Wich frankly, is great, because if there ever was a dev who absolutely deserved to get paid for their game, its these guys.
Dwarf Fortress is by now, ancient in internet time, and it has likely inspired some of, if not THE biggest games existing out there.

im terrible at his game, but i love it, its scope, its simulation of an entire world, all that jazz.

Depending on how long you generate worlds, you could have evil humans or even dwarves. A demon lord could take over a dwarven civilization and you could have dwarves come to raid YOUR dwarves. 
There's quite a few biomes you can settle on with different features that completely changes how you have to survive. Choose a lush forest with tons of trees and food and constant rain. You could choose a scorching barren sand desert that has zombies. You could choose a frozen tundra with constant snow storms and giant twisted versions of animals and yetis.
Not to mention that stories that can be made in your fortress from the different scenarios that take place. A goblin siege could take place, half of your military wiped out, parents and children will grieve the loses of the fallen soldiers and aspects of their personality can change based on how they handle it. Maybe they'll become depressed constantly, canceling jobs and being a nuisance. Or they'll become more hardy and brave, able to replace to soldiers as even stronger ones.

I'm at max default pop, the happiness is generally alright and I have as much food and drink I need. I think I can put this on my CV at this point.

Anyway, here's one of my favorite recent stories.

A bronze colossus attacked my fortress. I had no idea how to kill him so I started building an elaborate drawbridge trap to drop him into an inescapable pit as my fortress was locked down, however, I didn't notice I locked out my legendary miner dwarf (one of my first 7 dwarfs). As I was constructing the traps, the miner, of course, wanted to get back home so the colossus struck him down, he was unconscious, had almost every bone broken, an arm and leg missing and the neck torn open. I already said goodbye to him. However, I noticed that the colossus had a chink or two on his health page so I figured the miner with a pickaxe managed to do damage (considering the visiting sword wielding humans made no damage). Deciding to abandon the elaborate trap, I released an army of miners which managed to strike down the colossus and turned him into a statue.

I put up the statue in the middle of the temple as a reminder of our victory, and that legendary hero, the miner dwarf... survived his injuries!

He's now a retired hero committed to drink and eat for the rest of his life, and I will be there to make it happen for him.

10/10, the best story generator ever made.

We really need to invest in Tarn Adams cryoengine so we can see this game completed around 2123.

I haven't stuck through a fortress for enough time to see it through from start to finish, and I do hope to achieve that one day, but I can definitely recognise the game for what it is.

Dwarf Fortress is a game that is like no other that I've played; As you do not have full control over your dwarves it has a unique way of telling stories through little intricate actions that each of your dwarves take and you can decide whether to look at this story telling at a macro level, a micro level if you really want those little details, or not at all and still get some enjoyment out of it. But I'd say to get the most out of the game you definitely want to involve yourself in the world building that is happening in every moment of gameplay. Combining this story telling with the nice sprite art and very fitting little soundtrack, it's certainly a cozy experience to come back to every once in a while.

Yes, you might have to spend some time researching things on the wiki, but compared to the classic version .47 of the game, back when it was all ASCII, learning to play Dwarf Fortress has never been easier. The truth is, the steep learning curve of Dwarf Fortress does not come from its game mechanics, but rather circumventing the numerous bugs that you encounter over the course of a single fortress.

As a game, Dwarf Fortress fails in many aspects. Balance is not a concept the developers care about. You can make pastries worth more than the GDP of the world in a week. There are bugs that can prevent you from using certain game features or even playing the game at all. Dwarves use crossbows for hammering instead of shooting whether or not they have ammo. Sometimes a massive siege of cave critters will spawn despite having them turned off in the settings, causing your FPS to drop to <10. This is why it’s important to forget about Dwarf Fortress as a game, and to think of it as a story generator instead.

Dwarf Fortress is all about stories. Amazing things can happen with or without the player’s intervention, and the results are never the same. This is because Dwarf Fortress generates a physical world [i] [b] and [/b] [/i] the history of its people. That NPC in your fortress, she has a family. Her mother was born in the capital and fell in love with a man who became a noble, but divorced her and married six other women later on. The tailless dragon that just game-ended you has been around since the beginning of time and nobody’s managed to kill him yet, but there is a legend about a hero who fought with her and fled, with her tail as his prize.

Even if Dwarf Fortress can be a pain in the ass to actually play sometimes, there is so much intrigue in how the generated history will interact with your playthrough that it’s often worth the trouble. You can also download 3rd-party software like DFHack from Steam which will help circumvent most of the bugs in the current version and provide various QoL changes. However, with or without extra tools, I’d recommend Dwarf Fortress. It’s the most innovative sandbox game ever developed, and there’s more content to come.

Oh my God. Buy it. I started playing way back in 2014 with the original. I struggled then found a book ""Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress: Learn to Play the Most Complex Video Game Ever Made"" that did a step by step guide. Following that book I learnt the basics, then I moved to watching videos but would still reference the book. I used the tile sets so I didn't have to play in ASCII mode. Once I got the hang of it, it was amazing.

Played it on and off, one time I even played in ASCII mode (once you know how to play, ASCII mode isn't too bad). Eventually I shelved it because it would lag when the fortress got massive. I hadn't played it for years then heard about the Steam version. Although very pleased I didn't follow it as thought it would take years. During that time I discovered they'd released the 64bit version right near the time I stopped playing which would of solved my frame rate issues.

Anyway. As the release of the Steam version came close I started watching more. Tarn explains everything so well & knows so much. Having done a tiny bit of programming and I mean very tiny, its amazing the knowledge he and his brother have.

Anyway, not only is it great so far, it is worth buying the game to support Tarn and his brother. Considering the text based version has been free for years, despite that, they've never given up and continued to update it all along. I donated when I first got the original, I may have even donated twice if I remember right. For me to do that, it has to be worth it as I'm very tight with the money.

Dwarf Fortress is a classic and a one of a kind experience.  Other games have tried to emulate and capture the magic, but nothing beats the original.  It's a game that's difficult to learn, even harder to master, and you're going to love every moment of it.

The classic version is still available for free, as of writing this.  You don't get mouse control or the fancy interface, as far as I know, but you do get to experience Dwarf Fortress in its original form before you pick up this one.

Once Adventure mode is finally implemented into this version, it will become one of those 'forever' games.  There's so much to do and experience that you could theoretically play it forever.

I  did my research and knew I should wait, but I had watched a play-through and could not hold off trying it.  I’m having fun, but on the second day of playing this game I started getting hit by the many things people warn of.  Game slowing down as your fortress grows, clunky UI with some options buried deep and others just not explained anywhere.  Ranged units not really working as they should.  Enough issues to ruin your experience as soon as you’ve learnt enough to enjoy it.

I’ve never played DF and after watching a how to play I found the learning curve (while notable) was not as bad as advertised but it was made more frustrating in that the steam/premium version is rather new and there isn’t enough info out yet for workarounds badly needed… probably because some of the things are just broken.

I would say this game plays like a un-optimised early access title EXCEPT that it has more content than they usually do.  There is something quite refreshing in the way indie devs sometimes fight to keep certain content in their games where bigger companies just cut features out of the game when they don’t want to spend the money/time to fix or develop them.  I didn’t feel bad to give my money to the passion project of two guys who’s made such an impact on this genre.  I really hope they can use the funds they make with this premium edition wisely and polish this game so the finish matches the foundation.  Their old school fan base has ensured them a overwhelmingly positive review rating and a bunch of sales that the game in its current state does not deserve.  They deserve the reviews and the money but the game doesn’t… not yet…. Hopefully soon.

For English III, I was doing a paper on why I thought Video Games was art- and I came across a John Egbert article on why he, a film critic, did not think Video Games were art. The article ended something like: ""And no, Dwarf Fortress is not art.""

This lead me down a rabbit hole of blood and greed- of insane dwarves and mushroom wine. I downloaded this game on every school computer I could- because while they did have blockers for video games, they did not have blockers for this. I also stole a flashdrive from a teacher and proceeded to keep my fort exclusively on that flashdrive. I went from computer to computer, plugging this baby in and continuing my fortress. It was great. The game was very hard to see and comprehended, but I still loved it nonetheless. Goblins, Liches, Megabeasts- all represented with simple ASCII. I was, and still am, a purist. I only alter the Color Codes you see, no texture packs for me.

This game now? Still very good. Easier, unfortunately, and I miss the old UI. Sure, Toady definitely had to update the UI- but what he and all the newfrogs fail to realize the byzantine insane UI gave it CHARM. It gave it ROBUSTNESS. Navigating the menus via muscle memory made you feel proud of your skill, made you feel like you had a huge cock for being so good at menu navigation. Newfrogs will never understand this.


But this is the only drawback. The game has gotten too easy- too easy to read. Dwarves don't break down as much anymore. Goblins are weak compared to my ironclad dwarves. It's, frankly, boring. But again, only drawback coming from someone from back in 2017 (Not as old as some, but older than others).",1700876028,1700876028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hidden in the mountain store

Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free

Long ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.

It's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.

Well it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.

In a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  

I keep thinking ""I could do better"" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.

If you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)

In any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  

TL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",1670667817,1700819796,True,270,5,0.925435900688171387,0,True,False,False

First impressions: I have been drinking way to much mushroom swill, eating innards, bashing stone, dodging drainage, and fighting the hordes! 

Ah the life of a Dwarf!

The game is fun. Its complex, but it is fun. Simple truth.

The idea that I can gather a band of Dwarves and head out into a world where I have a lot of say in how its created, and who, or what its inhabitants are is awesome. Sometimes you win and sometimes you don't. I seem to lose more than I win. Lol 

Dying is part of the game. That is a significant part of what makes this game enjoyable and re-playable. The number of custom settings that you are presented with during setup allows you to continuously change the world creation parameters. This allows you to tailor the game to the type of world you want to build your Glorious Dwarven Empire in! Settings such as rainfall, temperature, sea level, savagery are some of the world creation parameters, to name just a few. There are many more options to play with. 

Once you have settled on your type of world you want to create. You get the choice to either play with a randomly generated group of Dwarves, or you can choose to adjust the starting skills, items, and animals they start out with. The choices you make for the skills, or starting items and animals play a large and important part in the survivability of your Dwarven folks.

Once your world has been defined, and your starting crew are selected you will then get to choose your starting location on your freshly created world. Its all about location! Pick your embark point wisely as it will affect what environment you start in, and what types resources are available to you. It is also important to check out who your local neighbors are. You don’t want to settle near The Tower of Dwarven Bashing! Ruled by the Goblin King Snotlick Soulstealer. It wont typically end well. On the other hand, if you are a Wrecking force of Battle-axe wielding Dwarven Warriors, go for it!

Once you settle on your Embark point you will show up next to your worn and now broken wagon of meager supplies. It is time to dig, collect, and survive. The game gives you a very helpful tutorial on the functions of the menu items. It takes a few to learn what they do and how they are interconnected. You should expect a significant learning curve. Did I say the game is complex? Well, it is complex.

Once you get an understanding of the basics the game starts to open up. From setting up resource gathering zones, and the creation of your production lines. To trading with the pointy eared b@s... Err gentle, kind, lovely forest folk, or trading with the Gold hungry Humans. You get to control all aspects of your fledgling economy. 

You Dwarves skill assignments at the start of the game, are directly related to the Job roles you now assign to them. Jo “Stubtoe” Jenkins (No relation to Leroy!) who you skilled up to be your miner now moves through rock like a hot knife through butter. But if you are in need of a little assistance with Old Elmbeard the farmer’s herb gathering before the winter sets in, then you can assign Jo to assist. You can set job assignments up based on need or skill. You can also set them up individually, or to multiple individuals to fill the role.
 
As you build your empire of rock and stone you will come to know your Dwarves. Early on you will get to know their moods, their desires, their motivations. They are unruly, ungrateful, loyal, loving, alcoholics! They are prone to do what they want. They have a mind of their own. They are not robots; they will do things…

I mean they will do what they want, when they want. You do not have control. You basicly manage the care taking of the Dwarves that go about their lives doing what they do. You setup resource gathering and production networks to provide them the means to survive.
 
The world in which they dwell within will come for them… It will happen, expect it, prepare for it. Survive it. Or die. Death happens.

You always have the option to build up your mighty Dwarven forces and go out and seek to conquer the lands around you. Or go and rescue a kidnapped person, reclaim a lost artifact, wage a holy crusade. The options are open to you. Explore, expand, and survive. Your adventure is built on your Dwarven Fortress!

There are many tutorials and resources available to you to increase your chances in this delightfully complex game. I highly advise you to spend some time getting to know the ins and outs of the interface and the logic systems and how they interact. There is a robust modding community that is ever expanding the scope of what’s possible within this game. Check them out.

A question on bugs…

Bugs are found in all software that has ever been created. This is the nature of code. Bugs happen when developers use innovative coding to make things behave in a certain way. When innovative coding and unpredictable player interaction collide, bugs happen. When AI logic processing gets stuck things don’t function. Simply put its ever evolving. The game will only get better as it moves forward. It is not in a beta state, nor is it riddled with issues. At its core it is a fun game with multiple complex interactions going on driven by logic systems. It is amazingly simple and complex at the same time. 

My conclusion based on 45 hours of the Steam release is that it is a strong step forward on an already awesome game. It has some bugs with system logic or AI pathing that is being worked out, and is expected to only get better. It is very playable. 

The mods coming out only enrich the game as a whole. The game is outstanding for the genre. You will enjoy it in its simple, yet complex take on gather, build, survive. Besides your Dwarves! Enough said.

Support the developers as we would not have this game without their vision and hard work. The game is great and I look forward to its expanding content, scope, and vision.

5.0 definitely feels different, the graphics really do subtract from that ""matrix"" effect everyone talks about, the game is slightly less immersive. 

The menus are nice, although I had no problem with the old version, and I do sorta miss it... a little. The new menus are rather clunky, where as the old menus were fairly smooth (after you sorta bash your head around it for awhile, it all sorta comes together), probably because of the key bindings more than anything. 

5.0 sorta gets the menus half way. The information is more visually present, in most cases, and easier to find in all cases. How ever it doesn't have a very good flow. moving back takes you to the beginning rather than a step back. Now, I wholeheartedly think that this will be  fleshed out and revamped in years to come, but for now its a sorta, for me, a sad middle ground. The menus do look much nicer, hands down. I do find it really hard to get to certain spots, like kitchen, which in my play is a sort of every other moment a screen I need up, it feels harder to get to some places, like much harder. Like getting to Urist preferences, it's too many steps, and I don't really see how the older ""jumbled"" way was worse... But, again, I played a lot for, like, 17 years. I may not be able to mend my ways...

That's the negative, the positive is that it looks very good. It feels a little more ""game"" like, now. and there are a lot of new features and things to discover and interesting things happening. The visuals do tell more story now, and the dwarves and other creatures look like their descriptions now, which is pretty cool.

All in all this is a fantastic version of Dwarf Fortress, and its now hitting a wider audience and I'm stoked about it.
But as an old player I gotta say there is just a little something missing... If you're a new player you wont even notice, it'll be the glorious DF we all love. If you're a vet then come meet me in the tavern, we will share a barrel of masterwork plump helmet wine and fist fight a gorlak while feeling nothing remembering a game made with all craftdwarfship of the highest quality.",1674001115,1700801674,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This is coming from someone who's never played a colony simulator before. The only experience I had playing one of these games was spending 30 minutes in the tutorial for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/]Rimworld[/url] and hating every second of it. Lets just say that I didn't like Rimworld and according to some people, it's one of the most beginner friendly colony simulator out there. How is it possible that I didn't enjoy such a polished and somewhat simpler game but ended up spending hours in this janky old game? Well... all these hours are me trying to figure out how to do the simplest tasks. This game will eat up your time keeping you glued to your screen, hypnotized. It's not just a game, it's literally a hobby. This is its own thing. Learning this game feels like learning how to play an instrument, or like learning a new language, or even learning how to ride a bike. Referring to the Wiki feels like homework. I don't consider myself to be a nerd and I'm definitely not into those Dungeons & Dragons things yet I’m having the time of my life with this beast of a game.

This game just kind of throws you into an ocean and lets you figure out how to swim, or at least float. Let me tell you that [b]you will drown a lot[/b]. This game is very difficult it's not even funny. Meme on Dark Souls and its reliance on skill all you want but this game will slam you hard with its randomness. There are some things that are beyond your control that when things don't go your way, it's frustrating. Which brings me to my next point. Losing is fun… that's the whole point. I just kinda wing it and learn from my mistakes. I'm too lazy to read the Wiki sometimes so I just consult YouTube for help. A big shout out to [url=https://www.youtube.com/@BlindiRL]Blind[/url] for helping me out with some of my questions. He makes tutorials for even the most basic things. For example I made a meeting area and my animals were starving and I couldn't figure out why. I then realized what the pasture zone was for so I plopped it down. I didn't realize I actually had to assign my animals to the zone so they just died. I tried to make a well… and it didn't work, so I went to YouTube. This game has become so popular, the resources for help are nearly endless.

I didn't know about this game until 6 months before the Steam release so lucky I didn’t really have to wait much. I knew it existed, I've just never really paid attention to it. Around that time, I tried the free version and I'm happy to announce that this version is better for newcomers. I still have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking at with the old matrix thing. Not only that, the mouse controls make this a more ""tolerable"" experience. I say tolerable because like I said, this game isn't easy. It's one of the first games that has made me boil my eyes out. Not because of a sad storyline or anything, it's just one of those things where you pause, cry, brush off the dust, and continue.

The soundtrack is a banger. I thought acoustic guitars were lame and electric guitars sound cooler. Boy did these songs change my mind. It's so relaxing. It's like Minecraft music but guitar. Every time [url=https://youtu.be/bhU8VdELyTE]Drink & Industry[/url] comes on, It makes me feel very happy to see a lot of pixels having fun in a tavern.

And for those of you who are worried like me, yes you can make the UI bigger. I'm visually impaired and need my letters to be big. Like grandma phone big. Unlike Rimworld where it only lets you resize the UI based on your resolution, Dwarf Fortress gives you the freedom to make it as big as you see fit. I haven't noticed any windows obscuring buttons other than the tutorial window, but you can minimize that and it's still playable. The menu isn't pretty, but I like to read what I'm clicking on.

It's not all sunshine and rainbows. Let's talk about the optimization, ""It's just a bunch of pixelated sprites, what could go wrong?"" [i]Proceeds to make the biggest world and cranks everything to the highest[/i]... big mistake… this game somehow lags. I'm not too knowledgeable on the technical side of how this game works and how it renders everything, but you need a surprisingly beefy computer if you want this to run properly. I'd say my PC is decent, not top notch anymore but it can still run current day games on medium settings. Lets just say that my computer fans were going crazy. That would be my only complaint so far.

If you are eyeballing this game, I'd say go for it. Maybe do some research before going in, the only reason I managed to keep my first Fortress for a while is because I watched hours upon hours of let's plays from many different people. I got really sick and couldn't get out of bed so I would binge watch many Dwarf Fortress videos all being +45 minutes each. Monkey see, monkey do. And that's what I did. I'm a visual learner and I learned a lot just by watching people play. I went into this knowing what an aquifer is. I also learned how not to be afraid of them. Just build around them…

I 100% recommend this game as a non-nerd and as someone who's never played a colony simulator before. The only thing I can compare it to is The Sims but instead of controlling an urban family of up to 8 members and building a house, you control about +200 creatures with deep and complex feelings and emotions. You build a fortress, a dwarf fortress. Then you try to survive in a not so family-friendly crude world.

Trying this game out opened a new genre of games I like and I’m now open to trying out more like it. I want to try [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029780/Going_Medieval/]Going Medieval[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1700870/Clanfolk/]Clanfolk[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/]Oxygen Not Included[/url], among others. I'll even give Rimworld another chance. This game has made me appreciate the detail and endless replayability that goes into these “nerd games”

The gameplays is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of geology most of the jokes will go over a typical player's head.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the z-level of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about FUN. As a consequence people who dislike Dwarf Fortress truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Toady's existential catchphrase ""Losing is Fun,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Archcrystal by Sethathos.

After the game was released on Steam, it became much more accessible and a little easier to play. Graphics were also added, something I had surprisingly never missed.

At the beginning of each new game, a complete world with a unique story is generated, which you can explore and follow in Legend Mode. There are tons of creatures, with the main characters being dwarves, goblins, elves and humans, spiced up with beasts and monsters of all kinds. On closer inspection, the stories generated by the game often contain such crazy details that you really can't make them up.

If you really want to get involved yourself, you have to get a bunch of haphazard alcoholics to build a decent fortress and get to grips with managing it (procuring and processing resources, creating and training an army, etc.). That doesn't sound too difficult at first glance. But then there are the other races, such as other dwarves, humans, goblins, and a colorful bunch of cannibalistic tree huggers who are just waiting for someone to dare to cut down their trees. Even if they thrive in their own fortress deep underground.

If you want, you can make the game a little more beginner-friendly by cancelling enemy attacks.  However, this does not make the game directly peaceful, as anyone who has dug deep enough can probably confirm. 

If practically every fortress ends up being overrun by enemies or your own computer runs out of memory one day, that's a moot point. 

You probably won't have a super successful dwarf force the first time, and maybe not the second, third or umpteenth time either. But then you should always remember what the game itself says about itself: Loosing is fun!",1700763240,1700763240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Brings the original ASCII game to life with improved graphics*
- Tutorials available for most tasks*
- Lots of fun
- Mechanics soo deep and diverse it requires a wiki opened on a second screen
- Dwarfs digging holes, drinking alcohol and fighting the world
- Game continues to be updated

Cons:
- Very steep learning curve
- Lots of FUN
- Mechanics soo deep and diverse it requires a wiki opened on a second screen

* in comparison to the free, non-Steam, available version on Bay12games

In conclusion:
Recommended game for people looking for mechanical complexity over graphic quality featuring dwarfs and other milkdrinkers.

Turn on keyboard cursor in Settings > Game > Keyboard Cursor Enabled, and check out macros which work with keystrokes. You can define hotkeys for just about anything, from mining orders in certain shapes, to building furniture, to whatever you can think up. This clears up half of my nitpicks

Coming from Rimworld as a new player to Dwarf Fortress, I find this version to be reasonably easy to get into (granted I've always got the wiki up and I'm always on the lookout for optimizing and learning new things), but I also see how it could be frustrating for returning players. In my eyes, that frustration doesn't warrant a negative review, and I think the game should be evaluated for what it is.

And it is ROBUST. There's a couple things I'm missing from Rimworld such as prioritized stockpiles or tasks (Build this door right here RIGHT NOW, or always make sure THIS stockpile gets things first), but the dwarves have a mind of their own, and there's many, many more dwarves in my fortress than I ever had colonists in Rimworld, so there's always somebody up for the job. Eventually. Hopefully.

**Sometimes it's awkward to tap in hotkeys with one hand as the other is on the mouse (going B - S - P has my hand reaching across the keyboard and that's annoying), but I'm sure these things will be addressed, and in the grand scheme of things they don't take away from my enjoyment of the game. (**See REVIEW EDIT at the top of my review, this issue was me being inexperienced)

You may settle in any biome and face really different challenges. 
You will explore a lot of ways to make your fortress survive by digging into different industries from metalworking up to organcis processing.
Automation possibilities are great btw - game supports mechanisms, and you can do a lot using water, levers, floodgates and etc.
Fighting system is really accurate and basically process creatures to basic limbs - no juke I had to destroy undead finger once.
Also variety of enemies is great you will face a lot of worthy enemies and if you dig deep... Let's say you will face random generated ones first, and if you manage to dig deeper you will face [redacted]. Ground enemies are great too you will face invasions wide variety of worthy enemies dependent on biome you settle.

I played the non-steam version of this game on an off for many years. In the past I’ve enjoyed some of the copycat games which had better visuals but lacked the depth of Dwarf Fortress. I know some people love the ASCII graphics, but I’ve always wanted it to look a bit more modern and make it easier to interpret what was happening on screen. I followed the build up to the Steam release and purchased it at launch. I’ve had so many hours of enjoyment over the years for free – take my money you deserve it.

So this game is interesting, and I struggle on whether or not to actually recommend it to people in general or not... But I think for the purposes of steam's review system I will, because it's a beautiful labor of love despite it's seemingly impenetrably obtuse presentation.

I certainly recommend it to fans of city builders, old hyper granular sims, and don't mind a bit of clunk and the occasional unfair loss; because once you accept that part of the fun is the story you can tell at the end of the day and become willing to take risks to experiment with what sorts of goofy mega projects the game will let you get away with the game really starts to shine.

This is the progenitor of games like Rim World, where in you select a place on the world map to start, and work from basically nothing but a wagon full of supplies and seven dwarves who you must order to build structures, chop trees, and carve out tunnels using a command menu and painting zone markers. At the start the biggest hurdle to get over will be memorizing the UI hot keys and of course, the environment of whatever zone you chose for your new home - which range from rather bountiful unthreatening meadows and forests to scorching, inhospitable deserts full of vicious beasts to hellish cursed zones where the dead hunt the living - where even a creature's butchered hide might come to life and try to strangle the dwarf who did the deed; and everything in-between. Chances are the worst you'll have to deal with is the occasional giant bird or kobold thief or pack of wolves, but as you progress and word of your fortress' wealth gets out you'll soon be beset by the real threat to any playthrough... Migrant waves! (And goblin sieges, and the occasional mega beast, of course). The true challenge of the game is balancing the expansion of your fortress, ensuring you don't get too rich too quick and end up with more mouths than you can feed, while still managing to secure yourself from more tangible threats; and of course in addition to a strong food industry, you'll need to ensure your breweries are going at full capacity at all times, because a sober dwarf is an unproductive dwarf!

The true beauty of this game, though, is the fact that the world is never static and even the most meticulously and carefully laid-out fortress will rarely end up going as planned; whether from a possessed dwarf seizing a workshop and demanding turtle shells in a barrel desert, requiring them to be sealed in lest they harm the populace when they inevitably go mad and a new workshop hastily put together in its place; or digging out an unexpected cave full of horrible primordial monsters craving dwarf flesh forcing you to relocate the newest housing project for the latest wave of immigrants... Or some human bard deciding to incite a race war by punching the local elven envoy to death in a drunken rage spiralling your fortress into chaos from within; or even a dwarf getting their socks set on fire in the magma forges and deciding they need a drink before dealing with it, setting off a massive explosion and wiping out your booze stocks. Any number of things can happen, and they're almost always hilarious to look back on when sharing your stories with others.

For added !!FUN!!: Run a succession game with friends, where in you all pass around one dwarf fort file round robin style every month (or every week for faster turnaround) and watch the chaos that ensues from multiple hands managing a single fort, sometimes not realizing that siege workshop they built was in the middle of an old farm flooding plot; or being left wondering why there's a cage full of a thousand cats sitting in the entry way.",1700707845,1700707845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Long Review 
Amazing to see this 2006 game continue to be developed 17 years later. It has been made much more user friendly to new players and given some amazing graphics and sound design. The first time I built a tavern and ""Drink and Industry"" started to play I though a friend threw on some banger music in discord. But my love of this game goes much deeper than just some fancy graphics and some banger beats. It goes back to the first time I played dwarf fortress and when I fell in love with it. My first fort died because they ran out of drink(a common and beginner mistake) The rivers froze up and there was no water that I knew of, and every one of my dwarves began to die one by one except one. She wasn't liked by anyone in the fort and that was A OK by her, as she hated everyone else as well. This became very important because some how, some way she was getting something to drink and none of my other dwarves had access to this source of life saving water/ale. As my fort crumbled she survived and decided to also take pity on the 2 dwarf children. So after my entire fort except for her and the 2 dwarf children she adopted died I gave her the sole task of dragging the corpses out into a stockpile to screenshot. This would typically give a dwarf negative thoughts, not her she relished in the fact that those who made fun of her and her tattered clothing were dead and got happy thoughts. After she beat down one child snatcher but failed to stop the second from stealing her other adopted kid I resigned my fort to it's fate by her hand. From that moment on I saw the appeal of dwarf fortress and fell in love with this odd game. 11/10",1700696676,1700696676,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Same tagline I used when I supported this game aeons ago, but now shiny enough for humans to use and not end up dreaming in ASCII, with a tutorial (Short, but it's an entry point, this game doesn't hold your hand, ever) and a UI that involves the mouse (SHOCK!!)

Played it for countless hundreds of hours previously, but in the past few hours alone the following has happened in my forts 3 years:

- Forgot water pressure existed, so nearly flooded my first Steam fort when digging out my well and irrigation
- Didn't have the right type of cloth, so one dwarf ended up going insane and running naked through the halls until she died of dehydration
- Next artifact looked promising, Urist McUseless spent a whole season crafting....an animal trap decorated with the same wood it was made of....
-Out of my 28 population, 9 were children. In a shocking turn of events, 5 of the remaining useful adults were related to some Noble stunted alcoholic maniac and inherited their positions within a bloody year
- Giantess decided to come curb stomp me, called everyone to the burrows, the 5 nobles stood in the above ground fields having a chat. Cue said Nobles knee-capping the Giantess, gutting her and then sticking a pickaxe in her and then gather round the corpse to continue chatting.
- Second person went insane because I didn't have the right type of cloth, cue nude streaking while muttering something about pencils, noses and ""Wibble""

And this is only the beginning... It's not for everyone, it's hard as balls, and if you're after graphics move on (Although a nice touch how the dwarf sprites actually follow their IG descriptions), but you'll never hear better stories than from DF",1670372244,1700694394,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

One of the most notable features of Dwarf Fortress is its depth and complexity. The game features a vast array of mechanics, including mining, crafting, farming, and combat. Players must carefully manage their resources and ensure the safety of their dwarves.

Another notable feature of Dwarf Fortress is its procedurally generated world. The game creates a new world for each playthrough, which means that no two games are the same. This adds a great deal of replayability to the game.

Dwarf Fortress is a challenging game, but it is also rewarding. Players who are willing to put in the effort can create a thriving dwarven fortress.

Positives

    Deep and complex gameplay
    Procedurally generated world
    High replayability
    Creative and challenging

Negatives

    Steep learning curve
    Can be buggy
    Not for everyone

Overall

Dwarf Fortress is a challenging but rewarding simulation game that offers a unique and immersive experience. It is a must-play for fans of simulation games and anyone who enjoys a challenge.",1699635140,1700690130,True,1,1,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

We have to start by admitting that Dwarf Fortress is not for everyone.

You will be given a plethora of texts in various that will build  each and every one of your Dwarfs as the unique characters that they are.
You will have to Dig the earth to create your mines at least. 
You can build above the earth or make a mountain fort.
You will have to decide which of you products you will sell and try to plan ahead for the next caravan that will come your way. 
You will have to plan ahead and request items that you will need next year in your Fort. That may be instruments , food , clothing ,pets ,or hundreds of possible other items .

And above all you need to know that is not a fast game.
Take your time  enjoy it.
Take notes regarding your favourite Dwarf or Dwarfs.

Check how their life is progressing. Will they be a Legendary Miner? 
Or maybe they are a Legendary Warrior or... They got on their hands a book of the dark arts and they became a Necromancer that will keep raising any dead part they encounter.
My Dwarfs are trying to be Mathematicians i believe. I got 6 books on my fort and everyone is reading the one book about Mathematics

My favourite Dwarf, is a wrestler in my melee squad. He has a Battle Axe but he keeps attacking once or twice and then he abandons it and starts biting and trying to pull the Left arms of his victims. For some reason he attacks only their left side.

My question. Is he going to survive till his retirement or one day he will be a bit too cocky and a goblin will shank him before he ends up making a name for himself as the Berserk of Obeyclasp Fortress.

Who knows what is going happen?

I just plan on enjoying the trip as their stories are unfolding before my eyes.

And don't forget Losing is Fun.


(in case either kitfox or Bay 12 Games see this. If you can bring back in any way or form the old Logs. so that we can re read the battles of our dwarfs or events that happen in the map, we would truly love that.)

To call Dwarf Fortress a game is failure of language.
This procedurally generated ""game"" is simply one of the greatest classics of all time. 
A game that is constantly updated and loved by its creators, and one that is equally loved
by fans who have been playing it and watching others play it for decades now, all with a shiny 
new Interface and graphics. 
You will do things in this game, on accident, that leads to some of the most bizarre and wonderful 
encounters from consequences of actions you didn't even realize you took.
From the wonderful lore that is generated about each of your [b] Urists [/b] (dwarves) that you actually take the time to get get to know them, their wants, desires, dreams, etc.
If you can imagine it you can build it. And then it will flood and you will start all over again and enjoy every 
single second of it. 
This game belongs in the pantheon of the GOATs, it deserves to be mentioned every time any discussion of these timeless classics is brought up.
If you're on the fence about buying it, I say do it, its got a bit of a learning curve but thats what youtube for and at the very lest they deserve your dollars because they kept this game free for two decades (and continue to do so on their website for the ascii version) and they deserve every penny.

The game gives you freedom; too much for what usually is considered the good dose to make a game consistenly good; yet It still manages to not derail of It´s initial narrative design. The descriptions the game provides constantly through text manage to give a seriously detailed picture of something that probably barely exists in the game outside of Its description. But that´s the marve in itl; having the choice to truly focus on anyone or anything you want and see it revolve around It´s world, interest and fears is what makes this so great.

Chris Redfield from the Resident Evil(TM) Franchise of Video Games here. I have edited this for the steam awards badge! Like I said. I don't think dwarf fortress is a good game, BUT I think its a huge achievement technologically speaking. Back to regularly scheduled programming:

I ain't gonna refund it, because it has cultural significance and belongs in my collection of games, but I'm not gonna say I like it.

Pros
-- Deep simulation
-- Good podcast game
-- SOMETIMES something funny happens

Cons
-- You usually have to wait about 10 hours for something funny to happen
-- The game is stupid easy unless you like doing pointless things to increase challenge (restricting how you play, doing intentionally stupid things)
-- The majority of the game is just building crafts and expanding your vast array of bedrooms. It really is mindnumbingly boring.

I know it's forbidden to compare this game to Rimworld, but in Rimworld I can embark anywhere and I'm guaranteed to have some fun stuff happen to my colonists. In this game as long as you aren't an actual masochist, your dwarves will always be fine. You have to THROW THEM into danger for them to die (E.G. digging into the circus). You may counter this and say ""Well Chris Redfield from the Resident Evil(TM) Franchise of video games, why not embark on an ice sheet or an aquifer?"" I'll tell you why - THAT'S MISERABLE AND BORING IN A COMPLETELY OTHER WAY. This is a fantasy world simulation, not a true video game.

Miner Tekkud Domasasdug was the first to breach into the caverns, greeted by a wave of fresh but muddy air and a surprise guest: an angry Great Crocodile was right in front of him. Tekkud instinctively punched it into the lower body with his free hand, immediately gelding it.

Today, many many years later, a gem-encrusted statue of Tekkud the Gelder stands at the entrance of the King's throne room. It commemorates our first act of establishing dominance over these lands. It's a warning to all who seek an audience with the King, to remind them of what we may do to anyone who'd disregard our absolute authority.

I recommend just trying to survive at first! 
-Create an underwater riverway to fuel your vast sewer lines, wells, and to provide an internal and safe fishing area.
-Keep cavern layers always open but prepare for danger by installing various traps and gates to prevent shadowy invaders taking over!
-Make a hospital that can safely store infected dwarves bitten by were-beasts so they don't quickly overtake the entire fort.
-Automate your clothing industry by refining Pig Tails, shearing animals, spinning cloth, etc. No dwarf wants to wear the same disgusting socks for multiple decades!!!
-Think of new and interesting ways to eliminate your pesky criminal dwarves without directly murdering them by use of your militia. Flooding/Drowning rooms, execution by weapon traps, creating a new military squad including only the criminal party and sending them alone and weaponless to fight invaders in the caverns to earn their freedom!

Dwarf Fortress is a complex game with a steep learning curve but extremely rewarding once you get the general understand of things. You basically manage an entire troop of dwarves starting out with seven to which it can grow to around 200 of the fellas. You essentially attempt to keep them happy by micromanaging various aspects of their lives. Although despite your best efforts one is likely to die due to a small, tiny, little oversight, or because poor ole Urist has decided he want's out. If you can get the basics going and keep them working you can begin on mega projects or dig to the center of the realm for all the riches that entails.

― Arthur Schopenhauer

Originially I bounced off the game more than a couple of times but the passionate commuinity surrounding it and the stories that arose from it just kept bringing me back.

I am glad I did, what I discovered was an amazing work of art that just keeps getting better the more time I spent with it. I like many others were eager to see it released on Steam, not just because we would get better graphics and an arguably much needed overhaul to it's interface but that with it, Tarn and Zach would be rewarded for all their hard work.

I am grateful that I live in a world where a project like Dwarf Fortress is able to exist, and not  just exist but was (and still can be) freely given. It shows us that games can be a labour of love. So I am glad with this Steam release more people will be able to see what I and many others see and come to appreciate this wonderful gem.

Thankyou Tarn, Zach and the Dwarf Fortress community who supported you for those 20+ years. I look forward to the future.

The visuals aren't stunning, the soundtrack isn't award winning, the UI/UX aren't the greatest (way better than before), the game-play isn't the most technically impressive. There is no set in stone immersive story or lore. No poster worthy protagonist/antagonists. And no control?

It's a massive sandbox. One that you try, and mostly fail, to control. Characters do what they want. They have feelings, relationships, preferences. Those things aren't set either. They change with the environment. They fall in love, fall out of love, experience pleasure and trauma. They scheme, and plan. Take and give. You shape the world these characters live in but they are the ones that live in it. You can plan your fortress, you can build the walls, dig the halls, claim your treasure, put a king on a throne, build a cathedral to the gods. None of it matters. A flood can fill those halls, thieves can steal your treasure, the king can be usurped, and gods can curse your people. Enlightenment, banquets, mystical beasts, and order. Plague, starvation, monsters, and rebellion. Nothing can stop the FUN and that's the fun. That's the beauty. Every thing is unique.

There's infinite possibilities, scenarios, and stories to experience as no two fortresses are the same. 

The tutorial and nice graphics are a welcome addition over using the raw ASCII or the LNP+Graphics pack, and it's undeniable how much thought, blood, sweat, and effort has been poured into this game over the literal years of constant and dedicated development. 

I may not have a lot of hours on the steam version, but I have thousands of hours and many thriving (many more failed) forts in the ASCII version. Please take my words into consideration for purchasing this game. 

This game may be for you if:

[list]
[*]If you're willing to spend time learning [b]all[/b] the different buildings, their uses, and their priority
[*]If you're willing to deal with a slightly clunky UI to plan, design, and navigate a very large 2.5D world
[*]If you're willing to engage with your dwarves at a deeper level, understanding that each one has a set of skills that they're good at, likes and dislikes, and preferences
[*]If you're willing to spend hours, incrementally building up your fortress, building new rooms, bigger food plots, grand halls, workshops, mines, a working army, trap doors and draw bridges, lava moats, etc, only for it to all fail in the end by either an unforeseen circumstance, or by a flaw in your design
[*]Most importantly, if you're willing to do that all again after a fort fails 
[/list]

This may not be for you if you're looking for a more simplistic/easier town building/colony management game. 
If you're still interested in the organic stories, I'd highly recommend watching someone like kruggsmash on youtube. 

Personally this game is a buy because I love the game, and to show support to the brothers who have spent a major portion of their lives breathing life into this game and truly turning it into something magical for us all to experience.

On the other kind, it was kind of obvious. This game is absolutely incredible. It's my favourite game of all time. The depth of the sandbox it provides is unmatched. It has one of the only video game soundtracks that I'll eagerly play when I'm studying or trying to sleep - all of its songs are beautiful. The stories it can generate (with only a little bit of imagination) are captivating, hilarious, sad, exciting - they capture the full spectrum of what makes being alive worth while.
The controls for the game can be a bit rough, and while I do love the graphics they use for the game, it is ultimately a bit limited. What else can you expect? It was made 20 years ago to render ASCII graphics without mouse support, and the team at Kitfox games has made a huge effort to modernise this game and it has absolutely paid off.

So, I now had only happy dwarves but no migrants for the last year and I really needed them now because I kinda started a war with the elves after I seized their traders goodies after they didn't want to sell to me. Luckily my population more than doubled a week later from 24 to 63 dwarves.

Dwarf Fortress was one of the first games I ever played. At this point I've been playing well over half my life and can't see it ever getting old, if you've just found this game or have always been turned off by the UI I can't recommend checking it out more than ever before, personally I'd recommend struggling to get to grips with the game from scratch in order to discover that losing is fun from the get go but if you're not a masochist you can utilise the new in game tutorials and plethora of online community guides to get a headstart so that you can be slaying goblins (and probably your own dwarves) in no time.
Whether you enjoy building, colony mangement, sandbox, roguelike or god games, dwarf fortress has you covered with no one playstyle being forced on you. On top of the deep and crazy base game modding really expands the game letting you add in your own races, tools, recipies etc without any coding knowledge while community made total conversion mods, world creation tools and 3D visualisers open up even more ways to enjoy the game.
I don't feel that the learning curve should put anyone off and if you want to try the game first you can always download the classic version for free (and download a graphics pack if you're not keen on ASCII), or even download PeridexisErrant's DF Starter Pack (Also known as the Lazy Newb Pack) as a single download including the latest classic version of the game, graphic and tilesets to choose from, the ability to edit settings outside of the txt files, and lots of utilities to mess around with.
One thing to note is that the Adventure roguelike mode isn't shipping with the Steam release but will be added for free at some point (there's a roadmap for those interested) and while it was originally the main gamemode it's generally seen as secondary by most players. On the upside if you're new you get to look forward to a huge free addition where you get to explore your huge worlds as a character of your making and your band of merry drunks.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room: the graphics. Gone are the days when deciphering the matrix of ASCII characters was a rite of passage. The Steam version has undergone a graphical face-lift that could make even the Mona Lisa crack a smile. It’s like trading in a trusty old pair of bifocals for the Hubble telescope; the clarity and detail put old modded tilesets to shame. It’s a high-definition tapestry where every pixelated dwarf and meticulously crafted fortress tile tells a story.

Gameplay-wise, Dwarf Fortress is as forgiving as a brick wall in a pillow fight. It's not just a game; it's a lifestyle choice. The learning curve isn't so much a curve as it is a vertical cliff face with overhangs and the occasional gremlin throwing rocks at you from above. But that's the charm! Each failure is a story, each success a saga. You'll craft tales of glory as your dwarves triumph, and equally epic ballads of despair when they inevitably succumb to a were-llama uprising.

Management is the name of the game, and in ""Dwarf Fortress,"" you manage everything: from the intricate beer-brewing protocols to the proper use of soap (which is more important than you might initially think). The level of detail is so granular that you could probably use it to file your taxes, or at least distract you from the fact that you haven't.

But let's talk about the real draw here — the stories that emerge from the chaos. You'll find yourself emotionally invested in Urist the dwarf, who crafted a legendary chair only to be driven mad by the ghost of his pet rabbit. And when the fortress falls, as it always does, you'll shed a tear, raise a tankard, and then delve back into the mountain for more.

In conclusion, Dwarf Fortress on Steam is not just a game; it's a digital adventure park for those who like their rides with a chance of decapitation by a rogue carp. It's the best thing since sliced bread, but be warned: this bread comes with a chance of mold in the shape of dragons. It's not for everyone, but for those who get it, it's the Sistine Chapel of gaming — enigmatic, revered, and now visually stunning.",1670379559,1700644144,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

Okay, so this was already one of the deepest simulations in gaming history and now with the Steam release and a new UI along with awesome graphics it's propelled itself far beyond the legendary status.

If you ever found yourself interested in this game but couldn't connect with its old look then you no longer have that excuse! Go buy it. For those that are curious then just know that some of the most popular games (i.e. Minecraft, Rimworld etc.) are heavily inspired by this 20 year old game.

Dwarf Fortress is difficult to learn, and you will basically spend more time on the wiki or asking for help on discord for the first few forts, but OH BOY is it worth the time investment. One of the very few videogames that are an endless hobby all by themselves.

The game might look very empty and dry, but once you know how to interpret what's going on, there is so much to go over! I once had a badass naked dwarf remove a steel bolt stuck in his knee and stab 3 goblins to death with it while bleeding out.
One other time a child killed a boar after it interrupted him playing with a puzzlebox.

You can literally create very very very detailed statues with stories on them, same applies for figurines, drawings and the likes. There are so many industries to invest in, so many machines to build, so much room for creativity!

Just knowing that each dwarf has exactly 32 teeth simulated should be enough to tell you the amount of detail!

Still, a 10/10 experience in my eyes. It's Dwarf Fortress. Many titles have tried to copy the formula, and a couple have succeeded in making something special.

Many features like mine carts and scholars are black magic that requires reading multiple huge Wikipedia pages to learn the best approximations  and hypothesis community research has found on the systems. Unironically, modding in DF is than parsing the menus and stuff in game .

Not only that the game is super easy and poses no challenge. I liken it to Hardcore Minecraft, a game DF inspired, all you have to do is dig a hole and seal the top and you can never die. Of course, no one actually plays hardcore Minecraft like that and you should not play DF like that. DF is best played when you put your Dwarves at risk, when you try new stuff, give yourself lofty goals. I like learning and there is no end to what you can learn in DF. If you want to do something, with enough research and black magic you can probably do it. 

Dwarf Fortress is one of my all time favorite games. It has such a smooth pace of play. Start a fort with a goal (Such as making a fort all about farming) either succeed in the face of great adversity or fail spectacularly. Start a new fort with a new goal (such as raising a grizzly bear army but now you can set up some quality farms as you mastered that in the last fort. succeed in the face of great adversity or fail spectacularly. Start a new fort with a new goal. Build a glass base on the bottom of the ocean but now you can set up quality farms and train animals for defense with minimal effort. And so on.

There is no in game progression in DF. No tech tree to push through, no new features to unlock, permanent upgrades. An yet, for me at least, Dwarf Fortress has the most satisfying progression out of any game I have every played as every fort gives you a new skill that you the player have mastered. A new tool in you the players proverbial tool box. Every fort gives a new understanding of game mechanics. Ever fort increases you the players mastery. 

Dwarf fortress is a sandbox. It is a sandbox that emulates so many stupid little things there is no end to what you can learn. No end the journey of mastery. Like an asymptote that gets infinitely closer to the point but never reaches complete personally master in DF is impossible. But that is okay, even with just a moderate understanding you can do so much cool stuff. 

Dwarf Fortress is a game that is easy to survive in, damn near hard to thrive in, and gets more fun the more you play and the more you understand. Thus, we have a game that gets more fun the better you are and a game that it is impossible to have perfect knowledge of. That is why Dwarf Fortress has the loyal following it has who put up with years of no content and the bugs and the interface and the graphics and all that. Because, there is no limit to the amount of fun you can have, no end were you have learned everything. Infinite fun so to say. I like having fun.",1700637569,1700637569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visuals and PC support got improved further so I tried it .. and it has blown me away.
The depth of things you can do here is wild and you are learning new things constantly mostly through your own mistakes.

Oh all of your dwarves died because they had nothing to drink? Better assign a brewer early next game.

A craftswoman was about to craft a legendary artifact but got mad and started to beat other dwarves in her underpants? Maybe you should provide all materials she needs to craft it.

Your dwarves got bitten nearly to death by wildlife but you managed to heal them at the hospital? Yeah better lock the doors next time because those were werewolves and all your dwarves transformed in those and infected others which led to the death of an entire colony.

So I'm loving this game and there is always so much do to and improve in your mountain.

It can be overwhelming but its also inviting. You want to learn how to do that next thing on your mind, or that thing you see which you know can be used. Let the internet be your friend and research things as you play. Things are fairly simple to understand once you know how to do it. Just simply learning how to do something is somehow rewarding in this game, even if you dont even end up doing what you learned. Its hard to explain. Ive never played a colony sim in my life. I now play a colony sim. I dont see how this game can get old. This is a masterpiece in every literal sense.

Edit from 15 hours at review time compared to 200+ hours in: DF hack is basically a must to play this game properly. DF update hit, DF hack wouldnt load, and Im instantly feeling like I lost a lot of QOL features that help the fortress. Hopefully a lot of QOL updates happen in the future ( thats the main goal for the team so lets hope ) to make it where DF Hack isnt needed.

The game takes more than a bit of time to learn and the best way to learn how to play the game are tutorial videos. They help you learn the basics and then you have to rely upon the old adage ""losing is fun"" as something usually goes wrong or you reach a point where you're done with the fort.

The fact the world continues and evolves as you play is one of the more amazing things. One of the things I've wanted to do a lot is just play 1 continuous world over a long period of time but the thing that keeps me away from doing that is just available time. You can generate a lot of worlds with interesting lore without much work.

One other bad part is you kind of need to apply your own story to the game. Stories happen but you somewhat have to investigate and tie things together in that very human way. The game does a lot of simulation and you need to be the one to connect the dots and understand the larger picture as the different puzzle pieces interlock and come together.

Overall, I recommend the game because of the infinite joy I've had as well as the joy they keep bringing with updates over many many years. The only problem is that it is complicated and takes more than a bit to start understanding the game and that understanding is almost always done better with outside materials like the wiki or youtube videos.",1700629249,1700629249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you can think/dream it you can likely do it in this game. You wanna make a giant pyramid, you can do it. You want to make a medievil torture room you can. The game will take a bit to learn if you're new but the tutorial helps you at least start and understand the basics. You can play with just the knowledge learned in it if you really want to. Or you can use that and build on top of such knowledge. You're going to lose forts, but don't worry losing is fun! You can resettle in your forts with a new group if you really like the site and don't want to find a new one (there are likely to be some new spider inhabitants though so careful). I don't say these things just to hype the game or to repeat known memes within the community. Losing is fun is the point of the game, think of roguelites which are part of what inspired this complex game to exist. You can learn from your failures and start a new save using this new knowledge to have a fort go for longer, or you can willingly destroy it to see how long they last or whatever other reason you choose. The systems are well fleshed out and not half baked vs other games, memories and such work like a proper memory unlike say Skyrim or whatever other game you can think of. It's fun to even jsut mess around and try things to learn different systems. Deepnding on you're likely going to have someone die or get a bit frustrated but that's part of the whole, losing is fun statement for this game.

We retook the fledgling fortress, and in force. We reinforced our foolish structures in defiance of the trees (the Elves weren't up this far north), building walls and channeling the power of the very aquifer that denied my warriors steel to form their life-restoring well.

It would be easy to describe this game as a colony management sim where you baby sit a bunch of drunk short people... and that would be accurate way of describing it. 

it's the autism part is the fact that this game is rim world on steroids. Yea sure you can chop off the arms of your colonists in Rim world, but in Dwarf Fortress you can declaw elves, one finger at a time. Tooth by tooth, ear by ear. 

This game is 17 years in the making, it started out as a type of table top RPG software to help keep track of characters and then it branched out into it's own game. It's been redesigned dozens of times and directly inspired a game about placing blocks and getting blown up by deformed green pigs. 

The thing that makes this game special is the attention to detail, weather, finger nail growth, gi tracks, erosion, hair, teeth, rivers, oceans, ambient temperatures of every individual items, gods, civil wars, war between nations, politics, sink holes, and even the stages of depression. The game is basically the medieval matrix for everything inside it.

The DFHack community has put a lot of work into improving the game, and it's great! But the steam version made it no easy task, DF had the unique opportunity to implement what the community developed over ~20 years of gameplay, learning by trial and error, to make the game as enjoyable as possible (some would even say playable). Still, we ended up with one of the absolutely worst UIs I've ever seen in a game. 

DF is a masterpiece considering its objective and what it was able to achieve so far. But my current line of thought is that its clumsiness is still unacceptable.

Look, I would love to give a neutral, but since I can't, I have to go with thumbs down. I can't recommend the game until they put sorting or searching options into menus. I am tired of scrolling to find things everywhere, all the time. It is such a smaller thing, but REALLY affect gameplay when playing with +100 dwarves. Have you tried to use the justice system?

I think Dwarf Fortress has no shortage of personality and customization options, but I think it genuinely suffers when it comes to actual *gameplay*. That being, there really isn't any.

Every playthrough for me is the exact same, I create a fortress, I build up my stores, create commodities to trade for other things, deal with the various environmental hazards that come my way, and fill my halls with statues and engravings. I watch my fortress come to life as dwarves migrate by the hundreds, the halls teeming with little sprites, dancing across my screen like ants on their way to their next task. I could sit and watch it for hours.

That is the issue. That is the gameplay. You watch these little sprites for hours until something comes in and demolishes your progress. The level of agency or control you have to avoid these things are basically limited by luck and your ability to foresee and circumvent those hazards. To contrast with Rimworld, where if I am met with a hazard, I have some level of agency to control how my pawns respond. Dwarf Fortress simply throws it's hands into the air and hopes you remembered to assign enough squads, or that you were fertilizing your garden properly, or that a migrating eldritch abomination hasn't wandered through your front door. 

Once it's over, it's over. You've wasted hours of time, and contrary to what this game is known for online, I can never for the life of me remember a single pawn. I don't know their names, I don't know their jobs, I don't know about their personality, or what they may have contributed to my fortress. All I am left with is a faceless mass of dwarves, dead on the stone floor, representing 10 hours of my life down the drain. 10 hours watching a bunch of sprites, whom despite having names, jobs, likes and dislikes, I am never privy to due to the speed and presentation of this game. This doesn't so much provide a story generator, as it does a playground for engineering in the context of digging underground.

Electronic Arts/WB Games/Ubisoft/Activision worked hard to normalize all these things - this is practically spitting in their faces!

Jokes aside... **insert some slow sad laughter here**

In all honesty I find myself stuck when trying to explain why the game is good. Think the best I can do is say it's kinda like Factorio where it's been a complete game for ages yet they just keep adding more.

The game is what spawned so many similar games like Rimworld, Towns, Gnomoria, etc - some like Rimworld have gone in amazing directions while most others have just died over the years... meanwhile Dwarf Fortress has been quietly receiving updates and additional content all this time.

Admittedly this game isn't for everyone - but if you've ever been left wanting more from many of the failed spin-offs that have popped up on Steam, this one shouldn't let you down.

Not launching with Adventure Mode is *like* early access but I'll give it a pass since getting my hands on Fortress Mode is basically the full version as far as I'm concerned. Been looking forwards to it since the first day I saw the steam announcement pop up.

Despite the simple pixel graphics, there's a truly mind-boggling level of depth built into it. Creatures have preferences, hopes and dreams, short- and long-term memories, can experience mental trauma, can become depressed, can form all manner of relationships, etc. Combat can involve fighters knocking out each others' teeth, hacking off limbs, pulping various body parts, removing fingers and toes, and various other gruesome and potentially permanently-disfiguring actions. Never in any other game have I seen a demon go up against a kitten and be instantly killed because the kitten got lucky and managed to break its spine.

Beyond the complexity (and I'm only scratching the surface of it here, believe me) the game is just such a relaxing joy to play. It's unforgiving, yes, anyone will tell you that, but you can get a great amount of enjoyment from just watching your dwarves go about their daily lives, eating, drinking, conversing with each other, and working on projects you've given them. Additionally, there's simply so much to do, and you'll never run out of things to try. Want to dig as deep as possible and see what riches (and terrors) lie below? Go for it. Want to build a gargantuan fortress-complex that puts Erebor to shame? Awesome. Howabout making a railgun to simultaneously impale a dozen different attacking goblins? Fully possible. Conquer the world? Also doable. You'll really never get tired of this game, and if you get tired of your current fortress (assuming it doesn't collapse from your mismanagement), you can always just retire it and start a new one, with the old one still existing in the same world and you being able to interact with it.

Now, with all of that said, there are a few negative things you'll have to deal with playing Dwarf Fortress. For one, there are a considerable amount of bugs. None of them are entirely game-breaking mind you, just irritating. It's coded entirely by a team of two people, so these bugs can take a while to solve and updates come out... sparingly. Not for lack of trying of course, Zach and Tarn Adams are incredibly dedicated devs, there's just only so much two people can do in a timely fashion. Additionally, the game is very difficult to get into without the help of a myriad of tutorials. This can be a good thing if you're a fan of vertical learning curves and figuring things out through trial and error, but if you aren't, please do make use of the multitude of helpful youtube tutorials out there. They'll stop you from making rookie mistakes like getting children to haul corpses and permanently traumatizing them.

10/10 game, wonderful work Tarn and Zach, only game where I can feed my dwarves roasts made out of the brains of their own dogs and they'll like it.",1700603866,1700603866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

&
KILL THIS smelly, stuck-up, arrogant tree-fondling hippies ELVES!

----------
In forests and hills of legend and lore
There once lived a clan of the elves we abhor
Their arrogant height and their pansy decor
Were merely the first of the crimes they'd pay for!

Now these elves had a problem, a terrible plight,
They didn't know ale and they had no fist-fights,
Their lives were pale shadows, their boredom a blight,
So they went to the dwarves to deliver their spite.

For it's hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok,
The dwarves strike the earth and make love to the rock!
Blood for the Blood God, Blood for Armok!
Hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok.

Came the elves to the fortress, the mountain-home grand,
They indicted the baron; ""You've clear cut this land!
You have chopped down our brethren, you short little man,
Of course this means war, now deliver, now stand!""

When the elves were all dead, the dwarves were confused,
Who were these strange fools, so quickly abused?
""More blood for the blood god,"" the Baron's wife mused,
And they went back beneath where the hot magma oozed.

For it's hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok,
The dwarves strike the earth and make love to the rock!
Blood for the Blood God, Blood for Armok!
Hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok.

Well the dwarves kept on choppin’ that forest to stumps
And the elves’ fighting spirits were down in the dumps
They sieged once again, but were met by the pumps
While the elves’ fat was melting, the dwarves got more plump!

Back in the forest, at the elven retreat
The elves were quite puzzled by this sound defeat
“Perhaps,” said the druid, “we shouldn’t compete,
“If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em, now pass me the meat!”

For it's hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok,
The dwarves strike the earth and make love to the rock!
Oh, Blood for the Blood God, more blood for Armok!
Hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok.

In the Smooth Points of Pride, a new fortress was found,
With incredible wealth in the depths of the ground,
And the elves came to trade though they scowled and they frowned,
For the trinkets of this place were scepters and crowns.

A talc ring for berries, a goblet for cloth,
It seemed that the riches were sweet heady broth,
So the elves kept on coming, despite their great wroth,
Till the day it all ended in red bloody froth.

For it's hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok,
The dwarves strike the earth and make love to the rock!
Oh, Blood for the Blood God, more blood for Armok!
Hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok.

Spoken over bridge:
And it happened that on one day an elven noble name Lema Ceraliceyi came to this puckered sphincter of a fortress, and she looked upon the wasted jungle where the dwarves had taken the wood they so desperately needed for beds, bins, and boxes, and she was taken with a mighty rage. In her hubris she descended upon the leader of the fortress and said unto him, ""You have disrespected the trees in this area, but this is what we have come to expect from your stunted kind. Further abuse cannot be tolerated. Let this be a warning to you.""

And this so enraged the mayor of that cursed fortress that a gleam came into his eye, and he swept her a bow and shed a tear, and whispered promises to her of a new respect for nature, if only she and her gleaming brethren would return again, to trade and teach them the ways of leaf and branch. And Lema Ceraliceyi was gratified and decieved, and left in foolish confidence that her sick arboreal fetish would be welcomed here when she returned. But such was not to be...

In the following year, they brought wagons so full,
Full of berries and barrels and silk cloth and wool,
And the elves tried to trade with the elephant herders,
Who slaughtered them slowly while screaming BOATMURDERED!

For it's hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok,
The dwarves strike the earth and make love to the rock!
Oh, Blood for the Blood God, more blood for Armok!
Hey-di-lee hi, and ho-di-lee hok.",1670340060,1700601299,True,38,6,0.736995279788970947,1,True,False,False

Dwarf Fortress is a game that honestly has surprised me, while it looks like your most typical Settlement Survivor game, There's alot of interesting elements to it. Like your dwarves having their own likes/dislikes and preferences, monsters that can spawn into your world to wreak havoc, and the fact you have to dig into the earth to build your home, instead of houses on the surface.

Dwarf Fortress is something i would call a ""guide game"" because some mechanics in the game can be confusing, where you will need help to know how to handle it without feeling stuck. There is an tutorial, but it only covers the bare basics. When compared to most other survival games, Dwarf fortress requries you to get used to it's UI along with how to build objects and manage your settlement of dwarves.

I would recommend it to more expeiernced players of the genre. It's very fun once you know what you're doing.",1700598814,1700598814,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

Dwarf Fortress has depth, 100+ Z Levels, insane base building, insane character depth, even each enemy has its own history connected to the world.

Generate a world with its own history civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures gods legendary monster and characters all randomly generated  and you can customize everything during world  creation.

 Every single character has its own history and personality and you can look it all up in legends mode and see you can see the history of your world  what the characters have done in their lives how many kills they have or how they died their or relatives and so much more written history books and who currently holds a legendary artifact and where it is now is it still in his possession or did it get stolen and the cool thing is you could just go into adventure mode and take it. 

Fortress mode is kinda like rimworld but better. 

Avdenture mode is a work in progress for the steam version but its an open world roguelike it lets you control a single character you can be whatever race you want do quests explore from a party and all that. 

You are missing out if you think its too hard lol its not that bad sure even i don’t know everything but if you ever get stuck just look it up on YouTube or ask on the steam forum I did not take long for me figure things out  i never got stuck for long it has infinite replayability its insane its impossible cover everything in one little review because its way too much what i told you is just a tiny fraction of what this game can do.

Cant wait to try adventure mode on steam version.

A 4 year old fortress founded by a ragtag band of dwarves looking to strike the earth and make their own home without the oversight of the dwarven clans oppression. Everything seemed amazing and the fortress grew and expanded while flourishing greatly... until the giant cardinals arrived. The massive cardinals swooped from the skies killing animals and dwarves alike. They even went after our children. A hastily formed makeshift militia would battle them for months until they were eventually eradicated. Peace, at last. At least until the giantess showed up. At this point our militia quickly disposed of her. Unfortunately she was easy prey compared to the werebeast attacks that followed. First was the werebuffalo which we sustained heavy injuries. A scary month followed in the hospital waiting for the moon to rise once again and see if anyone would transform. None were infected. We dodged an elven arrow with that one. I guess word got out to the rest of the werebeasts though since another beast showed up. A much mighter foe. The Werehare Overlord. It took out many a dwarf before we were able to take it out and we couldn't even bury the dead before 9 of our dwarves transformed inside the hospital. Death quickly spread from there throughout the whole fortress. Miasma, disease, and death were unstoppable after that. We've lost over 60 dwarves (half our fort) now and we lose more each time they transform. No one knows who to trust. Everyone is an enemy to each other now. There is no way to contain the outbreak. We won't survive the rest of the year. All is lost. I'm walling off the fort from the inside. If anyone escapes it would mean doom to the surrounding settlements.

I tried the tutorial just to see. A tree fell on my woodcutter, killing her. This prevented the tutorial from proceeding as some functions were locked behind being able to cut down trees. FUN.

So far I have lost a fort due to an alligator killing all my starting dwarves. 
My miner and a cat have been burned by lava, an appropriate memorial slab was built for them. 
I've had a pig get into a tree somehow and could only be removed by cutting  the tree down, which killed the pig...bacon I guess. 
Giant Raccoons are stealing my stuff. 
My dogs are attacking the local animal people, their skeletons are left at the gates as a warning.

but not dwarf fortress, those kids were playing in the cropfield with a toyboat.
I sat down and the dragon finally got those 4 little buggers. I got my screen of fun and the soundtrack to go along with it.

I did watched alot of streams, tutorials and lets plays, and tought to myself, instead of starting a new world, I'll just continue the map.
But not on dwarf fortress, 2 crashes and then lava dropped from the skies and water came out of the ground. I tought I lost my mind.

Year 12 of Omenceiling. We've hidden the caged cave dragon in a hallway, and the demons come at dusk! (BUY THIS GAME!)

Update after 70 hours of gameplay:

The Charm of Hatred fell to ruin! But in 250 Fangshocks was founded in the Eternal Dimension. It is now late winter 254. A vile invasion of goblins was crushed by the Hammerwives. A clutch of child snatchers were eviscerated in the very heart of the fortress. A great magma lake at the heart of a volcano was discovered and turn to workshops fpr dwarven designs. The mountainhome granted the leader of Fangshocks a barony. Now the dwarves turn their attention inward to the deep depths!

(This is an amazing, amazing game. Just get it already!)

Update after 41 hours of gameplay:

The Charm of Hatred grows strong in the mountains! In the second year since founding, Kosoth Kuletlaltur the Weregiraffe came upon the fortress in the last night of winter. It blazed hate in its glowing red eyes, and the dwarves knew why they feared the night. But the spear dwarves held the gate and struck down the fell beast. A year later the dwarves remember this night as they drink in the tavern because the beast carried an artifact chest named Timnarzotir Osodash Sod. It is now used to store goblets in the dining hall. Strike the Earth!


Update after 29 hours of gameplay:

The new controls have been amazing for me as a person with significant arm pain. Really opened the game up to me. I have now made my most successful fort yet, halls smoothed and engraved, lavish meals, hallways with traps. I'm almost to the population trigger for an invasion. Most fun I've had in a game in a decade!

Original review:

This new Steam version is great. In the old ascii version mouse use was limited and largely through mods. This updated version has almost total mouse support. As someone who uses footpedals and pen tablets for my mouse this allows me to start playing Dwarf Fortress again. The graphics are a nice improvement as well (though I didn't mind the old tilesets, these are far easier on the eyes and brain). I worked through the short tutorial to get re-oriented and I suggest new players do the same. This game is amazing value, I look forward to playing it a ton now.

Don't get me wrong. There are aspects about this game which are awesome. It beats pretty much every similar game in terms of simulation depth and available content. However, it has one mayor downfall:

The user experience is utterly horrible.

There is simply no other way to put it: the ui of this game sucks. 
Let me give you a few examples:
A common thing one needs in management games such as this is to produce a certain good so a minimal stock is always kept. Here is how you do this in DF:
 - you open the workorder screen
 - you click on add order
 - click on the item category and choose the item
 - click on the edit button of your new workorder
 - change the shedule to recurring
 - you add a condition to the workorder
 - set the condition to be less then your required stock
You will have to do this for dozens of items! It get tedious pretty fast...

Another example:
You don't want to put certain crafters into your military? Well tough luck, you better crosscheck the military and job assignment screen, which you can't open at the same time...

Stuff like assigning people and checking up on them in general is much more tedious than in comparable games like rimworld or oni. Adding the fact that a typical fortress has around 10x as many people than these games makes it utterly horrible.

The whole UI is also very dated from a technical view. You expect to be able to change a number by clicking on it and simply typing in a new one? Like in every other software since the 90s? Nope, click a button, retype the whole number and confirm it with enter.

I really hope this changes in the future. But i also don't think it will.
Maybe the developer should just expose everything with an API and let the community solve the problem. But in the current state i have to recommend against buying this game.

- go into steam, install dfhack.. it's free.  then NEVER EVER play this game vanilla.

Ignoring the QOLs that dfhack brings, which is a requirement to make this game fun IMHO.  It also helps with  performance issues.. later on, in your dwarfly journey.

Beyond dfhack (which is a requirement as far as I'm concerned), modding the game adds a ton of great fun too.    Why play as dwarves, when you can play as goblins?  or how about Nagas?  Don't like war dogs, how about wargs?   Dwarf Fortress has some pretty awesome modders, so once you've played the game Vanilla(and by vanilla I mean dfhack + dwarfortress).

There's always progression in a proper video game, which is usually a two-step progress. There's the point where you don’t know enough about the game, and then there's the point where you do and you start to really have fun. This game decided to add a third step, the “russian roulette” step. In this step, no matter how well you play, the game will inevitably throw an unbeatable element randomly into your playthrough, and you will lose hours of work. Is losing still fun if I have a giant hole in my head?
 
This is not Dwarf Fortress. A setting like “dwarf fortress” implies that there's going to be a mystical element to it, where the player can harness this magic to their advantage and win. A better name and setting for this game would be “Lord of Flies on Jurassic Park”. The emphasis of this game is realism, and realistically, a group of toddlers don't stand a chance against a primordial race of all-seeing dinosaurs, out to fulfill their prophecy of annihilation.

I've played quite a bit of this game, so there's obviously plenty to enjoy. But the simple truth is, I don't like playing a game that has a lengthy gameplay loop, that then decides to dangle this process on a tightrope. At least with other survival management games, if you make a mistake, it's immediately game over, but here it's still game over, except you die a very slow death.

- Constantly trying to figure out how to do X or Y, and opening Google, and most of the time not even figuring out, or having to do complex work-around that cost you more time.
- The UI doesn't make sense and is overall very poor, which is a deadly combo with the first issue mentioned above, you can't even see your current game-speed anywhere, in a world simulator, a game that has hotkeys to quickly slow down or speed up, they didn't bother to add a single text value anywhere to show the current speed state. I would be surprised if a journalist beated the tutorial, I did, after clicking all the buttons, basically playing a hide&seek with what you want to do.
- Have to worry about too many things that you cannot even wrap your head around. The population is unhappy because of ""dreams"" or thousands of activities/stuffs that each dwarves wants to have/do, while in theory it sounds nice, it would probably have been better if the game introduced more depth slowly, but surely, the more you play, with new mechanics appearing one by one. No matter how much you dive into the game's core, the core is shallow, none of those mechanics is polished. It's like the developers wanted to make the game that had the most mechanics out of all games ever, that's all. Not user-friendly, not made to be fun, nor to be polished or good-looking, just made because they could. But since the devs knows every corners of the game, I'm sure they have a blast with it.

Might buy this game again in a few years if it becomes more player-friendly, gets a UI revamp, and is less of a micro-manager (at least, gets more automation). But at its current state, just no. I have no idea who can like this extreme of micro-management, but I'm sure those people will have a blast if a DLC comes out allowing to manage every atoms of the entire world at each frames, this is how it feels like.

Disappointed of my experience, but perhaps it's just a me situation. There is some interesting concepts, but almost 30$ as price-tag for something that could've came out in 2008, I recommend keeping this game in your radar for a sale or for it to be more polished, or to be prepared for a brainf--k.

the soundtrack is very well done, tavern and invader theme's being my personal favorites, but the loss of the original track as well as the new art style doesnt 'feel' like dwarf fortress to me. in the future, hopefully this art style is what df will be remembered as, and thats cool if tarn is okay with that, but to me dwarf fortress will always be represented by that little ASCII smiley face",1670364524,1699331404,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The difficulty comes from gaining game knowledge. This is fun when you realize you truly learned a specific system, but very frustrating when it's ""how do I even do X"", ""why is everyone dying""
The Steam version is well worth it. Mods and especially DFHack smooth over many problems.
Personally wish existing systems were developed further instead of the current magic and villainy goals.

If you play this without reading the wiki - you are doing it wrong

if you play this without engaging the community and learning from other players - shame on you

if you complain that the game is too complex - go watch the IGN review. The games complexity is entirely necessary and merited.

THIS IS THE MOST COMPLICATED PC GAME TO EVER EXIST
some don't even call it a game. some call it a fantasy world simulator. 

this is not for casuals. this is not for children. it will put hair on your chest. it can be played infinitely and never stops being expanded. it has been under production for almost 20 years. The only objective is to make your own fun in the ultimate sandbox, make anything you want. mod it up, give it time, it will grow on you.

If you find yourself frustrated, go watch kruggsmash on YT or blindIRL on twitch. they will soothe your frustration. if you find yourself disheartened, take a break and read the wiki. if you need inspiration, go watch someone breach the underworld. 

I just watched 200 dwarves clad in iron go to war with a bronze colossus, only to become a mangled mountain of corpses at the base of our fort. The only survivor is a human poet downing what he can of our seventeen thousand barrels of ale before the inevitable ghosts of 200 dead dwarves haunt him to death. every 5 minutes another duke shows up to retake the fort and gets smeared along the mountainside by the colossus. 

I could have put that colossus in a cage and made it an amusement sensation for the dwarves to throw rocks at and use for target practice

I could have used a cunning plan to trap that colossus in a room below ground which incoming sieges would wander into, turning it into my personal security

I could have used all that iron to pump lava up from the great magma sea, creating a lava moat which the colossus would fall into and melt

i chose to arm every dwarf and throw them at it because I didn't like how un-optimal my crafting setup was. 

what will you do when a hydra wanders into your fort? what will you do when an UNDEAD hydra wanders into your fort? when the elves wage war against you for cutting down trees? there are a million ways to go at any scenario, from technology, to manpower, to playing god. 

contrary to popular belief, this game does have multiplayer. it is called ""sending your save to someone else and letting them play it"". only top tier players do this, are you a top tier dwarf fortress player?

How do you win this game? you win by spending a thousand hours on it, and making sure every one of those hours was enjoyable. This game is not for everyone, but it is certainly for gits like me who like a good adventure. If you make it into the hall of legends, you win forever. if you mine adamantine, fun is incoming. give it a try, give it a break, give it a second chance, and you will find happiness.

And then, another beast arrives. I dispatch my soldiers as usual, and they get killed one by one. The beast then climbs the stairs of my fortress, killing everyone in it's path. My population starts falling. At the same time, my fortress is attacked by fishermen. Meanwhile, the beast reaches the main floor of my fortress , still killing everyone. The population is now 1. Lo and behold, Mudi Gisepuki, Human maceman of 80 years old attacks fight the beast and vanquishes it. He gets sensory nerves damages and loses the ability to stand and slowly dies in the tavern....Two fishermen arrives and attack him but the mighty Mudi kills them without even standing.

After a while, he can stand up again ! He starts walking and goes...to the kitchen to grab something to eat. He then loses consciousness, the end is near...But no, he regains consciousness !

He now spends his days in the temple, praying and being haunted by a fallen comrade. He takes a break from time to time to go grab a plump helmet beer which makes him euphoric and goes back to the temple. On his way, he walks past his fallen comrades corpses, and doesn't feel anything anymore. Some visitors often come to the fortress and Mudi feels satisfied discussing his problems with them.

After a while, another army of fishermen attacked and managed to kill him.

Mudi Gisepuki, the Human maceman and monster slayer was 80 years old, had 2 lovers and 11 children. He valued tranquility and knowledge.

Everything that can be proc genned is for example dwarfs have physical differences, memories, moods, likes and dislikes. It's the original colony sim, with legends mode and logs you can see everything involving all of the 1-10000 years of history. 

It's worth the price of purchase on steam for the fact that the controls are streamlined alone, I was very much against the fact that they changed everything and introduced mouse controls, but that was silly, it's become perfection enabling more players to find it accessible as well as making it easier on veterans. 
 
Worlds:
Every world has it's own procedurally generated history, and landscape. Viewable with a legends mode before you embark on your adventure. You can choose where to place your fort, making it upto you how hard or easy you want the game to be, despite this you will eventually lose.

Dwarfs:
Dwarfs have their own feelings, memories, history, likes and dislikes, physical traits, and ailments. You can direct dwarfs but you don't have control over them directly. For example, the amount of fingers and toes each dwarf has is taken note of and tracked in this game. 

Fortress mode:
The current release only has fortress mode, you chose where to embark after you create a world with it's very own original landscape and history, you take 7 dwarfs who are all randomly generated with their own things going on, as described above, and you point them in a direction on what to do, but you don't directly control them in the end. As you build up your fort you'll meet other races, monster slayers, traders, etc, bringing their own personalities and traits to you. You will get migrants (I recommend capping total migrants at 180, cause after 200 even the best cpu to date will chug) that will arrive adding to the number of dwarfs and people in your fort(monster slayers can reside if you have an inn and tavern; and will not necessarily but can be dwarfs). You will lose, that is part of the fun, you get to start a new world with a new history and new dwarfs on the next run. 

The updated from original game:
Tileset, very nice, with workshop you can customize as you please. 
Ease of access, the game is extremely easy to get into now in my opinion, with the ease of controls and mouse support you'll be at home after reading the wiki some.
The game feels like it runs better than it did back in the day. 

What to look forward to:
Adventure mode: 
You can make a new world or enter the one you built and retired your fort in, and run around the world doing quests, making trouble, whatever you so choose, as virtually whatever you choose. For example: Back in the day I played a Spider-man grappler, well as a spider man you walk with two legs, and have six free ones, and i proceeded to grab some civilian in a human village by the jaw and rip out their teeth one by one and throw them at passerbys. You can even visit your fort!

This game even without adventure mode as it is, is the only game I think I could play for the rest of my life. It's a 10/10 even without adventure mode, with adventure mode(coming out in 2024), it can even surpass it. It's absolutely worth the full price cost, it never tires.

Incredibly detailed, complexity beyond reason, and it's only really half-way done. I cannot overstate how influential this project is, or how many amazing stories have come about because of it. This piece of art is a masterclass in dedication to a single project, to unfettered vision, to a game with nearly no boundaries. It's timeless, it's classic, it's beyond its time, it is Dwarf Fortress.

I remember a time way back before this release, in a fort that had been doing very well. At one point a caravan showed up along with a raiding party of goblins shortly after. The merchants understandably fled for their lives, leaving their entire stock at our fort. After dealing with the goblins, we took in everything they left in order to clean out the trade depot and fill our coffers a little more. It wasn't long after that incident that, out of nowhere, dwarfs started dropping dead. Not being killed, not being sick, not going mad. I'm talking young and healthy dwarfs just dropping dead in a hallway or a room, with no sign of struggle and no reports of combat. I was baffled, nothing like this had happened to my forts previously. Once several of them had dropped dead, I paused the game to do a deep dive on literally everything we had in the fort. Was it deadly dust? Some kind of contagious syndrome? But the more I looked, the less it made sense. I eventually gave up after a couple hours of looking, but the incidents kept happening.

I got fortunate enough to catch one of these dwarfs in the act of dying. Terrible for certain, but an invaluable piece in this deadly puzzle. The only signs? Paralysis, asphyxiation, and an empty cup. It still made no sense, but with the cup nearby this dwarf who was now doomed to die, I decided to check the drink stocks on the off chance they were drinking something harmful.

Turns out that caravan had left an entire barrel of snake venom, and my dwarfs hadn't distinguished it from their other drinks, so in the stockpile it went. To say I was stunned is an understatement. At least 9 dwarfs died to this negligence.

This game is incredibly addicting and you will find yourself playing from when you wake up, not realize how much time passed between making your first fort and it dying, and now it's night IRL and you can't remember eating.

If I were to pick a game to play for the rest of my life, it would be this game because of the fact that it has layers upon layers of systems built upon one another where you could play for years and still have systems to learn.

Does this game have a unforgiving learning curve? Very much so, though it mellows out once you learn how to survive initially.
Do I recommend this game? 100% worth every penny.

Personally I'm not a huge fan of the new tileset but it's objectively fine. My main issue is with the new UI basically forcing you to play mainly with mouse and it feels no much slower and less fluid than the old keyboard shortcuts. I know there are still shortcuts but they feel like such an afterthought with very little support.

Its about enjoying it, having fun.
Dwarf Fortress is not about developing skills, I found this the hard way. Dwarf Fortress is about finding stories, funny living beings and getting interested on what will they develop.
If you can manage to like ASCII graphics, the earlier versions are still available on Bay12 but buying the game will not be about ""getting a copy"", buying is endorsing Tarn and Zach passion project.
The game is a pure sandbox, you get your 7 dwarves at the start and then everything else is up to you. A failure is never a fail state like in many other games and there is no incentive to continue playing if you are not having fun.
In such case you can just save, go back to the main menu and generate a new world. If you want to play on the same world, retire the fortress and start a new one on the same world.

Its a forever game were you play without pressure, were you can savour it, enjoy it. There are no mechanics like DF-inspired games that force you to end your gameplay (Rimworld spaceship, archotech vaults and so on), you can play this game forever.
And this is how I got 1.034.00 hours of this game, just playing nice and slow. Spending lots of hours reading Legends, characters personalities and beliefs, Giant Sponges and Kakapos personalities and their views on commerce, morality and so on.

It's fun, its a game that takes you out of the current system were games are MADE to be enjoyed for X ammount of time.

They're not wispy tree hugging elves. They're drunk craftsmen and women who go insane after failing an attempt at a masterwork because there was no precious gems to hand to work into their piece and then go on a killing spree until they christen their achievement (or lack thereof) with the blood of their comrades, family and loved ones.

More practically, since this is meant to be a review, it's dense, it's heady, the learning curve is almost akin to getting a degree in college but all of that contributes to emergent stories that are hard to replicate in any other medium.

The best advice I can give anyone starting this game if the interest takes them, is to forget about success or even being good at the game. Just start a fortress and wing it, see what happens. When people say losing is fun it's because the stories that happen are basically impossible to repeat in any other game. 

The random generation can make things seem dry or obtuse since it seems to make little sense but most of the time when you dig down through the various menus they make more sense. Sometimes it is just drivel because that is what systems generating things randomly do but you'll get hilarious, tragic and heroic stories endlessly. A quick browser search will direct you to famous (infamous) stories of people's forts and histories created by playing this game. If you don't like reading, there's channels who make videos out of them on youtube.

You could get lost potentially in a generated world's lore alone just in legends mode (a history browser with category tabs for your generated world) for hours.

Compared to other games of the genre, it definitely doesn't look and feel as smooth and responsive especially since it's entities snapping around instead of smooth movement and such (The game's framerate also isn't very smooth a lot of the time but you really don't need the frames tbh. Especially when the graphics are like this.)

If you can sink your teeth into it, you're in for probably the richest experience in the genre. Hard to get into, and harder to master -- a sea of depth and replayability could keep you playing for a long, long time.

With tutorials and the steam release for nicer graphics -- being a newcomer has never been easier. To be honest, even with a short tutorial and the game helping you out with tips involving subjects you may bring up in the UI -- I recommend watching some DF tutorials online. The game is brutal and will be VERY brutal 'n confusing if you don't get a grasp of the basics. I recommend watching at least a couple videos of ""Dwarf Fortress: A Beginner's Guide & Tutorial"" on youtube. Definitely helped make the game less of a headache. That is to say, you won't master everything quickly. However, the game will throw you curveballs left & right -- with how much of a threat the DF world can be, expect difficulty and ""Fun"" as this community calls it. 

Losing & small failures definitely have their merit in games like these -- since the game is a good engine to weave stories in your head should you let them in. The world feels alive, and sometimes you'll see changes to the generated world itself as time goes on. It isn't a stagnant point where you get dropped off in the present and nothing ever happens.

At this current point in time (3/4/2023), Adventure Mode is not out yet for the steam release. Adventure Mode alone is worth a buy, let alone the standard game. Can't wait til that gets out -- but I assume It will be quite a stretch of time before that becomes a thing.

I haven't noticed any yet but do expect bugs as well -- afaik It's a buggy game sometimes since it's conception and I'll probably experience it as I master more things about this game and notice things are off. 

So long story short, It's rough 'n rugged but extremely rich at it's core. It being rugged also gives it charm. You're managing dwarves. Strong alcoholic little midgets. The soundtrack is also fantastic and gives the game atmosphere along with some ambient sounds sometimes, clinking or woodwork etc.

If you're unsure -- pick it up at a sale if It ever goes on it. Or maybe watch some videos. It's a little hard to break into for a lot of people including myself but I'm glad I did.

EDIT: 10/13/2023: Logs have been fixed & organized by many tabs which makes this game a LOT more enjoyable and readable. Multithreading has been added which boosts performance a sizeable amount (looked like 20-25% or more iirc). Anything will help when your fortress has a LOT of entities later on. Still eagerly waiting adventure mode -- whenever that gets added I'll most likely return to this game a whole lot more often. Replayability is already ridiculously high, so that'll only add onto it.

DO BUY DWARF FORTRESS IF... 

    (1)  you enjoy babysitting psychotic, alcoholic toddlers who love fighting each other and swigging plump helmet beer
    (2) you enjoy managing individuals have autistic focus on craftsmanship, digging holes, and reclaiming missing socks
    (3) you find humor in combat systems where dwarves who lose or break their weapons start headbutting and biting Forgotten Beasts
    (4) you are fascinated by geology, randomized world-building, and surprising emergent behavior
    (5) you are perpetually compulsive about what lies below in the next layer of dirt.
    (6) you are okay with the understanding that you can't control all your dwarves. They have minds of their own, and only do what you want them to do 70% of the time.
    (7) You are detail-oriented and enjoy pausing the game and (for fun!) flipping through stats, historical notes, and background information and other details for hours at a time.

DO NOT BUY IT IF....
    (1) You like clean, efficient interfaces to control game features. The game is much faster if you memorize keyboard shortcuts and learn where the dozens of submenus. It's a pretty opaque control system at first.
    (2) You like clear plotlines and goals. This is really more of a simulation than a game in the traditional sense, more akin to SimCity in that regard or the Sims.
   (3) You are the sort of Jenga player who gets frustrated when the Jenga pile gets more and more unstable. This game is a study in systems going out of control and crashing catastrophically, undoing what you spent hours laboriously building. You are never quite sure when a hole in your defenses will allow a Forgotten Beast to start a murderfest inside your fort, or when the emotionally unstable dude with the ax is going to lose it and start whacking dwarf children of his neighbors.
    (4) You like supermodern graphics and special effects. This game was originally run with ASCII code symbols and later on tile sets and only now has started getting what looks like 16 bit graphics. It is intentionally old-school and meant to exercise your imagination.
    (5) You like your games polished and finished. This one has been in construction for literally decades, and there are tons of ""placeholder"" features that are visible, but not yet fleshed out.

So far, it is not yet a ""Yes"" by paid game standards. 

There was a lot of work done, and some of the long-awaited elements. like proper mouse controls, building without pause and scaling graphics. Now your eyes do not bleed out. But it is 2022 ending, not 2002... Rimworld raised the bar, and it is hard to impress with procedural generation of world or text nowadays.
If you played it before and know mechanics, or you did all you could in ""Oxygen not included"" or ""Factorio"" you might want to support the team. 
If you are more casual gamer - wait for updates and changes.

There are many UI, UX issues and balance issues.
You may have multiple windows with dwarf names opened, but you may interact only with some of them.
You may spend a long time (5 to 15 minutes) assembling your squad of dwarf, but the ""Disband squad"" button is placed next to ""Cancel active order"", and this is a recipe for disaster.
Your dwarf may be stuck in a walled-off place, and you have no way of ordering him to disassemble the wall he built in first place.
Placed furniture may become invisible, unusable and a block.

Mechanics are explained poorly or not at all.
Explanation video ""how to build a well"" lasting 7 minutes WITHOUT a voiceover OR text from a developer?
Look up ""xkcd learning curve dwarf fortress"". Sadly, it is still accurate.

From an outsider`s point of view support of modders is lacking. 
Dwarf Therapist is still much needed and it is not available, and progress boils down to backwards engineering.

The negatives: the new mouse based controls are a total headache, i am still constantly mashing keyboard keys out of instinct only to remember those no longer work and you now have to use these slow, clunky mouse menus to get anything done.  The biggest gripe i have is the profession assignment menu.  I would have thought, since they're trying to make an entirely new version of the game, they would have just incorporated something like Dwarf Therapist directly into the game, as that was like the number 1 issue with the old version.  It was just a well known fact the game isn't playable without dwarf therapist.  But nope, not only did they incorporate this confusing, complicated, and poorly functioning dwarf profession menu, but now Dwarf Therapist won't even work on the steam version of the game.  So...sorry, but if i can't use that, then this game just isn't playable.  

But I can't help but question why they even bothered to make the steam version.  Because it doesn't seem like they tried to take the game in any different direction, or add any improvements.  At the end of the day, at it's core, this is just regular old Dwarf Fortress, albeit a much poorly functioning form of the game.

I was hopeful that $15+ million in revenue would be enough to fix this, but development still moves at a snail's pace a year after release [/b]

Game breaking bugs, crashes, core features being removed, unsortable randomized lists, convoluted menus, lack of search bars, and complicated ways to achieve simple tasks even compared to the free ASCII version of this game plague the “premium version” of an otherwise unparalleled base building & storytelling game

[b]Improvements vs 47.05:[/b]
+ Information HUD is very descriptive 
+ Game comes with a tileset 
+ Good soundtrack
+ Minimap

[b]Game Breaking Issues: [/b]
- Game occasionally crashes while autosaving
- Forts get corrupted and can't be loaded anymore, even if you load older saves 
- Mood debuffs - Dwarves in the same room, even meeting areas and dining halls, don't socialize properly, leading to a permanent, Unmet Need: Socialize, be with family, etc
- Military System - I’ll give Tarn credit for publicly stating he doesn't like the way it came out, however it is still an absolute mess and should just be reverted 
- Dwarves will inconsistently ignore equipment (pro-tip: Make sure you have dedicated armor & weapons stockpiles with refuse disabled in them)
- Custom uniforms are bugged (pro-tip: create your custom uniforms on a “dummy” squad where it will remain bugged, and then set it on the squads you actually care about)
	- In some saves, none of this advice will work, and you must individually set equipment for each dwarf in your military to get them to equip anything

[b]Removed features:[/b]
- Hotkeys being displayed next to buttons
- Civilian Alerts
- Stockpile Priority Settings
- Ability to set ranged ammo type
- Ability to see combat logs after you dismiss them
- Health Screen with overview of all dwarves' health
- Backpacks don’t have their own UI anymore
- Multi-Z level burrows must be drawn one Z-layer at a time
- Graveyards - tombs must be drawn as 1x1 squares over coffins one at a time, requiring hundreds of clicks (create, start selection, end selection, accept)
- Legends mode no longer has a map
- Adventure Mode (coming soon™)

[b]UI:[/b]
- Alert System lacks notification sounds, doesn't pause on most events (make sure to download alert sounds from the workshop)
- Since the game doesn't pause for most alerts, you often won't realize a fight has occurred until you find piles of corpses a few days after a fight
- Selection screens often include unsortable, uncategorized, and randomized lists of every item in your fort, requiring scrolling through tens of thousands of items
- Item selection screens will often be long, randomized, or unsortable lists of every item in your fortress.
- Lists with categories often have weird classifications of items, for instance, rock pots full of wine are considered, ""tools""
- Search bar isn't present in half the places you'd expect it - Scrolling though tens of thousands of items with no search bar is not fun
- Work orders screen lacks search bar, move to top, sort function, grouping, and copy/paste

[b]Needs Improvement:[/b]
- Half the menus lack a search and sort function - scrolling through thousands of items feels unnecessary 
- Game is still single threaded, despite being the perfect example for a game that should be multi-threaded, and you can feel it in the lag
- Zero graphics optimization, will peg even strong GPUs at over 95% and still not run smoothly
- Equipping items is a bloody mess
- Burrow system doesn't immediately make dwarves retreat, often they will continue doing tasks for several days after assigned to a burrow
- Burrow system isn't strict enough - Dwarves can take days to enter burrows, will randomly leave unless you physically trap them
- Cannot prioritize buildings
- No “tiles selected” numerical readout to assist in building, designing, must count tiles individually
- Worldgen seeds (ex: awa5ta4weywa4ta36taw6a6t4) must be typed manually - just why?
- Embark screen has precisely two zoom levels, no favorite system like old DF, no coordinate system, and lags like hell if you try to click and drag while zoomed in",1671074684,1696307460,False,6,3,0.367908954620361328,0,True,False,False

I bought this game on the hype last year. It's a great concept and I played it hard for a month or three until the bugs and poor implementation made more frustration than joy. My previous 7/10 review was predicated on the Devs making the hard course corrections they were started on, but now a year after purchase, it's still the exact same buggy mess it was a year ago. If you have money to burn and are curious about what one mediocre programmer can do with 20 years, and want to see what would have been cool in 1985 buy the game. But if you are looking for a fun game that works correctly, anywhere near modern standards, this is definitely not it.

I'll give it another 20 years, and if I'm still alive by then I'll update my review- if there are any changes.




 I'm a tough reviewer. Let's start there. It's 2023 and I expect a certain level of quality in modern games. I also try lots of Early Access games, so I'm kind of jaded to small studios presenting their EA game, then poofing without finishing the project. 
    So it was with great trepidation that I dropped the $30 on Dwarf Fortress. But this tiny dev team has been quietly beavering away under a bridge somewhere for 20 years for close to free. And the reviews were all positive, and resource management/ mine stuff to dig with, dig stuff to mine with' games are my jam. I LOVE Factorio, it's my Gold Standard for EA games that kept polishing until they hit greatness. So I dropped the coin just before the Holidays.
     Since then I have lost 6 inches on my height, I can't shave my beard fast enough and I've taken on a mysterious predilection for short, hairy women- and honey mead.
    Seriously, this is a terrific game. If you like this kind of game, you'll like this. Totally playable. Very complete. Extremely addicting. It's a simple, 2D isometric map- with more going on under the hood than the Millenium Falcon for depth and complexity that will keep your interest. 
    You have my two thumbs up. 
    That said, now the tough part of my review....
    It's a terrific game, with the potential for greatness, buuuut... that tiny dev team just doesn't have the manpower- yet. 
    This is already changing. All that sweet Steam money, including my $30 helps. They've brought on two more folks, and their road map is interesting and ambitious. 
    Changes are coming, but they are not here yet. Some really fundamental QoL features are missing (one obvious example- no hyperlinks to your Dwarfs (Dorfs) character sheets, and no scrolling between them, makes assigning tasks or military units tougher than it should be), along with some features that seem pretty necessary but are not even on the radar, like a side/ elevation view. It's a game about digging deep, with no way to see how deep you've dug. And no blueprints, so you are manually drawing everything, every time. And no, the macros don't count. This isn't 1986. Cut and paste is a thing now. But not in Dwarf Fortress.
    Part of this is the origin of the game. It was pretty esoteric before the pretty tileset came along with the premium version. That kept the fanbase pretty small, tight, and loyal. But opening the game up to the larger gaming community took away that immunity.  Now they are a fish in a pool full of photo realistic, 3D games, and gamers who have come to expect what they have already seen 100 times - even from tiny dev teams.  Seeing a sideview of the old text based graphics wouldn't have looked cool. But seeing my fortress from the side is what I would consider a basic and fundamental feature.
    So in it's current format, I give the game a strong 7/10, with the likelihood of that going up into the 9's if they can pivot their focus to appeal to a wider gaming audience. The deep geekery is what made this game so interesting in the first place. Credit where due. This game has layers of layers built into it's layers. Its a remarkable achievement, unlike any other game I've played, but also just the sort of game I love. But I believe they need to continue the course correction they started when they decided to make a pretty tileset. To appeal to the widest audience they need a bit more QoL and a bit more bling. The depth is already there.
   I look forward to upgrading to an 8 or 9 as the game progresses. No game has ever scored a ten, though Factorio is a 9.9. Dwarf Fortress has the same potential.",1673619786,1696160352,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I don't think all the things people like to say about this being 'one of the most complex games ever' are really useful in describing it. It's fairly simple once you figure out the mechanics of getting your dwarves to survive. It's just a sandbox with *lots* of mechanics you can interface with, and many you can't.
But, being a sandbox, once you get your economy up and running, the gameplay is highly self-driven; the game deploys ever-greater challenges to the survival of your fortress, but not much in the way of objectives. This means you have to create your own goals, which is something I have difficulty consistently doing.

Basically, Dwarf Fortress is the Seinfeld of survival strategy games: it defined the basic tropes and expectations of its genre, but didn't evolve along with the conventions that the games it inspired established, leaving it looking extremely antique; milquetoast even: that same stifling pit of generic identity that Metroid and Pokemon find themselves in at the bottom of their own genres. It's best recognized as Minecraft's grandfather, and Minecraft itself is now a great-grandfather of games who do what this game does in more refined, directed, accessible, and stylish ways. And sure, in those games you don't get the chance of it generating step by step descriptors of a minotaur smashing through your patrol dwarves like cardboard only to have its eyes clawed out by someone's pet cat who happened to be on a tree right above it (true story) but the unabridged verbosity of those descriptions is ROUGH and it takes some serious effort to dig through them to find those gems.

For a game whose coremost conceit is taking direct control entirely away from the player, relying on the AI characters to follow (extremely vague) orders, the AI is continuously unreliable and buggy. Lack of functions to abort most tasks, retreat from combat, or otherwise stop the dwarves from killing themselves is simply bewildering. 
The game's near complete lack of displayed information (most notably, the resources required to craft anything are nowhere to be seen) will leave you constantly wondering if you're experiencing a bug or if you've not yet discovered an obscure and vaguely labeled sub-sub-menu you just have to toggle a check box in to keep your dwarves from diving off a waterfall to their death, stabbing their allies, refusing to build something vital to their survival because an easily movable pebble is in the way, jumping into a horde of demons to gather mushrooms despite a standing shelter in place order, or a hundred other bizarre behaviors that despite their unpredictability are also monotonous in their frequency.
Also, due to the lack of functional description combined with heaps of truly obscure background mechanics, checking the wiki while playing never stops being absolutely essential. Hope you're not trying to play on a single monitor or on Steam Deck. 

Reading the flavor text does result in some truly unique stories, but they're mostly irrelevant to the moment to moment gameplay and increasingly not worth the frustration of the game's total lack of now-genre-standard UI conventions. Its directionless feature-creep has resulted in a world a mile wide and an inch deep. My admiration for the amount of dedication and effort that the creators have poured into it is rapidly waning as that effort drags it farther and farther from being a game that you PLAY, and into being a game that you RESEARCH. Merely being able to survive in it, on the easiest settings, with some sense of basic competence is an achievement worth bragging rights.",1695100260,1695870361,False,12,3,0.419758111238479614,5,True,False,False

Pro's+
neat concept and large world generation with huge potential

Cons+
Doors DO NOT WORK AS DOORS this means every single enemy and wild hostile animal will walk to the door, open it, walk through it and then close it behind them. The doors only have two states of everything goes through and nothing goes through making them nigh useless

UI is completely glitched and broken causing things like search bars in manufacturing menus not actually registering typing and instead activating the MANY hot keys in this game sending you on a ""lovely"" journey into something completely unrelated

UI does NOT arrange MOST things in alphabetical order so having say 200+ names to search through for a specific task is just as fun as it sounds. There are no options to accomplish this either in most menus or even separate, filter out or streamline your archaic search through the lists of many, many things and items.

UI controls are minimum with no tooltips, descriptors or information informing the player as to what they are seeing and how it relates to their current task or icon.

Tamed animals almost dont listen to the zoning and i mean that they will stray very far and outside of the pasture zone and since doors cant be doors, there are no way to wall or fence livestock in reliably 

extremely minimum controls on the dwarfs which can be frustrating when you need them to do a specific task at a specific time

no smart building so dwarfs will build themselves into walls and create holly walls

construction auto-suspends at times for seemingly no reason and will not automatically start back up until the player manually resumes it

enemies in wild areas consist of animals and giant bugs which is fine. having a minimum number of at least 3 that must be on the map at all times and have these enemies auto-set to go into the player base and kill once the player's base hits a certain size is ridiculous and the epitome of not fine. Which is how this game operates. This combined with the previously mentioned ""doors not being doors"" problem leads to extremely and constant anoying deaths

alerts make no sound, do not auto focus the player on things like combat and are barely useful. If an alert is on a specific dwarf for a specific purpose for instance, the alert system only keeps the location of that ping at that moment which means it doesnt follow that dwarf so once you see and select the alert, it brings you to a completely empty or useless area.

Alerts are spammed for near everything and most of it is useless and combined with alerts not really alerting the player very well as they go unnoticed they tend to just spam the left side of the screen with numerous small icons that are all equally uninformative as they are not pertinent.

combat control menu and ui are very poorly done, clumsy, not responsive and half the time half the squad is running around doing other things.
that is to say for example:
enemy giant squirrels (which are deadly) are approaching as they are set to auto-path into the center of my base and kill things.
send squad of men to attack.
squad of men will begin to arm themselves then some will stop then they will got to attack then half will walk back and do other things halving the strength of the attack right then and there.

When dwarfs begin an attack and the enemy is kite, dwarfs will continue to attack a constantly fleeing wild animal sometimes until the dwarf dies of starvation or dehydration and there is little to nothing to stop them due to the lack of specific control.

this game really had great promise but the most basic and common interaction points and UI points are extremely broken, unfinished or just poorly thought out and executed. 
Also the tutorial is broken and will soft lock so dont do it.....",1695850371,1695850546,False,11,5,0.449992060661315918,2,True,False,False

It was described to me as a colony simulator - the first colony simulator, in fact, the one that founded the genre. Apparently it randomly generated a fantasy world, and your job was to help a bunch of dwarfs build a settlement and thrive. 

I was immediately intrigued by the notion, but one look at the interface and I was turned off just as fast. The arcane ASCII graphics and clunky keyboard controls were utterly inaccessible. I saw a bunch of squiggles. I was assured by my guide that I was looking at the throne room of his fortress. “How can you tell?” I asked. “You just learn how to read it” was the reply. Hmm…no thanks. 

But Dwarf Fortress remained on the periphery of my awareness, occasionally revealing a glimpse of the compelling madness it contains. Like many others, I devoured the tale of Boatmurdered and other similar playthrough write-ups. Stories of artifacts, demons, disasters - and above all, the fall of fortresses, the many failures, the tragic deaths both noble and ignoble.

At last, the wall has come down. The Steam release of Dwarf Fortress has made it compatible with the human brain at last, and that has let me and many others finally see what all the fuss has been about. What I’ve discovered is that Dwarf Fortress may be the most impressive piece of software I’ve ever encountered. The legends were accurate.

It is, however, something of a shock to the system. To call it a colony simulator is to sell it short. To call it a fantasy world simulator is more accurate, but undersells it. Tarn and Zach Adams have been working on Dwarf Fortress for over 20 years, and in many ways they have transcended the limitations of the form, elevating their life’s work to something more than a game, something that is more accurately interpreted through the lens of outsider art.

This makes it hard to play. Indeed, as a simulation first and foremost, you are less ‘playing a game’ and more ‘running a sim’. Your ability to control your dwarves and develop your environment is very hands-off, following strict rules that interact in highly complex ways. It cannot be overstated how much playtime is spent wondering how to do something, followed by many hours trying to puzzle out the solution with the wiki and guides. There’s still a barrier for entry here, and it’s the enormous learning curve and deeply convoluted UI.

Luckily, and as they say, losing is fun. Triumph doesn’t come without tragedy, and with the amount of times you will try something new and fail horribly, tragedy is never far away. Without a definitive ‘end goal’, the tension that arises from experimentation is the main gameplay loop. You set out, play until things fall into chaos, and repeat. Perfectionists will be deeply frustrated - it is essential to embrace the lack of control to some degree.

Ultimately, Dwarf Fortress is software that creates a world and then writes stories in it. Learning its byzantine ways will allow you to write alongside it and take ownership of the story in a way that is incredibly moving. My fisherdwarf was ambushed outside the fortress by goblins and stabbed beyond hope of recovery. In his final moments, he dragged himself to the nearby wall and engraved an image of his god. That moment took both me and the game to create, and it’ll stay with me for a very long time. Dwarf Fortress overflows with opportunities for such creation. Operating it is art as much as science.

And there’s still more to come! Adventure mode hasn’t been ported to Steam yet, and that promises a whole new way to explore the worlds of Dwarf Fortress and tell these incredible stories. Plus, as a living project, it will be receiving constant development and improvements indefinitely - if they’ve put in over twenty years already, it seems like a safe bet that they’ll keep going.

Those who are willing to take on the challenge and get through the learning curve will have an utterly fascinating time doing so. I dreamed of fortress design for a fortnight straight.

I tried the game with ASCII years ago and couldn't get into it but the new GUI makes it a pleasure to play. There is a fully formed game already here but there is also immense potential and I'm looking forward to how the game continues to grow and change over time.

I compare this to RimWorld which I played first, and to be honest I enjoy Dwarf Fortress more. RimWorld seems to be cycle of build raid, build raid while Dwarf Fortress feels like feels more organic. Yes there are raids and attacks, but they're varied including forgotten beasts and goblin sieges, random fauna and even the undead in some biomes or worse if you go really deep. The Z-levels also make a huge difference - the playmap is vast and you can make complex multi-level fortresses with 100 dwarves+.

A resident necromancer (that I didn't know how to deal with) confronted this monster and subsequently raised all the fresh corpses in my fortress.

My fortress has rebounded, but many dwarves remain traumatized from the event. The military, conscripted from the few civilians that remained are hardened souls unfazed by death, but this serves them well in the frequent clashes with local goblins. Several of the raised undead were blessed with sapience and remain valuable residents, fishing and mining alongside their mortal brethren. Meanwhile, construction on a bridge of marble and porcelain has recommenced, successfully linking two continents together.

Very fun game that can be played in a lot of ways. Gives lots of freedom, great community, and is very in depth about everything for a colony sim or any game in general. The procedural generation of every world, every creature, every event, and every civilization allows you to look into each worlds past and legends, while making your own. The expansive caverns and goals are great to look forward too and major progression is very satisfying. The game has a very steep learning cliff resulting in a need to figure out what to do and how to do it, and has a lot of surprises that can be quite scary to first encounter.

This version of the game is definitely more polished than the free version so it will be more accessible to new players but is just as fun to play, especially if your goal is to dive deep in the simulated world or manage a complicated production process using a variety of labors and materials. 
There's still some rough edges to be polished in the new UI (like accidentally disbanding the squad because the big X next to orders is for that not for cancelling an order) but the craftsmanship is of the highest quality. Sadly in some ways the new UI did not improve on parts of the game that were difficult to interact with, and in some cases even presented new problems like the uniforms for archery squads and their ammo, glitches with button presses and focus, inability to sort and search for dwarves etc.
UI aside, there are still some longstanding bugs, and missed opportunities for improving key systems (ranged combat, announcements etc).
The ease of use of this new UI might fool you that the simulated world is simple, you might be amazed at how deep the simulation is if you start exploring the dwarves' personalities, materials used for production, civilizations and other fortresses in the world, or the way the world is generated.

- The UI is very unreadable, I have to look for every simple thing on the Internet, because it is difficult to deduce anything from this terrible UI.
- It's hard to get interested in the fate of our dwarves because they move so fast, teleporting from tile to tile, that it's impossible to track them. There are no indicators of what the characters are doing. There is no visible interaction between them. In Rimword, I was always involved in the fate of the colonists. It's not possible here.
- This game is super frustrating at the beginning and then becomes super boring. In Rimworld you had to constantly develop and plan, the game was challenging you, but in Dwarf Fortress nothing happens at all.
- There were a lot of other frustrating issues that I don't remember because I played it about two months ago.

Update 9/13/2023:
Hell YES. customizable notifications. That was one of my biggest grievences with the steam version! I am 100% by this game now! Thank you Tarn and staff for continuing to work on the soon to be greatest DF game ever!

Update 4/10/2023:
I still feel everything in my old review rings true. and My gripes about the game remain the same HOWEVER These are some of my new opinions on the game. 

-Steamy Dwarf Fortress is bringing a whole new audience to DF, which is good!
-The graphics and some design choices really let people who are more graphically inclined 
 enjoy the game and really get into the stories and histories that can be made. 
-The game still feels vastly more limited then it's predecessor
-The game has UI and alert problems that can compromise a fortress that REALLY should be core gameplay options and NOT requiring Workshop fixes to get around. 

All in all. I am changing my down vote to an up vote because I do find myself playing this sometimes. I still favour the classic. but that's just me being an old head about the game. Play whichever you want! Most importantly, The Dev's are getting an Income from this game. and that accounts for somthing. especially the years of effort and love that has gone into the classic and I HOPE goes into this game. Keep on you beautiful Beardos!

Old Review:
Let me get this clear right off the bat. I LOVE DWARF FORTRESS

That being said. this dwarf fortress is NOT worth 40$ there are many issues with it as it stands and I'm going to list them now compared to classic dwarf fortress from the bay12 website

-alerts-
New: are silent and hard to notice, this is a HUGE problem when a dwarf is making an artifact, or getting attacked, or anything that could cause a berserk state
Classic: Game would pause and alert you of ANY issues that your fortress may face, may it be a new beasty showing up, a dwarf going berserk, or an artifact attempt being made, giving you a chance to react and look into the situation.

-CRAFTING-
New: Everything no longer has a keybind, meaning you have to manually click each and every time you want to order a new thing [unless using managers] which means that the time to queue up 10 beds for example requires a series of clicks to open menu, scroll to bed, click to build, repeat 10x. Absolutly horrible as this can take upward 20 to 30 seconds depending on what your making, plus you can no longer choose materials without a manager.

Classic: Building and queing things is easy, with a keybind to everything it's as fast as you can hit those keys, again, beds as an example. click on building, press keybind for build, then for bed. repeat 10x. which can be accomplished within 2 seconds easilly. also you can choose your materials while queuing items. 

-BUILDING-
New: Much easier to build, this is a huge improvement over the old game in every right, my only complaint is that you still have to micromanage structure building as dwarves can easilly block themselves form building a construction.

Classic: Slow and tedious, this is one of the few things this game actually improved upon

-Dwarf Management-
New: while easier to review dwarves moods and needs, managing their skills is abit more frustrating once again, while this is probably just me not liking a new system, the fact that all dwarves are automatically assigned to do ALL things means that you can have bad crafters making things while your good crafters are off farming or wasting time. just means there is alot more micro managing before you can even start. 

Classic: Dwarves are difficult to read, but starting off they are tasked with basic tasks like hauling, and their specialisations only, making them far easier to manage right off the bat. while immigrants will make this tedious in the long run. DFTools fixed alot of that.

-GRAPHICS-
NEW: Amazing graphics. I absolutely love the design and look of everything. 100% approved!

Classic: ACII graphics are not intuitive at all, However it can be easilly understood. has it's own charm to it. and modders created hundreds of texture packs to breathe life into Dwarf Fortress. some almost as good as the new steam version.

Final Take: This game is not worth the money. It adds far to many problems to be worth paying 40$ for when with the addtion of DFTools and a texture pack. Classic is Far superior and FREE. Just google ""Bay12 Dwarf fortress"" and do some exploring. you'll find everything you need to enjoy this game at it's most powerful. I just regret playing this longer then 2 hours so I lost my money :(
[EDIT 12/7/2022]: After discussing this with some amazing peeps here in the community forum. I DO NOT regret buying the game as It is going to the developers of the classic Dwarf Fortress. an amazing game, I am just disappointed in the current steam product and hope to see it grow beyond what it is]

To fix this version of the game I recommend:
-The option to switch to classic controls for us Keybind fans who like to play the game at a decent pace
-ability to easilly find the announcements and reports page. as mentioned. I could not find it. 
-Make announcements and alerts for important things like artifacts, attacks, berserks, e.c.t. pause the game 
 and pop up an alert. the fact that this stuff is hidden from you screws you more ways then you can emagine!
-check out DFtools and make a dwarf management system similar to it. the current one works... fine I guess, but it's still clumsy and weak at best.",1670428106,1694637103,True,0,0,0.604229092597961426,13,True,False,False

You are merely caught up in this simulation, like a cog in a giant machine that is indifferent to your situation. This is the gift and the curse of this game. I mean, of this simulation. It's not ""rimworld, but old"", it's more like ""algorithm generates massive amounts of interconnected lines of text that could potentially interact with a human player at some point, I guess"". This is quite unique and makes for gameplay where you really have to set your own goals in order for there to be any ""game"" to play at all.

Otherwise, you will simply be building workshops to employ dwarfs to craft various things, which will attract more dwarfs and cause you to need to craft and cook and build more things, and dig more, etc. That's not really a game, and I was confused about what I was supposed to ""do"" at first when playing. If you play on low savagery, you can get a decent amount of space to figure out all the cryptic systems. But, it will also potentially give you so much space that you can forget that a seemingly minor threat could end your fortress quickly.

were-creatures are to be taken extremely seriously

So, don't buy this game looking for a medieval fantasy Rimworld. Just go play Rimworld with mods if you want that. But, if you are ok with spending lots of time figuring out lots and lots of different management systems only to potentially lose it all without warning, then this simulation can offer you gameplay situations that no other games can.

(There is no comparison to Dwarf Fortress. It is a world generator, a fantasy universe, a digital ant farm, an absolute masterpiece of technical wizardry and software engineering prodigy, and an incredible game to boot, with a depth exponentially beyond anything else ever conceived. It is recognised as a work of art for a very good reason, and even that only begins to do it justice. Without it there would be no Minecraft, no Rimworld, no Roblox, no foundation for countless other incredible and influential games - the world's foremost gaming and computer historians would struggle to trace the entirety of its influence and impact. Even if you never see yourself playing it, you should support the Adams brothers' magnum opus [and Kitfox Games for making this version happen!] And if you don't invest the time to experience its world, its ability to weave a universe and an epic worthy of the ages out of 1s and 0s, organised by one man's brilliant and unparalleled vision, you are doing yourself a disservice. Dwarf Fortress is a brilliant masterpiece of ingenuity, vision and dedication, and an ideal example of what can happen when a singular genius with mastery over the power of computing has a vision and stops at nothing to put it into reality. It is one of the most incredible things ever created on a computer, and while this may come across as gushing hyperbole, there is nothing more deserving of it.)

We have this game to thank for excellent titles like Rimworld, Oxygen Not Included, and I suppose more average but not necessarily terrible titles like Gnomoria, Clanfolk and Caves of Qud (though I haven't really played either of those last two, so your own mileage may vary).

However, it must be said that being the primeval version of an entire genre of gaming does not necessarily mean it is the [i]best[/i] version in all ways.  Older is not always better, and in many ways, Dwarf Fortress has been left behind by modern iterations of its genre.  The graphical edition on steam has made great strides to improving the UI of the game and make things more readable, but the underlying jank of the game is inescapable.  Playing this game after playing Rimworld unavoidably brings to mind minor frustrations that the Dwarf Fortress game engine has baked in - why is it impossible to build flooring unless there is nothing currently in that space?  Even a chair or door in the way will result in the game refusing to let you lay down flooring, and sometimes even dwarves (or kobolds, if you are using the mod) standing in the way can make construction plans suspend themselves.  Construction is also impossible in diagonals, so many times your fortress will build around a corner and then be unable to finish the wall because the corner piece of blocked off, requiring you to disassemble a wall, finish the corner, then rebuild a new wall.

These are just small examples of QoL improvements that were added into newer iterations of the genre, but still haven't quite made it into Dwarf Fortress.  Selecting building materials is another such hassle, as there are DOZENS of types of wood and stone in the game, and each one appears on a list of material options.  Or you can just select 'pick nearest material' and watch a patchwork ugly floor and wall be constructed of 6+ different colored materials.  I don't necessarily blame the dev for this - as I understand, Tarn was a solo dev for over a decade on this game. And it was the first of it's kind, so props to that. 

However, I suspect that trying to comprehend and fix all the spaghetti contained within the code of this game would be enough to drive another poor soul mad.  [i]Mad!![/i]  What Tarn did wrong people were able to see and build better in later games, though.

That being said, if you can work around the jank of the clumsy systems in the game, in many ways it has more complexity and depth than anything else the newer games manage.  What it lacks in polished systems and UI it more than makes up with in the scope of what is possible.  

Where else can I build a fortress on the side of a volcano, dig deep underground and create a machine that, with the flip of a switch, floods the overworld with lava, melting those [i]damn goblin raiders[/i] into slag?  And should a forgotten monstrosity try to crawl from the depths into [i]my[/i] fortress, they'll have to slither over half dozen fully armed traps stuffed with steel giant serrated blades.  More like forgotten [i]lunchmeat[/i], am I right?

And there are many other delightful things you can discover hidden within the mechanics of the game.  Do you want your fortress to become a bastion of learning, where scholars and sages come from afar to peruse your vast library and pen their own tomes within it?  You can do that! Do you want to capture a dragon in a cage and use it to burn anyone who tries to enter your fortress?  I wouldn't recommend it, it will very likely go horribly, but technically it's possible!

And that's really the core of the fun of Dwarf Fortress.  There are so many creative ways to manipulate this vastly complex game engine to see and do things you wouldn't have expected.  But the learning curve is very steep!  You will fail very often, and in ways that are more esoteric and frustrating that anything you would see in Rimworld.  Just wait until you have to deal with a werecreature plague that gets worse every full moon, an attacking bronze titan, or a loyalty cascade. Or you're going to discover what lies in store if you dig too deep!

You're going to fuck up and everyone is going to die, multiple times!  Over and over!  But every time you will learn from the experience, and the next time, you'll do better.  Unlike modern games, there is no difficulty settings.  The only gameplay setting is Dwarf Fortress (I mean, you can edit the world settings during generation I guess, but that's not going to do a lot to change the overall gameplay).

That's why the mantra of this game has long been: Losing is Fun!

Honestly I feel that this is its weakest point and what will lose the majority of players. While the steam version certainly starts to bridge the gap on bringing more players into the DF world it is still a bridge pitted with holes. Hopefully something future patches and/or mods will start to fill.

As for myself, I initially found it an incredibly difficult game to get into. The tutorial barely scratched the surface and you are left to learn the majority of the game yourself by researching the answers online. I dropped the game so many times before I discovered the gem hidden beneath.

So many hours I would put in and feel I hadn’t accomplished or understood a thing. It was both a long learning process and honestly a tough hurdle you simply have to be willing to climb.

I often questioned what the objective or purpose was but I would time and time again dive into the game and simply learn the mechanics, controls, GUI etc. But something kept bringing me back, my stubbornness perhaps to understand?

Thankfully, after a year of on and off playing, I can say it was well worth the steep learning curve. I have learnt to absolutely adore this game. Rimworld was the only game I could compare and had just as many hours in and yet it differs so much.

While there are many similarities it’s the comparisons that will have you finding ‘flaws’ if you can call them that. It cannot be compared as this game is nothing like anything I’ve played. The surface level looks like a colony sim but the world that is built is absolutely dripping in history. 

So much so that it feels lived in, it’s your world and yet you have very little control on how it is shaped. Politics, economy, war. It all plays a huge part in how the land came to be and what it will be. 

As your colony grows, you become a part of its history and what happens next, well, you’ll just have to play and see. The term losing is fun plays a big part here as it shapes the whole dynamic of what comes next. This is your story even if it doesn’t always go your way.

You might be unlucky enough to have one of you drunk little dwarfs being a serial killer because he hates his job, Maybe they are a part of some death cult and they ask you for a chapel so they can bring members together to pray to their dark god, or has our dwarf got an affinity for eat dogs' liver. The game is so random and it's that what makes it so great. 

There is a learning curve, but trust me stick with it and this game pays dividends, A big tip for you new players don't sell meat or any wooden object to the Elves, yea they really don't like that!

Game is full of interactions and simulations that don't and never will exist in other games. It's a living project that is in a perpetual state of development, as it should be.

This version was released to raise money for cancer treatment because the US healthcare system is broken (just like all neoliberal economics). 

The good: it's fun as hell, and always has been even before you could click the buttons. I've probably put thousands of hours into this game over the years. Never felt disappointed by weird behavior. Just chalked it up to ""dwarf logic.""

Who lived in a hold of dwarf and man
Life was peaceful in the hold
Till came a beast forgotten and old

The dwarves of the hold died left and right
The men of the realm fought with all their might 
Yet the beast would not fall, to arrow nor blade
As the spirit of the hold began to fade

Edem got up, the last of his force 
His right arm shattered under the weight of his horse
He let out a cry, and threw down his shield!
As he charged at the beast, at the edge of the field

The beast was quick! Though not quick enough
It certainly helped he had cuts cross his scruff
Yet even so, Edem would go into legend!
For the strength he mustered, and energy he'd expend

With a quick left hook, there was an earth-shaking crack!
Against the beasts neck, Edem's fists would snap!
The beast was shocked, and let out a laugh!
As Edem did too, at his own awkard gaffe

Till suddenly it went quiet, and everyone stood still
The beast had gone silent, and felt quite ill
Nobody had realized, not beast, nor dwarf, nor man
The beasts neck had flown off, with the strike of dwarfs hand

Then thunderous cheer! Rousing applause!
Edem lie, still alive, in the field of Danaus
Unlike the beast, Edem's tale was carved in time
The brave swordsdwarf, the punch worthy of rhyme

Edem Fikodromek, punched the beast made of salt
It stood three stories tall, and refused to halt 
In one good jab, the beast was felled in its prime
And Edem Fikodromek's legend was engraved in time",1693784832,1693784832,True,1,0,0.502341926097869873,0,True,False,False

That being said, once they started to actually have graphical games, my love for gaming really took off. This graphical version of Dwarf Fortress was an easy buy on steam, even better if it's creator gets more money for his addition to the game itself! 

It's still got that old-timey feel to it, and what a hell of a learning curve to be on! DO THE TUTORIAL IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE. Actually useful and helpful, while you still have the wiki to go to for understanding how to use the different aspect of things and objects in the game. 

I'm getting comfortable enough in my gameplay now that I am actually paying attention to the personality of the little dwarves in my fortress.

Thing is, that was MY FAULT for not having the smoothest way to ensure I had enough raw material for production... but this lady... WOW.

This is not a game, even calling it a simulator is very merciful: it's more like an overcomplicated Excel spreadsheet with a horrible GUI disguised as a colony simulator by a dev who probably should go take some classes on optimization and GUI design.

Don't get me wrong , I love difficult simulators that accurately simulate a specific thing such as OMSI 2 or the Microsoft Flight Simulators. However, there is a difference between simulators that are difficult because the subject matter itself is complicated like planes having a metric tons of buttons in the cockpit and ""simulators"" that are difficult because the developer had a aneurysm while developing the UI: ironically, the former tend to provide a better, more detailed but somehow shorter tutorials on these very realistic subjects than Dwarf Fortress, where the tutorial barely touches upon anything at all. Yeah it's nice knowing how to do basic digging but my little pixels keep dying because the game didn't tell me how to set up a kitchen or a dining hall.

Related to this is the complete absence of information in-game: the wiki itself is outdated and the information that is current operates on batshit insane moon logic. Here is a situation: how do I encrust only [b] specific gems [/b] in the workshop? Other colony sims like Rimworld would do this simply, 2-3 clicks: click on the workbench, select the task and the game would let you simply select which gems to encrust. Simple, user-friendly, non carpal tunnel inducing. How does it go in Dwarf Fortress? 

1.) Click on the workbench

2) Add the gem encrusting task (wait, no that will process every single gem in the big ass stockpile)

3.) Dig out a new place for your stockpile , pray to the God(s) or the Goddess(es) that the miner doesn't die because of some unrelated status and that you won't die of boredom while they dig.

4.) Click on the stockpile, navigate through the UI mess to forbid everything but the gems you want encrusted. Pray again so the game doesn't bug out with this.

5) Go back to the workshop and assign the task again but this time to that specific stockpile.

6) Pray the hardest that dumb little dwarfs won't take stuff from the big stockpile and actually finish the task.

Besides that, placing bedrooms for every single dwarf resident/visitor is a pain in the ass, blueprints are basically useless. This is really annoying at 8 dwarves, I can't imagine what it looks like at 250. The icing on the cake is the lack of QoL features: you can't replace the floor under the furniture because temporarily removing the furniture is too logical for the tiny little brains of dwarves, you can't replace the walls with walls of different materials and the dwarfs are too dumb in general: your fisherdwarf will try to fish in the same place for eternity and still try fishing while getting attacked because finding a different fishing place and running away automatically when attacked is a luxury.

Oh and the famous story-building, alive world the fans and reviewers keep raving about? Meaningless. Sure you can hear about Sir Snogglepoof of the Kingdom of Fire being killed in a coup or some random elf forest bringing home a treasure, or even see what your dwarves fight about but what is the point? You can't do anything with that information and when you are more busy fighting against the UI and obtuse mechanics, you don't really have time to view every single world/personal event (nobody cares about a werecat being infected with some disease and scratching some random guy) especially when you have thousands of braindead dwarves needing babysitting because things like ""common sense"", ""instincts"" and ""logic"" don't exist in this world. Seriously, the ""best"" writing I have seen in this game was ""This is the corpse of [Insert irrelevant dwarf's name] corpse. It is coated with water. It is coated with water. It is coated with water. It is coated with water. It is coated with water"". I am not joking.

This game is just a relics of an old age of bad GUIs and insane mechanics. The colony sim part has better, more accessible alternatives like Rimworld where the storytelling is more personal. However, if you want a DF style storytelling, I recommend the following: pick a verb (x killed y, x found a treasure, x founded the kingdom of y), go to a fantasy name generator site and replace the x and y with those generated names. It's free (+ you can add your own flavor to it) and you don't have to pay 30 dollars for a buggy game that should be in EA. Or just download the free version, AFK and only ""play"" it for the famous ""world building"".

Dwarf Fortress is like if OMSI not only required you to drive, an already difficult task when the vehicles you drive are steel behemoths but also encyclopedic knowledge of medical terminology in case a passenger gets sick/injured, an extremely detailed knowledge of repairing buses you have to do by yourself and also a master's degree in thermodynamical engineering to understand the air conditioner mechanics. Sure it's ""immersive"" I guess, but there is a reason even the most realistic simulators leave these things out: too many caveats.

Oh and IMPORTANT info: decade-old annoying bugs don't get fixed. You know why? Because the developer nor the fans care about making this a playable ""game"" or just a ""simulator"" (even the latter should be playable, which plane sims can manage to do somehow), he only cares about about his obsessive desire to make an ""accurate"" fantasy world simulation. You are basically paying 30 dollars for an alpha/beta (the version number right is around 0.50 right now, which means it is only 50 percent complete in those 20 years, which should make this an Early Access game) of a weird passion project with design choices stuck in the 90s, falsely advertising (alright, that's a harsh word but still) itself as a colony ""simulator"" """"""game"""""".

Fans will try to tell you this is part of the fun (in other communities, these would be called game-breaking bugs and have thousands of reviews of calling it out, bringing it's review score to Overwhelmingly Negative or at least Mixed), but I feel like it's more of the nostalgia speaking than actual love of the game.

TL;DR: If this game was released in 2022 without any history or rose-tinted cult-following (as in highly dedicated) behind it, it would be rightfully criticized for being incomplete, buggy and for the seemingly absent devs. Unless you like ADHD levels of detail of an elf's toe being broken or some irrelevant dwarf's teeth breaking to a million pieces combined with the absolute worst, most nonsensical GUI/gameplay design in the entire universe then avoid. Meaningless systems are overdetailed to a point they become a burden and important ones are seriously underdetailed.

Sadly, the entire foundation is broken. Unless Putnam/another programmer manages to sort out years of spaghetti code (and that is if Tarn doesn't decide to add yet another broken ""feature"") then there is not much hope for major improvement.

There is a damned good reason why most simulators at least try to put the game/fun part first: if MSFS simulated the entire process of getting a pilot license, dealing with the bureaucracy and making the repairs manually it would probably cause major problems/frustration for the sake of unnecessary complexity. Instead it cuts a few corners there and there but still manages to be an entertaining (by whoever likes the subject matter) game and a realistic simulation.",1672669959,1693130297,False,0,1,0.35100284218788147,0,True,False,False

This game takes procedural generating of every aspect to a whole new level. Every world is unique. Every creature has personality and complex traits. Art and masterworks completed by dwarves reflect upon their history, their preferences, the things around them! Legendary beasts are truly epic with terrible and frightening traits that distinguish themselves differently from each other.

This game has such a level of depth, and we're not just talking about how far you can dig down! All history of the world, the people, artifacts, religions, kingdoms are all meaningful towards its progression. All of these things matter to the people of these worlds, and they will act upon those biases. The world is truly alive as factions vie for power, towns are raised and razed, races triumphantly excel or succumb to extinction. New generations are born to carry their family legacy or go off on their own paths. Legendary beasts rampage above and below, to slay another day or be slain.

The UI is very intuitive and the tutorial is great for teaching new players how to play. There is however a bit of complexity that may be somewhat ambiguous to beginners, but trial and error or a good tutorial will help lead the way through some of the more complex constructions, like wind or water powered mills.

I understand how iconic and innovative this game was for the time, and I am happy it got the love it deserved to bring a much needed modern look and feel. However, I just could not get into it. 

I think that, despite the overhaul, the game-play is still exactly the same as the original- which can be good and bad. For me, I do not think it has aged well at all. It feels way too clunky, and like you need to spend hours reading a manual just to do anything. After hours of frustration of learning how the damn game works, I eventually just gave up. It just does not hold up to the modern standard of gaming Imo. The new coat of paint does nothing to fix what I consider to be an extremely clunky game.

One could say it’s a mega beast of a game. The number of possible projects you can undertake to make your fortress more fun is virtually limitless. 

Do you want to create a surface level city with walls, towers, and moat? You can do that. Do you want to go underground and stay safe from the deadly fauna of the dwarf fortress world creating vegan utopia? You can 100% do that. Would you like to create a mushroom farm in the caves and create an underground secluded society of dwarfs? Hell yeah you can do that. With enough patience and play time you can grow a whole new generation of dwarfs born in your fortress. Not to mention denizens of lava levels and benefits utilisation of lava brings to your dwarfs.

The stories this game tells are absolutely insane.

I was immediately looking forward to the absolute chaos he would cause with his presence trying to usurp the spot of my then mayor or maybe reanimating dead things. Turned out to be a pretty chill dude who just wanted to read books in the library and work on gems. Admittedly I did keep him away from any military conflict just in case of fun.

Another time forgotten beast climbed into my fortress from the caverns despite the stairs being about two Z-levels above the cavern ground. That forgotten beast killed more than 30 dwarfs before my military got there to dispatch it. I’m still upset about that one but in all fairness I should have placed the hatch to protect myself from this possibility. Or maybe I should have created barracks closer to the caverns instead of carrying training on the surface.

Speaking of lava, I was really surprised when on my volcano embark there started to come out of workshops lava crabs (or something like that) setting my metal working dwarfs on fire causing burns and killing some of them. So now I have non functioning workshops cause everyone competent at metallurgy is in the infirmary attempting to recover from burns. Half the military wounded or worse. And there I have a massive security breach with denizens of lava just waiting to jump out and hurt my now Hephaestus looking like dwarfs. Such fun.

Does the game have problems? Yes. Probably the three biggest issues I personally have are as follows:

Marksdwarfs most of the time seemed to be lost on whether they should use crossbows as hammers or use them for shooting. Frankly I gave up on training them and just get them to practice martial arts eventually set them up as hunters in their civilian time. Attach a few dogs/bigger animals as an escort and you should have a steady supply of meat/bones/shells from the surrounding fauna and also live marks training. Also copper bolts only since they are cheap and I found in one of the goblin raids that when the dwarfs do have bolts they do like to hit their front line comrades in the back. Then again I might be utilising them wrong so yeah.

Next animals. I want to be able to treat my dogs. Let me heal my dogs for the love of gods. They are warriors and they deserve to be treated with respect. I had to kill more military dogs than I would like to admit when they became more of a hindrance in a fight with more scars and trauma than I would wish on any deadly forgotten beast. 
Saddest moment when a military dwarf goes to war and his maimed dog just follows his master to suffer even more trauma despite barely crawling. That damn dog was a hero.

The third issue is the logs. Dear gods, I need logs in my life. It feels like there are so many situations when I don’t know what happened or what and how something died or got hurt. For example, one of my axe dwarves died during training but other than the news that he suddenly died I have no idea what happened. I cannot examine the body despite multiple dwarfs surrounding him. I think it might be natural causes but I guess I won’t find out till I get him into his tomb with an engraved slab. Anyway logs would be useful.

There is a UI but after familiarising myself with it for a while now it doesn’t bother me as much as it used to. I can defo get through it much easier than the original dwarf fortress.

There is still much that I would like to learn to utilise better in the game starting with carts and storage zones. Anything with liquids really seems very daunting; aquifers are the first to go on my embarks. The scope of metallurgy and variety of different alloys is scary to look at. I am trying to dabble in it every once in a while to mix it up and create a bigger variety of crafts.

With all of this in mind and considering the game is an ongoing project with new things and fixes to come. It’s already a massive game with plenty of things to do and try and I do hope that it will only grow bigger in the future.


PS. For the newest of players I highly recommend the guide section. You will not regret browsing through it.

-

Dwarf Fortress is a game like no other. And while it has spawned a whole genre, indeed with marvelous, more modern successors, none have come even close to the sheer scope of possibilities and fun the player is provided here.

This is not a modern game. Input is filled with an excessive amount of steps measured by todays standards. If you are experienced with older versions, be prepared to relearn every single keybind (not necessarily in a sensical order). If you are new, be prepared to use  the wiki (which is great) on how to set up the sometimes easiest task. Including how to navigate (to) the corresponding ui.

At it's core, DF is a colony sim in which you are tasked to guide a dwarven expedition from meager outpost to sprawling metropolis. Filled with taverns, underground farms, deep mines and magma cannons. The usual dwarf stuff.
You give orders what to build or where to dig, manage your dwarves' daily needs and generally watch them neither do what you want nor enjoy what you've created for them. No matter how carefully you plan ahead, some particularly special dwarf is sure to find a novel way to kill themselves. And if not by their own hand, or one of the many berserking dwarves, then by one of the various things the game has to offer to introduce more fun to your fortress.

Of course you can dig too deep. Sure, there are goblin invasions, angry elves rambling about you cutting down too many trees. Nothing you haven't yet seen elsewhere, when your hunter kills a unicorn or your pastures are devastaded by dragonfire. Some fortress will starve, the next will go insane because of the ghost of your murdered tavern keeper. A case still open to investigation by your sheriff after seven years. But you learned (to burry your dead properly). Every time you do.
What if you just, and barely, survived a giant coming for your goats? Have you had enough time to properly wall off your now massive graveyard before the looming necromancer army arrives? If not, your last two warriors may now be facing their former brethren on the wrong side of your defences. Maybe, attracted by word of your former victory, a legendary human swordsman just happens to reside in your fort by then. Single handedly wiping out the evil magician and his hordes.

What's beyond the usual in this game, is the attention to detail. Dig too fast into an aquifer and you will drown. Have no alcohol for too long and they will inevitably go mad. A two year old baby may be struck by a strange mood, kill a random passer by and create a masterpiece flute out of the victim's shin bone.

DF creates stories. Small ones, like the dead tavern keeper. Capital ones, like when I accidentally flooded my living quarters with magma. Hundreds of souls were lost because of one lever unturned, one floodgate still open. I had designed a trap for intruders. Apparently it worked. 
Once, the cat guarding my food storage from vermin was adopted by my guard captain. His character screen showed him pretty happy about that decision. I had no part in this, but figured they were a great fit. Details.

The whole world, including historical events and resulting feuds, is simulated. There are so many systems tied into each other that even offering your goods to an elven trader while they are packed in a wooden bin may cause war with another (tree loving) civilisation. There is gravity, fluid pressure and wind speeds. Different climates with different problems. Religion, guilds and mental health among your population.
There is no goal, no end. Besides the fact that every fortress will eventually fail, you are free to do anything you can imagine. Even built a retracting minecard cannon shooting excess nobles into unsuspecting panda bears. You can open a combat log to see what exactly happened when the flying dwarf had crashed into the unlucky mammal. How his head had crushed the creature's spine by force of impact. 

I can't wait to see all this in adventure mode, to travel „my“ world.
See, it's not only a colony sim, but a roguelike as well. Alas, since this feature is not yet implemented to this version (you'd have to downgrade to a previous built), my review solely concerns fortress mode.

With the paid version you get a nice tileset (ascii is but the press of a button), a banger soundtrack, mouse support, a new ui (which is really not that good, but Dfhack works) and an actual piece of art as featured in the MoMa. 
You get a game that is still in active development after decades. You may not get the update that feels most important to you. Maybe never.

Playing it may feel outdated and boundary breaking at the same time. I can deal with the interface because I enjoy what gets obstructed by it. But oh boy is it obstructing.
Luckily there is mods. Dfhack, a great tool to adress most if not any (ui) issue one might have is already on steam, with Dwarf Therapist for easier dwarf management apparently on its way. Generally you can modify anything however you see fit, expanding the already ridicolous amount of content infinitely. 

There is a certain learning cliff, but getting a small fort running stable is relatively straightforward. From this point, the only limiting question is „will [strike] enough [/strike]  any dwarves survive it when I do this?“ 

If you are into colony sims and the likes of Factorio or even grand strategy (though it would be a long and hard road to affecting the world on this scale) I see no reason for you not at least try (it's free, after all). And if you like it, consider giving money to a true labour of love. If you are into none of the above, try it anyway.

 theres no way to blueprint. you need to build ~200 bedrooms for your dwarves. first you need to carve out 200 bedrooms one by one with the mouse. then go into work orders and have 200 beds built, 200 doors built, 200 chests built, etc. then you need to place down 200 beds one by one. then you need to place 200 doors down one by one. then you need to place 200 dressers down one by one. then you need to place 200 chests down one by one. i didnt mention putting down floors which you have to do first and you have to do that room by room.
the game is just a hot micromanagement mess which sucks because otherwise its one of the coolest games ever. but before being a dwarf simulator its a hair tearing out simulator.

While yes it's outdated and it's hotkeys being frustrating to learn, I consider the original objectively superior. This game feels like a thirty dollar tileset with mouse controls being enabled. Aside from graphics and some mouse controls, nothing has been done to actually improve the gameplay experience. The UI isn't much better than the original, and navigating workshops is no longer as simple as just hitting the hotkeys. Instead you have to scroll through workshop menus for each individual work order you want done, or babysit the workshop when you set the order on repeat. On top of that, race conflicts are completely removed from the game, something in the original. Now that sounds odd, considering goblins often raid your fortress. What I mean is that the devs have completely removed the ability for your dwarves to discriminate from other in game races in any way, so no more goblin race riots. On top of this, for some unknown strange reason the devs added animal sexualities. What's that, you just bought a male and female pair of horses to breed? Too bad, the female is asexual. 

Overall this feels like a cashgrab, with an opportune moment for the devs to inject their political agenda. I don't recommend, and would honestly want a refund in retrospect. Thirty dollars wasted.",1692231593,1692231593,False,8,1,0.368668198585510254,0,True,False,False

So, what's wrong?

- the user interface. Everything, every screen, every input or button has a problem. Buttons that look disabled and instead they are toggles. Text areas that don't allow you to select or move the cursor around. Search functionality that doesn't work with partial keywords. Inconsistent icon placements. Inconsistent icon functionalities. Lists of items and materials ordered in a painful way, making a stockpile is a horrible experience.

- dialogs. They are unmovable panels. Why? 

- scroll wheel to move z levels instead of zoom. It's just grrrrrrrr. And the zoom is clunky at best. Annoying experience.

- logs. The constant question is: what the hell happened? Good luck finding out the answers.

- butcher under farming. Again, this is the ui, and it's so illogical that we kept it from the ascii version. It personally upsets me soooooo much.

- no links. Whenever an entity name is displayed it should be linked to its property panel. 

- freaking right click to open a contextual menu. I don't care if we learned to use the keyboard in the other version, just make this one usable.

- no sounds. In 2023, this is a negative for a game on steam. Again, it never had sounds, but it is a requirement for this version.

Every single interaction in the stem version is so badly designed that makes it very hard to _use_, and I am not even talking about the gameplay!

There might not even be another game I have played as much as this one.

So, why haven't I played the Steam version. This comes down to a change in the way the UI was handled that means that the Steam version requires the mouse for play, while the older 0.47 version allows me to play with keyboard only. I'm currently hoping that they are working towards making the game playable without ANY mouse inputs at all, and should they do so, I'll likely install this again.

So...why am I suggesting it? 

Well, in the case that you're a new player who has no experience with the game, none of the problems I have with the Steam version will be problematic for you, except perhaps the odd poorly laid out UI elements or clunky interface elements (the irony here being that being mouse-based makes poor UI choices even more evidence since hotkeys memorization essentially nullified the clunky UI for veteran users).

In the case that you're a veteran of the game, you might have issues with the way the UI has been adapted in a similar vein as I do. Still, Toady deserves your support. This work of digital artistry and passion deserves financial recompense for the time you've already played it before the Steam release.

This game is absolutely not for everyone. A great number of people will never be able to connect with it, either because of the pacing, the complexity, the propensity for losing (its FUN!!), or even the graphics. A part of me still thinks that everyone should play it, in the same way that I feel on some level that, even if you don't like Classical music, every person should give Bach or Beethoven a listen. This game is a piece of modern history...and one of the fundamental inspirations behind Minecraft, and the various games that then were inspired by Minecraft like Terraria. Playing this game is like listening to the Beatles...you don't realise how much of its ideas are spread throughout the gaming world until you play it.

This game is an influential work of art, and thus, you should experience it, even if you won't like or play it in the long run. For my own part, I've still got 0.47 on my computer.",1691778108,1691778108,True,35,0,0.735104560852050781,0,True,False,False

One concept you will need to embrace is that ""Losing is fun"" because at some point something bad will happen and you will get wiped out, but generally there will be some cool story you created that led to that. Every dwarf has it's own personality and it's amazing how things develop.

Even though you will eventually ""lose"", I consider this a very cozy game because you can pause anytime and make some amazing plans. There is a ton to explore and it's great to see just how much depth there is in this game as you learn and go.",1691594918,1691594918,True,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

Dwarf Fortress is a good game, don't get me wrong, except... well, maybe it's just my Rimworld brainrot kicking in, but compared to that game this one just feels quite tedious at times. Keep in mind, I'm reviewing this game from the point of somebody who just wanted a to play a good, retro-style colony sim, not somebody who's been following the game for a long time, I know some of my complaints may be about features very important to the game's structure, but that fact alone doesn't make them good, necesserily. Also, as Rimworld is my most played colony sim, I'll be making quite a few comparisons to that game. 
Alright, to start with my complaints, this very complex game gives you really low amounts of data about... well, everything. In Rimworld you can see all important stats of an item/creature in one simple menu which [b] contains a searchbar [/b], here you have to actually search for that information yourself, assuming the game can even give it to you; I had to google most of the data I needed because the game just doesn't tell you almost anything; this game also doesn't allow you to set priorities for most things, at least as far as I know, so you are at the mercy of your dwarves' AI for most of the time, and trust me, that's not fun. Also, the game has quite a few bugs, eg. about half an hour before writing this review I accidentaly clicked a button which just happened to be glitched and crashed my game, possibly deleting about half an hour of progress; needless to say, I'm still quite angry about that. 
Okay, now with the positives; the art style is great and the gameplay is solid (assuming the core mechanics decide to work properly), additionally having less control of the world than in, say, Rimworld, can be really nice at times because it lets you watch the community you've asembled work by itself (assuming the AI decides to work properly).
Alright, I guess I should probably summarise my thoughts about this game because my writing style is quite messy and I probably missed some things: the game is very nice to play if everything works properly but is a real pain in the neck when it doesn't, which happens more often that I would've liked. It can be a really good game, but I'd advise you to wait a bit until more bugs and other issues are fixed; until then, Rimworld would probably be a better game to put your money into if you're looking for a good colony sim.",1691343317,1691343317,True,2,0,0.503589749336242676,0,True,False,False

They've hired more people the new graphics additions coming along seem super cool for representing the actual procedural information of the dwarfs appearance, I just fired it up after a couple months and it sucked me right in. It runs much faster and more smoothly with multithreading and they just added that so I would imagine it can be optimized eventually but already allowing me to do things way too big with way too many dwarfs and livestock on a 16 x 16 embark and it gives me a pretty decent 30 fps which is a lot of activity for such a huge thing I'll have to retire it probably before I get to thousands of dwarfs but I am building the legendary capital of what will be a huge empire of retired forts for many hundreds of years to come in the world cuz I found 'what I wanted to do'.

DFhack is on steam, get it, even if you don't want to 'cheat' its more a simulation and its very opaque so learning how to do various things how the physics generally work, read some wiki pages and pick some grand goals like stealing all the books in the world or something. how you can achieve those goals what those goals might even be takes some time to understand and in the mean time with DFhack you will be learning how to just keep your dwarfs alive fed clothed, washed, etc, so it can be very handy to have little interface of tools to ease the process or even just basic quality of life stuff like autobutcher slaughtering your overgrown cat population or whathaveyou, it helps improve the experience. Which is robust, more people are working on it, and I definitely recommend the dfhack as you will find yourself using it less to cheat the more you learn the game and then you will find yourself using it for different things cuz you can do some complicated stuff, wage ware on the entire goblin race if you want, with your army of undead zombies and undead revenants who dont eat or sleep or have emotions, they can take the war across the entire world for you if you want. and you'll learn how to do these things without the tool assist. But it can also give you a tool to drag and drop delete ALL those walls you built on the wrong z level or something without individually clicking on every square or one of the other work arounds. 

Definitely recommend it but yes if you're new to complex simulation colony management games or even have played rimworld before, rimworld may have modeled all its DLCs around base features of dwarf fortress, but dwarf fortress is quirkier and pretty different under the hood, it's hard to explain but you will understand if that's you and you fire this up. So don't feel guilty about cheating so instead of having your fortress die in fun every couple hours you can just experiment and see what everything is you can do and have fun with it, I have played this game a lot and I am still finding new fun things to do all the time,  I will find more things I want to do and spend thousands more hours in this game I have no doubt.

PS _ I waited to play dwarf fortress being keenly interested since 2004 when some super niche internet nerds I knew started talking about it, and minecraft lololol. And Tarn always said in the past 5 years it was going to be 'release version soon' and I think now half a year after release it's polished right up and this is a true gem and they will continue to polish for many years to come, and lots of other people make mods which can just tweak the experience in fun ways and I love it.

If you really pay attention to what the game is telling you and open your mind, the possibilities are endless. So many stories. The grandfather of many other hit games and many gaming concepts. If there's a game that you should take with you to a deserted island, it should be Dwarf Fortress.

As of the time of this review, I've played for 168 hours in the same world, around 20 fortresses, building stories and a legacy to play on the Adventure Mode once it's out. My latest fortress was a ""Hermit Fortress"" where the Hermit Dwarf, Adil, had Noah Syndrome. Adil has 62 war dog pets which walk around with him for everything that he does at the fortress! Adil already has written two books about his lonely life.

Also, this game re-ignited my passion for games. I know this current version of Dwarf Fortress without Adventure Mode is a Colony Sim and not a Roguelike. But in any case, DF led me to Traditional Roguelikes and now I'm in a cycle of ""gaming rebirth"", playing every possible traditional Roguelike I can find, everything feels like a complete breath of fresh air, a new discovery at every corner.

I will elaborate on 2 anecdotes, without spoilers, which I believe summarize this game.

Say you want to forge a steel axe. First you need to make steel. To do that you need flux stone and iron. Flux stone and iron make pig iron. Then iron, pig iron and flux stone make steel. By the end you get 2 steel ingots. Then you can forge the axe. Making the steel and forging the axe requires two different types of workshops, and each step takes up fuel. You could set up a workshop above magma and forgo using fuel, harnessing the magma's heat instead. Now, you could just make iron weaponry and armor and be done with it. It is much simpler, cheaper and you can make more of them. That will probably be enough for the odd goblin or elf invasion. But when facing some of the dangers this game has to offer, iron simply won't cut it, sometimes literally. If that process sounds tedious, you're right, it is. Which is why all of it can be automated by assigning a dwarf as a manager and setting an order for each step, which can be repeated as often as you want. It is worth noting that Steel isn't something you unlock arbitrarily at some point in a tech tree, there is no such thing as a tech tree. What you can and cannot build is restricted only by the materials you have and your own creativity. I would say that you are also restricted by the simulation and its rules, but at some point someone flooded the entire world with magma without exploits. Make of that what you will.

Say you want to build a mill. This will give you access to flour, sugar and dye. All useful for industry and/or trade. In most games you'd just plop down a windmill, or select the watermill and hover next to the river until it turns green and place it there. Maybe there will be differences in production according to how strong the stream or wind are, but that'll be it. In DF this is merely the first step. After you place the windmill or water wheel, you then need to connect them to the millstone itself. You could do this by making a long, inefficient and spacious assembly. Or you could place the millstone next to the windmill or water wheel, but that would mean your dwarves would have to travel to and from it, which might expose them to wild animals or, even worse, be inefficient. So, you decide to redirect the river, meaning you have to tackle with the water physics of the game. Perhaps to avoid the dangers of the outside, or to be even more efficient, you dig an underground water passage, which powers a water wheel that is inside your fortress. If you want to really spoil your dwarves, perhaps you could use the same water to fill up a well that they will use to clean themselves, and as a secondary source of hydration if they run out of alcohol.

People have already expressed why this game is a one of a kind simulation, and the steam version finally makes it accessible to a lot more people. While veterans do have some valid criticisms about the control scheme and readability, and I hope they get addressed either with a patch or a mod, for newcomers this is the ideal version to start with. And with adventure mode in the works for the steam version as well, there will soon be an entirely different way to interact with the simulation. Even without it, it is well worth the asking price.

If 3 of these things are fixed/added my review will be turned to positive.
 
1 Make an option to add visible hotkeys to most actions that have hotkeys.

2 Fix instability in the game, it has crashed twice for me.
[I had some Quality of Life mods enabled when it crashed so I can't rule them out though I doubt it was them]
3 Add an option to make Smoothing/Engraving Designations see-through.
 
4 Add an option to make most alerts trigger a sound.
 
5 Make it so you can turn off Skill and attribute rust. [I just want the option]
 
6 Add an option to make it so mushrooms can be grown year-round underground. Why would temperature fluctuate that much Underground.
 
(7 Add an option to assign all dwarves to a burrow.) !Fixed!
 
8 Trade UI is very inconvenient. You have to click on each one or sell them as a box. This is problematic when there's something in a box you don't want to sell.
 
9 General bug fixing.
 
10 Add levels of priority to stockpiles.

11 Fix cheese so it goes into stockpiles properly.

Dwarf Fortress is finally playable for me, I just could not get used to the ASCII art or the UI. Fanmade sprites helped a ton, but having to battle the UI at every turn was not so enjoyable.

Now this! This is enjoyable, the father of all colony sims is back with a very well done overhaul to its UI and sprites. You can tell what things are, and most importantly how to do things via the UI. The tutorial, albeit short, is also a good help - along with the rest of the ingame guides.

The game is finally playable to a wider audience. It deserves your money at full price.

1) Lots of bugs and quirks.
The game might have a memory leak, and it WILL occasionally crash without warning, so remember to turn on autosave every season as well as manually save once in a while after you've completed some big task.
Practically every major feature has at least one major bug, which is documented on the wiki (which you absolutely have to use to play well btw).
In general, the quirks (exploits) are also one of the reasons why so many ""epic stories"" spawned from DF. You HAVE to know some specific technical tricks in order to survive well, as some of the (combat) threats are nigh-impossible otherwise.

2) Unfriendly UI.
This was largely addressed by this graphical update, but it's still difficult to get certain overviews of information (such as skill proficiencies, which is remedied by Dwarf Therapist) or understand what you need to do and how to do it (especially when the military is involved). Another specific example: You cannot build up-stairs to mine up into an unknown tile in this version.

The dwarves all gathered in the great tavern to celebrate what they had just built. The building was single-story, made with scraps of wood and rock of all different kinds mashed together creating a blinding eyesore of a construction. Nevertheless, the dwarves celebrated their work. Visitors from neighboring outposts were enjoying the hospitality of the Diamondhames dwarves, drinking their beer and wine and enjoying the local acapella band's perfomance. Barrels upon barrels of good wine and ale were kept in the back storage, waiting to be consumed as the night went on. 

There was no warning when the parrots came. 

They flew in and immediately started attacking the tavern-goers, violently ripping off any kind of shiny jewelry they could get their beaks on. A patron grabbed one of the parrots by its legs, swung it around and smashed it on the corner of the table, breaking its neck instantly. War broke out. 

The cacophony of screaming people and squawking parrots filled the tavern hall. Three of the parrots swooped in on the acapella band, whose performance had been chaotically interrupted. A performer caught one of them by its beak, ripped it off and threw the flailing bird to the ground where it was left to bleed out. Over to the right side of the hall, the lead vocalist was attacked by two birds at once, flailing his fists around in a drunken attempt to land blows on his assailants. He was in trouble; he had been drinking so excessively that he couldn't tell up from down. He lands a blow on one of the birds, as the other dive bombs him in the stomach. He fell down, and knocked over a chair and a table as he hit the ground, shattering drinkware all over the floor. He vomits. He gets up, and brings his fist down on one of the birds that came in for another swoop. He vomits. Another bird dive bombs him in the stomach. He vomits again. With every punch he throws and blow he takes from the parrots, he retches. However, he must protect his jewelry at all costs. As the last parrot came in and swooped at his neck, he caught it by the nape and delivered a bone-shattering blow to its skull with his right fist. The bird's head was rendered to nothing but a jumbled heap of flesh and feather. The victorious acapella performer stood triumphantly as he dropped the dead parrot to the floor. The dust was settling, the rest of the tavern-goers had managed to flee in the chaos. It was silent, other than the sound of blood dripping from the bodies of the dead parrots all over the tavern hall. 

He vomits. 

He stumbles, falls over, and vomits again. He tries to clamber up but he retches and vomits once more. He retches and empties his stomach a total of 37 times consecutively before he manages to get up again. The floor of the tavern is covered in puddles of blood, vomit, and spilled wine. He looked around the room as the dawn's first rays began to shine through the door, illuminating the chaotic mess that had just been made of the brand new tavern.

Dwarf Fortress is not a game, it's a lifestyle. I got into this game initially after interest in RLKeeper on Steam. There's a lot of similarities but that one is a lot less complex. I'm sure you could call this the ""Father of Sims"". I'm not going to be able to say much more than what has been said from others but I will say as a new player it depends on how much you want out of the game. I won't say much because if you're already here you probably know what's all about.

Dwarf Fortress with a bad UI?!?!?! That's totally unheard of! But seriously, while there are a LOT of UI improvements, there are also a lot of stuff which you just... can't currently do anymore with the new UI, especially in regards to keyboard controls. You can't do most things with keyboard controls, only the surface level stuff (which pretty much only includes mining, wood chopping, and gathering)

The stuff that is intentional is great (mass designating bedrooms <3), but it honestly feels like there isn't even half of the functionality of the old UI...

Also, using the ascii glyphs renders the game almost unplayable. Stuff like damp/warm stone is just no longer shown via ascii, which sucks because I genuinely like the ascii more, and even if I didn't, it means that the free version of this game is damn near impossible to play (unless you just play an older version)

Other negative reviews list countless issues too. Stuff like no way to control what ammo Dwarves use for training, no reasonable way to make Dwarves retreat into a safe zone during emergencies, and so on.

I'm sure all of this will eventually be ironed out~ and I'm sure the reason why this version was released was to get feedback on the new UI before developing it further (Which is why I think the UI is only really great for surface level mechanics), but it's been over half a year, and there hasn't even been a hotfix for basic stuff yet.


The game is still awesome, but as of the time of writing this review, it's still going through tremendous growing pains from redoing the entire UI. When it gets there, it'll be amazing. It just... doesn't seem like it's going to be making UI improvements anytime soon at all, which is a shame.

I'm not sure if I can recommend it over the older version or not. Some of the QoL here is undeniably fantastic, and investing into the older version (especially as a new player) seems kinda... weird knowing that none of that version's UI muscle memory will carry over. If you're new to DF, maybe just pass for the time being.

Rest assured this is one game that isn't just going to be abandoned, a passion project that has inspired countless stories and adventures.

I personally don't encounter bugs more than about once per 5 hours. It's an amazing experience I already sunk tens of hours into and I have no idea how I did that. It's definitely one of the way more addicting games once you get the hang of the basics. If you love system-based games or simulations, this is definitely up your alley.

There's really too much to describe in a simple review. The game certainly isn't for people who want a simple gaming experience, as anything as simple as starting out requires a small book of knowledge about the game (Though the beginner tutorial is surprisingly helpful at starting you off with bare minimum knowledge). Learning is thankfully also not boring, especially if you are the trial and error enjoyer type. The game is most of all an amazing story generator. By that I mean that apart from the game itself, there's great enjoyment to be had in talking to others about the insane (or even mundane, yet funny) things that happen in your fort to others.

Insane game and I'm excited for what systems they will implement next to make the experience even more insane.

 - No civilian alerts. Seriously. You can make burrows dwarfs are free and willing to ignore, but that is it. No way to order dwarfs to remain in safe spot in case of danger.
 - You can't dig up in corridor. In classic version you would just build ""Up stairs"" and dig into ceiling. Here you can't build stairs without spanning them between multiple levels and you can't do that because layer above you is solid.
 - You can't set uniform ammunition. In classic you're able to set which ammo is used in combat and which in training. Not here anymore so your dwarfs may at random train with steel bolts and shot wooden sticks at titan.
 - No health screen. No way to identify which dwarf is injured and how badly other than click each single one.
 - Default auto-pause settings are joke. Game won't get paused when traders or migrants arrives or your dwarfs are getting slaughtered in caverns. But you will get half screen modal and pause when drafted soapmaker like his wooden sword very much. Tweak announcements.txt yourself ASAP or you will get frustrated very quickly.
 - No way to display combat log (in general or for a creature). Once you dismiss the announcement icon log is gone forever.

I tried to like this version, but it is underwhelming. I figured out the ""classic"" version before this 'fancy interface' on Steam became available. I am a huge fan of Rim World, Battle Brothers, Kenshi = probably over a 1K hours in those games, so don't tell me this game is not for me.

However, the stop-motion,  choppy presentation of this game kills any sort of joy. It is 2023, can someone please make all those sprites, screens and everything move fluidly, like it is in Rim World? In 2023, there must be a technology to achieve this, right?

In its current state, this game looks exactly like it did several years ago with fancy tiles applied. 

I bought it because I want to support the author. But in all honesty, since you have to deal with the choppy presentation anyway, might as well use the original  version.

I watched tutorials from Kruggsmash, Quill18, etc. but never got far and stopped trying. Like many others, I waited for the Steam release.

Dwarf Fortress is not an easy game. There is a tutorial but it doesnt really hold your hand for too long.
If you dont like trial and error, reading up on things or watching videos, then this game is probably not for you.

I played the tutorial and 11 hours later im still working on my very first fortress. I expected to fail after 1 hour max and im amazed how well im doing so far. Maybe the first fortress has some special settings to make it ""easy"", i dont know.

My fortress has been partially flooded, because i tried running a waterfall through it,

I have a drawbridge over some water and drowned 2 dwarfes making the river deep enough so enemies can not just walk through it, One of them became a ghost and haunts my bridge now.

A dwarfen child has been abducted by some creature that managed to get in and out of the fortress without being killed. I dont know how or why only one dwarf fought that evil thing but it happened.

I tried raiding a place. The leader of my squad ended up being captured.

Stuff doesnt work out as i envision it most of the time but im having a great time regardless.

Theres things that could be better in my oppinion.
I think that important notifications should pop up in the middle of the screen (like a creature stealing a child) and maybe pause the game .
I believe it would help me if i could have everything work a bit slower. Everything happens a bit fast but maybe thats because im not used to the game.
The tutorial could be better. I understand that a tutorial can never explain everything in a game as complex as Dwarf Fortress but i dont think the tutorial is good. Videos and reading up on things helped me out.

Im not good enough at the game to complain much. Ill get the hang of it eventually.

I will fail over and over again. My fortresses will rise and fall but i think thats the most fun the game has to offer.
With every fortress i will try out new things, just to ruin it eventually and start a new one with new lessions learned and a new adventure ahead.",1670836904,1689623985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This realm is rarely found and even more rarely mastered. Yet, nestled within the complex code and esoteric aesthetic of Dwarf Fortress, one finds an intricate masterpiece that captures the heart of this digital Olympus.

From creators Tarn and Zach Adams, Dwarf Fortress isn't merely a game, but an intricate world simulator that sets a gold standard for strategic gameplay, woven within a rich tapestry of emergent storytelling. It is a game of profound complexity, astounding depth, and an enchanting challenge that would make even the most experienced strategists think twice before calling themselves masters.

Beneath the beautifully updated art lies a cosmos of astonishing complexity and breadth. Each dwarf, each creature, and each grain of sand is uniquely simulated, giving rise to an emergent narrative that is as compelling as it is unpredictable. In this procedurally generated universe, every mountain, every stream, every gust of wind is rich with history, teeming with life, and full of potential to tip the scales of destiny in any given scenario.

The gameplay of Dwarf Fortress, while initially daunting, is a remarkably rewarding experience. The core mechanics involve leading a group of dwarves to build and defend a successful fortress, but the depth of possibilities is staggering. From the craft of unique artifacts to the geopolitical and social dynamics of your fortress and its inhabitants, the decisions you make impact the evolution of your fortress in unpredictable, chaotic, and often hilarious ways.

One cannot review Dwarf Fortress without acknowledging its steep learning curve. But for those who endure, the game unveils its true nature - a complex and enthralling epic that offers limitless opportunities for creative and strategic thinking.

Beyond the mechanics, Dwarf Fortress is a breathtaking platform for storytelling. The triumphs and failures of your dwarven civilization are yours to orchestrate. Each dwarf carries a personality, with hopes, dreams, and fears. It’s the narrative that blossoms from these personalities that make the game truly shine. You'll find yourself laughing at the dwarves' shenanigans, sharing their sorrow in times of loss, and even gasping in awe at their feats of bravery against unexpected foes.

Dwarf Fortress is more than the sum of its parts. It’s a testament to the beauty of emergent gameplay, a love letter to strategic complexity, and a cornerstone in the cathedral of simulation games. It is a game of grand ambition and masterful execution that perpetually invites players to venture deeper into its mysterious, chaotic, and beguiling world. It sets a high bar, challenging players to master its mechanics and explore its sprawling narrative arcs.

In conclusion, Dwarf Fortress isn’t just a game. It is an extraordinary, multilayered journey that stands as a testament to the power of creative freedom and the potential of independent game development. Every fortress is a new story, every dwarf a new character, every decision a fresh adventure. Dwarf Fortress does more than entertain; it captivates, engages, and envelops you in its world, creating an unforgettable experience that will keep you coming back for more. It is, in short, a masterpiece.",1689255488,1689255488,True,15,1,0.60041576623916626,6,True,False,False

This game lacks character animations and honestly looks and plays like something from 1992 (not entirely a bad thing just a warning that it is much behind Rim World in terms of looking like a semi modern PC game). Your dwarves move about the game play area and you have to click on them and read a text box to see what they are doing. You cannot leave the starting play area except for sending a squad of dwarves out to other play areas / colonies and (again) read a test box about how their expedition went (i.e. you cannot view them once they leave your starting play area). This game does two things i like that Rim World lacks: you can dig down and build on ""levels"" below your starting area where in Rim World you can only build on the surface level. I also love the medieval fantasy setting with ogres, goblins, elves etc. If more was added to this game (like mainly animations) and the ability to leave your play area like Rim World it would be a much better game.

Steam Release was my first time playing this game, and I had only heard of DF, never played or even seen the old stuff.
So, should you buy the game? Probably.
Dorf Fort is a long-term resource and time management game in the vein of Rimworld, Oxygen Not Included, and other such games. What's the difference? Those games branched off of the path and spun the genre. But as far as records show, DF STARTED the genre in its purest form.
Your average gameplay loop is going to be creating a world, staring at the huge map looking for a 3x3 square to call home for an hour. You'll choose a civilization to hail from, and embark. You arrive, decide its home, and start building the fort. And then dying in year four, because a 200-foot-tall one-eyed cretin decided your fort looked like a great place to crap.

Then you'll do it again. You might embark with seven warriors to take back the fortress, creating a monument to the fallen original settlers you lost before. You'll suddenly realize that while you were building that first fort, the world around you grew. Now you have adventurers coming to this legendary fortress, and now you're a barony of over a hundred dwarves. You'll build two or six temples, a bunch of guildhalls, and start churning out artifacts.

Then you'll lose the fort to something else, a necromancer perhaps.
So you settle again, the same core civilization of Dwarves. Trying to make their place. Then you'll remember that you can retire a fortress, and the AI will take over. So you go three years, retire, and hop to another. And dwarves from that now thriving fort will show up in trader caravans. Some come to live in the new fort. And you realize, again, this is a living world. Your actions aren't arbitrary. You can decide you've done your job, and go build another.

There's not a victory condition. Set a goal and see it through. There is no outright game over, losing a fort is just history in motion. There are often four or five different dwarf kingdoms, so don't be afraid to start a new fort under a new king. There's no true winning either. Dig as deep as you like (don't, you idiot, you'll go straight to the CIRCUS and the CLOWNS will get you)


Go to war with the local necromancers, build a temple fort to Kobolds, or create a fortress where your only export is diamond encrusted mugs forged by an angry old codger in the heart of a volcano. It'll be fun. So, Urist, boot up that wiki.

Love it. There are so many sprites!!! I have completely converted to the mouse interface by now, and I like it. It lags, but the UI is good. [strike]If I have the game unpaused and click ""Stocks"" it pauses for a few seconds before the Stocks screen loads. This is understandable, because it is loading a list of thousands of items, but it should be mentioned.[/strike] With my 10 year old 200 dwarf fort on my i5 12600K I hover around 50fps. This is with flowing water and a magma pump. It should be noted that when the game is unpaused, if I try to click, for example, ""chop trees"", the UI lags and won't register clicks. Pausing before issuing commands has no issue.

This game requires a video tutorial. I have watched some years ago, I recommend captnduck's DFVIDTUTS2015 playlist. That is for the old version of the game, but you'll get a ton of info that still applies. If you have never played Dwarf Fortress, please, for all that is dwarven, WATCH OR READ A GUIDE BEFORE LEAVING A REVIEW. This game is not for babies. I've played hundreds of hours and today I was still reading the wiki learning how to tame animals and breed a grizzly bear army.

One thing about difficulty. Do you want a tip to make the game less frustrating, or a little easier? Probably save you a few forts? This tip is a bit OP. If you want the struggle, don't read this: [spoiler]Cage traps are very powerful. They can be constructed early game. They are built with mechanisms at a mechanic shop and cages built by a carpenter. Your dwarves and animals can walk on cage traps without triggering them.[/spoiler]

As an experienced player, this Steam version is an upgrade. The visual and audio changes are superb, and all the other changes are personal preference. After 70 hours I have completely converted to the new controls and UI. The only negatives are the UI lag and unavoidable fps death. I've built a pretty big fort and yes, it halved my fps, but it runs at 50fps. It just takes a little longer for time to pass. Best colony sim. None of the copies are as good as Dwarf Fortress.

There was an issue that made graphical rendering slow down to less than 10fps whenever you moved the camera. After a rather silly amount of time in an experimental beta, the library updates that fixed this were finally promoted to the stable branch.

And if anything's a microcosm of the DF experience, it's that.

This game is brilliant. It's more complicated than almost any similar title, and as near as I can tell, inspired its entire genre. It's a blast to play, and the hours will fly by in joy. The music is amazing - I didn't know I needed dwarven drinking songs in their original dwarven, but apparently I did.

But it is also rife with bugs, some of which have been known for over a decade. You'll need tools to manage the bugs - DFHack is a free mod that contains tools for exactly this, and is available on Steam. It also fixes some odd omissions, like the lack of blueprinting. I'd consider it basically essential.

Here's a link to the decade old bucket bug, in case you don't believe me. DFHack has a way to automatically empty all buckets in your fortress to work around the issue. https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=4230

The steam local community is a little new, and there's a lot of misinformation around the current issues with the game.

I absolutely recommend you go to the Dwarf Fortress File Depot and download the 47.05 r11 PeredexisErrant starter pack. I cannot at this time recommend you actually play the Steam Release. The official tileset has some charm to it, and I don't dislike it. I still play with the ASCII or one of the other tilesets, but it's not bad.

The music might grow on me if I listened to the music, but for me it's the vaguely flamenco guitar track, something from Doom 2, or silence.

The mouse controls frustrate me. Old DF was keyboard only, with the DFHack utility patching in some minor mouse controls. I and many others would still play entirely with keyboard, due to accessibility reasons. A mouse is inherently more difficult to navigate menus with than keys.

That brings me to the menus. Old menus were a mess. New menus are a different mess. Old menus you could learn the keybind, and once you memorized it you'd slam through them navigating deep into something in a second. Now most of those are buttons you need to click, with no associated keybinds. This means you now require a mouse to play Dwarf Fortress. \

In addition to this, certain features that used to exist in the older versions have been removed. One-Step has been removed, so there's no advancing the simulation slowly. Things have been moved from one menu or list to another, and it seems to have as much internal consistency as it used to. 

Cutting trees used to be a single entry in the Designations, now it's a button by itself. This is baffling, as cutting trees is something you will only do for maybe ten minutes at the start. After that, Wood is a scarcely used, but essential resource. This is certainly not a thing you should devote limited UI space to.

Cutting trees was D - T - Enter - Shift and arrow or numpad - Enter - Escape to close the menu. This might seem like a lot. It is not. From the home row on the keyboard it takes maybe two seconds to designate a large area to cut. Now you wiggle your mouse to find the pointer, go to the bottom of the screen to click the small button, move your mouse to the area, click one corner, move to the other corner, click the other corner, right click to clear the mouse. This requires more precision and means more moving of the hands to do the same task.

I will begin playing the steam release once there is a legacy UI and Legacy Keybinding option. Give me back my three panels, give me my Designate.",1688858012,1688858012,True,2,0,0.510178089141845703,4,True,False,False

It has been claimed to be one of the most complex games ever made, I wouldn't let that deter you from trying the game. Most things in the game make sense, it has a heavy focus on setting up industry chains, like you designate someone as a hunter, they hunt wild animals in the area, they bring the animal carcass to a butcher who turns it into cookable meat, raw hides, bones etc, the raw hides are used by the tanner to turn into hides used by the leathermaker to make leather clothing.

You can have a lot of dwarves, compared to Rimworld, this has more focus on automation, instead of micromanaging individual pawns in Rimworld, here you can for example set up work orders in a list of priorities, so that your carpenter only makes 1 new barrel for drinks, if there is currently less than 10 available empty barrels. Rimworld has automation too, but I would say Dwarf fortress has even more of a focus on it, perhaps as a necessity due to the sheer amount of dwarves and items involved. 

You can do some fun engineering projects, like diverting a river to get water and waterwheels providing power inside your fortress, or a water/magma chamber trap for any intruders where you drop the water/magma on them, let them drown or fry, then empty out the liquid and the loot will even stay if you set up grates to inhibit solid items from flowing through. This has a lot of possibilities in terms of creativity; if you can conjure it up in your mind, odds are that there is some way of implementing it in the game.

Maybe the main obstacle with this game is trying to put what you have in mind into practice, as you have to perform it within the confines and framework of the menus mostly navigated with the keyboard only. The graphics also don't necessarily make everything clear all the time. 

Consequently, if you want to play this, you have to expect to use some time to learn and experiment with how the different mechanics work and how to utilize the oldschool controls to get it done. Also, you will probably end up checking the wikis for the game a lot or guides, as many things aren't explained in-game.",1688838786,1688839661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]My reviews are not only on games, but are also on the studio/developers and their community. If you want to know more about the people who made these games and the community that supports them, then please take a moment to read my review before buying the game.[/h1]

When this game first came out in the ASCII format years ago, people loved playing the game, and the concept of it. One of people's biggest complaints was how the game doesn't look good in the ASCII format and the game is often hard to read and understand. People created mods for this game in order to make the game better looking, which is what we have here today.

Yep, this is a game where the developers took hundreds and thousands of community assets, and put them in the game. There were no credits to the people who originally created the assets, and the developers refused to pay them for their work.

Have you ever wondered why there are only a total of 51 English reviews on this game, and only 6 turns out to be negative? And out of all the positive reviews, more people found the negative reviews helpful than the others.

Those negative reviews compares the game to Rim World, ""but with clunky and with weird controls"".

The game performs terribly the longer you play. This game will heavily use your RAM and CPU to simply save and load, and the longer you play, the longer it will take for the game to save and load. The data is saved in a raw-text format, just like in the ASCII version when the game came out years ago, and raw-text save files takes much more space that other format. A good example would be Ark Survival Evolved, where it saves all your player data in a raw-text format, if you are playing on a server cluster, your game will bound to crash if you have too many engrams (blueprints) learned on your player. 

Despite my gameplay hours on Steam, I have already spent weeks playing this game, and my entire folder adds up to be larger than 60 GB, despite the game being very small when you first download it. 

▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲

Players have reported multiple and many game crashes, bugs that leads to crashes, and bugs that breaks the game ever since the launch on Steam, and none of the issues have been addressed and fixed by the developers.

▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲

There are way too many interfaces and UIs that are difficult to use, block your view, or are insanely unintuitive. The text and font is completely giant, the icons are massive, the interface is like trying to navigate through a maze. Nothing in the interface provides any useful interface either, you either know how to use it, or are going in blind.

The trading interface is a prime example of bad UI design. You get a giant prompt where it lists everything you can trade with, and you have to manually specify what you want to trade one by one. There is no easy controls to for example, bulk select, where many other games do have.

The community of Dwarf Fortress is usually very nice and chill, but there will always be the toxic few individuals, much like in majority of games.

There are people who has been playing the ASCII version of the game for over 10 years, and they buy the Steam version when it gets released and praise the developers for the work they ""did"". Those people will go out of their way to gaslight themselves, pretending the issues don't exist such as the crash bugs, and save corruption.

[b]Some other points:[/b]

> Almost all of the hotkeys that are in the original ASCII game are either gone or broken.
> The Steam version doesn't have the Adventure mode included, which was the community's most favorite game mode.
> Despite the launch on Steam, there have been no actual QoL updates or features added.
> Having gigantic save files means the game itself will continuously re-write your drive, which will cause heavy fragmentation and damage your drive.
> This game has an extremely steep learning curve, it has many hidden mechanics that the tutorial doesn't tell you about. It took me multiple days to learn that traders from different factions will immediately leave if you trade them something they don't like. 
> If you set up your Fortress near a river, it will continue to generate basically infinite amount of clam shells, and this alone will overload your dwarfs with just moving the shells into the stockpiles.
> People who complains about bugs not getting fixed on the Steam Discussion forums will be silenced by the forum moderators.
> People started complaining about how this game doesn't go on sale during Steam Sales last year, and the best the developers can do is a mere 10% off. What's the difference if the original price is £24.99, and after 10% off its £22.49?

[h1]Conclusion and Advice[/h1]

Stay far away from this game, it was extremely over-hyped just like Cyberpunk 2077. If you want to have the original experience, then I recommend trying out the ASCII version otherwise.

However, if you are willing to put in the time and effort, it is an incredibly rewarding experience. The game is full of surprises, and there is always something new to discover.

If you are looking for a game that is truly unique and challenging, I highly recommend Dwarf Fortress. It is a game that will stay with you long after you have finished playing it.

Here are some of the things that make Dwarf Fortress so special:

The level of detail is staggering. There are literally thousands of different things that you can do in the game, and each one has its own unique set of rules and mechanics. Don't be scared by all the memes and etc. you've heard about how impenetrable it is. It's kinda Flanderized at this point. Take it slow and you too can get stuck in.

The emergent gameplay is repeatedly incredible. There are no set goals or objectives in the game, so you are free to do whatever you want, however you want. This leads to a lot of unexpected and interesting situations. The game is incredibly complex, with a seemingly endless number of things to do. You can dig for minerals, build weapons and armor, brew alcohol, and even bid your dwarves to create art. The possibilities are pretty much endless. I'm not going to muddy the review by posting some insane story about some madness that happened; enough have done that already that my doing so wouldn't add anything to the conversation. 

Though with that being said...Not that it affects the gameplay itself, but the community is amazing. There are a large number of dedicated fans who have created a wealth of such stories...and, more usefully, lots of tools and resources to help new players get started.

I thought the graphics looked bad... BUT I gave it a chance and refunded it after seeing the horrible menu
time skip to 6 months later... I was like why not try and play it again and now I have a headache
I was admitted into the hospital yesterday and just got out because of a horrible migraine that caused me to faint which costed me 2,000$ which is just unbelievable. The game is choppy as hell and the graphics are mind mindbogglingly  horrible. The game is so over hyped and everybody thinks its so fun but the tutorial was horrible and didn't tell you how to survive or what things you need to build up a fortress and survive. I know its supposed to be free play and do whatever you want but I legit played for an hour and had no idea what I was doing and ended up trying to expand until I got bored.

Some criticisms. 

* The hotkeys are either totally gone or nonsensical, In the classic version you could do everything with hotkeys if you wanted, Now some things you need to click a lot to do simple stuff, its really annoying, All of this was in the core game, why would you remove it ? 

* The combat and event log is gone, This was a core part of the classic version and helped paint the story of your fort. 

* No adventure mode ? Seriously this was one of the most fun parts of DF.

Example when you craft apparel that comes in pairs like boots, gloves, socks you craft just one of pair - either left or right (and since when socks can be left or right?). I don't know if it's rng determined or not the idea is just bad.  Also AI of your settles doesn't exist. You designated stockpile for stones or ore? Nope they will leave boulders lying in their rooms. Speaking of ore at some point i wanted to make some iron. Of course i can't just make iron i can either make pig iron  (which requires different minerals) or smelt ore which in turn gives me iron. Alright if the developer wants to be so anal about things what sort of iron do i get? Is it grey, white, malleable or ductile iron? Do developer even know what is the difference or just heard the term somewhere? I guess they don't since pig iron would be pre requisite to ""iron"" we get in game. 

The last straw for me was animal husbandry. This system (like many others) is just bad. Let's say you have 10 chickens but you would like to  have 20 as constant population and slaughter any excess. So first you have to manually lock them in pen so your dudes don't take eggs away (you have to add nesting boxes but that is logical). Now we wait chicks hatch and hatch until we have 30. So now stupid me thought that i can let the my guys pick the eggs. Nope - all the newly hatched chick were not added to chicken pen in via room managment tab so the wandered off on sight seeing touraround your fortress. Ok we fix that. Then let's go to butchers table and set up population control order. Nope you can not do that. What you can do is manually set which animals are geting butchered via single clicking them in pet/animals tab which is subsection of dwarves menu.

Every system i've in this game is like that - a lot of manual labour to achieve simplest task. Imagine you are sending someone to a bakery to buy some bread. That person understands you but you have to write down EVERY action they have to take to get the bread. So it would be something like that: get up from bed, get dressed, go downstairs, put on your shoes (both of them), check what is weather like... and so on and so forth. 

Audio is just ambient noises expected in mine /workshop/cave without any connection to where is the camera.

It also has a great legacy and casts a titanic, decidedly non-dwarf size shadow over the game industry. Many other fantastic titles take inspiration or pay homage to Dwarf Fortress. Our modern videogame concept of a dwarf might be as much rooted in Dwarf Fortress as it is in Lord of the Rings; dwarves in DRG or WoW bow respectfully to their heritage.

The gameplay is great, again, I mean it literally. Forts get so huge that they bring high end machines to a crawl. Gameplay is a giant maze of mechanics and controls. The procedurally generated ingame world has more events, characters, lore and history than the average fantasy novel. Civilizations rise and fall, and it's entirely up to you whether that wide open overworld means anything to you at all. At least until the world forcefully comes knocking.

Since it is randomly generated text most is not coherent but the fanboys will tell you that is acceptable and if you read everything you will get a few lines you can form a story from and then tell people how exciting your text based adventure was.

The text makes it seem exciting but in reality it is far from that. My colony fought a dragon, actual onscreen fight was over in like 5 seconds due to the game having zero animations but the text was hundreds of lines detailing this grand battle. What I saw on the screen was a tiny dragon sprite that bumped into tiny dwarf sprites and left tiny blood splatters on the ground. I say bumped into because the game runs on ticks of a clock and each tick the non animated sprites jump one square like some old Atari game from the 80's.

It is an easy game despite some wild reviews claiming it is a very deep and complex game. Yes it keeps track of how many teeth a dwarf has, their eyelids and other body parts but all of that fluff has no meaning in the game other than more fluff text. One of my dwarfs got his arm cut off in battle but to my surprise he could still carry and fight with a 2 handed sword. One dwarf needed crutches but he still moved, fought and worked like nothing was wrong.

All of the stories you hear about the exciting adventures in this game came from those thousands of lines of generated text not from watching the screen and playing the game. If you just play it like other popular colony sims it is boring because it is just tiny sprites and cheap graphics, the books worth of generated text is where the game is so you pay for a book generator not an actual graphical game.

Even with very minimal graphics it struggles to hit 30 fps on a Geforce 4080 with 16GB of vram, 64GB of system ram and a 24 core i9 cpu overclocked to 6.5 mhz. My gaming rig can run Skyrim with 2200 mods set on ultra settings where it looks like a movie instead of a game and never drop under 60 fps even in big cities with tons of npc's but this game runs like total crap and looks really bad on a 42"" 4k monitor.

One last thing, this game has no tech tree or progression. You start the game with everything in the game available as far as every crafting station unlocked. Once you setup all the stations and assign work orders you can leave and it will easily run itself with no input from you. It is easy mode colony sim. I had 7 dwarfs, setup everything and went to watch a 2 hour movie, After 2 hours of no input from me not only was my colony still alive but it had grown to 75 dwarfs. 

There are many great colony sims out and honestly they are more deserving of your money and time than this one is. IMO this should have remained as a free game on their website and never had a paid version released because it honestly feels like the devs just wanted to do a quick cash grab on Steam. My advice if you are interested is go download the free version, grab one of the many tilesets to add graphics (the original game is all ASCII characters) and play the free version instead of paying them any money. To me releases like this give indie games a bad name because it appears devs like this only come to Steam to get rich then they go away laughing at how much they made.

The horde of fanboys who pushed this with those exaggerated reviews in the first 48 hours of release just makes it appear to me to be a scam. Go look at the praising reviews and notice the hours played, most are under 2 hours played and many under 1 hour. If you click to view their profile you will see they still do not play this version of the game yet they praise it like it is the best game made.

Here's what's great about this version:
- Graphics! They're great, much easier on the eyes than the ASCII version, though this is a matter of personal preference of course. I'm mostly happy about square tiles.
- Music! I do kind of miss the Classic theme which has been burned into my memory, but the new music is amazing and worth a listen. 
- UI! The new UI is much easier to use for beginners, a group which I am very much a part of. There are a lot of QOL features (such as multi-placing) that aren't obvious, and it will cause muscle memory issues for veterans, but overall this is a much appreciated update.
- Mouse controls! That is all. 
- Mod support through Steam Workshop! I haven't played around with it, I probably won't for a while, but it is welcome.
- The save system! It allows you to save to different timelines in parallel, which is amazing and a very cool idea I wish other games had. Maybe other games have it and I just live under a rock.

Here's what should be improved:
- No Adventure mode (yet)
- Camera controls are choppy in the main Fortress mode, where they move like in Classic. The camera can be moved smoothly when choosing an embark site, which leads me to believe a smooth camera could make it to the main gamemode eventually. 
- Resolution weirdness
- Some UI elements overlap the main view (the main source of annoyance for me was the ""Find Embark Site"" form overlapping a quarter of the map) and do not move away when they should, which is a bummer.
- I've had the game crash once, which is annoying.

Overall, this is the best way to jump into this legendary game for beginners. Veterans might prefer to stick to Classic, and I think everyone should give the unaltered DF a try, just to see how it is; but for what Tarn and Zach wanted to do, which is to expand the reach of their magnum opus, it is fantastic.

While there is a charm to the old 'graphics' of the OG Dwarf Fortress, for the uninitiated it can be almost impossible to approach it without some major learning. The Steam DF (AKA 'Premium') has beautiful spritework, designs, and is visually easy to figure out what exactly is going on compared to the ASCII style. However, if you're an old player uncertain about this - There's always the ability to turn on the OG look!

For the setting, Dwarf Fortress is a pretty classical 'low fantasy' setting but with some darker elements. There's really only 'evil' magic users such as necromancers. Your dwarfs do not and cannot use magic (unless they themselves become necromancers). But, your Dwarfs have a great boon under their beards: The riddle of steel and high quality armor - as well as your own noggin to make devious traps, pit falls, or weaponizing draw bridges to smash unsuspecting nay-do-wells. Normally the only civilizations you will mostly come across are: Elves, Humans, and other Dwarfs. Though there are 'animal men' beings that occasionally come by and are either a problem or soon-to-be problem.

The combat in Dwarf Fortress can be visceral, brutal, horrifying, and even depressing - if you read the combat logs at least. Otherwise visually the sprites just kind of stand next to each other while blood forms around them and they eventually kill over dead. Trust me, a big part of this game is using your imagination paired with the detailed combat logs and the thoughts of both your dwarfs, and your opponents!

Dwarf Fortress is, from what I have heard, the inspiration for games such as Rimworld. All with the complexity and wildness that is managing moods of your citizens, their food, health, drinks, etc. Your dwarfs have their own needs, wants, desires, moods, personalities, thoughts, and so much more. You will have to overcome so many issues and rise from worrying about if you have enough crops for the first few years, to battling horrific monsters that will come and try to make your fort into their new home.

Last, but certainly not least is the crazy modding scene that exists within Dwarf Fortress. Don't like playing Dwarfs? There's countless mods that let you play as anything and (almost) everything to your heart's desires. Game not hard enough? There's a mod for that! The modding scene can only go up from here and it gets better almost every week.

Dwarf Fortress is a game that holds no punches. There IS thankfully a tutorial, but once you learn the ropes - it's up to you if you can dig deeper and see what the world has to offer.

If you've spent any time with Rimworld, Prison Architect, Space Station 13, *Minecraft*, or any of the games those games would themselves go on to influence, you've felt the shockwave that originated with Dwarf Fortress's original 2006 release.

There aren't many unique things left to say about Dward Fortress, as the musings of its utterly insane cult following have churned endless discussion over the years, but I'll say this:

_This is the game my 12-year-old self dreamed of making._ I dreamed of building intricate world simulations, of making material systems that influence the way you make things, of computer-aided storytelling in worlds far more interesting than our own. As an adult, I laughed at this naivete. And now I see that it's not only possible, but it'd been done already, before I'd even had the dreams to begin with. It's literally a childhood dream come true.

I'm sure you've heard the tales of DF's difficulty. And difficult it is -- things can go wrong for countless reasons (""losing is fun"") but the main sticking point, invariably among people I asked, has always been the graphics, and the interface.

Both of those things have been vastly redone for this release, as you can tell.

Dwarf Fortress is free and always will be, but what you pay for is a modern, streamlined interface, an incredible soundtrack, and gorgeous sprite art directed by two DF community titans, Mayhem and Ironhand. The price may seem steep, but the renewed experience is worth it, IMO.

It's not perfect yet, but Dwarf Fortress' commercial debut is stunning, and I keenly await what the future holds.

....DAMNIT, I forgot to set the well up and now everyone's dying of dehydration. One sec.",1670359108,1686434118,True,1,0,0.441117763519287109,0,True,False,False

In adventure mode it was simpler* and the gameplay loop was clear and direct to tell you what you did wrong by looking at the log, you died because of dehydration and trying to fight an animal twice your size, learn how to drink water. You died because you had sprint toggled on and you passed out falling into a river and drowned, learn how to use your legs properly. You died because of the cold, learn to ask a friend to stay inside for a night and so on. 

In the game, it's complexity is a blessing and a curse. It leads to brilliant and hilarious situations but also leads me to not knowing exactly what caused my colony to crash especially without a log to sift through. I need feedback if I ever want to move on from a hole-in-the-dirt 'fortress' to the megalopolis that I saw in adventure mode. I need to be able to see numbers like 57% of your colony spent 70% of their time crying into their empty mugs or 39% of your haulers spent all of their time moving the same items to the same stockpiles 3 because you clicked on the wrong one and created an infinite loop of suffering. Right now the game has practically no data besides basic stockpiles but I've had colonies fail even though I had 20 drinks and food for every dwarf. 

Honestly sitting there as your last dwarf dies whom you named and watched closely by a weak goblin siege when you have 100s of steel bars and untouched armor because my squads for some reason didn't think to put them on and run into battle to get slaughtered like that feels honestly bad. The only thing I could do was sit back in my chair and stare as the river continued to flow and the lungfish mysteriously piled on it's shores and the never ending stream of cats get murdered by the goblins blood pooling at the bottom of stairwells. I leaned nothing from fortress mode so how do I ever expect to have a different result the next time I play? How do I expect to have 'fun' when it's the same story, different characters. Same song, different mountains.

Many moons ago, long before its arrival on the hallowed grounds of Steam, I embarked upon a journey into its depths. Alas, the treacherous path was fraught with perils, for the labyrinthine [b] UI [/b] and the intricate web of its game design cast a shadow of uncertainty upon my soul.

But lo and behold, the passage of time has brought forth a transformation of epic proportions! The artisans behind Dwarf Fortress have wrought a visual metamorphosis that surpasses all expectations. It is as if they took the brush of an ethereal painter and breathed life into every pixel, creating a vibrant tapestry that beckons with promises of grandeur and adventure.

Gone are the days of stumbling blindly through an enigmatic maze of menus and commands. The reimagined interface now extends a welcoming embrace, guiding even the most hesitant of souls with gentle hands. It is a symphony of usability, a harmonious marriage between complexity and accessibility, rendering the once daunting fortress management a dance of elegant mastery.

And what of the game itself? Ah, my friend, Dwarf Fortress is nothing short of a magnum opus, a testament to the boundless passion and craftsmanship of its creators. Within its virtual realm, you shall find a living tapestry woven from the threads of love and dedication. From the minutiae of each [b] dwarven [/b] life to the grand tapestry of emergent stories, every element pulsates with a sense of purpose and authenticity.

As you delve deeper into the rich soil of Dwarf Fortress, you shall witness the marvel of its procedural generation, where vast landscapes spring forth like dreams from the annals of an ancient civilization. The very stones sing with a story yet untold, inviting you to carve your own destiny amidst the winding tunnels and towering halls.

Crafting, survival, diplomacy, and warfare intertwine in a ballet of gameplay, each step demanding strategic acumen and unyielding resolve. The choices you make, the alliances you forge, and the battles you wage shall echo through the annals of history, etching your name into the eternal tapestry of [b] Dwarf Fortress[/b].

So, my dear comrade in exploration, I beseech you to embark upon this masterpiece of interactive artistry. Dwarf Fortress has emerged from the crucible of time, adorned with new visual splendors, and transformed into a game that transcends mere entertainment. It is a journey that shall test your mettle, ignite your imagination, and leave an indelible mark upon your gaming soul. Embrace its allure, and bask in the glory of a truly remarkable experience.

Alright, here's the deal. I've been a gamer since the days when 'Pong' was considered cutting-edge tech, and let me tell you, Dwarf Fortress has been an absolute blast. Why? Well, it's like our favorite 2D digging and building game, Terraria, just took a heavy dose of depth and complexity. The two games share that special something – that spark of exploration and construction – but Dwarf Fortress does it in a way that's like 3D chess with digging and dwarves.

It's been 800 hours for me – I know, right? Who has the time? Apparently, I do, because this game's got me hooked. It's that sense of discovery, that raw joy of ""what's around the corner?"" that I haven't experienced since my days lost in the Terraria's underground jungles and hellish depths.

This game, though, it's a wild ride. Imagine running your own underground city with a horde of dwarves. Every decision you make, every tunnel you carve, it's all part of this grand saga that you get to write. It's half city-planner, half RPG, and a whole lot of fun.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it – this game is tough. I'm still trying to figure out how to get mist working properly in my fortress, and it's no easy feat. Dwarf Fortress doesn't just want you to follow a set of instructions, oh no, it wants you to understand its crazy physics and make it work yourself. It's a challenge, but the kind that keeps you coming back for more.

It reminds me of those old-school games where the manual was thicker than a phone book and half the fun was figuring out how it all worked. It's like that, but in a procedurally generated world with so many layers it'll make your head spin.

So if you're an old codger like me, someone who cut their teeth on games that didn't hold your hand and challenged you to really think, then I reckon you'll find a lot to love in Dwarf Fortress. If you loved Terraria, and want to see what it would look like on overdrive, give Dwarf Fortress a go. You won't regret it.

It's painful to write this, since I really like the free version of DF so much and only bought this version because I wanted to support the author, but with the amount of CTDs I've had personally I can't recommend anyone else buy this.

It's super fun, and the new graphics are great, but there is little more frustrating than putting in a bunch of work on a new section of your fortress only to have it disappear when the game inexplicably closes.  My PC is relatively new and reasonably fast with plenty of memory.  I ran memtest86 all night long followed by the y-cruncher stress test for long enough for temperature to stabilize and encountered zero problems.  Drivers are all up to date.

Clearing the errorlog and looking at it after a crash often reveals it to be entirely empty.  Maybe after a few more updates things will be fixed, right now though, it's essentially unplayable it's crashing so often.

The game's ability to evoke a range of emotions and create memorable tales is a testament to its remarkable design.

[h1]Steep Learning Curve and Niche Appeal[/h1]
It's important to note that Dwarf Fortress's complexity and steep learning curve may not appeal to everyone.

975370,128071659,76561198076278129,0,11,9699,0,350,1698854590,"Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe, I was just outside Barcelona, hiking in the foothills of mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw, a beautiful woman, bathing herself. but she was crying...

I hesitated, watching, struck by her beauty. And also by how her presence; the delicate curve of her back, the dark sweep of her hair, the graceful length of her limbs, even her tears, added to the majesty of my surroundings. I felt my own tears burning behind my eyes, not in sympathy, but in appreciation of such a perfect moment.

She spied me before I could compose myself. But she didn't cry out. Instead our eyes held and she smiled, enigmatically, fresh tears still spilling down her cheeks. I was frozen. I knew nothing about this woman, and yet, as we stood on opposite sides of a pool of water, thousands of miles from my own home and everyone I had ever known, I felt the most intense connection. Not just to her, but to the earth, the sky, the water between us. And also to the entirety of mankind. As if she symbolized thousands of years of the human condition.

I wanted to go to her, to comfort her, to probe this feeling of belonging I had never encountered before. But I couldn't. Because I knew that if I spoke, if she spoke, that moment would be ruined. And I knew I would need the memory of that moment to carry me through the inevitable dark patches throughout my life.

And so I watched her lower her hand, turn, and slowly walk to the shore opposite me. The rest of her perfect form was gradually revealed to me, and I held my breath as I watched her disappear behind a copse of trees near the water.",1670370857,1685628123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then you learn about how your dwarfs all have individual needs and personalities. Then you learn about all the different types of animals and how you can train and domesticate some. Then you open the justice menu. Then you open the nobles menu and realize how they all need certain requirements and how others can mandate the production and ban exports on others. Then you dig really deep and open a cave and forgotten beasts start invading. Then you realize they all can do different things and some can be made of literal fire. Then you dig deeper and discover magma. Then you dig in the wrong spot and spawn a demon that kills a lot of your men. Then you dig too deep and accidentally open up hell and demons kill everyone. Then you load your save and open the map, and so on and so on. 

Though, as fun as this game is, it has some flaws. Mainly the sheer amount of RNG. When you open up the map and want to exterminate the local goblin population because they're douches who siege you, you find out they have a stronghold of 10000 men. 1000 of which you need to kill. Your soldiers can only kill like 9 max each, and they can repopulate. The only way to kill more in your raids is with really strong war animals. Like elephants, cave dragons, jabberers, or just other giant animals. The problem is, the first one can only maybe be gotten from Human Caravans very rarely, and you need 1 male and 1 female or in the very rare chance your civ just happened to domesticate elephants while generating the world. The next 2 are real rng just depending on where you embarked and insane spawn rng in the caves, and again you need to get 1 of each sex. All the others are just rarely gotten from elven caravans, and after giving them hundreds of thousands of dwarf bux in golden crafts as offerings and cleaning out their caravans every time they show up for multiple in game years, they haven't shown up with a single one. Also the base game doesn't have a tool to mass dismantle furniture such as beds or tables (this is fixed with DFHack, and before you point out the fact that you can spawn units via DFHack, as of the time of writing this review, you can't, it's bugged.) 

Another thing is how good/fun settling by certain landmarks can be, if you settle by a volcano, you win if you can handle magma properly as you can super easily fuel your forges, smelters, kilns and certain furnaces. While you can do this in any spawn location by discovering the great magma sea, you need to be a bit more competent with it and knowing how to transport magma up z levels safely otherwise your dwarves are stuck hauling all your ore down hundreds of flights of stairs, which pretty much just makes the point of having magma as a fuel source rather moot. 


This thing is probably just a bug, but sometimes names in the justice system are just.. wrong. Like the first name is right but the last one is kinda wrong. 

One last negative thing is how easily caravan pack animals can get spooked, causing merchants to bug out, if the animals get spooked before they arrive the merchants will bug out and never truly unload because one of their animals that contains their cargo is just somewhere else. If they get spooked after the merchants arrive and unload the merchants can't ever leave.

Returning to embark locations, but a lot more positive now. the absolute choice of embark locations is insane. If you want a really hard time, just embark in a haunted swamp and watch as those winds fuck you up. If you want an easier time, just embark in a forest, plains or just by a volcano. 

Another really cool thing are the details in the world, if you get a book that contains ""the secrets of life and death"" anyone who reads that becomes a necromancer. They become essentially immortal as in they don't need to eat, sleep or drink and never age. And nothing else really changes about them except that they can raise corpses to fight. They don't become evil and try to kill your fort and your status doesn't change at all aside from the fact that the necromancer tower you most likely stole the book/scroll from is really angry at you and will siege you occasionally.

Cons:[list]
[*]The learning curve can still be steep for newcomers, as understanding the intricacies of the game's mechanics requires patience and dedication.

Many things cannot be placed on their own. Furniture and such need to be built first then placed.
Acquire material> Order item at specific workshop > place item

It's a bit of a chore, it's not intuitive. It can become a second job just learning things that should have been straightforward to begin with. 

If you're used to Factorio, Oxyen Not Included or Rimworld's intuitive and easier to navigate UI then this game will offer a lot of initial challenges just learning to place simple structures or furniture. 

The game feels dated and the controls tedious.

If you're unwilling to endure and learn dated 90's eras style of controls, it's not worth your time.  The game offers a great deal of complexity but take caution if you're used to modern games.

05/2023: 

The UI is still horrible. It's awful. Underneath the trash UI is a great game. 

I still can't recommend it. You need several hours of gameplay just to get used to the Interface and understand the backwards obtuse logic the game follows when placing the simplest of items. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST DIRECTLY PLACE A FREAKING CHAIR???? Good luck to you when you have to reorganize dozens of furniture. There's no mass orders for that. 

Take flooring. Rimworld, you click on the flooring icon and set the material then drag-click to place the order. Rimworld will take into account any door, furniture and items then tailor the order to that. It even gets better with mods when replacing stuff.

Dwarf Fortress, you click on Build menu>constructions>Flooring. Drag click then choose the materials needed. Now the problem is that when there's obstacles in the way you have drag and click again avoiding said obstacles. If you multiple rooms like say 10 bedrooms, you have to do this ten times then again clicking on what material to use each time. It's bonkers. It's carpal tunnel syndrome territory. 

Zeus Master of Olympus was released in 2000. That game has 10x better interface, clear and informative!
This game still doesn't have that. Prepare to watch Youtube tutorials and Google everything. 20 year difference and the ""modern"" game DF has just the most unintuitive interface and build/construct logic.

Want to dig deep and unearth treasures and horrors?

It seems that Dwarf Fortress was not created for people who simply want to learn a complicated yet well-made, polished, and rewarding simulation game.

No, Dwarf Fortress seems to be made for masochists who enjoy:
1) Endless, pointless micromanagement
2) The challenge of learning (and adapting to) obtuse, convoluted, and bug-ridden systems

Honestly, Dwarf Fortress can barely be considered a game. It is homebrew colony simulation software that just happens to have a tangled array of interactive game-like features tacked on to it -- features that are often inconsistent, incomplete, and/or broken. Even the functional bits lack polish and clarity of purpose.

It is an absolute shame that the Dwarf Fortress development team lacks a competent game designer capable of shaping its rat's nest of old code and cruft into a fully functional and unified whole.

From top to bottom, Dwarf Fortress is amateurish. The interface is a clusterf**k of epic proportions. The psuedo-3D layer-cake design of the game world is ludicrously hacky. The way the various game entities navigate the play area is jank incarnate. I could go on and on.

Definitely has a much less intensive player learning curve, while still allowing for the same gameplay as the original. Definitely a recommended version of the game, and is worth the price if you're interested in this genre of game.
BUT
There's one thing that prevents me from calling this the definitive version of Dwarf Fortress. This version of the game does not have the logs, which are used to keep track of the story of your fortress. You can't go back and look at events from (in-game) months or years ago if you've already dismissed the alerts. My suggestion is to buy this version to learn the game and play a bit more casually, when you want a simple experience. Buy this game and then go download the OG Dwarf Fortress, which I consider to be the definitive addition.
Tarn, Zach, I speak to you now: When you have the time, the addition of the logs would certainly be appreciated and would truly make this version of Dwarf Fortress the definitive edition.",1684998044,1684998044,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

------------------
They finally updated to SDL2. The game still has issues, but at least the core engine components have been worked on. Changing to a Positive review since I have been convinced that more patches will come in the future.

Old Review
------------------
Game does not utilize GPU for some people because the game uses an outdated SDL 1.2 for its graphical framework. Because SDL also handles UI input, if too much graphical processing is being done then you will lose the ability to interact with the UI.

As a result, the game becomes unplayable unless you are playing on a very flat map with not that much sprite activity, and no resolution above 1080.

I will update the review back to positive if this is patched.",1670340107,1684989200,True,0,0,0.529808402061462402,5,True,False,False

The UI makes playing and enjoying the game a lot easier and there are notable improvements to performance, especially when generating new worlds. If you're already a DF player and are on the fence about paying for a free game, you get quite a lot more in this package than just the good feeling of supporting the devs.

If you haven't played Dwarf Fortress before, but you enjoy colony management games like Oxygen Not Included that have ridiculous levels of depth to their world simulation, you'll enjoy this. Build elaborate contraptions and watch them fail because you don't understand basic Newtonian physics. Start over and do it again until you master it and invent new elaborate contraptions to build.

If you ever wanted to know the innermost thoughts and feelings of a Dwarf, including who they're in love with and what they've been dreaming about, you'll enjoy this. Read through pages and pages of historical records to understand where your civilization came from. Read detailed logs of your Dwarves' thoughts and feelings. Use this information to keep them from going crazy, or to hunt down vampires and criminals, or just to pry into their private lives to find out who they're sleeping with.

However, for some of people, including me, Dwarf fortress is the kind of game we dreamed of playing when we were a child. Running a fortress within a fully simulated world. It's like reading a best selling never ending fantasy novel. It's complicated, it's sometimes messy, but by god, it is an absolute masterpiece of a game.

you WILL lose, cry and want to throw your pc, but if you're like me, you'll come back for more.

Tips to have extra fun:

Have easy to remember nicknames for your first dwarves, and any dwarves who lead significant lives so you can follow their stories and pay attention to their lives. At first you won't have time to follow the stories and that's fine. Eventually that'll become easier and learn how to use work orders.

Which brings me to work orders and DFhack. Use them. They will make life easier. DFhack for automatically engraving slabs for dead dwarves, because when you get to 200 dwarves... NOBODY wants to be clicking engrave slab every 2 seconds. Alongside with autofarming e.t.c.. dramatically improves the experience. Don't use it at first, but definitely when you get to a ton of dwarves, you'll want help with the stupid little things.

Other than that,

if you can find a way to plough through little frustrations, then it has got to be the BEST GAME EVER MADE.

It requires the wiki, and I hope they further the tutorial system and flesh it out more because of that, even if it is just simple wiki integration for the short term.

Slowly we gathered hordes of food, alcohol all the while mining into a small unassuming mountain hoping for safety when the time came. We armed ourselves and kept the peace. The people were merry, the taverns were many and the alcohol was endless. It was a place of entertainment and inclusion of all races. 
That was until the forest took offense to our Dwarven,Goblin,Human,Elf and Serpentman debauchery. The attack was swift and vicious. Our axe lord forces overwhelmed, fields burned and livestock decimated... We ran to the burrow hoping for safety, many doors line the path, crossbow dwarves at the ready... but it wasn't enough. Slowly the beast crushed the rest of our meager forces leaving only destruction in it's wake. That was the day the city was lost.

Dwarf Fortress: the titan of complexity where dwarf-driven creativity meets survival in a world teeming with delightful depth. Imagine a game of 3D chess with a twist of fantastical unpredictability.

[b]Gameplay[/b] - Exquisite Complexity (8.5/10): Dwarf Fortress is the dwarven artifact of the gaming world - intricate, multifaceted, and masterful. Your dwarven colony's whims are your command, and the wilderness, a ruthless arena of survival. The learning curve? As steep as a mountain's cliff side but equally rewarding once ascended.

[b]Graphics[/b] - No More ASCII (7.5/10): Dwarf Fortress has shed its ASCII shell for the Steam release. What we get is a charming, tile-based art style that's as colorful and lively as a dwarven feast. It might not be the Mona Lisa of gaming graphics, but it's a visual banquet for those used to the old ASCII diet.

[b]Sound[/b] - Subtle Soundscape (7/10): The sound design tiptoes like a sneaky kobold thief - subtle but effective. It's the soft humming in the backdrop of your dwarven drama, grounding you in its intriguing world.

[b]Replayability[/b] - Infinite Dwarven Chronicles (9/10): Dwarf Fortress is a bubbling cauldron of replayability. The dynamic, unpredictable world ensures no two games are alike, offering an endless supply of dwarven tales to tell.

[b]Accessibility[/b] - Daunting but Doable (6/10): Dwarf Fortress is like a trap-laden goblin fortress when it comes to accessibility. It won't hold your hand but for those brave enough to tackle the challenge, the sense of achievement is as satisfying as striking a rich vein of adamantine.

[b]Verdict[/b] - Dwarf Fortress is a paradoxical delight. It's intricate yet accessible, maddening but rewarding, harsh yet deeply captivating. Its tile-based graphical update makes it more approachable without sacrificing its signature complexity. If you're a fearless gamer seeking a challenge that's as tough and rewarding as forging a masterwork artifact, then Dwarf Fortress is a must-have. Remember, in the world of Dwarf Fortress, losing is fun. Prepare to have a blast!",1683871274,1684193789,True,5,0,0.579376518726348877,0,True,False,False

Very poor quality UI and UX, the underlying game is the same as ever, but its much harder to accept this mess of bugs and poor optimisation after paying for it.

The UI ignores mouse clicks constantly and is generally unresponsive at high resolutions.
I get about 20~fps on a 8700k at 4k in a PAUSED fort with 7 Dwarfs.
My GPU doesn't even get to participate since the game uses SDL v1 for graphics, which was deprecated like 11 years ago. Rendering is being done entirely on the CPU.

Don't hate the game but it needs a lot of UI work to make things like trading MUCH less time consuming.  It's f*cking ridiculous how limited and how many times you have to click to mark all of a particular item category for sale.  You have to click all of the individual items or all of the individual item sub-categories depending on what you're trying to sell.

He doesn’t have a book about game design either, and I’m pretty sure he only taught college-level classes for Stans in Mathematics. So, not a good look to start. The game also looks kinda old, and there are flashing things sometimes, but it’s not like Vampire Survivors. 

So, a dwarf migrated to my fortress and they missed their family. My Rimworld colonist’s sister stopped by and it had no effect whatsoever. That’s how you add immersion, because it’s not expected. Or when my colonist’s mother stopped by to visit her son. Beautiful moment, especially because they have green numbers next to each other’s names. It outshined the time a dwarf was traumatized after witnessing other dwarfs die from a Forgotten Beast, and when I checked in on them, they often thought of that event. And that’s fine I guess, but I had to read that. It would have been better if Will Wheaton had read it to me like when I read Ready Player One (I highly recommend this over Dwarf Fortress). They died of melancholy anyways, because they wouldn’t eat anything— which is weird cuz melon’s in the name. Being a dwarf is okay, but there’s something personal about pawns and the wholesomeness that comes with playing The Sims in Space with guns and dog tails. They even got those little pictures above their heads when talking to each other.

I payed around $100 for a base game plus all DLC instead of $30 for a game that should have been in Early Access. At least Rimworld is finished. But you know, I like to use a lot of QoL mods because I can’t change the priority order of all total tasks. You get some really cool check marks though (they’re green!) or you can use a 0-4 system for those specific tasks. Why would I ever want to automate anything important outside of basic tasks when I could just keep having to adjust priorities? It’s at least better than that annoying red circle with a slash in it that keeps popping up in DF. I don’t read those anyways. It’s like reading the font in a Link to the Past.

My point is: I’m here to consume a game, and I really need to make sure you understand that. When I learn that a twenty-year-old game is being released with some updates but is still essentially the same game, you best know I gotta give’em the sauce. You can’t expect to partner with a smaller dev company and not have us expect updates every two weeks or be happy that there’s finally another dev on the game. Road maps? It’s 2023. We have Google Maps now. You can’t communicate with your fanbase every month either with monetary figures. You gotta get a Twitter and get a posh check mark that comes with a free Tesla. And look at that play count. It's undeniably factual that a low play count equates to bad game design.

The best part? I wrote this using ChatGPT and edited it to sound like me. Get on the ball, Toady.

Edit: I guess they removed a goblet-holding bug or something, and people actually liked that? What are they going to do next? Remove all the brown recluse spider men?",1683943573,1684039068,True,2,1,0.497152060270309448,0,True,False,False

And as a programmer, I've read about, studied the development and architecture of, dozens more (and even made a few simple sims myself).

Dwarf Fortress is in a class by itself.  Nothing I've played or seen comes close.  The breadth of this game hurts my head as I try to take it all in...and the more I learn (about the game, but also about it's development - Tarn shows up in a number of YouTube videos talking about its architecture over the years), the more I understand that what 'surfaces' (his word) in the game is just the barest glimmer of the machinery working under the hood.  The tip of an iceberg big enough to hold a complete alternate reality with every click of the ""Create New World"" button.

I bought this game a week ago today.  I'm now 50 hours in.  My job is suffering, my relationship is taking a hit...my only hope is to keep playing and hope I burnout before one or the other takes any permanent damage.

I played on and off, and loved to see the influence this incredible [i] artwork [/i] of a game had on other hit games, not least of which Minecraft.

The Steam version of Dwarf Fortress finally makes the game truly accessible, and fun in so many new ways. Its user experience is an object lesson in how to create an interface that is true to the keyboard control of the original game, but makes commands visible, discoverable, and clickable. The graphics are fun and informative, and for the first time my fortresses are really coming to life.

Things were going well with the book recovery so I built stage one of my library with some very nice jet walls, floors and furniture. (A+++ would aesthetic again).

This game is single threaded for sure. Meaning a lot of the time the game has queued your mouse click but it is to busy doing other things before processing it. So, much so it has forgotten about it. You might think it is a problem with your mouse but its the game.

Like really. I feel like I paid to play an early alpha release of a game. This game isn't polished at all. Has more bugs than I can count. And is more tedious to play than actually having fun.

For example: by default your max dwarf count is like 200. But each dwarf needs his own bedroom. But that's not all you got to make his office space, dinning room and so much more. It wouldn't be so bad if creating said thing didn't take like 50 mouse clicks to do. First you got to designate an area for the bedroom. Than you build a bed. Then you build a chest. And much more stuff like a cabinet. Then you assign a dwarf to the bed room. And so on. And each of those task is are 3 to 7 mouse clicks. Than you repeat all that to make a dinning room. And again for the office. And than again for each dwarf.

If you wan't to play a game where you spend all day looking at the worst menus ever. Just to setup a bedroom for over 200 dwarfs. As your sure to loose a lot of them. Then this game is for you. But if like most normal people stay very far away from this crap!!!

The good reviews are not warranted at all!!!

Edit: Because people are stupid. And leave stupid comments I decided to do a video of how stupid the game is. https://youtu.be/jx1-NrjAY4Y

Also because steam guard won't let me post. As I don't want to fucking enable it. I'll respond to stupid comments here.
@FriendCalledFive LOL. 10 mins is fucking lie. You say you like these menus, but that is either a lie, or some form of denial.
@natsukashiinoneko No lack of skill here. You are a fanboy crying about things he doesn't understand. I made a video just to show you how stupid the menus are. How laggy it becomes.

Other than the founder risking his life to bring our magma forges to life we've faced very few hardships secluded from the rest of the world. 

Come mid-winter we notice our entire supply of brew is suddenly gone, before we noticed what had happened the goblin thieves had already escaped. Our guards were off shift, no one has ever come here before. Days quickly turn to weeks and the few meager drops we can manage out of our mushroom supply can't keep up with flood of thirsty dwarves. The small murky pool at the mountain top has frozen over for winter and the weak are starting to drop like flies from the dehydration. First it takes the infants, then our elderly, we can barely walk much less continue mining at this point, surely this will be the end of the Flarelancer Fortress. Madness takes one of our fresh recruits to the guard-force, we don't know if it's the dehydration, guilt for letting the thiefs escape or both. The remainder of our militia regretfully takes him down with what little strength they have left, and melts down his old equipment into a coffin so he can finally be laid to rest. 

Spring comes, and melts that stagnant pool of filth at the mountain top and nothing can stop the entire fortress from rushing toward it and drinking the pond dry.

I've played this game since 2009 on and off, back in 2009, i had no internet at home, but i manage to download the game from Bay 12 games website after a friend in my Public library recommended it to me since i use to go there and play DnD in my spare time. They said "" Dwarf Fortress would be right up your Alley but the controls would be some getting use to. ""
Oh boy, they wasn't kidding, Luckily they was a Wiki page on the game, I printed off as much as i could of the basics and set off to learn this new game, Many hours would spent learning the controls but once i had them down..It was the best summer of my life. 
i can honestly say without a shadow of  a doubt. this game and at full price it the best bang for your buck you could ask for in a Fantasy Management game and thats not to mention Adventure Mode that will be coming soon. You'll be able to wonder a frozen tundra and Vomit on the ground and it will freeze and then if your character has the skill, throw frozen Vomit at a creature and kill it. if you want to make a really fun character when Adventure Mode releases? Create a Wrestler.
Nothing like getting a camel in a headlock in the desert as you practice your skill of becoming a Pro Wrestler
Spitting is a something else you can do, I've blinded foes by spitting into their eyes while entangled in a wresting match.

I know my hours don't show much time spent on the game here on steam but give this a shot if Fantasy games or the setting is your thing. You'll have a blast.

The fact that the steam version got actual graphics and more artists that are helping develop the game further only made it better. 

Some may disagree, but this game is a work of art easily en par with the greatest art pieces found in museums.

Instead of making the game actually accessible and playable, they keep adding new features. This is great for the tiny minority of veteran players, with encyclopedic knowledge of the the systems. But just absolutely painful for everyone else. It's telling that it took 2 decades for them to decide to do half assed graphics. 
Because yes even though we finally get graphics with the steam release many tiles don't even have a dedicated sprites, instead sharing the same sprite among many. The sprites that doe exist are often more confusing or misleading than the original ascii.

It's one of, if not the deepest sim game out. I mean characters have simulated eyelids, animals can track liquids around when they step in a puddle etc.. Youve all seen the fantastical accounts of crazy shenanigans fans have gotten up to in this game.

But everything good about the game is trapped behind the needlessly obtuse UI and UX, as well as the utterly unexplained mechanics and goals. There's no tooltips, the tutorial just abruptly ends before even explaining how to properly use workshops, let alone how to get food and drink to become sustainable etc.. 

Coming from games like rimworld and gnomoria, you can really see how much DF would benefit from similarly modernised UX. Simple things like audible alerts and pausing on important alerts make a huge difference. Thing like having a cancel order button in each order menu. Because after 5 hours i cant even find one in any menu anywhere. 
I cannot imagine how impossible it is to manage anything once you have more than a few dozen dwarfs. Theres no way to easily see your stock piled items, dwarf status, what dwarfs want etc.. You have to manually dig through the warf list and look at each dwarfs page manually and individually.

I've been gaming for twenty godamned years, i have stupid amounts of hours in colony sims. this isn't just a me problem, this isn't a problem i encounter in other colony sims and it's a relatively easy problem to fix. Sure for their small team everything is time consuming, but theyve had 20 years and an influx of funding from the steam release. But instead of improving the actual game, they are just adding more BS like babies.

Got discouraged at world generation where it makes you stick with the first generation of sites without the option to redo the process. Had to go back through the settings page to rebuild, and it was genuinely hard to identify points of interest on the map with the sprite packs used.

That, and no adventure mode, told me everything I needed to know to keep waiting.

I can't recommend DF.  The game has been in development for 20 years, and still has so many bugs it's unbelievable.  There is a strong community of support around this game that has propelled its popularity.  However, they have become so used to the bugs that they don't see them anymore.

The game has SO much potential.  The world gen, the depth of procedural stories and characters, and the flexibility in crafting your own ""story"" in what is essentially a city builder is unparalleled.  You feel like you can do almost anything! Until you can't...

I have rage quit so many times, and then try it again...thinking I can find a work-around.  Well, in many cases you can.  There's extensive documenation about the bugs on the wiki.  In fact, a huge number of pages feature the ""bugs"" category at the bottom to outline stupid things that never get fixed.

An example: Pathing causing CPU usage is always an issue for a game. In one annoying case, enemies would try a new path through a restricted door on every tick.  This caused significant lag.  So, instead of fixing the pathing algorithm, the devs decided to remove the feature where the door was restricted.  Problem solved! Now, any of your creatures (even your cats) can open a door and wander out to get killed.  That was an excellent solution.  Or, in this Steam release, there are creatures that can destroy buildings.  Except, they can't.  They'll wander up to a locked door (at least you can still lock it so nothing can go through it) and just idle there for the rest of the game.  

The game has been out for 5 months now.  What are the dev's doing to fix these? Not much...they're creating tiny versions of the sprites cuz that's important.

My latest rage quit: a dwarf got dehydrated and died. There's plenty of drink.  Only thing I can think of is that the dwarves are simply not moving stuff to proper stockpiles, causing too many of them trying to path to the same square.  They move everything else, but won't move the drinks to the correctly assigned stockpiles.  Additionally, when going to pick up something, they pick the closest item.  Not the one that makes the most sense.  So, going to pick up a mug? Well, I'll grab this one that another one dropped when he died next to that large beast instead of one of the 30 that are safely in the dining hall.

The fan's of this game ignore these things saying dwarves are just silly, right? Maybe some fantasy stories make Dwarves dumb, but largely they aren't.  They're aggressive alcoholics that work hard.  They aren't going to dig a hole when they're nothing to support them anymore.  But, in DF that happens. A lot.

Final issue that is so ridiculous: not having connected items clickable.  I should be able to click on an item, be able to click on who is carrying it, then click on his other items, then back and forth.  It's basic UI database management.  This barely happens.  I can't click on an active dwarf and find out where he's going. I can only see what his job summary is.  And, the many management lists often aren't sortable or searchable.

The devs are creative, but they aren't good at fixing things.  I hope this will change with the money from the Steam release, but it seems they just want to go on ""business trips"" instead of fixing problems.",1683066161,1683066161,False,7,1,0.427482038736343384,2,True,False,False

Another thing that I love about Dwarf Fortress is its replay-ability. Every time you start a new game, you're presented with a new world to explore and a new set of challenges to overcome. This makes it very difficult to put the game down.

The learning curve is steep, and the graphics are basic. However, I believe that these are minor flaws that are easily outweighed by the game's many strengths.

But until several months after its Steam release, I did not give it much thought; in part due to its steep asking price. Eventually, curiosity got the better of me and I bought it.

What little I did know of was that DF is widely regarded as the progenitor of the subsequent games in the genre. Such was and is its influence that a number of the features and game mechanics we take for granted in contemporary colony sim games were first pioneered in DF. 

I was equally surprised to learn that DF began as early as 2002, and was released in public alpha in 2006. And here I was thinking Chris Hunt took ages to complete Kenshi. Tarn & Zach Adams should similarly be commended for their patience, love and perseverance in developing DF.

Granted that I found DF's pre-Steam text-based CP437 graphics quaint in a nostalgic sense, I was not quite comfortable playing the game, the one or two instances when I looked it up. [i] Mea culpa [/i], for in its tile set format, DF proved to be quite the ride.

It was fairly difficult at first to grasp its basic mechanics, since they visibly differ from other colony sim games. Indeed, I nearly gave up and uninstalled it after 10 hours of playing, only to reinstall it the following day to satisfy the itching urge that just wouldn't go away.

With enough dogged determination, I was soon able to comprehend DF, with much more still to learn. Admittedly not all the mechanics are to my liking (the inability to copy+paste stockpile settings in a convenient manner, and having to start a new world every time you add one or more new mods, is particularly irksome at times) but I reasoned this is due to its origins and development as a game. Certainly, I can see why DF has gained a near-fanatical base of fans and supporters over the years. I can only hope these shortcomings will be addressed later on.

I think I've said enough. DF rightfully merits its reputation for a steep learning curve, jaw-grinding failures whenever disaster hits your colony, and all-around enjoyability. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm heading back to dig, dig, dig, a-diggedy, dig.",1682157653,1682698863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You choose a embark location in a large world, this world you can generate according to parameters. 
The embark location has a few params which are important/fun
 - Temperature (impact e.g. water freezing, drying out)
 - Available Ore that can be found (if not available, you'll have to trade for it)\
 - Availability of trees
 - Availability of Sand
 - Availability of Clay (Have not used this yet, but can be used for pots etc, but often you can simply use rock
 - Aquifer type (wet ground, might make mining difficult because it floods with water, can be used also to make wells etc).
 - Surroundings, from peaceful, to wild animals to literally haunted with reincarnating animals, zombies and disturbing weather.
 - Biome(s) you can partially select certain biome types, which vary from oceans, to woodlands to mountains, to actual vulcanoes. Obviously this impacts what resources are available.
 - What kind of Hostile or friendly encampments/cities/fortresses are nearby, you can get raid and get raided by these for example.

Probably more, but this comes up on the top of my mind, this only starts your game as mentioned there are other locations, you can re-use worlds including existing forts as well.

Once you embark you get a 3 dimensional map, your dwarves start with their stuffs on the ground level, how high this is, depends on your embark location. You can chop trees, harvest bushes, dig down with stairs, or just ramps (or up) and mine out parts of the map. 
You usually start doing this to make some basecamp, especially in your first game.

You'll likely want to create an indoor farm, this can only be done on non-rock soil so don't go too deep, (unless you head straight for caverns, which are fun, but sometimes tricky to find). Easiest way to create alcohol is farm plump helmet mushrooms, they grow year round.

Your dwarves will need water, a river works, but dwarves prefer a well, something you can construct on a hole in the ground which is above water some z-levels below. (creating replenish able water sources can be fun).

Your dwarves will need food, you can eat things from your farm, hunt animals, butcher animals, fishing, make cheese from milking animals (which you can pasture on anything that has grass or cavern soil, cavern soil spreads on non rock once you uncover them) or gather wild fruits/plants. Dwarves will be happier if you cook food, and there are certain degrees of quality you can cook at a kitchen workspace.
Dwarves also need alcohol, a Still is something you'll need, in between this and the farm, you also need a farm plot and farm workstation by the way. Alternatively, you can sometimes make drinks from wild fruits, or start a bee colony, and do some beekeeping for mead, this also requires some tools to process the honeycombs to processable honey.

Dwarves will need bedrooms, this is a room with a bed and a door preferably, maximum happy peasant dwarves will want a chest and cabinet as well. You can however make bad quality rooms, or a dormitory, worst case, dwarves sleep on the ground (this does not make them happy). Beds are made of wood, other furniture can be made of rock, metal wood. note that every dwarf has their own preferences. 

Dwarves can get injured by the way, they don't have visible hitpoints, but they have limbs, which can lose function, or be dismembered, a doctor can sometimes patch these things up, there are also different types of doctors.

Good last thing to mention (as I have not covered a lot at all), All dwarves have their own preferences, skills and traits. They react to objects and events, and can get slightly traumatized etc. if they're unhappy they may cause fun by starting mass bar fights and cause deaths and more depression.

Go watch some videos if you're interested. I will recommend this anyway.

Don't expect the most polished game ever though! But it is actively being worked on and still very playable, a bit CPU heavy and some things are bad for CPU, like avoid waterfalls 50 levels down into your caverns that never stop etc.",1682624182,1682670406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing on and off for a few years, always watched kruggsmash on youtube. 
I struggled for years with the PeridexisErrant's Starter Pack applying different mods and graphics overhauls, although It is a solid alternative.my forts never lasted that long and would crumble from the easiest of enemies. 

This steam edition is the best game of dwarf fortress I've played yet, and most successful. the controls are easier to use, and the graphics are easy to understand.
 My fort has yet to crumble and has reached 204 population and is the capital of the dwarven civilisation. The necromancer king joined the fort after it had been a Duchy for a year or two. Necromancy is posing challenges I don't really understand and the fort is strewn with gore from some of the corpse pits being resurrected. issues with the hospital tasks not being completed almost killed my military but my own blunder not seeing the labour menu's cleaning and suturing tab.

This game simulates a living, breathing world for you, of which you can explore, shape and decorate parts. You can make complicated water features and machines; you can build logic gates and all sorts, for those engineering types. However, the main difference I would highlight between Dwarf Fortress and most games is that, despite the game being single-player, the player never feels alone, nor like they are having the same experience that every player does. Every fortress is unique, every character has its own foibles, influencing its decisions to (il)logical ends which you can only guide and witness. Like to build immense, intricate structures? This game has got it. Like to conquer vast territories and manage an elite military? This game has got it. Like to manage colonies? This game invented it. Like to explore emergent narratives? This game has got it more than any other. The only thing that holds it  back is also the thing that allows it to be so vast: it has basic graphics.

Now that I have a few forts under my belt with the Steam version I have to say I am a bit disappointed.  I understand why they did what they did.  First the default settings make the game a lot easier.  But it feels like they rushed it out the door.  I’m all for Toady getting paid.  He got my money years ago.  But if you go from contribution only to paid version you have to meet some basic standards.  Just a few things that make this incarnation very hard to play.  Unsearchable and/or unsortable lists of dwarves, items, tasks.  At 200 dwarves this makes finding a dwarf a 5 minute task.  Then you need to find 10 to set up one squad and you are up to 50 minutes of just scrolling lists.  The trade screen is so over simplified that you have to take days specifying what you want done.  Burrows are completely broken.  It isn’t even a suggestion to the dwarves.  They just ignore it.  The path restrictions interface is just broken.  Sliders don’t slide.  Manually entering values doesn’t take.  And there are some years old bugs that still haven’t been fixed.  Try equipping a crossbow squad and get them to train at targets.  Got a bow, got a quiver, got 1000 bolts in my barracks.  But will they equip them - NO.  They all want that one forbidden copper bolt at the bottom of the river before choosing from the stacks behind them.  I knew the workarounds on the old version but here I can’t fix it.  They dumbed down too much and removed essential features.  I could go on, unfixable tantrums, losing your Legendary Weaponsmith to a pissed off 1 year old that punched her in the leg, bugs upon bugs in the task conditions, and so on.  I will come back to it a few months and see what they ironed out.  But, like every publisher today, they pushed a half baked product out the door.

To be fair there might be a lot of simulation happening in the background, but you'll never know it. There is no feedback on what's happening, no 'story' being made, to give an example of how bad it is I tried sending some dwarves off on a mission: 

I spent an hour trying to figure out why I couldn't send them on a mission before I realized they were actually going off on the mission and coming back; with absolutely nothing to tell me that they had, or any status update on what happened. They just leave and.. you have no idea what happened, there's no feedback. To be fair it does give you a notification when something interesting arrived on the map, but zooming to the notification takes you to where they entered the map. With how visually 'busy' the game is, it's practically impossible to actually find where that visitor is, zooming to the spot where they entered the map is pointless.

All those stories I'd heard about this game, like about necromancers and werebeasts and all that, are very misleading.

But little things, like for example - there is no unique drawing for a dog standing on paved road, so it turns into a dirt square (visually only) when one stands on it while chained. Nothing too serious, but caused me to do a double-take and confused me for a moment, taking my attention off more important matters in-game.

Or the way trees will completely block pathfinding sometimes, but other times a dwarf (sometimes a crazed hostile one who just turned back from being a were-creature) will climb up into the trees and I can send my militia up after them... Meanwhile the traders just stand by the edge of the map blocked in instead of climbing over the trees to get down the slope and around my giant moat.

The problems are all little quality of life problems. On one hand, there is a HUGE amount you can do and a lot of automation. On the other hand, there are some things that feel very fiddly and clunky. If finding/renaming animals based on their traits were as easy as making very specific and esoteric rules about when to build things, the game would be somewhat more enjoyable.

I feel like in some ways, it should be considered ""early access"", because while the game is complete in many ways, it feels like it needs to be polished more. Someone who really, really likes this kind of thing (someone like me) can look past these issues and enjoy the massive word the game has to offer. And, while i'm not suggesting this game should dumb itself down for the casuals, I am saying that it feels disjointed how some aspects of gameplay offer intensely granular control, while others feel like you're trying to hammer a nail into a popsicle stick with a baseball bat.

I can just avoid those aspects of gameplay and play around it. But it would be nice if things like naming/culling your herd were as granular and easily controlled as other aspects of the game, and if the AI felt as intelligent and deep as the systems that make the world the AI lives in feel so deep and real. I love the way everything influences everything else, the way that all kinds of unexpected things flow into each other. The way everything interacts can feel seamless at times, and that sense of immersion and the expansive nature of the world is only ever broken by the hamfisted dingdong that is the AI controlling NPCs.",1681970637,1681970637,True,2,0,0.467799633741378784,0,True,False,False

I am glad it has finally made it's way to Steam, and with new graphics and a friendly UI to boot! Highly recommended if you can spare hundreds of hours to have FUN!

So far the main issue I have seen is a few little quirks with the UI that I am sure will be fixed in time. Mostly the lack of a way to quickly build multiple items from workshops, and an overview of your Dwarfs stats. Basically the game still needs Dwarf Therapist, but doesn't have it yet. I was hoping the developer would have looked at DT and used it for idea's, but I guess that didn't happen. 

Also the alerts system is pretty horrible. I keep missing alerts that popup since they are small and off to the side of the screen. They need to either pause the game for important alerts, or play a sound so I know to look at them.

My last complaint is the lack of Adventure mode on launch. There was a vote from the community, and I guess people are to impatient to wait a bit for Adventure mode for launch. I hope it comes soon, as it adds a lot of flavor to DF to be able to visit your own fort in adventure mode.",1670373165,1681873579,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A watermill enclosure adorns the brook's edge, and a magnificent roofed tower, a true feat of engineering, rises high above the castle's battlements. I've been toiling away with DFHack to complete the roof and shield the castle from the whims of the weather gods, but I won't completely rob the trees of their rightful place - a few ""pot holes"" will remain for the arboreal residents to thrive.

Venturing inside the castle, one are met with four large green glass-covered pits, each spanning many levels and offering a breathtaking view of an artificial cavern teeming with life. The cavern floor is a lush carpet of shrooms and spores, and a bustling bee civilization hums along in an 'octacomb' array of hives, with a few strategic green glass grates high above, allowing them to buzz about and out to the castle yard for some fresh air.

One day, the elves came bearing grave news - their closest forest retreat had been overrun by goblins. After some diplomatic wrangling, they named me a ""butcher,"" but we eventually settled on a more peaceful solution - I was permitted to cut down a precize number in the fifites of trees until the next season. Seeking to impress my elven guests, I proudly presented a bin of the finest obsidian mugs, a testament to the unparalleled craftsmanship of my people, in exchange for a lovebird in a beautiful wooden cage. But my broker was left scratching her bare beard in bewilderment as the elves promptly gave her the bird.

The new controls are so much slower compared to the old game, I understand that Kitfox wanted to make the game accessible to new players, but i don't understand why there is no option for a ""Classic control scheme"" or something similar. 
But ok, a few hours in and you adapt yourself to the new controls. However, i have a few issues with the game, the main one being that its not that much more optimised compared to the old dwarf fortress.
Other than that, task prioritisation is somewhat buggy, and limiting a dwarf to do only one thing is made difficult with the new labour system.
The old game used to pause much more frequently, and while being able to have the game unpaused when you're designating what your dwarves should mine is an overall great feature, I've had dozens of caravans just pass because the game doesn't pause for one of the more important features of the game. There are quite a few bugs but i guess that will get fixed eventually.
But it isn't all that bad, the soundtrack is great, the sprites are charming and the world generation process has been sped up quite a bit. A great improvement is that you can now see the ores you'll get on embark. They also managed to lessen FPS death, which was a frequent problem in the old version and a cause for abandoning many fortresses.

The key to enjoying this game is to read, and to allow chaos. It's easy enough to wall up (bridge up) and stop all possible incursions. But that's not the fun bit. Do it for a while to learn, but then eventually you'll realise that a perfectly safe and efficient fortress is not what your aim is. That's not the game. The 'game' and the joy of Dwarf Fortress is the journey, and the stories that happen along the way.

Set yourself a goal, or lots of mini goals, and try to achieve them. Trap a webslinging forgotten beast to bolster your silk clothing industry (then throw that all away bc forgotten beast silk is worthless and you can't sell it, then switch to webslinging fiend silk). Try pumping magma from the sea up to the surface to wipe out all the zombie sieges. Wall off your caverns completely and then restart a game with Cavern dweller attacks set to 0 once your FPS is at 5 due to the literal thousands of snakemen that accumulate over time outside your walls, unseen. Find out why everyone's so paranoid about werebeasts. Discover that choosing your baroness as someone without an item preference means they don't make demands for warhammers 20 times a year. Play. Learn. Work out that a magma-powered glass industry is essentially free magma-safe materials, and that step ladders mean your dorfs get a plethora of beverage options for extremely happy thoughts. Expose a tile to light, once, and then put flooring over the top but grow surface foods underground. Watch the story unfold when your legendary hammerdwarf mum after her only child is turned into a zombie, and feel that anguish as you read her internal struggles and decent into madness. Have fun.

But most importantly, don't save scum. Trust me on this. Letting things happen -IS- what Dwarf Fortress is all about. It's the 'losing is Fun' mantra. And it's true. Oh, and read about your dorfs. They're hilarious, and they mostly make sense. Their thoughts, preferences and memories ARE the game and your ultimate purpose.

You WILL be proud of your dwarfs and their achievements, even when it all ends because a deadly duster forgotten beast kills everyone and every thing from bloodloss before they can even step close enough to land a hit - except the Mayor because he slept through the screams of his brothers and sisters (don't worry, he woke up without shoes and stepped in a pile of extract on his way to drink his troubles away - his troubles didn't last much longer). It was a good fortress, I'll always remember those lil bearded b*stards.

So if you like colony/civilisation sims, can't help but find joy in individuals, don't care that graphics and UI aren't triple-A, and love discovering mechanics, quantum loopholes, self-powering generators, collapsing 120 z-level pumpstacks due to 1 mechanism being non-magma safe, flinging goblins 50 ft in the air then pummelling them with a 20 weapon shotgun, and laughing at outrageously random events or creatures..

It was high summer, and most of the beloved dwarfs were up in the trees harvesting limes and dates. Seeing the dwarves graciously swing from branch to branch was a delight in itself.

But alas, terror struck. A herd of 6 agitated water buffaloes snook up on the harvesting zone through a mountain pass. They gored the few children and stragglers on the ground, barreled past the dwarves still in the trees, and towards the main entrance. Luckily, a human trade caravan, along with some seasoned soldiers, happened to be in the area, and once the buffaloes closed in, the humans made minced meat of them. (Technically, the meat rotted on the ground before it could be butchered and made into roast, more on why below.) Who knew, but it turns out humans can actually be helpful once in a while.

However, the dwarves still in the trees were now struck with a fear of the low ground, and refused to come back down. (I believe this was a bug.) Those not already stuck in the trees, climbed up to help with the harvesting they still believed was going on, and became infected with this terrifying fear. The dorfs stayed in the trees until they got thirsty, then very thirsty, but still refused to come back down. The samaritarian Urist McDoctor wanted to bring water to the thirsting dwarves, but soon had to abandon this endeavour, as there were no empty buckets available in the tree where he was stuck himself.

The lone dwarf left on the ground, Urist McFisher, had been far away when the attack happened. He came up with a brilliant idea, to chop down the trees. The trees were quickly designated for felling, but nothing happened. McFisher soon realized that was because all the woodchoppers were stuck in the trees, and too afraid to come down to cut them. McFisher had an answer for this too, he decided to pick up the craft of woodchopping himself. He started looking for an axe, but couldn't find any. It turned out all available axes were up in the trees. Not to be stopped by such trivialities, McFisher had a plan for that too, just forge a new axe. There was just one small problem, all the smiths were stuck in the trees, so who would forge it? A few apprentice crafts later, McFisher finally managed to cause dwarves to come tumbling out of the trees, at which point they all ran to the dining hall to drink beer straight from the barrels and complain about the lack of cups.

Meanwhile, the goofy humans had decided to stay behind at the trade depot, and not leave for trading elsewhere as custom dictates. (I believe this was a bug.) They did not say whether it was because they had such good laughs at treehugging dwarves refusing to get ground below their feet, or out of sympathy with the defenseless chaps hurtling insults from above. It was soon decided to wall off the mountain pass, and lure all wildlife past the new human guards, as they clearly had no intentions of leaving. The dwarves were taking bets on how long the humans would last.

Shortly thereafter the game crashed (I believe this was a bug in the game, now fixed.) Upon reloading from the previous season, the buffaloes meandered straight to the trade caravan and got killed. The caravan left shortly thereafter, and everything proceeded in blissful, boring peace until the autumn. The dwarves lived to have fun another day, to be detailed elsewhere.

I've put easily 1000+ hours into Dwarf Fortress after discovering it early in 2020, and still every fort and adventurer is wildly different from the last. I often call DF a ""snowglobe"" of a simulator (as one of the creators, Tarn, once referred to it), because it goes to great lengths to avoid ""gamified"" events that just appear out of nowhere. Instead, everything is simulated and tracked, with checks against things like moods, ethics, and personal histories at every possible point.

This Steam version is much more refined. It offers the most accessible release of DF to date and yet, it remains a uniquely hardcore experience. It'll definitely take you many failures and hours to learn. Famously, Dwarf Fortress attracts just as many fortress voyeurs - watching let's plays and reading stories on the forums - as it does actual players. Even [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPbLBpjgcc13TcUxv6_NJuS-fn-UvV5FH]my own legendary fortresses[/url] occupy a place of special pride in my mind above all other gaming achievements.

This version is a premium version that contains new graphics and music for a higher quality experience.

[h1]Fortress Mode Review[/h1]
Even if this game has a new UI, there is still plenty to learn so don't feel bad if your overwhelmed. Play the in game tutorial, watch video's online, and most importantly ask questions. You can do so on the steam discussion board, Kitfox Game's discord, or on the Dwarf Fortress forums on Bay12Games website. Trust me when I say this, no one completely understands everything about the game. It has had many versions before the steam release so rarely did anyone fully figure the game out.

So I won't mention everything that is to come, everything related to magic, adventure mode, graphics. 

My fascination with the game began in 2018, the praise of its community having done its thing I found myself trying its basic version, simple...and yet very complex. English not being my first language it was impossible for me to differentiate each square, so I quickly abandoned my project. It was in 2019 that I learned that a new ""friendly"" version was in the works. I was interested in its development from beginning to end waiting patiently to have the game in my hands. I bought it on the very day and the number of hours played easily answers if I enjoyed my adventure.  I've reached a point where I just feel like I've been through the game (although I'm not) and I'm waiting for new content and new interfaces. 
Now, I think I have now enough hindsight to list the positives, the improvements and the negatives.


[h1]Positives points :[/h1]

[list]
 [*]A rich and vast world with many distinct cultures and races in which we take pleasure in evolving and especially in recruiting unique, bizarre beings each with their own history and unique characteristics. A language that is certainly basic but that differentiates each people and gives them a certain originality.

 [*]A thorough customization of our culture (symbols, names) that allows us to choose with a fine-tooth comb what constitutes the foundations of our new civilization.

 [*]Original and very pleasant micro-management details (to make a hospital work, make sure you have crutches, soap, buckets filled with fresh water but also tables, for a tavern don't forget to create cups, jugs and to think of leaving enough space to allow everyone to dance). However, pushed to its extreme this makes some industry systems complex and tricky, especially the paper and book industry with 6 big steps or the creation of instruments which requires to create an incalculable number of small parts. This certainly makes the game more realistic but requires you to think about many things at the same time. 
To facilitate their creation perhaps allow the mouse hover to open a diagram of the steps and each component required with the number that we already have, this could greatly help to know where we are and what we are missing.

 [*]New original room concepts: museums, temples, guilds, rooms for rent for taverns... I'm not used to managing these spaces in games so it's refreshing to be able to create them.
I know that enriched with more specific objects and new components/events it would make it possible to make each building unique with for example the implementation of a calendar and festivals that can be created to measure ( for a museum we could give universal exhibitions on a theme, For the temples, specific ceremonies or fairs where objects related to the divinity are sold to subsidize statues or projects related to beliefs, for the guilds we could manage discovery/recruitment sessions with stands, classrooms that give weekly general courses with free registration as the Collège de France in Paris does (Teaching is free and open to all without registration. This does not give any diploma but knowledge) for the rented rooms there would be activities and leisure activities to attract foreign tenants, breakfast and dinner system, common rooms with entertainment, tourist tours of museums, cave gardens ...) I think that we could make their concepts even more original, lively and therefore interesting (they are just ideas, I don't expect them to be done)

 [*]The system that is by far my favorite is the formation of a guard that acts as a kind of police force and can solve investigations by interrogating suspects and catching the guilty and prosecuting them. The prison is very realistic.
I wish, however, that rather than an officer having to walk the entire map to question a person, a specific interrogation and waiting room was implemented. 
[/list]

[h1]Negative points:[/h1]
[list]
 [*]The way the army operates is not up to par. Their schedule is ""hard"" to manage in the sense that it is too specific (either you train all year or not at all) and the fact that you can't choose a weekly schedule makes no sense. The system for assigning dwarfs simply does not exist. Having to unroll all your civilians without skills to find the ones that stand out is a long and tedious task. Dwarves who already have skills should come to the top of the list automatically. We should also be able to recruit our soldiers on their personality traits. I don't want an empath, a person who dreams of peace or a person with a weak constitution or health. For my guards I don't want people who are cruel, who don't like order or law, who are capable of stealing or being bribed, so set up a filter system by personality or skills.

 [*]The nickname system is also not up to date and makes it obsolete. For example for an interrogation it doesn't take into account their nickname so you have to find them only with their original name and I think this applies on a number of other things. 
[/list]
 [*]Diplomatic relations interface: I don't find it clear enough, I have trouble fixing my own and even other people's realms on the map or understanding what's going on there. The interface for relations and trade with other peoples should be reachable with one window and should be able to sort with specific information (races, alliances, wars, trade...) in fact the map should be reworked to be more relevant.
[/list]
[h1]System to improve:[/h1]
[list]
 [*] The marriage and birth system is too simple. 
We should be able to do ceremonies in temples and births in hospitals, to give these places back their uses.

 [*]Children are not interesting in their condition.
There should be new specific needs, new objects adapted to their ages (beds, toy chests, small drawing tables, paintings, sculptures that could be kept in personal chests) but also family time or play time with other children, perhaps create a playground area or classrooms exclusive to the little ones or include free learning in guilds for children.

[/list]

[h1]Conclusion :[/h1]

Dwarf fortress offers many possibilities and hours of play but still lacks content and interface that would make the game more simple and enjoyable. I still expect a lot from the game and I can't wait to see all the next improvements, especially the entry of the economic system to be able to make dwarves of several social classes with districts reserved for their level of wealth. I recommend it for people who like complex management of a civilization and write their own story.

Right after a hydra had attacked my fortress and killed 2 of my dwarves (one being a veteran axdwarf) i got a notification that the dwellers of the deep were attacking. So I checked my entrance to the caverns to see that it had been sealed before the hydra's attack, and that there were in fact 3 of my dwarves stuck in the caverns suffering from thirst, among them my mayor and a regular speardwarf from my raiding squad.

Seeing how the rest of his squad wouldn't be able to reach them in time Oddom Gusikulal decided to take on the invading antwomen by himself, swiftly dispatching 4 of them without getting a single scratch, he was quick to tire however, and one queen ant warrior took the opportunity to stab him in the leg with a {Steel Spear}, despite his injuries Oddom fought a fierce battle against the remaining 2 queen ant women, he managed to slay the one who injured him and put some distance between the survivor and himself, but from behind a veteran antwoman warrior snuck up on him, twisted his neck and tore the skin, now Oddom was bleeding from his neck.

The antwoman delayed the remaining queen ant's death for but a moment as Oddom took the oportunity to stab her in the head and instantly killed her, after this he was injured by the last remaining ant warrior that stabbed his other leg with a {-Steel Spear-}, the battle devolved into wrestling and grappling, however during a brief instant when the two of them took distance Oddom destroyed the ant warrior's left leg affording the exhausted warrior some breathing room, he manage to injure the warrior a bit more but his body was giving in to exhaustion, his attacks weren't landing and a lucky stab from the ant woman's {-Steel Spear-} hit his lower arm, making him drop his shield, after that both of them exhausted and heavily injured continue to trade blows that didn't manage to hurt the other.

At last, Oddom gave in to exhaustion and passed out, dropping his +Steel Spear+ the antwoman who was uncapable of holding Her's resorted to wrestling and shaking the unconscious Dwarf, the speardwarf squad was still too far away to help Oddom, and after several minutes had passed the ant warrior continued pull on his limbs, tearing some tendons and causing more injuries, it was then than the Mayor emerged from a lower level of the caverns -Iron Pick- in hand and approached the ant woman who jumped at him but missed, after this the Mayor stuck a fatal blow to the antwoman's torso, tearing her appart.

Oddom sucumbed to his injuries shortly after the screenshot was taken, now he rests in the warrior's tomb along his brethren that fell before him, his name will be sung in the taverns of the dwarven hillocks for generations to come.

It's a complex and challenging game that offers an incredibly deep and rewarding experience. If you're willing to put in the effort to learn its intricate systems, you'll find an experience unlike anything else.

Gameplay-wise, Dwarf Fortress is all about managing a colony of dwarves in a harsh and unforgiving world. You'll need to keep your dwarves fed, happy, and safe from various threats, including hostile creatures and other civilizations. The game's systems are incredibly detailed, and there are a huge number of different things to manage, from individual dwarves' needs and personalities to resource production and trade with other civilizations.

Graphically, Dwarf Fortress is not the most impressive game out there. While this may be off-putting to some, it does allow the game to be incredibly detailed and complex, and the lack of fancy graphics can be part of the game's charm.

One downside of Dwarf Fortress is its notoriously steep learning curve. The game can be incredibly daunting for new players, and it can take many hours to get a handle on all of the game's systems. However, if you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn the game, it can be an incredibly rewarding experience.

Overall, Dwarf Fortress is an incredibly deep and rewarding game that offers a unique experience that is unmatched by any other game out there. It's not for everyone, but if you're willing to put in the effort to learn its systems, you'll find a game that offers endless hours of challenge and entertainment.

Maybe the difficulty curve was too steep, or maybe you just didn't like the idea of playing with just your keyboard. Whatever it is, you probably haven't played Dwarf Fortress before (or you're just here to see what funny reviews have been posted), right?

Look - let me tell you a story.

I started my journey with DF a long time ago, back in ... 2007? Maybe? I was reading a group let's play of the infamous (in the community) Boatmurdered while in my freshman year of college. ""What is this?"" I thought, squinting at the arcane screenshots of ascii junk; I'd played roguelikes before, I was familiar with ascii display, but even compared to that, this ""game"" looked more like an errored spreadsheet in the 80s than anything you could play. But, being bored and curious as I was, I read the stories. I read about elephants lurking in the distance, about trading parties being murdered by the savage land before the dwarves could even hope to fumble with them; I read about defense mechanisms and world razing traps - all of this in the weird, squashed little box that was default Dwarf Fortress, and I fell in love. 

Time passed. I tried, and failed, and tried again; I found tilesets and eventually the Lazy Newb Pack and finally, slowly, inch by inch I learned to play the game. I learned how to survive a season, then a year, then to survive until - well, until something inevitably brought my forts to ruin, but that's part of the fun. That's part of the drama and intensity that is dwarven life, and that's part of the charm. You might have two hundred dwarves, but they're all individuals, and you can pause your grand schemes at any time and just *watch* one of them and it's so utterly satisfying. I have hundreds of hours in games like Rimworld - and there are certainly some very excellent sims out there! - but I have *thousands* in Dwarf Fortress over the years. 

This game - this simulation - has so much work and love poured into it, it's absurd. I've watched the world change, growing depth, becoming literate, gaining hospitality, springing trees from the very earth, and I've grown with it. Dwarf Fortress and the dedication Tarn and Zach have put into it have inspired me in times where I was losing faith in my own dreams, and I can wholeheartedly say that they're a huge part of why I've had the confidence to pursue a career creating my own business. Their persistent work to perfecting their creation is a beautiful opus to the art that games can be, and it's without hesitation that I say this is one of the best, if not *the* best, games of all time. 

And honestly, if you're not sure? Go try the original free version. Go read or watch some of the many playthroughs people have made over the years. Take a journey with it for free, and see why these men absolutely deserve your support for this beautiful game. And of course...

In earlier versions, most players probably found that the inscrutable interface often made play sessions an exercise in frustration when one was already grappling with the obscure mechanics behind the world they were trying to survive in. 

I'm very pleased to say that the Steam version of DF makes huge strides by improving the interface dramatically. Almost everything is now available in clear, logically laid out menus that forgo any need for keyboard shortcuts (though they are still available). 

The graphical upgrade is very welcome as well. Long gone are the days of inscrutable symbols and letters jittering across the screen. Though I have played DF in the past using graphics packs they were never as nice as this version. 

Dwarf Fortress is not a perfect game. It is still in a state of development (20 years and counting!) There are strangeness and bugs galore.

(Oh actually I've gotten used to it, built and dug ones can't be linked at all. Connecting built ones requires lateral visibility of both ends which was my problem since I only had diagonal connection with impossible to move stairway.)
Still quite puzzled by the UI being strange, say the trade menu doesn't save what you traded and a rightclick disregards your selections and kicks you out. 1 click ruins it recommend removing RMB functionality and having it as Esc only, same with Burrow designation RMB is very easy to accidentally click. Maybe a confirmation button for stockpile deletion too since an accidental click of that button is quite devestating to the micro grind, the search doesn't find the category unlike the trading one so you've got to google where to store say ""coal (bar)"" or mussel (shell/refuse) or that armor/weapons/finished goods have quality/ and material listed the same way the actual item is you gotta see it for a few hours to get the hang of what you actually need and try to remember what stockpile accidentally stole all your blocks. Wonder why an ""All"" stockpile is even an option since it steals from everything perhaps have it automatically unassign everything that was assinged somewhere else to have a ""what's left?"" stockpile other than a ""let's steal your iron bars and merge them with building blocks"" or ""skulls? you want skulls as single stacks in your main room?"" stockpile automatically.
I will also note how the dig/channel/deconstruct of are written strange. deconstruct deconstructs both built and dug, deconstruct cancels building projects but not dug projects, deconstruct will do both if you select a large area undoing screwing up your ladders on accident. Eraser will cancel dug commands but will do nothing to say constructions they're cancelled only by you clicking twice (or a 1 click macro with mouse drag) which is just odd I can only fathom how it would be playing Rimworld where X (deconstruct) and C (cancel) would be merged not only cancel my walls but also try to deconstuct every wall and floor but not tables and chairs you'd have to click those manually.
I will keep it as negative, it is quite workable but the help popups not staying hidden if you choose another fort I can only guess why a 3 sentence popup is even suppose to explain what a burrow does I'd rather not have bothered or added a key (f1 say) or an encyclopedia button (like CIV) acting as a logical guidelines rather than sentences of obtuse information not even getting close at grasping how overwhelmingly deep the menus are. Do prefer to brute force my way through the logic and I thing I got it down now, my learning's quite incompatible with most people's. The popups not staying hidden, buttons doing infuriating things and building logic unexplained ingame it's just too user unfriendly right now. Maybe intentional but even in 3ds you can spend hours removing bloatware tooltips maybe modding is all it ends up being but how would you mod in a ""remember last material used"" button to a clunky big button design of the placement menu comatible with the ascii type of deal.
Good game though deep down, I assume it's written to accurately represent the thinking of a dwarf. Without AllowBuild ""Haul+"" and the no copy/paste on stockpiles and them not hauling bins/barrels to there and no forced dump on workbenches. Simply said it could be alot more open to you, if I'd want a specific thing hauled around, say Spike Balls, you'd have to make a stockpile that only allowes traps of that kind, then disallow all your other stockpiles storing Spike Balls and hoping one day someone gets a bin to there and dwarfs get the hang of actually splitting them from Swords and Armor you don't want to sell. Same with rock blocks and ingot bars or finished goods (Crafts) in the same bin as rope I adore how the logical mistakes are always your own fault but it could be better without the weird grind of storage location. Barrels and bins sorting by material and not content in the trading menu I assume it wants ""U""mans to hate the sorting once that's fixed it's perfect.
Sorry for that negative recommend now that I got the stairways down they weren't logical before but it's fine now, but I assume most would rather quit than grind your way through understanding how they got stuck. I wonder if a tutorial like Factorio does it (a sandbox type of deal) would improve this and they'd ditch the popup things entirely. Never used the Factorio tutorial myself, as said before I love the grind of finding it myself, but I would think you could explain the building or the military creation and their equipping logic with a seperate ""world"" opening up giving you a sandbox type of deal seperate from your fort to assign and just watch them in isolation till you cancel out and returning to your fort to then take the practical advice to practical use. Hostile hud doesn't fare well, hopefully someone remedies this quickly it does hamper gameplay quite alot leaving memories down the road. Stockpile deletion being a single click is still the most infuriating thing ever, same with designating chop commands on anything but the trunk, animal training in the sense of learning the how-to's, military efficiency logic, combat logs hidden and sorted by creature name, Material logic of armor and weapons not visible. Sum it up, hostile hud it doesn't want you to learn.",1679654750,1679884198,False,10,2,0.524474740028381348,0,True,False,False

The lazy newb pack and graphics helped a lot and I was always taken by the ingenuity and creativity of the modding community and the sheer scope of the game itself, but always did feel the barrier to entry was pretty high.

Now that I've got 500+ hours on this game (a lot of the hours on my account are probably from leaving the game on while sleeping or away from the computer) I have to say that my previous issues with the game are largely erased with this steam release. There are definitely some things that I think could be improved ( one thing that really irks me as of right now is that when preparing carefully to begin your fortress i've only found you're able to + or - one item at a time, Makes it a little difficult when you're trying to get 30 - 50 seeds or drinks) but I believe they'll sort out some of these minor issues before too long. All in all, the increased mouse functionality and enhanced mod support really make this release shine, and definitely worth the money, not to mention the fact that that money is going to a good cause. 

Tarn and Zach have never had a thirst for money, never tried to squeeze money out of the people who enjoy their game. Making a paid release was something they had to be somewhat goaded into by the community after becoming aware of the fact they legitimately needed the cash for health concerns. They've repeatedly shown that their hearts and souls are in this game, they've spent 20+ years bringing their vision to light and have no intention of stopping anytime soon. You would be hard pressed to find a set of developers who have put more work into their vision. I have the greatest respect for them for following their dreams and am so happy to see the success of DF on steam and what that will mean for the improvement of their personal lives. They certainly deserve it.

Now, for anyone who has never played the OG Dwarf Fortress, if you're on the fence, i would definitely recommend the game to you! Like I said before, the scope of this game is beyond any other game I have ever played. When you begin the game, you will generate a world with thousands of distinct entitities, beasts, and warring civilizations. Each entity has a will, motivations, and will float around the world discovering, battling, living their lives according to their personality. It's honestly amazing to see and there is, to my knowledge, no other game that generates such a world history. Before going into a game, you have the option to go into the revamped Legends mode, where you can see entries on every notable entity, civ, hero, city... and some of the entries are super intriguing. When you're done with a fortress in your world, you can retire it and then look into legends and see everything going on behind the scenes of your fortress. In one fortress, I thought everything was hunky dory and going fine, then I retired the fort to play another one, only to find the previous fortress shortly was destroyed. Come to find out, necromancers had invaded my fort, under assumed names, and plotted to destroy it. The fact that that all could happen in the background, that nefarious characters can move to your fortress under different names, that just blew my mind.

In my latest fortress, I found a dwarven civ that had only 20 - 30 people in it, with no sites.., a dead civ. Come to find out, they had breached hell in their original settlement, and a powerful pig demon had seized control of the capital and began to run an evil goblin civilization from its ashes. I began as them and slowly rebuilt an empire stronger than the original, and have waged ceaseless war against the goblins, leaving them with just our original city to defend. I'm currently preparing to take back the capital, which is my self imposed  current victory condition for the current playthrough. It's all so heroic and amazing to me.

If you're a creative person who is into fantasy, you'll find endless inspiration in this game. It gets my creative juices flowing in a way that no other game does, and I can't recommend it enough. This game is still very complex, though it is much more accessible now, and I can guarantee you will have a great time if you enjoy a challenge and have an interest in city-builders, strategy, and/or the fantastic. You will lose, eventually, but it actually becomes enjoyable, the push/pull of various forces in your world, the heroic struggles of your dwarves... the old axiom of Dwarf Fortress holds true -- Losing is FUN!",1679858770,1679858770,True,24,1,0.707191407680511475,0,True,False,False

The creature was massive, and my dwarves were understandably terrified. They all ran for cover, except for one brave and foolish miner who decided to take matters into his own hands.

The miner grabbed his pickaxe and charged towards the toad, swinging wildly. To everyone's surprise, he managed to land a hit, causing the toad to go berserk. The toad started jumping around the fortress, destroying everything in its path.

But my brave miner was undeterred. He continued to chase after the toad, swinging his pickaxe like a madman. Finally, after what seemed like hours, he managed to land the killing blow.

The entire fortress erupted in cheers, and my brave miner became a hero. But his victory was short-lived, as he was immediately struck down by a falling stalactite.

That's Dwarf Fortress for you – a game where even the most heroic of deeds can end in tragedy. But it's those moments that make the game so unique and enjoyable.

The sprite art is amazing and for the undead monstrosities that are procedurally generated, there are even customized sprites for whatever particular nightmare is eating your dwarves.Now, I would like to say that there _are_ a couple reasons to like the original over the steam version. The biggest for me is that now, creating tombs, nestboxes, and other rooms is _EXTREMELY TEDIOUS_! You can't just create a big room and then put coffins in it and call it a tomb, now you have to place a tiny 1x1 tomb zone over each coffin or they won't function. Especially on the steam deck, that kind of repetitious back and forth is just miserable. Secondly, while I overall love the new labor setup, there are still a few bugs in its interactions with work orders, standing orders, and the like, so sometimes you'll just be sitting there furiously wondering why your dwarves have ALL STOPPED MINING!! (the answer, fyi, is that you need to make more picks and put them in a stockpile because for some reason the picks that the dwarves are already carrying aren't _enough_)Small hangups aside, listen--this game rules. This past weekend, a full-on balrog, a great winged creature of flame and darkness came up from the caverns beneath my fortress, and with each roar, it spread fire in all directions. I panicked as my dwarves fled their tiny wooden fortifications and the monster drew closer. But then, suddenly, everything changed. You see, the giant mushroom stalks of the cavern had caught fire, and it turned out that they were actually supporting the cavern's vaulted ceilings. In one final roar of destruction, the balrog cracked through the supports around it, and brought the whole cavern down, burying it forever in flaming debris.

I might change the review if I ever learn and then can play the game.Edit: After playing the game for a while, I think I can recommend the game, you just have to get ready to learn or else you'll be at a roadblock. I wouldn't say there's a learning curve in the sense of this being ""the hardest game of all time"" and that the only way you could possibly play it is to have a 200 IQ brain, it's just a process of learning the controls and what you're supposed to do. The wiki is being updated with Steam's version of DF, so unless an article doesn't happen to have relevant information, the wiki does help explain things. Looking around the Steam Discussion boards helps too.Now for some of my experiences: I figured out how to run a fort after a few not-so-long games. Workshops, materials, jobs, militias, I don't think these are explained too well in the tutorial but after playing through a few forts, you should get an idea of what you have to do by then and can layout the plan of your fort ahead of time. Hotkeys aren't too serious to learn unless you can't bear having to click seven times to place a single door, which in that case you can just press a couple hotkeys to get to a menu then use clicks in succession to do what you wanted. I haven't messed with mechanical structures or fluids yet, besides trying to dig a hallway to let lava from a volcano in to a room so I can make a magma forge over it (the miner then burnt to death because the lava was faster than them). My experience with militias is limited since the only thing I had to fight off so far was a werebeast, just make sure to arm your dwarves accordingly and train them when regularly. I haven't found myself in need of trading with caravans, only when I'm low on drinks or happen to need something I can't make myself yet (whether because my fort isn't able to make it yet or because I haven't figured it out yet).",1674253618,1679694300,True,0,0,0.446007579565048218,0,True,False,False

If you played Doom first.. well, you probably wouldn't be too impressed by this less evolved version of Doom.  Now that again, but Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld.  Yes, DF has a world history that rimworld lacks (though if it has gameplay impacts beyond flavor text of books or whatever, nobody talks about them), DF has a number of different structures and etching and Z-levels and such, which are only available in Rimworld as mods, etc.  But Rimworld streamlined a bunch of the tedious craft first/place later of DF (only still present in sculptures), scoped down to a slightly smaller size to make you appreciate all the effort of every member of your colony, rather than growing to the DF fortress size of dozens of dwarves (and therefore never looking beyond the base stats for most of them to assign them jobs and forget about them).I'm not saying DF is bad - I am certain that DF has a lot to offer.  It's just.. if you asked me to recommend DF, I'd say ""play Rimworld instead; it's a better player experience, provides the same genre gameplay and epic stories of building amazing places and/or dying horrible, random and stupid deaths, and if you just LOVE dwarves, get some dwarf mods or make some with biotech DLC"".  That said, it IS a great look into the origin of the genre, and the steam release has refined the absolutely unusable control scheme that plagued the original to semi-modern standards (but you still need mods for hotkeys), finally bringing the original to playable levels.  I feel like Bay 12 still deserves its reward for it's genre defining gameplay and mechanics, so I don't regret the purchase..

You start off with a decent colonist (i. e. dwarf) count so that there is none of the sluggish starting phase as in the default 3 colonists setting of Rimworld.
Also the work tends to be more smoothly automated once you get to use work orders, you can automate most anything but still be flexible with one-time orders.
The fact that you have dozens of layers means you can expand quickly (albeit vertically) and will not run into space issues any time soon. (compared to Rimworld in a stony region)

For me it's definitely the better game (although I really like Rimworld) just for the bottomless freedom you have. The simple fact of quick expansion with a lot more characters means you are not constantly hamstrung / bottlenecked by bad traits, RNG luck on abilities etc.

However, with just some hours in I cannot yet say if there is sufficient 'external' motivation from enemies to make the game feel challenging.

This game is epic in soooo many aspects, annoyingly also epicly annoying in a few.

That's why us veterans talk about ""Losing is FUN!!!1111"" when we meet up and spill some mushroom beer into our grey beards.

Many years ago this XKCD-comic (xkcd.wtf/1223) led me into a gaming journey of a lifetime. I can only compare it to Sid Meiers Civilization in that regard, which has me under it's spell similar to Dwarf Fortress, although a few decades longer since elementary school me saw it's first incarnation on an amiga500.

Luckily for you many of my frustrations with the game over the years will be a thing of the past with the new steam version. May the reason Toady decided to go commercial be a sad one, the result is a great one indeed!

What really sets it apart is the personality of the dwarfs and other creatures you encounter and the many wild interactions they will have with each other. Overall my favorite aspect of the game is that I have about 320 hours in it so far and it feels like I learn something new every time I play. I can't say that about any other game. While the learning curve is quite steep the rewards are well worth it when you can sit back and watch your dwarfs do their thing.

This game is one of the only games I have played where being in the discords for the game itself and the popular mod DF hack lets you see the devs interact with the community on a daily basis. Really cool to see them work on this and while everything they talk about goes over my head as I know nothing about coding, its nice to see that interaction between Putnam and the players.

On the other hand, even though it had been out for months, there are some issues.  Right clicking, instead of taking you to the earlier menu, takes you out totally.  Some buttons are not clear on what they do.  There seems to be no tool tip system.  The tutorial makes me think of the tutorials in Paradox games.  If you don’t play Paradox games that isn’t a GOOD thing.
The military menus are, somehow, harder to understand and I miss the older military menus.  
The hospital zone has to be placed over bedrooms.  Coffins each need to be placed in their own tomb zone.  Birds don’t seem to want to use next boxes.  The game does not record announces or events so there is no log to go over after something happened...
And I can’t to figure out how to get the mods I picked in Steam to work in the game.  A menu I am missing?  Maybe in settings?
I tried looking up information in YouTube and on the wiki but much of it is…well..wrong.  Or outdated.  Or just copied and pasted from older versions.  Even people on the DF forums are as confused as I am.
I think the problem is misinformation and maybe updates have changed a few things since it was first released?
I love it.  And would suggest getting it.  But even for old players the amount of time you will be searching and failing is going to frustrate you.

You do have to do some due diligence and read a little to know what's really happening, and what's really going on is truly complex. I do genuinely grow somewhat attached to particular dwarves as I watch their personality change based on their experiences. The variety of ways you can fuck up is quite astounding. I love this game, but I would recommend playing the non-steam version for now. This version of the game does appear to be missing quite a few options that help to properly run the fortress, and as such, there's a lot of brain numbing waiting for specific things to be done that you can't prioritize simply because there is no way to prioritize them for whatever reason. There seems to be some inconsistencies between versions in the farming department and old tricks to ensure you have stock of certain plants seems to be a bit finicky. Things will go missing sometimes. Dwarves will cancel constructions with ""unable to find path"" even though there is no blockage and restarting the construction makes it work fine. Most vitally of all, in my opinion, is the fact that Burrows do NOT work. For the uninformed, burrows are an area you can restrict certain dwarves to, its something akin to a district maybe, in which the dwarves will live and work in that ""district"" and only leave if you allow them to. There's a lot of utility to burrows, but in the steam edition of this game they do NOT function as intended. A big part of the game is using an ""emergency burrow"" (a burrow with every dwarf assigned to it, in a defensible area of the fortress) when you come under invasion or siege, as activating (un-suspending) the burrow will have all dwarves drop what they're doing, and high-tail it to the safe zone. It is incredibly vital that this feature works as trying to manage 30 something different dwarves all in different places doing different things, in combat. On top of that, they are much more easily picked off when they are alone, of course. So what do they do when they get called to a burrow in the steam version? They just *stop*. They freeze, and get stun-locked, and scream at you about how they can't find a path. They stand stark still, and won't even defend themselves now, simply staying statue if an enemy pulls up. Only dwarves not currently performing a task will make it, and that is quite often only a few children/babies and maybe a peasant or two. This is very problematic and the first two times I tried the strategy, I lost 60% of my population VERY quickly before I realized what was happening or why it was. 

Unfortunately, there are no mods to fix this, and despite it making the game borderline unplayable in specific but common scenarios, it has yet to be fixed (it has been an issue for a good while already). So for the reasons of missing content, a good handful of minor bugs, and even some essentially game breaking ones, I can't recommend the game ON STEAM, YET. I really do love this game, and i'm probably even going to keep playing it on steam anyway, but it isn't worth it to buy this in it's current state when there is a free version that's honestly still a lot better. It's a bit less user-friendly unfortunately, but in the long term the ""old"" version is just preferable.

I got interested in this title due to it's status as an ""overwhelmingly positive"". First look in to this game through videos and screenshots were okay. I felt like I could enjoy this, as it has similarities to RimWorld - a game which I absolutely love and adore. This little spark of excitement got immediately lost after I made my first entry to the game. Here is why;

- UI fails to deliver much excitement and/or feel of interaction. By not having any mouseover effects on buttons, interacting with the game is extremely dull and unpleasing.

- Performance is... awful. It's amazing how much this game generates when creating a new world, but if that can't be optimized to meet any kind of current industry standards, I'd seriously opt-in for better performance over the unnecessarily huge pile of randomness I'll most certainly never get to engage with during gameplay anyway.

- Price is not in any way justified. I'd be less vigilant on my feedback, was it a ten-bucks game we were talking about. But no, thirty-bucks with a maximum of a 10-percent discount at best. That's a downright robbery for something like this. I get the point where you'd gladly opt-in for a higher price due to how amazing and committed the developers are, but to someone like me, who kind of wants and needs a good ""first impressions experience"" without knowing much about anyone behind the game, it's not a solid reason at all. It's a 20-year old game and it plays out exactly like a 20-year old game. It should not have a price tag of an indie game released just now.

As a conclusion, I'd much rather purchase RimWorld a second time than purchase this game. It's just not a good experience, unless of course, you are an old-school game geek and happen to love the dev's commitment to all this.",1679326454,1679326454,False,12,1,0.441800832748413086,0,True,False,False

I always had a fascination with Dwarf Fortress, way before the steam release.  But the graphics even with tile support, third party apps like Dwarf Therapist, and only using the keyboard turned me away.  Now all of those could have been overcome, and I kind of wish I had; but my attention span can be short when it comes to what game to play next.

Now that the game is on Steam I dived in hard, and I was straight up addicted to this game for about a month and a half.  What I got out of this game was a fantastic colony sim where every one of your dwarves acts like an independent person full of wants, fears, and booze.  Now part of me feels like I can get the unique units in other colony sims, but Dwarf fortress isn’t just about mechanically building the best fort.  It’s digging deeper, interacting with the other races, and pushing the boundaries so you get to experience FUN!  All these mesh very well and I think its all of these in a fantasy world that really hooked me.

Is it hard to get into?  Really its not as bad as I first imagined.  With default settings on the starting biomes I actually felt like I wasn’t being challenged enough.  Alot of the stories you have heard about difficulty were in older versions of the game, do don't have that put you off from buying.  The UI though may give you a tough time and while I put up with it I hope its better optimized.  It does need a second pass with feed back.

While I am now taking a break from this game, the eventual adventure mode and hopefully great increases to performance will bring me right back in the hopefully near future.

It's a management sim and a world sim that are completely unrivaled. 

My first fortress I was overrun by angry crows. Did some researching and I learned if you destroy enough of the environment the wildlife will spawn in hostile. At the time of that fort there was also a bug which caused animal aggression to max out if you had anyone fishing, this bug has been fixed. 

Lost the next fort to FPS death. Did some research into why my frame rate was so bad. It's partly my 7 year old pc, but I did have a ton of garbage accumulating which drains resources. I learned afterwards that performers and performances also cause a lot of fps loss. (Thanks Putnam for the info)

My following fort I lost to tantruming dwarfs. Turns out if you don't clean up corpses the dwarfs get upset. 

The things that the dwarfs think about are very realistic. If it makes you happy it would make the dwarfs happy. If it would upset you it would probably make your dwarfs upset. 

My current fortress has repelled hundreds of goblins and 14 forgotten beasts. I am doing well with what I have learned, but I expect that to end soon.

You have to go into it knowing the game's moto. Losing is Fun. 

I expect by the anniversary of this game in Dec.  2023 I'll have close to 2000 hours. It's amazing and I love it.",1677457675,1679284205,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I highly respect the devs for giving Dwarf Fortress more ""accessible"" graphics for the average gamer (like me), but the UI needs a serious revamp to boost Dwarf Fortress to new accessibility heights. As a complete beginner, having the wiki open as a reference while you play is a requirement, because there is no other way to know what certain workshops are for, and what certain items are for, and why you should bother making them. The game provides little to no information in tooltips, and I get that the devs expect you to figure it out somehow as you play, and lose and die a lot as you bumble around, it sort of diminishes the fun factor for me when I feel like the UI itself is providing the conflict, and not the game mechanics. 

(If there ARE UI tooltips explaining what certain things do, then I must be blind because I've never found it.)

For example, it took me diving into the wiki just to figure out how to set up and equip a military squad. And even then, I'm still confused as to why my squad is refusing to equip certain pieces of armor that I crafted for them. It's a bit of a nightmare, and the game fails to explain any of it to you in a way that is obvious to the player. 

This is ultimately my only complaint- and it's a big one- because the game itself should be the challenge and not the navigation thereof. That said, if you don't mind alt-tabbing into Wikipedia whenever you encounter something confusing, you will get a lot out of Dwarf Fortress and you will be able to appreciate its vast scope and depth.

But I do have a few critiques that I hope the developers will address soon. They are the following:

1. I believe there needs to be longer, more varied, and more numerous ambient tracks (both in terms of music and in-game ambiance, such as tavern noises or rain). I would like to no longer constantly hear seagulls screeching and wolfs howling. It gets annoying fast.

2. I know that the developers did a huge amount of work developing this UI and UX for the Steam Release, but I think making alerts more noticeable, menus less bulky and more responsive, etc. would be great. 

3. The current release still has quite a few bugs. This I can understand, this is Dwarf fortress after all, one of the biggest games ever. Still though, why is it so difficult to get a squad to equip crossbows with bolts, and have them actually shoot at the agitated crows that harass me every five seconds?

4. To add onto that UI and UX point, having a better system for making custom worlds and more default options would be great. Having some sort of slider to set an exact amount of years, or explaining in-game what values correlate to which default settings would be another good thing to add. In fact, a lot of really basic information is left out of the game itself, and has to be accessed via the wiki, which is fine for the most part, but can be inconvenient sometimes.

5. Combat longs are nearly incomprehensible. I understand this game comes from an era where having a more simple readout for these kinds of things is expected, but having it be more clear from the alert about who is attacking who, who is on who's side, and maybe some additional visual indicators (such as a body diagram) would be great additions. 

6. The sprite work in the v0.50 release is some great stuff, but there is still a lot missing. 

7. On the map screen, getting an idea of the geopolitical conditions of the world you've generated is somewhat difficult

8. The economy. I should acknowledge that I am new to DF and I've heard that something resembling an economy used to exist in DF, but was disabled. But as it stands right now, what determines the prices of various things is kinda arbitrary. I know having some sort of Victoria 2-esk system would be ever-so-slightly insane to ask of the devs, but accounting for scarcity and marco-economic factors should be an important point.",1670808624,1679195987,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will take breaks and play other things, but I will never be ""done"" playing Dwarf Fortress because it will always have something new to offer. The best description I've heard of DF that really expresses just how open-ended it is, is that it is like single-player D&D, where the game is your Dungeon Master. Nested inside an uncannily lifelike simulation is an incredibly complex colony management game, as well as ""Adventurer Mode"" where you can play an open-world RPG as a single adventurer and explore the world you've created, including your old fortresses. If you're into colony sims or roguelike RPGs this game scratches a particular itch in a way that no other can. And it is only about halfway through being developed, huge new features are planned to be added in the coming years.

While the new Steam release has massively overhauled the UI from previous versions, there are still some frustrating aspects of it that haven't been ironed out yet, and make the game harder to get the hang of. This game will always have a bigger learning curve than other games due to its sheer complexity, and some of these issues make it that much harder to learn.

Adventurer Mode was not included in the initial Steam release, it sounds like it should be out no later than early 2024.

Just remember people when playing this game the motto is, ""Losing is fun!!!!"" :3 Although this game can be unforgiving, yet it's always fun to play even when one loses. It allows one to see either the rise of a Dwarven civilization that one creates personally with the help of your dwarves. Or watch the dawning age of a Megabeast rise to power and terrorize the land along with your dwarves. Or you can open up hell once you dig down far enough, the skies the limit when you play Dwarf Fortress. Heck you might just get lucky and get a dwarf who enters into a fey mood to create a legendary artifact and are rewarded with the hilarioyus situation when one of them makes a legendary crafted leather thong encrusted in jewels and bones. Who then proceeds to don this artifact and strut his stuff around your fort while everyone admires his dwarf craftsmanship. Honestly everything in this game is randomly generated from the world to your dwarves to when they enter into such fey states to what they craft. It will always keep you guessing just what's going to happen next? But honestly this game has been a favorite of mine since my friend introduced me to it. Although it will take you a while to learn the games mechanics it's honestly well worth the price. For this game offers a high level of playability with all of the worlds one can randomly generate where nothing is the exact same due to how you can customize and tailor the generation of the world.

Even at that age I had a fondness for the black and green text of old school style command line interfaces and mainframes. To me, getting closer to the computer's hardware is like getting closer to some sort of truth. Naturally the ASCII art style and very low level programming style of the game tickled this fancy. 

I donated to Tarn and Zach at a young age with money I made working a part time job in high school. In return they sent me a drawing of a Velociraptor riding on the back of a rocket, firing an AK-47, in space, several UFO's floated about the page and they even had sparkly blue crayon hulls. I think that's what my teenage brain asked for them to draw but I can't remember. Unfortunately, I loved the game but, like many others, found it to be so obtuse to play compared to other games I had at my fingertips, but always in the back of my mind, I knew there was so much potential if I just sat down and learned the damn thing.

With the release however, that is all changing. This is the version that anyone can play. The art style strikes a perfect balance between visual appeal and psuedo-nostalgia. It's like the game has sprung into life. There is enough graphical representation for you to understand the world, but not enough to rob you of an opportunity to use your own mind's eye and creativity to form stories and scenes of what is happening on the screen before you. While there is a wealth of information, there is still plenty of space for you to draw your own conclusions. These dworf worship a God - 'The Submerged' that represents Rivers, and they want you to build them a temple, so why not fill it with statues of otters, fish and waterfowl, and place it submerged underneath the bed of a river? Intrinsically there is not a difference between this and a 4x4 square with a masterwork level decorated throne. But extrinsically, it is everything.

Easy comparisons to this game are right in front of us: Kenshi, Rimworld, Going Medieval, Factorio etc. All with various levels of 'game-mechanics'. But Dwarf Fortress is really a unique experience. Rimworld is a challenging game where you have to pay special attention to colonists needs and there are many pitfalls that end runs. You research new technology, engage actively in combat systems, and have several win conditions. DF gives you everything at the start, there is no win condition, and you mainly engage in combat through interacting with your Fortress, not your dworf. When you lose, the first thought isn't, dang I suck, it is, well, there is not perfect fortress, and all fortress must end, and now I get to make a new one, with all of the experience and knowledge I have now, this one will be the best one yet, hmmm... I think I will try to settle near a Necromancers tower this time, and see what that is like.
 
The point I am making is that Dwarf Fortress is not a game. Dwarf Fortress is a canvas. Sure, your fortress can fail, but it is much easier to NOT fail. The game gives you room to learn and grow and experiment, and is not so focused on winning and losing. The engagement I feel working on a fort is unlike any other solo game I have played. You learn your dwarves and they develop a history that only you know. In my current fort, I have a warrior who was heavily wounded in combat and as such is very slow and unable to fight, and has now retired to live near the duchess' tower and crafts all of the stone statues throughout my fort. I have a dworf who is not injured, but still as slow, because they have on around 20 crowns. Is that a bug? Or is that dwarf just enthralled with crowns? Time to read about their personality to find out.

I kept finding clothes all over the floor of dwarves bedrooms. I read that a cabinet in their bedroom will solve that, as dwarves will put their old clothes in there. But I still found that a couple dwarves were still leaving their clothes everywhere. I was frustrated by this, until later that day, I walked into MY bedroom, and what do I find? Clothes all over the floor next to my cabinet. That was the moment that I fell in love. Dwarf Fortress is not a game, Dwarf Fortress is alive. 

Dwarf Fortress is the closest you will ever come to communicating with Armok himself.

Ah, Frodo. Erebor. Built deep within the mountain itself the beauty of this fortress city was legend. Its wealth lay in the earth in precious gems hewn from rock and in great seams of gold running like rivers through stone. The skill of the Dwarves was unequaled fashioning objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Ever they delved deeper, down into the dark. And that is where they found it. The Heart of the Mountain. The Arkenstone. Thror named it ""The King's Jewel."" He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine. All would pay homage to him. Even the great Elven King, Thranduil. As the great wealth of the Dwarves grew their store of good will ran thin. No one knows exactly what began the rift. The Elves say the Dwarves stole their treasure. The Dwarves tell another tale. They say the Elf King refused to give them their rightful pay.

It is sad, Frodo, how old alliances can be broken. How friendships between peoples can be lost. And for what? But the years of peace and plenty were not to last. Slowly the days turned sour and the watchful nights closed in. Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce. A sickness had begun to grow within him. It was a sickness of the mind. And where sickness thrives bad things will follow. The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane coming down from the North. The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked in the hot, dry wind. 

Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the wrath of the dragon. No help came from the Elves that day nor any day since.

Once you do, you find that Dwarf Fortress becomes both a game and an experience.  So many moments and stories emerge while you try and guide your fledgling outpost to a sprawling city.  A soldier single handedly killing a weredeer because it woke him up only to go back to bed immediately after.  An elf somehow integrating himself into your society so well that he's elected as the fort's mayor.  Helping your guards solve a series of murders to apprehend a rogue vampire who's been hiding within your population.  Even something like bringing back the dwarves from the brink of extinction in a world teeming with evil lands.

Losing is fun is the mantra of this game and for good reason.  Because Dwarf Fortress isn't a game that's meant to be beaten.  You will lose.  But that's okay as every time you lose its another chance to start a new story from the beginning, to see what interesting things your dwarves will get into.  Playing dwarf Fortress is less about winning and more about the experiences you and the game create together.

I've sunk a decent amount of time into this game though not nearly as much as those from the ASCII days.  So I can say with confidence that if someone as scatterbrained as me can learn this game then you can too.  Give the game a shot, keep the Dwarf Fortress Wiki handy (you'll reference it *a lot*) and pull up some beginner tutorials on youtube.  Once you start understanding how each system in the game fits together, you'll see why so many people refer to this game as a masterpiece.

It is extremely nuanced.

I set up a tavern but forgot to serve prepared meals, the only had ale and rum, well also five entertainers and a large dance floor and some rooms to rent. What could go wrong. The dwarven miners and elvin spear men both got drunk, a fight broke out, all of my miners and all of the visiting spear men died and over sixty surviving dwarves showed up at my 12 bed hospital seeking treatment. It took months to train new minors and get all the other workers back to work. Total chaos.

Then there was time I accidently flooded my castle.

The still is not bugged. But the still must be connected to a stockpile of fermentable items and a stockpile of barrels. One carpenter shop with logs of the desired type that only makes barrels feeds the still's barrel stockpile. The still then feeds the drink stockpile which serves the drinks served in tavern and dining halls and then returns empty barrels to the still's barrel stockpile. For the fermentable items grown, they must go to a harvest stockpile which feeds a 3x1 mill stock pile for each item when then feeds a 2x2 seed stockpile with no barrels next to the planting area or the brewer will ferment the entire crop without saving any seeds and then next season you have no ingredients. So the still is not bugged, just incredibly comlicated and frail.

The user interface has a lot of potential for improvement though and it is quite cumbersome to use at times. I understand this might be a sensitive topic since this game has so many hardcore fans that are used to things being exactly as they are. But I think even the hardcore fans would appreciate a more powerful, better looking and easier to use UI once they try it. As a C++ programmer / UI designer I see so many things in the UI that could easily be improved with just a few hours of work.

Some examples of things that can be improved in the UI:

1) Better search when adding tasks : Many workstations have their tasks sorted into groups, but the search only searches in the list of groups, not inside the group. So if you don't know which category an item is located in, you have to manually go into every category and have a look since you cannot search for it, and often the categories and sub categories. I spent like 5-10 minutes just to find where the pipe was located.

2) Same for search when adding items in work order conditions, I couldn't for the life of me find some items in that list, searched in every category and didn't find it. But it must exist somewhere since the item I wanted to find was suggested as conditions for work orders of other items.

3) Better mouse input handling. I noticed that many times when I click to place a furniture nothing happens and it doesnt even register the click. But if I click, hold the mouse button down for a while before releasing it, then it registers as a click. Pausing the game makes the input handling faster and it misses clicks less often. It would be easy to make a change to trigger on a mouse click event, instead of checking for mouse down in the render loop. In general the UI should have highest priority and not be sluggish when the game rendering is slow. I don't mind rendering the game at a slower frame rate, but the UI should always be responsive.

4) If you are in a submenu and want to go back, right clicking will close all the menus and not just take you back one step, and you have to start all over. Add a way to make it possible to go back only one level.

5) Just general overhaul of the whole user interface to look over each feature to see if its placed logically, and if the icon could be improved. High res icons that are clearer to see. Tooltip on icons to explain the what it does. Furniture buttons could show if items are in stock for example. Reduce the number of clicks needed for common tasks. Borrow some ideas from Rimworld UI. 

6) Make room quality visible somewhere.

7) Make dwarf names clickable and take me to the dwarf information screen. For example if you are in the nobels menu and want to check the information of one of the dwarfs, you gotta remember it's name, then go to the citizen menu, sort by name, scroll the list until you find it, then click the information button. There is no search function so you gotta search the list manually. Everywhere in the UI where a dwarf name is shown, it should always be clickable and take me to that dwarf. 

8) Allowed pawn zones, like Rimworld, that makes it impossible for pawns to walk outside them. I know you can set a priority so they have general path finding preference, but it still doesn't stop 100 dwarfs from all jumping into the river and drowning even if you cover the whole river with lowest priority zone. I built a bridge over a body of water, set the bridge to highest priority, set all the water and surrounding tiles to lowest priority, made sure to forbid every item in the water. Still one managed to fall in,  and then they all followed like lemmings and drowned. Fun times though :-)

I could keep writing, like I said, there is a lot of potential for UI improvements :-)

Anyway, thanks for making this awesome game and for bringing it to Steam with improved graphics.

For me, there are two major issues with the game:
 1- It lacks basic information inside the game, you often need to search the wiki to see what something is supposed to do.
 2- You need to setup a ton of stuff just to get started. I do like simulation games with big complexity, but I like it better when it starts simpler and gets harder as you strive for better end-game stuff.

The strongest feature of this game for me is the ability to build along the Z axis, it's the first game of the genre that I see this feature on.

I see people praising the game for the complex simulation and how the overworld map is big and detailed, but you can't really tap into it because you are stuck to your starting area.

Seriously, this game has been in development for something like 2 decades.  It's got physics to the point that it can produce mushroom clouds internally (search on: Thermonuclear catsplosion).  Seeing all the physics at work is another matter given the interface, but the mushrooms will form, and this isn't just limited to 'hot air rises'.  It's got random generation of dieties, instruments, creatures, and some other elements.  And I don't mean 'slap another color palete on it and call it a 'Creepy slime'.  I mean, 'slap some extra eyes on it, some wings, let it spit webs, and make it from....(rolls die)  Steel.  Make it from steel.  And dust was sooo close too - well, you might survive this....'

It is at heart a story generator.  Can you have happy stories?  Say, a buncha kid dwarves save a pet bunny rabbit from a giant grisly bear?  Yes.  Can it have sad stories? yes, the grisly was followed by a cyclops...  What stories you get is up to the game, and what stories you find and adore is up to you.

My game's current story?  Well, a Necromancer has just become mayor, ruling over my dwarves in the 'Gate of Mastery'.  No idea where this is going, but it's got the cast and setting all ready looking snazzy.  Also, don't worry about the kid dwarves who are helping the rabbit.  They had the snot beat out of the bear long before the guards came on scene, and the kids skedadled before the cyclops got near.  Alas, for my guards, the cyclops has a ton more fight to it  than the bear, but I have the best dwarven medical staff waiting.  Well, when I say ""best"", I mean ""knows how to cut gemstones"".

If would recommend it if you are ready to invest some time to dig deep into the learning pit, if want to kill alot of time and have the ability to look past flaws to see beauty.
To get into the game I would recommend that you generate a world. Dive in - fail or get stuck/annoyed at the UI - read some wiki or look some tutorials. Rince and reapet a few times and then you can start to play the game(but will still most likely fail, get annoyed and have to search outside sources for information).
And before you invest to much time in a fortress do read about world generating settings and the advanced options.
Want to play and build in a quite peaceful world - possible. Want to see how long you can survive in a unforgiving, hellish
world - also possible. You can make your fortress area hundreds of levels(height - Z-lvls) for megaprojects or a smaller colony with a dozen or so lvls. The advanced setting will allow you to customize alot of things.
For me some patience trying things so fair is the UI and it´s lack of certain features. A search bar would definitly be helpful.
Stockpile management sure takes some fiddling to get somewhat functional. Be ready to deal with miasma and gemsetters putting dozens of gems on a single item.
On the good side - game is so outdated that it is not a dlc pushing, microtransaction, moneygrabbing business(atleast not yet). You can feel that it´s a labour of love or maybe a decades long slightly autistic obsession ;) from a game artists and not just from programmers doing their job.

Once your excitement wanes and you snap out of the mass-hysteria and learn to recognise you're being gaslit by cult-ish followers, you'd quickly realise that this game is a shoddily-made product that's not ready for release.

Some of the highlights of my bigger pet peeves:

- dwarves believing in so many deities they don't even have time worshipping each one of them even if they do nothing but worshipping for years, and they often go into an endless loop of purple-worshipping, with each instance potentially lasting for weeks that doesn't satisfy worshipping requirements to any particular deity anyway.

- dwarves rarely caring about meeting their personal needs apart from drinking and eating.

- dwarves hoarding old clothes and wearing tattered clothing when new clothes are available.

- dwarves wanting to interact with family and friends and ""making romance"" but making no effort at spending time at the tavern.

- kids going to the caverns and subsequently dying, since there are no zone restrictions based on age or other characteristics (burrows don't work in a way that makes sense to non-cult followers). You either set children to do nothing and watch your fortress lag behind hauling jobs or set them to do everything and some of them may die being killed by cave dwellers.

- the pretense that this game focuses on realism, hence the (unnecessary) complexities of e.g. soap manufacturing involving lye and tallow and musical instrument parts and such and yet:
---> cave alligators can open doors and climb up 40 floors;
---> you can't bury or cremate bodies of invaders;
---> i've never personally seen any instruments being played
---> soap is rarely used and dwarves don't shower frequently enough if at all

- sherrif/captain of the guard beating convicts even when there are plenty of prison cells

- i've not found a way to retrieve stolen items from thieves caught red-handed, except by killing them.

- haggard children throwing tantrums constantly with the mean-time-to-reoccur being too short.  

- the constant baby-sitting through auto-cancelling of mining designations of aquifer tiles, an annoying feature that you can't disable (reminds me of Windows Vista UAC) and yet:
---> cave-ins happen without warning 
---> children get eaten alive 
---> injured dwarves walk happily with their guts out instead of seeking medical attention
---> war dogs just charge on enemies killing themselves

- the spamming of thoughts that don't affect dwarves (e.g. your bone carvers and children who don't care about seeing dead animal carcasses) and yet these thoughts occupy pages of their recent thoughts report.

---

I could go on. But in sum, if you're new to the genre, don't buy this game. Wait until the developers show adequate commitment at fixing bugs and making the game feature complete. Right now it just looks like they're doing this as a pastime to entertain close friends after school in daddy's garage. I don't think they're serious enough and they're not ready with scaling and managing a commercial enterprise with profit-motive. They're not ready to take money from you and assume full responsibility that comes with it.

If you're new to this game but you've already some experience with similar titles like RimWorld, Going Medieval, Lords and Villeins etc., you'd probably end up wanting to love this game so much but you will be disappointed.

I can understand the appeal to the game, really I do, but its executed poorly.
The game has a small but dedicated community, which honestly make sense since its been free for a while and still is, but this is my first time playing and if I'm paying money then the game should get reviewed as such.

the UI is horrendous, navigating anything feels like a chore that should have been one of the main focuses when making a payed more newbie friendly version of the game.

You can have an extremely detailed system of organs and bones for a single dwarf but then this over engineered system is not used in any meaningful way! A dwarf will simply just walk up to the enemy and they will bash each other until one dies to some horrible wound, which from looking at other peoples experiences appears to mostly be head related injuries.

Furthermore the game has so many bugs and glitches, and odd features that you need to watch a youtube tutorial or search something on google to understand it, its frustrating and time consuming. Which again would be fine for the free version, but I payed some money and I dont want to spend 50% of my time reading tutorials to figure out how to start the game.

Finally but not least, My game crashed more times then I can care to remember, deleting basically any progress you make unless your saving manually very often. Everything Ive experienced would be excusable if this was in early access with a promise of being fixed in the future, but that does not seem to be the case as of right now.

Honestly id suggest researching and looking at videos and other things online before buying to see if you would like this game or not.

Let me tell you a story; a tale of sorrow - a dwarf plagued by demons, doomed to succumb to his own harrowing mind and the genius that was inevitably his downfall. The first dwarf to set foot in a new land; the first dwarf ever to call this new place home, and the first to leave his home behind.

Groden, an expedition leader of a ragtag band of misfit dwarf-folk, has claimed new land for his people. A sprawling vista of cherry trees, home to a bubbling brook. Truly this mountaintop was a sight for sore eyes. There was no time wasted, and the mountain upon which they stood quickly became their home. Each civillian was given a lofty room of their own, painstakingly mined out by Groden's sufficient skill as a miner. Each room was a mansion all its own, foolishly left too large by Groden's architects. Every dwarf under the mountain lived like a king, and when Groden's age tired his back and lowered his efficiency as a miner, he was granted retirement with the colony's blessings. He took on a new hobby; a task he could perform even in his old age. Groden decided to become a Gemcutter. Even as a retired expedition leader, he always put the colony first. With his newfound skills, he bejewled every dwarf's living quarters, and single handedly turned their quaint outsource of mussel shells into a bustling economy founded solely on his jewelry. Groden was the sole reason his home was built, and now was the sole reason it flourished. Cash flowed in like wine, dwarves always had a smile on their face, and Groden's family grew. Entire books were literally written about his  master craftsmanship, and his deeds were told to every stranger that frequented the dwarven taverns.

However...Groden's joy was not meant to last. He had become a legendary craftsman in his time, and on occasion, he would segregate himself from the others to work in private. It was in these moments he made his greatest creations, but no dwarf would have guessed that it was these same moments that cost Groden his sanity. In his old age, Groden had found that his skill as a gemcutter was wavering. He could not perform like he used to, and this ate at his mind. He longed to help his fellow dwarves, but felt that his new work was never enough. His bouts of lonesome crafting grew more frequent - his family saw little of him.

Groden, at last, fell into a state of irredeemable melancholy. He failed for the first time ever in making his latest creation. He was broken...He slowly walked to the entrance of the cave, past the trading post, and right to the edge of mountaintop. His last thought as he plummeted to the ground: ""I cannot stand the world any longer...""

Thus ended the story of Groden the legendary craftsman and founder of the Dwarf Fortress. He was buried in the tomb he himself had built. He was layed in a coffin of his design, layered with jewels of his make. And in the proper dwarven fashion: Two socks but only one shoe.

Rest in Peace, Groden. May your fortress prosper, and may the knife-ears starve on their diet of greens.

This story was told entirely by the game. It kept track of Groden's every thought, his mental state, his interaction with his fellow dwarves, and his age. I was merely the audience in this troubling tale. And this is merely one dwarf of a hundred, each with their unique personalities.

On many other levels, filled with janky half-baked mechanics and a lot of randomly generated text that occasionally hits a grand slam but often just spits out a lot of procedural semi-gibberish to sort through. 

I think it’s fair to say this is easily the greatest simulation of a fantasy world ever created. I’ve read that people have used Dwarf Fortress for DnD world building, and thirty seconds in the Legends mode sorting through the history of the tens of thousands of data points within a 100 year world can easily show you why.

It’s also an observably unfinished game with tons of things that are just not implemented. The mid-game is somewhat non-existent and you’ll quickly find out that a stable fortress is a boring fortress, so injecting madness in to the game by spawning in an evil biome or doing silly experiments is the easiest way to keep the fun rolling. Unfortunately, I feel like the hardest enemy in the game is the engine, because every single one of my stable fortresses have just succumbed to running way too slow. It feels like a lot of the endgame learning in this game is figuring out how to design a functional fortress which doesn’t kill your FPS.

But damn – I have a forgotten beast stuck in my water pipes because I forgot to seal them properly and I know he’s slowly gaining strength swimming upstream. I have an errant dwarven child named Kogan who is carrying nine scepters in one hand (somehow), who was completely traumatized by being assigned corpse-hauling duty that Kogan’s daily tantrum usually ends in a murder. And there’s nothing quite like watching an invading goblin horde attempt to work their way through your zig-zagging trap hallway, getting dismembered along the way before giving up and running home. The stories this game can help you create are incredible, hilarious, dramatic, and everything in between. 

Well worth exploring if you are, on any level, curious, imaginative, and willing to learn. It's more art than game at times, and it's also a little more random than you might want it to be... but sometimes, the engraving you decide to read is actually amusing, or the forgotten beast that spawns is made of something odd, or something comes together to make some absurd story that only Dwarf Fortress can make.

It was inspired by 2D roguelike games from the 1990's such as Rogue, Moria, and others. Originally Dwarf Fortress was designed to lay the foundation for a roguelike cRPG. But as the simulation evolved it became increasingly complex, eventually taking 20+ years of development. And it's still unifinished. Over the years Dwarf Fortress has inspired many other popular games such as Minecraft, Terraria, Factorio, and others.

Dwarf Fortress is essentially a fantasy roguelike city-builder. It plays like a combination of Age of Empires, Minecraft, and the SIMs, with a light touch of Dungeons & Dragons and Sid Meier's Civilization.

The goal of Dwarf Fortress is to amass wealth, defend your fortress, and keep your growing population happy.

_________________

The early days of your fortress are spent simply trying to scavenge enough food, clothing, and alcohol to survive. As your fortress stabilizes you will attract new migrants, but also thieves and robbers. Your fortress will slowly become wealthy by trading in processed good, mostly jewelry and weapons. You defend yourself with traps, hunting dogs, and untrained militia. Each Dwarf has their own personality, skills, and talents that you can take advantage of to increase profits. Dwarves fall in love, have children, make merry, and celebrate life.

In the mid-game you will continuously expand your fortress to accommodate your ever growing population. You will dig ever deeper seeking rarer and rarer minerals. Guild halls refine your industry and pass knowledge down to future generations. Jealous Goblins, Elves, and Humans will send armies to besiege your fortress. You will defend yourself with siege weapons, high walls, and a fully trained army.

In the late-game your fortress will compete for status with other fortresses in the realm. Nearby settlements will swear fealty to you out of fear. You can rise through the political ranks and even become high king. Your elite soldiers will raid settlements far and wide stealing artifacts of rare beauty and power. Monsters with godlike power will travel from afar to plunder your wealth. Underworld demons with unspeakable names will invade your fortress from the caverns below.

And then you will lose. Your fortress will inevitably succumb to invasion, starvation, or madness. And then you will start again.

You see, Dwarf Fortress takes place in a simulated world procedurally generated ala Civilization style. When you reach game over you can begin again in the same world, and thus the story continues. You can even send out expeditions to reclaim your old, defeated fortress. The game keeps track of the settlements and monsters in your game and what they are up to. Over time you will create a world history that is deeply personal and uniquely your own.
____________________

That's what Dwarf Fortress is all about. So is it worth playing? Well, to be honest, my answer is ""no."" And I'll elaborate on why...

(1) Bugs. Dwarf Fortress is buggy. Less buggy than some games. But enough to be frustrating when fundamental features don't work. Crashes aren't uncommon either.

(2) User Interface. A lot of time playing Dwarf Fortress will simply be spent battling a clunky user interface.

(4) Learning Curve. Dwarf Fortress on Steam still has a steep learning curve. About half your time playing the game will be spent reading the wiki. And not all the information on the wiki is up to date.

(5) Oversaturated Market. There are many, many, many excellent roguelikes and City-Builders on Steam to choose from. Many of these games have a faster learning curve and less bugs than Dwarf Fortress.

(6) Adventure Mode: Remember how Dwarf Fortress was originally designed to be the foundation for a cRPG? Well, that game exists in alpha state and it is called Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode. Adventure Mode is widely considered the best part of Dwarf Fortress and it's free online for those who don't mind ASCII graphics. It isn't available on Steam yet, but they intend to patch it in within a year or two. It can be downloaded for free online.
__________________

Conclusion: Wait for the Adventure Mode update to release in a year or two. Dwarf Fortress will hopefully be more polished by then. And there are many other excellent city-builders and roguelikes on the market to choose from. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simulation with unparalleled depth, can overlook the flaws, and are willing to invest the time to learn how to play, then Dwarf Fortress will likely be a very rewarding game for you.

Pro:
Complexity.

Con:
Complexity.

Every playthrough is unique and the game is satisfyingly complex and difficult.  The game's complexity creates a rich playing experience, yet its complexity also creates a steep learning curve, a general lack of user-friendliness, and occasional problems with instability.  My most recent issue has been unexplained crashes, but I have played 101 hours and the game has crashed 2-3 times.

I generally hate roguelikes. I find them to be a trash way to vomit up reused assets over and over. However, it is very different when the game is either... 
A: Balanced despite randomness 
or
B: Genre-appropriate such as Minecraft and other sims

Having played this game, it fits far more into the B category. It's broke as all hell, but it still surprises me in what it accomplishes. I have played 100+ hours, and yet there is so much I have never witness, such as desert biomes, ocean biomes, and all the insanity that comes with.
When I love this game:
Either do or do not play this amazing, wonderful, and horrible game. I am not being cruel to it. There are certain levels of bad game that go so far and beyond the realm of bad game that anything nice is an insult to reviewing it. This is into that territory at times, and so does not deserve politeness. I am still playing this awful game.

When I hate this game:
It's Dwarf Fortress. You are going to have a bad time. It is a bad game, and I don't mean ""it's not for me"" or any other type of D-List answer. Screw this game, screw the people who made it, and punish their family for three generations like a criminal in North Korea. I feel like I have been trapped in a concentration camp. Literally go play Minecraft or something. Avoid this game. I gave it a chance. I had hopes because I love supporting indie devs out of my wallet. Fuck this game.

That being said....

Is DF worth the 30 bucks, even though it was for free for a century?? Just for graphics and better UI?
Yes. Yes yes yes. For one, there are content changes as well - just like a typical DF update would bring and secondly, it is a damn good game well worth of it's price tag. There is a reason, why it created a whole gaming genre. If you should find out, DF is not quite yours, you'll still get some hours of entertainment out of it.

...well, what do you wanna do? Just like Minecraft (Which was inspired by DF), it is a quite sandboxy game with an hidden endgame challenge. A single playthrough (assuming, your fort does not perish) can take a hundred hours or more.
If you are into story telling / RPG, you are going to have a blast with this. Check out Kruggsmash on Youtube to get an idea. Each entity in DF has individual thoughts, desires, dis/likes, memories, relationships, (...). They argue, they create what they care about (writings, engravings, statues) and much more. All depending on the history and life experiences of that dwarf. It's a deep rabbit hole, if you care to explore. 
And if you like puzzles, you'll find yourself spending a lot of time planning the perfect solution for your fortress. Safety, efficiency, beauty, and more.


Bugs?
Since steam, a few. Take care when digging stairs bottom up. This will be fixed for sure. This is Toadys life work. He is going to work on DF until he physically can't anymore. What a legend!
Technically DF is still in alpha...I played DF when it was still a 2D flat Mountain Wall, when THE FLOOD was a thing and THE ELEPHANTS kept me awake at night. It grew like a kid.

In the world of video gaming, there is no doubt that a distinct titan stands out above all others: Skyrim.

The undeniable success of the Elder Scrolls series and Skyrim, in particular, is well-deserved. The expansive world, intricate quests and engaging characters have kept players coming back for more. Yet when comparing it to Dwarf Fortress with its Adventure Mode, there is no contest: Adventure Mode provides a gaming experience that surpasses even what Skyrim has to offer.

Dwarf Fortress -Adventure Mode- is an open-world sandbox game that offers players a unique experience every time. The randomly generated world and procedurally generated events create an ever-changing landscape for the player to explore. With its deep character creation system, vast customization options, expansive crafting system and detailed combat mechanics, Dwarf Fortress gives players a level of control and freedom that Skyrim can only dream of providing.

The replayability of this title is unparalleled. Every time you start up a new adventure, you never know what lies ahead. Whether it's infiltrating enemy camps or exploring labyrinthine dungeons, no two playthroughs are ever the same. This makes each session as exciting as the last one—you're constantly discovering new secrets and uncovering fresh challenges.

The level of detail that goes into every aspect of the game—from its worldgen to its mechanics—makes it one of the most immersive titles out there. You can lose hours just exploring the worlds you create, marveling at its intricacy and taking part in dynamic battles. Even after completing all your objectives, you'll still have plenty to do in this seemingly never-ending game.

In conclusion, while Skyrim is an amazing game with its own merits, the incredible and immense Dwarf Fortress -Adventure Mode- surpasses it in almost every aspect. Not only does the game offer players an incredibly detailed and immersive experience, but its procedurally generated content ensures that no two playthroughs are ever the same. This replayability makes this title one of the most engaging and satisfying video games out there today. Whether you’re a long-time fan or just getting your feet wet in the world of gaming, Dwarf Fortress -Adventure Mode- is sure to provide hours upon hours of fun. In short, if you're looking for a truly unique gaming experience then Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode is definitely worth the wait.",1677787930,1677787930,True,2,2,0.492524504661560059,0,True,False,False

Obviously most of them are UI-related, but some much needed improvements are that stockpiles are much easier to create/modify, vanilla now has a pseudo-Dwarf Therapist, and there are tooltips to help get new players off the ground. Not to mention support for WASD+Mouse, or hell, even Mouse alone.

The philosophy has sadly shifted away from hotkeys and towards point-and-click, which makes it much more accessible to a wider audience but makes it much more cumbersome to veterans of the game. Why they had to just up and abandon hotkeys for most things, I'll never know. The only keys you'd need to avoid for more casual players are W,A,S,D. As it stands my right hand can't decide if it wants to be on they keyboard or on the mouse, because some hotkeys are just flat out missing.

Still, it's gorgeous by comparison no matter what tile-set you used to use, and the music/ambiance is incredible.

This game is basically like herding cats as a full time job with your hands put on backwards. You can do a lot of interesting things, but you'll spend countless hours on trying to accomplish simple tasks, like getting dwarfs to equip armor; like they will literally sleep on top of armor without equipping it. Also, things are extremely complicated, which is good and bad. You'll need to watch some guides to even understand half of the things required to run a fort, and then you'll need to learn a ton of tricks to do the things you want. The upside is you'll be able to keep exploring the incredible depth of the game for a very long time. 
The one real issue is the crashing. It not super frequent, but you can lose hours of monotonous work every time it happens. Also you may run into into the issue I'm at now where you get a continuous crash at a certain point that ends your run. I think these issues will get better over time, but currently this is a major problem. Combined with a lot of really terrible UI design (like not being able to sort dwarfs in most menus) the game becomes equals parts love and hate. 
Overall I would say it is very interesting, and sometimes fun. There's a massive laundry list of things I would like changed, but I put in over 300 hours in like a month so you'll get your moneys worth at the very least.

Twice, some bird-people I modded in tried to steal artifacts from me, triggering massive bar fights, one of which actually killed a woodcutter. The fortress was plagued by my incompetent rail-laying skills, two giant attacks, and a werecamel, all of which it survived. (Though we continued to find werecamel blood in the fortress for years after repelling it.) After some exploratory mining through the magma sea (which tragically fried two of my dwarves), I discovered a vein of extremely valuable metal, but also immediately lost my fortress to a clown invasion. RIP, Dutyroads.

I chose to prepare carefully for my new fortress, Bookhalls, which I am roleplaying as a university focused on knowledge and the arts. As I prepared my expedition party, I felt genuine affection for my little dorfs. One of them would be a miner and stoneworker, one would be a farmer, and a few would be scholars and administrators.

Within the first few months I accidentally flooded part of the fortress when a pond melted because I forgot water can flow diagonally. Not a huge disaster but it was funny.

Dwarf Fortress isn't just a colony sim, it's a fantasy world generator, complete with lore, history, logical chains of events, and dramatic payoff. No other singleplayer game even comes close to achieving what these two guys have built over 20 years, [i]and they're not even done.[/i] They're working on updating the Steam version to re-add the mode where you can play as a single adventurer within your world. They want to add generated magic systems and world lore tied into procedurally-generated creation myths. Basically the only way to beat the stories Dwarf Fortress creates is to take part in a well-run TTRPG campaign with a collaborative DM.

Though I am very familiar with many colony simulators, I found the lack of documentation and tool-tips had to be rectified by going into the forums and discussions.
I also had to watch alot of video's on you-tube to understand how to play it.
I haven't really encountered any bugs.
Many of the systems are clunky and the very basic visuals make it difficult at times to see what is going on.
Furthermore, I found the lack of automation problematic, something rectified to some extent by DFHack which I find essential now for this purpose.
The military side is important but the dwarves are difficult to control. This is one of the most frustrating elements. I'm not sure I've even managed to get archer dwarves working. Some real-time in-battle formation and stance  commands would be very helpful.
In the caverns I often find it hard to tell when there is open space next to my dwarves without hovering my mouse over the space.
I also find it difficult to know what I need to do to satisfy some of the wants of my nobles.

Nevertheless, I recommend this game highly.
Also I suspect there is much, much more depth to this game, and I've only just scratched the surface.
The replayability is enormous.

You get what you put in as far as story telling goes.

Mods help a lot with balance issues and quality of life and are why I'm now 100% sold on the steam version.  New players won't need all the mods, just play for a while and after some time you will start noticing things like all animals give 1 piece of leather regardless of their size-- then you can start browsing for mods for the issues that bother you the most.

Read the negative reviews, because they are mostly fair.  If bad UI and frustrating unimplemented systems and bugs are deal breakers for you then you should steer clear.  The UI is ""completely new"" but its bad, so many extra clicks and lacking so much polish we expect from modern games.

The complexity of the game objects, from world building, history, character anatomy, geology is astonishing. And the opportunity to build some crazy megaprojects is great. Want to build a dam in the river? That's easy. A nice little waterfall to shower your dwarves (without flooding the fortress, ideally)? Possible. Want to drain the magma sea? Also possible. Want to pour the magma into the nearby ocean to create an obsidian tower from bottom of the sea to the sky, just to try if you can farm in the siliceous ooze and pelagic clay? (spoiler: you apparently can't. At least, you can't set up a treefarm in there. At least some versions back that was so.)

And then, while the project is in progress, your expedition leader suddenly declares himself king of your civilization and you better get moving to build him some nice rooms. Or the elves appear and get all snobby about how you're not supposed to fell any more trees. 

Some of the greatest moments recently: I was searching for the flux stone (needed to make steel), and used actual geological facts to locate it. It was hiding between the gabbro and the gneiss, as a metamorphic layer should. Sneaky marble was only present in the southwest of my map though.

When some migrant with a really horrible, totally conflicted personality (""hates natures, but admires it, so he is conflicted"", ""hates people but likes to have friends"", ""loves to shout when angry"", ""is a quarreler"") dwarf, name was Fikod, arrived, I decided to send him out on a suicide mission. ""Go and raid that village with 80 elves, Fikod!"", I told him. Thinking he would die. Instead, he returned with a hemp sock that he had stolen. I sent him out some more, and he brought back more and more goods (up to a giant cougar, omg.), without ever being seen. I tried to make him happy at that point, but he really was a hopeless case with that personality.

I was willing to turn a blind eye on the game's glaring faults, but now that the guys racked up millions selling their seriously impaired baby as the 8th wonder of the computing world, I see no reason to remain so lenient.

[h1]Quality insurance[/h1]

This version is certainly more pleasant to look at and listen to, but sure enough the bugs are still there, and since some date back from day one, it's safe to assume they will never be fixed. 
Apparently Lord Toady is more focussed on serving us another helping of [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_(comics)#The_Gaffophone]gaffophone[/url] generators.
If you're buying that spiel about that magical overhaul happening between 2040 and 2050, good for you. I don't.

The new guy apparently wouldn't recognize a friendly user interface if it bit him in the <beep> either. I bet most if not all the enthusiastic reviews didn't progress very far into the game. But plenty other people have already voiced the same concerns, so I'll skip that bit.

[h1]Emergent behaviours[/h1]

Now for the much touted ""emergent"" thingies, be them narratives or behaviours, I simply can't see what people find so exciting about this game. Let's take an example:

So we have this deliriously complex generic system for modelling bodies, complete with eyelids, circulatory and nervous systems, bones including a ribcage with true and false ribs, tendons and cartilages and a nearly complete set of internal organs (except the politically incorrect ones. Too bad, I bet a emerging p<beep>y grabbing story would have made headlines). In all, my guess would be there are well over 200 bits and pieces for a mere dwarf. I shudder to think of the giant cave spider model.

I'm willing to believe an intricate simulation taking gazillions of parameters into account runs in the background, but the main logic is barely on par with a circa 1980 Apple ][ game: make a beeline to the nearest opponent and pelt it with semi-random attacks on semi-random body parts until it or I end up clinically dead.
Only the loss of some vital organ or a complete drainage of blood will end the ordeal. As it turns out, it's the brain that gives first, 95% of the time. Very rarely a poor Goblin will bleed to death before the dwarves manage to behead it or destroy its brain, but that's about it.

The outcome boils down to an embarrassing travesty of Monty Python's black knight scene, stuck on repeat.
That is all that ""emerges"" from a broken and simplistic game logic.
It's rather sad to think of the time spent defining hundreds of creatures, each with its hundreds of bits and pieces, for such a paltry result.

[h1]Now for the stories...[/h1]

There are a few ""surprises"", but all feel very scripted to me: a few unwelcome guests, taverns and their drunken brawls, the trademark fey moods and ghosts...
It's arguably fun to deal with these events, but your ""emerging story"" will most likely fall within the usual 2 or 3 possible outcomes (which I won't spoil, for those who haven't read the corresponding wiki pages yet).

About taverns, I never managed to trigger any kind of ""epic"" brawl in them, even after letting fish rot under the noses of the infuriatingly blissful midgets (who were already wading in puddles of vomit, but apparently having dwarves drop their cups on the floor and puke after quaffing their barley wine is an emergent behaviour).
All I saw was 45 midgets suddenly rushing out of the room (apparently to snitch on the offender) and some cryptic event reports. I then had to go to the justice tab to sentence the culprit for each individual assault on dwarves, elves and dogs. The poor sod was eventually strangled to death by the cop that was supposed to arrest him. Cringey.
Mmm... Maybe I should reload my last save and add some more rotten fish, so that enough of the little blighters lose their marbles to finally trigger a jolly good bit of fun?

Now seriously folks, no doubt the moods of each dwarf are intricately modelled but, just as with the combat system, the logic that moves them is woefully inadequate, and the game far too buggy, unfinished and unbalanced to make any meaningful use of it.

Many stories seem to unfold in the head of, shall we say, overenthusiastic fans, including some that are extremely unlikely to happen, or downright impossible in the actual game. Since ""mastering"" this ""best software ever"" has become a mandatory token of coolness, I suppose the temptation of embellishing the gaming experience is hard to resist.

The rest of the ""noteworthy events"" are mostly the consequences of an inept AI that has the dwarves doing the most stupid things, like working for months in a room full of rotting fish until they throw a tantrum and die, or standing right in the middle of a track, waiting to get clobbered by the next passing mine cart.

The review that racked up an ungodly amount of likes, though genuinely well written, is a perfect example. Squashing a toddler is a common occurrence known as ""atom smashing"". It's more of an annoyance than anything, in my opinion, but it makes for great stories as long as you don't try to actually play the game.

And then there are the consequences of various bugs worth posting yet another ""emerging story"", of the ""a branch fell off a tree and killed my lumberjack"" kind. But if you're playing for the first time and bought the spiel about emergent thingies, I suppose it must look like magic.

[h1]Losing might be fun, but as for playing...[/h1]

Some diehard gamers are either using the game as a base for role playing sessions, or a kind of nerdy fake physics sandbox. The game does OK in both cases, but that's not for everyone, to say the least.
For those simply seeking the thrill of building a mighty fortress, the cardinal flaw of DF is its triviality.
Not only is the combat hard to follow, verbose, bland and broken, but most if not all of the steps needed to build a working base are absolute no-brainers. Build a couple workshops of every kind, put your psychopathic killers in training as soon as you can spare a couple of dwarves, give them armours in the best metal you can mine on the map, build one of the many corridors of death available in countless tutorials, and Bob will be your uncle. Until the death by one-digit FPS comes to claim your little heaven of dwarven peace.
I only rarely felt a sense of achievement playing the game, because it essentially boils down to reading the friggin manual, namely the wiki and the description of some DFHack commands, and making sure to give the bugs a wide berth.

Btw., this ""losing is fun"" motto is the lamest excuse ever for dismissing any and all of the issues that mar the gaming experience.
Sorry, fanboys and fangirls, not everyone likes to waste dozens of hours of gameplay on a badly balanced random monster, a mere bug or sloppy optimization (and inability to produce a multitasking version) that makes the FPS drop to 1 digit figures.
I can see how some people might find that enjoyable, but to me that kind of gameplay rather feels like a s<beep>y day at work.

[h1]Conclusion (sort of)[/h1]

DF is a fun toy for terminal nerds willing to put up with all the bugs, cringy mechanics and atrocious UI in exchange for a playground sporting flavour text generators and bonkers physics simulation. But selling it as a nice alternative to Rimworld, a genius piece of poetic art or a procedural generator of a reboot of the Lord of the Rings is nothing short of a scam.

On the other hand, stupid rich people appear to have willingly spent millions to secure the virtual ownership of some godawful computer-generated monkey mugs. So it seems there's nothing a good hype can't sell.
To be fair, while the idiot monkeys really cost a packet, the idiot dwarves, though grossly overpriced, remain affordable.

The graphics, while far better than its ASCII counterpart, is still somewhat of an eye sore as things pop around between 'cells' on the map. The textures themselves are fine, but the movement makes it awful in my opinion. On top of this the dwarves don't really stand out from their environment as in similar games where they have names and so on close to them. 

On the other hand! The game is incredibly complex and has a huge assortment of features. You could spend thousands of hours in this game if you can look past its initial issues.  The problem is just everything else. 

If you can deal with poorly designed menus and eye-sore of a graphics system then by all means, you should get this game. It doesn't get much more complex nor deeper than this.

Yes it looks strange, but it plays out more like city builder/colony simulator.
It's nowhere close or similar to Rimworld as in Rimworld you can see everything more precise & in slower pace, but whatsover on Global scale Dwarf Fortress has very interesting simulation level, which is at best similar to Songs Of Syx.

Whatsover in comparison with any kind of other games I must say Dwarf Fortress has the most uniq gameplay as it contains whole enless void of content.

The soundtrack is also a massive draw for me. It was actually part of the reason I picked up the steam release in the first place. I do think the price is a little steep at $30 but honestly I shouldn't be griping about it since A: you can still download the ASCII version for free, and B: this game is a passion project and Tarn and Zach deserve the praise & the profit. Thank you both. :D

I have a couple of real complaints, but nothing too major. It mostly boils down to the re-imagined control scheme, and to someone used to the old version of DF before the steam release it's a little bit annoying to get used to. All of the muscle memory I had before is not useful anymore, since everything has changed places. Maybe a ""Old controls"" button would be a good addition.

Edit to elaborate... first impressions consisted of a growing joy of discovery laced with frustration at the difficulty and the sheer pig headedness of my little dwarven minions.

At some point though, the penny drops. It's not just an unusually detailed colony simulator, it's a world simulator. I let go of the urge to manage the individual dwarves and just govern the site. I start trying to keep the inventories properly stocked and the craft and construction workloads balanced so the dwarves have some time to themselves. I let most of the rest unfold on its own.

Suddenly everything starts to make SENSE. Almost every decision acquires long term consequence: optimizations expose vulnerabilities, redundancies create inefficiencies, all of which become apparent under various stressors the world keeps throwing at you. 

The amazing thing is given time to absorb how the world works, at least 95% of it feels organic, neither random or scripted. Not only is everything happening for a reason there are ways I can direct the consequences or hedge my bets, even if I spot them only in hindsight.

There are no doubt a large number of tasks that can become tedious with the available interface but the more I have played, the more I have realized this was the usual indicator I had failed to properly organise my inventories or had neglected to build the correct mechanical devices. It's probably one of the biggest gripes I have seen but the the fact that these pre industrial barely literate dwarf societies have poor data management is one of the most coherent features of the game. There are ways to do almost everything better, but they do not involve data links, sorted lists or chained event triggers, at least not at the user interface.

This game will not be for everyone. If you are a compulsive min/maxer it will either heal you or end you. But if you are the sort that enjoys emergent game play in any way, you may not play another game for months or years. This is a fantasy world simulator that feels incredibly realistic.

Once you mine a staircase you can't just expand it you have to start a new one next to it. This becomes especially annoying once you hit the aquifer and the mining action gets cancelled at every level.  I understand the difference between mined and built staircases but still cannot get a clean continuous staircase in my base. When you try and remove stairs things get even worse, with only the ""up"" or ""down"" parts getting removed cutting off access to entire levels which then have to be fixed with yet another staircase or ramps. I can't understand the up/down stair mechanic either. I don't have separate stairs for going up or down in my house and I don't think many people do. Stairs should simply connect two levels, built in the direction you select when scrolling with the mouse wheel. Plenty of other games handle this concept just fine. Ultimately my base just gets littered with failed staircases and that alone is enough to make me shelve this game for now.

Furthermore when building down through an aquifer you need to wall off an area around the stairs to prevent water intrusion as you dig down each level. If you do a 3x3 area with the staircase in the middle it's like the dwarfs pick a different way to build the walls every level and it's almost never the way you would expect it to be.

There may be some trick to this im not understanding but building stairs in a game like this should not be difficult.

This release has done exactly what I hoped it would, and made the game so much more accessible to novice players.  Now I can clearly see what's going on in the world around me, and easily wrap my head around the Z-levels, and building in 3 dimensions.  

My first fort has gone well so far.  It's in a cushy spot, near a brook, in a fairly friendly world.  I've been learning the individual systems, how to craft armor and weapons, how to make sure my dorfs are not just surviving, but thriving!  Let's be real, they mostly just survive, but  it's slowly getting better.  All in all, it had been a pretty unremarkable adventure, steady solid progress, expanding networks of workshops and supply cache's.

Then the child disappeared.  For a week they scoured the little fort searching for the missing child.  Only a community of 25, every child represents a tremendous stake in the future of the fort.  They had always been safe, there had been a few troll attacks, but the militia spotted them early, and always won out easily.  

The sheriff interviewed residents of the fort, searching for a lead, but none materialized and the community was forced to admit that the missing child may constitute a mystery for which no answer would ever come.

Breaking the doldrums that had settled over the fort, a wild eyed metal worker emerged from his workshop, having only now been released from the grip of the creative frenzy that had been driving him.  For weeks he had been in his workshop, ignoring all requests, feverishly crafting.  

He holds aloft his masterwork for all of the fort to see.  A legendary dwarven bone shield, impeccably crafted and engraved named....durximsonsi, or something equally dorfy.  A dwarven. bone. shield.

He immediately donated his creation to the fort and went back to his normal routine, hauling, mining, smoothing.  Very quickly after, the body of the missing child was found in his workshop, the Sheriff had the worlds quickest interrogation, and the craftsdorf admitted to everything.  He was convicted of his crime and beaten near to death.

Seriously the game is glorious. Infinite ways to play, things to try and do.
Learning curve is fairly okay (its been ages since ive played the original v:), but shouldnt prove much trouble if you are familiar with games like RimWhorl™ and the like. 

Aside from the games content from which I wont spoil much for now, lets focus on basics like:

Graphics - If you played classic df the new Tileset may be scary for you to look at. But give it a chance, it is of ≡exceptional quality≡ and imo really brings the game alive. There are many beautiful ...Sprites i guess... and add a lot of immersion.
If you are new to DF, you may think the game looks clunky or ""primitive"" even.... but be told that the graphics in this game is really just the surface of the Mountain Top you are getting yourself into.

Music (and sound/atmosphere in general) - Holy hecc, the tune is really up to date. If you enjoy fantasy kinda Guitar strumming, you are in for an earwig. One im getting to enjoy a lot lately as my smooth brain often begins recreating the games many beautiful songs. The other cool part about sound in the game are the Atmospheric sounds of your Castle. A Tavern will sound like a Tavern with drinks being served, glasses and mugs being raised together. Your guildhalls and manufacturing spaces will let you know that your dwarfs work dilligently as you can hear hammers strike metal into shape, stone and wood as well. 

An aspect that really adds to the immersion in a great way.


Gameplay - Diggy Diggy Hole, build your pretty mountain home and endure all the hardships the game throws at you. Endure all the hardships you are responsible for because you forgot something or did something wrong. Yes, you should really build a Still before the first Autumn. :)
Endure all the hardships you created yourself because you are fucking able to in this game. Yes I want the ""OfFiCe"" of my ""eLeCtEd OfFiCiAl"" to be a 69x1 tile floor, why do you ask?

Just dont give up if you come to a point of the game being hard or something went wrong. Instead of restarting the game, try to improvise or take extreme measures to save your fortress or go down with your dwarfs. Its what makes this game fun.

[i]There is no internal end point, single goal, final Easter egg or ""You Win!"" announcement in Dwarf Fortress, therefore, eventually, almost every fortress will fall. The only ones that don't, tend to be very conservative and very boring—and what fun is that? [/i] - (DFWiki)

Tbh not sure what to write anymore, guess im going back to play.

Dwarf Fortress cured my gaming addiction by making me addicted to Dwarf Fortress only.

I am 45.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",1676445529,1676445529,True,5,1,0.485528051853179932,0,True,False,False

The game itself is interesting, the self generating story by each dwarf and each civilisation is a great way to watch a fortress live and die. You will see a goat kicking a forgotten beast to death, drunkening in tavern leading to a brawl, facing off literal hell and win, single legendary dwarf hold off an entire siege or conquer your wold by exterminating every single non dwarven civilisation. This is all great. 
You can do tons of things in game, play safe and build a fortress, play risky and generate stories. 

However, this is assuming that you CAN play the game. Most of my fortress are abandoned not by enemies or internal struggles, but by limitation of the shotty coding. This is called FPS death where your ingame frame rate drop to 0/1 and you become unable to play at all. To me this happens 10 years in game time. 

This drastically limit how you can play the game. Every decision you make will need to consider ""will this help FPS?"". When you dig a tavern, ""will the path to tavern be too crowded to cause more lag"". When you place a room, ""will the travelling to the room cause more lag"". When you make a squad of military, ""will the production of hundreds of arrows decrease FPS"". When you breed animals, ""Will the behaviour and number of animals cause FPS death"". When you go to war, ""will the invasion forces cause FPS death""....

With such a limitation, you wont see many things you wanted. You cant build a generational fort and see dwarves get married, have kids, watching kid grow up. Because your FPS will stop. You cant breach into hell or conquer the world because entity's pathing crash your game.

The world generation and simulation are pretty good, the graphics are acceptable (despite some issues with mixed perspectives that can make it quite hard to distinguish different levels), and the music is mostly excellent.

However, performance is irregular at best (and quite bad most of the time) and the UI is atrocious. It's actually worse than the UI in the free (""ASCII""-like) version in some cases (ex., when building stairs between levels). Common operations that should be doable with a single mouse click take 5 or 6 (and then close all the menus and sub-menus, so if you want to place a different item of the same category you need to go through the whole menu tree again). Decorative icons and buttons are often indistinguishable (so you keep trying to click things that don't do anything), and to top it off the game seems to be using some weird custom code to detect mouse clicks that fails to detect about 20% of them, instead of just processing mouse click events supplied by the operating system like every other game made in the last 30 years.

On top of all these problems, they refuse to give you a refund if you've tried the game for more than 2 hours (and just picking world generation parameters and then generating the map can easily take half an hour or more).

So my advice would be: wait at least a couple of months and hope there's a complete UI overhaul (not just UI design, but also the way it detects mouse clicks and key presses), or have your stopwatch ready and make sure you don't go a single second over 2 hours before returning it, or you'll be stuck with a game that looks alright and promises a lot, but currently plays like a pre-release from 1984.

If it had a sane return period I would proably have given it a thumbs up (i.e., you should at least try it), but with this kind of (non) return policy, I can't really recommend it.

I wouldn't even pay $10 for it. The game has been in development for over 20 years, but the bugs become intolerable in the Steam version.

DF always had a massive case of 'Eve Online' syndrome, that it was much more fun to read about than it was to play. Unfortunately, this is still the case even when it got an actual UI that a human can comprehend without making this game one's second job. 

The problem is, there are a lot of things to do but I don't have an idea of what I actually want to do. I don't mind there is not a lot of handholding about how to do something. I can figure out where to build something I need but I have no idea what I actually should do to set meaningful goals. To my taste, the game is too open ended.

I can dig for things, craft things, train dwarves, build armies, build farms, harvest bushes, chop trees, smelt metals, collect eggs and honey, flood my dungeon and about trillion of other things but I don't see why I would do any of that. If I compare the game to something like Prison Architect or Space Engineers, it's easy - I see what I can do, collect resources for the next thing I need and get some progression but in DF this process seems very cryptic. I know it's there somewhere.

I have a great appreciation for this game as a passion project that exists but I just never could get into it. It seems like I will go back to reading fun stories about entertaining and absurd things that happen in the game.

I will try to revisit some time in the future, maybe there will be a campaign I could play.

My only current complaints being (1) missing civilian alert (2) need original music (3) need 3rd party tileset (CLA especially)
I think the original music & ascii interface has some distinct stuff to tell the player. Current cartoonistic tileset and revamped happy music is probably more suitable for general public, but I think it's not as better as the primitive guitar and ascii at telling the deeper story. My english sucks so yeah, more of a rant to myself

I tried it a handful of times but I was raised in the Sims era, not the Dos era, so I needed some basic graphics to truly enjoy it. You could've always just used Lazy Newb Pack, but the premium edition is far and away a better graphic experience than the mods provided. Plus its supporting devs who care. It has its bugs and quirks but no game can match DF's level of complexity. If you get good at this game, you'll be fighting it for fps at the endstages looking for more optimal ways to organize your dwarves and layout. When you're just starting out, you're trying to figure out why you're suddenly out of plump helmets and your dwarves are all angry. What is this unmet need prayer? Why does this dwarf worship three deities that no other dwarf has heard of? Why do waves of immigrants keep coming? I can't clothe or feed this many they are all starving to death and even worse, the dwarves are sobering up. The dwarven child had a tantrum and beat your best gem cutter to death? Tough, the justice system doesn't deal with minors. Figure out a suitable punishment and enact it yourself, as the God you are. A fickle one with limited control over the world but blessed with the foresight your dwarves will lack. 

Dwarf Fortress is a good, complex game that isn't for everyone but it might be for you.

I built a decent pub, followed by a temple a couple floors down. Engraved floors and everything. I started laying some wooden flooring in the pub to make it look more attractive. That's when I noticed some of my dwarves had started praying in the temple. Oddly enough a couple of them were thirsty. I had plenty of ale though, so I figured ""they'll get something to drink when they want to"".

Time goes by and mining and fortress activities on the lower floors grinds to a halt. The dwarves down in the temple refuse to work - they simply stand around, day in and day, praying. There is still plenty of beer for their daily needs, but instead of caring for their needs they pray constantly. Finally, one of them dies. And that's when I realized the temple dwarves were praying for deliverance - I had accidentally laid floor over the stairs, trapping the dwarves in the temple!
