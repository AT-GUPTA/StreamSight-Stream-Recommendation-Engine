This game can guide you into that imagination realm so deep and create an awesome experience into the cultivation lore. Similiar to how books can give better experience than real world movies. 
(A picture tells a thousand words but in some cases a few words can't even be put into motion pictures lol, an example I ever read in a book is : the writing is telling that a person has a watermelon shaped face along with other characteristic features, that kind of writing is impossible to put into motion pictures lol, even if it can be substituted with other method but that's not the point )

A must buy for those who love: 
- Cultivation theme
- Idle game genre

The fan translation is enough to understand a bit of the story and user interface. The only drawback is always the space for letters. Chinese writing is one letter for almost anything, be it tiger (5letters), lion (4letters), dog (3letters), you (3letters), me (2letters), anything (8letters), So any word translated will always exceed the space given by the UI, even on top of each other esp for things like : Strength : 8 , the word strength and the letter 8 can be on top of each other and really really hard to read.",1675620998,1682558517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You cultivate your qi, craft gear, tame beasts, upgrade buildings, make and evolve your own sect to conquer land and so on. Generally theres lots of things to do and i dont feel too rushed or inefficient like with some idles. 

The life span thing that someone mentioned as a complaint is false since it becomes basically irrelevant after youve played the game for half a day (you need to leave it open and unnatended for literal days/weeks to actually be forced to reincarnate cause of life span and after youve progressed more it becomes months).
