Honestly, save for a few missions, I loved this game. At least for the first 2/3 of the game, anyway. 

The campaign's storytelling and momentum completely broke down pretty much immediately in the last 1/3 or so, destroying everything it built up to throughout the rest of the game. I won't spoil the plot points, but the final mission especially just felt rushed and tedious, with the fights pretty much almost entirely influenced by whether or not the game wants you to hit your opponents. 

I can't really speak for the multiplayer as I didn't try it. The general gameplay feels good, so if you don't care about the campaign, it couldn't hurt to try, I suppose.

But if story IS what you're looking for, just play Project Wingman, if you haven't already.

Graphics are gorgeous, and the new mechanics like PSM and improved enemy AI is easy to learn for newcomers in the series, and difficult to master for veteran pilots.

I think it is because I was stuck on one mission and had to hear the stupid lines repeatedly. I still think it has some *meh* missions and the story is pretty dull by AC standards, there is very little attachment to any of the characters. Count, for example is just boring and his AI basically doing nothing but moaning all the time is just urgh. But yeah, I gave it another chance and like it a lot more now. The MP has a high skill-ceiling but is pretty cool too. 7.5/10

Coming close to finishing the game now and it is a slog. As a fan of the series I was expecting this to be a return to form after the mediocre AC AH, which without emulation has been our only alternative to Project Wingman or sim games. Graphics-wise, great. Music-wise, god-tier. Gameplay-wise, mixed-bag. Some missions are fine, nothing special, just fine, others have lousy instant-fail conditions. Great controls, superb explosions, the aforementioned soundtrack etc.. BUT, the teammates just NEVER STOP TALKING. Literally every second some lame, nonsensical quip about sandwiches comes through the radio, or some bloke starts telling you a tale about a mysterious pilot who made his enemies feel like antelopes or something. It's completely immersion breaking and both poorly written and not amusing.  IT NEVER STOPS.

If your new and downloaded, i recommend going to get the F-15C and the F-22 Raptor ASAP. Those 2 aircraft are broken. But its up to you, i don't control your decisions.

An arcade air combat game. Don't expect realism or a good story (because games aren't known for that).
However, the gameplay is good, mainly with well varied levels. You'll find each level has its own interesting fun gimmick. Nimble drones, giant plane, base attacks, and windy canyons.

Planes escalate in speed and power, and have a selection of special weapons to mount on them which include a giant cruise missile, railguns, lasers, firing multiple missiles at once, or a faster and more maneuverable missile. Some planes are special and allow you to do interesting maneuvers which can give you an edge in a multiplayer dogfight.

Other things like sound and graphics? They make the game pretty, and it also runs well too. I have a medium-end PC and I can maintain smooth frames consistently.

The missions have a lot of variety in theme and mechanics and tie into the story well. The controls are tight. A lot of customization with plane parts and even skins for single player at a certain point. I would even recommend the season pass, as the missions were fun and had a nice side story to them. The story is nice and cheesy the way it should be.

I bought this game a few months ago and just now decided to write a review for it. I enjoyed it a lot when i was playing it, i dropped it after an hour of trying to get my HOTAS to work, but after many hours of research i finally got it to work with my kit (Thrustmaster TWCS throttle and VKB Gladiator Space EVO stick - to get most hotas' to work you have to map each button individually, which was very annoying) At first i was dissapointed in the gameplay even with the HOTAS, as it didn't really feel nice in the hands for a fighter simulator. I did end up enjoying the game the more i played though. So there's that. 

Now onto the problems that i personally didn't like with the game, and then ill do the things that i liked and loved in the game (respectively) 
1. Poor HOTAS support 
(it takes a long time to configure a HOTAS in this game, as well as it being very jank controls)
2. Weirdly stiff handling or absurdly smooth handling 
(on certain planes i found myself either making 90 degree turns with the high G turn mechanic or barely 30 in the same time with and without the high G turn) [Before you say ""oh you just had beginner/expert  flight settings on"" i changed them to be expert at the very beginning and kept them static throughout, i don't know why it happened, but it does.]
3. High G turns 
(the camera makes a weird movement that takes me out of the game in third person, the high G turns are a fun concept and fairly well executed, it just makes it feel weird in my hands when i can turn 60 degrees in an F-14 Tomcat while also going 800 (whatever the speed is measured in))
4. really awkward turning mechanics 
(when i was flying between obstacles sometimes the high G turns would turn a bit too much [as stated in my 'weirdly stiff or absurdly smooth handling' segment, sometimes i needed to make an 80 degree turn between two close walls and i either  turned too sharply or too little and crashed)
5. Crashing 
(when i hit a wall or the floor it would bump me about 10-20 feet above where i made contact, this, of course, made tight areas really a pain to get through. I did manage after awhile, but it annoyed me enough to write this. - Also sometimes it was an insta-crash or i get three strikes before i crashed, i dont exactly know why, i assume it was because of health and airspeed.)
6. Lack of variety in weapons 
(you might be confused if you have played the game, but i dont like how each plane only had one special weapon - also 200 standard rockets is way more than anyone would ever need.)
7. missile lock range 
(most modern missiles can lock on to an enemy from an average of 16 KM [farthest you can visually ID an aircraft is about 6KM and almost every single missile in the game is a Fox-2 - heat seeking missile - Fox-1 is a semi-active radar lock, Fox-3 is full radar lock], in the game, you need to be within 2km of the enemy - which is almost entirely too close for comfort IRL, as well as being basically within gun range.)
8. Mission briefing and being wrong
(The mission briefings are mostly correct, but sometimes the mission changes from air attacks to a heavy ground assault halfway through, when i sortie i equip the best weapons for that specific mission, but when i suddenly have to take out 20 ground targets with my standard missiles - because i equipped 4-way-multi-lock air-to-air missiles that i only use like 15 of because the mission changed, it can be quite aggravating.)
9. Per plane parts ( i dont like how it doesnt get rid of your pre-selected parts to upgrade your planes for each mission, whenever i selected a better plane for a mission)
10. plane stats 
(i dont like how each plane has sliders instead of hard numbers for plane stats, its very hard for me to see which is better of two planes that have very similar bars. This game does a better job than others with this however, as each bar's value is more visually different compared to another plane. - even if each stat is not accurate in its job.)
11. low countermeasure count
(there is less than 10 flares in any aircraft - even though flare count in something like the F-16 has more than 20 at all times. While it is understandable within the game's story [with how even one flare costs $57 for things like the A-10, F-15, F-16, and F-22] they would skimp on prices, but in the late and early stage of the game it just doesn't make sense when you are flying several million dollar machines which also burn several hundred dollars worth of fuel every time they take off. [$500-$2000 per hour of flight for commercial planes, Fighters use more.])

Now onto the things i liked about this game,

1. Fairly engaging story 
(i liked the story that takes place in this game, its a little confusing at times and the cut scenes don't really affect missions/game play - all that talk and hypes about the 'best pilot' were squashed when i took them down within 2 minutes. It didn't really feel worthy of all the screen times IMO, also i was on max difficulty)
2. Take off and Landing 
(I really enjoyed taking off and landing between missions, especially when you needed to resupply for specific missions. I also really enjoyed how its optional to skip them if you so choose, but it was a little disappointing when the take offs or landings at the start or end of missions were skipped without warning, i would've loved to land and take off when i started or ended a mission instead of fading to black and a menu popping up.)
3. Variety in planes 
(I really liked the amount of variety in the planes you could pick from, - if the mission briefings were accurate i could've made the right purchase the first time lol - i do also like how each plane was--roughly--put in sequence)
4. Plane upgrades 
(i like how plane upgrades can drastically increase a plane's performance if utilized correctly)

There's so many things i can pull for any single problem or thing i liked about this game, but this is already a long ass review. So here's the TL;DR I like the game, just a lot of minor to major annoyances that can be avoided or conquered if approached properly",1706251498,1706251498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is really great. it's not a simulator, so don't expect it to be a dcs or something like it.
Gameplay - very fun combat, easy to learn hard to master. you can do all sorts of moves in this game and be the ace pliot we all want to be. 
Graphic - the graphic for sky, clouds and aircraft are really realistic and great. the ground part not so much but this is a air combat game so we don't care about ground. 
Music - the music of this game is fantastic, half of the osts are my cup of teas. 
Story - the story is really above the average, not fantastic but above average. 

the only thing with this game is short on the story and main campaign, and lack of replay potential. 
not worth at full prize, but as long there's sale, even a 10% off, is really worth it.

The game is both nice, and frustrating at the same time. Planes go whoosh, guns go brr and MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE.
In my opinion, guns don't work well enough to be fun/effective, but you have MISSILES. (and plethora of mostly visual mods, some target guns)

No way to change controls or sensitivity in-game (.ini tweaking exists, but... it's a 2019 game ffs)
Graphics look great, but how you interface the game is uncomfortable.
I like the fact that there is a nice story, but I'm not motivated to listen to everything they say.

I would really appreciate an ""objectives"" list being displayed. Especially on easy mode.

There is multiplayer. It works. That already beats Rogue Squadron, which would be a fine space flight combat game, but it died, so I was looking for something that works. AC7 works. But you get placed in a lobby with players who have all the modules unlocked, completed the story and know how to fly (probably have some mods that work in MP to, but I won't say with certainty).

If you are looking for technical 1v1 dogfights mostly with noseguns, mostly separated from the chaotic battlefield... look somewhere else. If shooting secondary weapons - aka MISSILES - in a 3D arena while you fly in a jet, this is good choice for you.

My HOTAS was recognized without any extra setup, basic controls work, but cannot reassign them, and it's impossible to do fine adjustments quickly, thus making gunfight spray&pray at best. I tried flying with gamepad, and I think is's better that way. At least there is a simple INI tweak to set sensitivity and that made flying with gamepad buttery smooth.

Obviously this is personal, but I always have problems with aligning myself with the combination of sky, clouds, terrain, radar and UI. When I ignore radar and UI, it gets better. Sad. There is a triangle-arrow thing that is supposed to point towards the current target, but it's just unreliable. Radar position is 2D, lacking any height data (see how Elite:Dangerous solves 3D radar)

To end on a positive note: I think the digital/modern look of the menu and the tactical replay of the mission is cool!

I would love to have an option on Steam to write a review with a ""meh"" or 50-50 option instead of just thumbsup/thumbsdown, because this game would fit that place in my opinion.

SPOILER ALERT, MISSION LOCK

Missions (well, the maps) are cool, but little things f*ck them up. For example on mission 8, enemies keep popping off the radar, and you have to track them down. But radar doesn't show where an enemy was last spotted. Just imagine how difficult a ""last seen position"" would have been to develop! So at least you know where to look under the sandstorm.
You accidentally shoot the VIP you are supposed to protect, and this is scripted (as soon as you shoot an enemy on VIP's tail, I suppose)... this makes you a convicted criminal, and... they give you planes to fly... sure, the devs enriched the story by other convicts flying with you and mocking you that at least you're good with MISSILES.",1705852431,1705852431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]The newest Ace Combat entry adds a few excellent new changes to the series core gameplay, while taking away some. [/b]
The most notable new feature is the implementation of the volumetric clouds and air turbulence which affects aircraft handling, visibility and weapons use. It finally feels like there is an almost tangible medium between the player and the target, not just a digital vacuum. Also enjoyable is the system of performing post stall maneuvers so with some skill you can break up the circle dogfighting without the quirks of the previous instalment. One of these was softlocking due to running out of ammunition in missions where you cannot rearm ( looking at you Ace Combat 5). Thankfully the system of regenerating rockets seen in Assult Horizon makes a return so we do not have to worry about that anymore here.
Speaking of weaponry, it's especially gratifying to see a range of more futuristic weapons that are available for standard fighters. I am very glad that the parts system has returned, thanks to which you have a wide range of possibilities to tune your fighters according to your needs. 
As for the soundtrack, all Ace Combat games soundtracks are on the very same high-level, but here Keiki Kobayashi has surpassed himself and I guarantee you will find yourself humming the game's leitmotif after completing the campaign.

[b]Ok but what about the features that have been taken away? [/b]
The one that hurts the most is the lack of a co-op mode and various multiplayer modes from AC:Assault Horizon, or even better ... from AC:Infinity. 
The lack of any kind of non-linearity, whether in terms of branching campaign paths (as in ACX) or within maps (as in AC6). Some missions goals btw seem to be way to harsh in the context of excessive score caps required to be done in a very limited time. Something the new players will feel the most. 
I won't elaborate on the plot much but it's a well-written more up-to-date than ever techno-thriller delivered in a very epic way with memorable characters and engaging dialogues between them.

I originally got it for Xbox One, probably after it had been out for a year or two, and thought it a pretty fun game.  I've played a lot of fighter sim games, and they were either way too arcade-ish and unrealistic, or so realistic that they had a really steep learning curve.  This is that one game that has got the balance just right.  In a way, it's almost like Forza for fighter jets.  All the non-fictional aircraft are licensed by their manufacturers...which for an fighter jet nerd like me is a huge deal.  Other aircraft games pale in comparison.  This is my favourite of all time, all games, all systems.
Additionally, the plot is interesting enough to suck you in, and actually care how it all turns out.  The graphics are good, especially the aircraft models. The level design is creative and challenging. With my moderately powerful computer, I get good framerates at all times.

I have only two complaints, and I'm sorry, but I'm gonna be that nit-picky person.

First complaint is that 90% of the characters are white, and the only Black character I noticed (""Wiseman"") is given a rather parodic/stereotyped voice - like someone told the actor, ""Ok, try to sound Black."". And he gets killed off too. It bothered me - it just feels like a slight, an unnecessary microaggression.

The second is that you cannot select the gender or pronouns of your character ""Three Strikes"".  We never see the character or hear their voice, and the name is ambiguous, so there is absolutely no reason why it has to default to cisgendered male. I imagine that fixing this would incur and unacceptably high cost, requiring editing a lot of dialogue and re-recording a lot of voice acting. I get that.  All I would ask is that the next game in the series allow the player to select, ""he/his, she/her, and they/their"", and adjust pronouns and dialogue accordingly.  I'm sure it seems like a fussy complaint, but little stuff like this is how normalization happens, how people like me become ""normal"" and acceptable. Other games have done this perfectly (Baldur's Gate 3 comes to mind), and the standard should be that a game character can be trans or non-binary and that all the other supporting characters in the game treat them with the same respect that you would expect for any other human being, and nobody makes a big deal out of it.  I don't think it's a big ask.

These complaints aside, this is one of my favourite games of all time. I recommend it, with the caveat that players ought to join me in applying consistent, respectful pressure to the game designers so they remember to correct these two oversights on future releases.",1705565397,1705565397,True,0,0,0.459363967180252075,0,True,False,False

No joke, this game got me into the franchise and obsessed with it.
As a starting point for newcomers, I feel like this does the job quite nicely. And after buying some of the past games for my PlayStation 2, I can see that this game perfectly accommodates for veterans of the franchise as well with amazing set pieces and callbacks.
Wish I could have played the other games first before Ace Combat 7 to be able to lose my marbles on some of the things that does happen given the context. But I would have never gotten into those games without this one.
Sure, the story is serviceable at best and definitely pales in comparison to some of the prior games. But where this game it sells at is in its hype gameplay.
Out of all the Ace Combat games I have played so far, this is the one I like to replay the most. With some extraordinary set pieces and dialogue, and especially the extraordinary soundtrack that accompanies each unique mission.
I cannot sing this games praises enough, I would highly recommend getting this in your library. Especially when it comes to the steam sales where the price of the $60 game can go down to the low low price of $8 or $9.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. 

Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. 

However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",1705356311,1705356311,True,1,3,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

Story wise, I would feel much better if this was set in an alternate universe to current day than a completely different universe with a whole lotta different country names. The story is simply there as a filler in my opinion and is completely scripted. No user choice at all.

Gameplay wise, it's always a simple ""fly there, shoot enemies"" with a cutscene in between each mission trying its best to explain the story. However, what is not simple is the chaos in each dogfight. Every plane has their own ideas and fly about the place making planning absolutely go out the window, coupled with the sheer number of maps available makes no two sorties feel the same. 

Multiplayer is very enjoyable, although a player with some very advanced aircrafts can easily trash pretty much everyone. Multiplayer does give you a lot of money very quickly so it is a really good place to farm cash and have fun while you're at it.

TL;DR, it's very fun for both aviation enthusiasts and the average gamer (I do wish there's SplitScreen, if there is one, I haven't discovered it yet).",1705113717,1705113717,True,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

.
I got into the ACE series with AC6. I enjoyed the game so much that I ended up creating my entire gamer ID around it. The dialog was...cheesy, but the game play was so enjoyable. I loved everything else about it! So when I built a PC and decided to purchase AC7, I was pumped. Man am I disappointed! 
.
One of the best things about AC is the user interface, and in-game play. This newest version is rough. The dialog is absolutely atrocious. I enjoy campaigns. I enjoy the story that has been curated for me, but even now, I'm on level 12 and I still don't know which nation I am flying for. I still don't understand what happened in level 4 (assuming that'll be answered later). And I still don't get most of the character interactions.
.
The radio chatter is just bad. ""You'll go into solitary if you disobey!"" -Already *allegedly* killed the former president. Pretty sure you'd keep me from flying again if that happened. ""Shut up and do your job!"" - Literally just asking mission critical questions. ""That bird is worth more than your life. Don't scratch it!"" (Same mission) ""Escort our planes out of there. They are mission critical. You're expendable."" -So you don't mind if I crash the plane then???
.
The menu, sub menu, sub-sub-menu, is so detailed and flimsy it's hard to navigate at first. Not anything to really be concerned about, I'm just being picky.
.
The amount of upgrades available for purchase in the aircraft tree is a welcome site over AC6. You start out basic and move to more advanced planes and weapons. I like the availability of upgrading other aspects of flight as well. I do however HATE the aircraft tree itself and think its a far over complicated system. Also, the price for some items will take a huge amount of play time to unlock everything. (also just being picky with this portion. I get it's a game. Play to upgrade)
.
I love and hate the upgrade to ""realism"" that is brought in by the weather development. Lightning can strike, effecting performance. Air turbulence pushes you around. The radar becomes less accurate in heavy cloud cover. This is a nice touch on a game that is supposed to be ""realistic"".
.
Overall I would recommend the game to fans of any war sim, but bare in mind, this is not, nor will ever be a fully polished game. There are aspects that just piss you off throughout.",1705112686,1705112686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For what it is, Ace Combat 7 is a smooth air combat game, in the same vein as Call of Duty is for warfighter games.  AC7 is not a flying simulator -- that's Xplane or MS Flight Simulator.  Overall, the goal here is combat.  Blow the baddies out of the sky.  Rain terror over enemy strongholds.  Fly fast, roll, flip, evade, shoot.

The graphics are not a point of focus, though good for the time of release using Unreal Engine 4, the models of the jets look great in a sunsetting sky above the clouds (where you can't see the low-res terrain).  AC7 has multiplayer which is geared more for solo queuing, just as their non-coop campaign is.  You can technically queue in multiplayer with friends using the in-match 'Invite a friend' option, but you'd have an easier time with the Steam friends list and either 'Invite' each other or 'Join' each other's games using that interface.  Hopefully Ace Combat 8 will REALLY refine their multiplayer experience and community.

I bought this game on Steam's Winter Sale for a couple bucks, and also purchased some DLCs after putting some hours into it.  For the money, I think it's worth it.  I've had a fun time buying planes and parts and spec'ing out my machines.  However, even for the money I paid, I would've hoped for a better campaign.  I don't enjoy this solo campaign.  The creators tried to do too much all at once.  Objectives are frustrating in early-game because mission preparation is pointless. 
 You're not going to have the right equipment to do what you need to do and beginners have a tough time.  It's not until you put in many hours and buy more advanced items will the mission objectives finish like they're designed to.  The story line is not worth watching in the cutscenes.  The AI wingman radio banter is cringe and would've been better just not included at all.

There are around 20 missions in the singleplayer mode, most with different premises and gimmicks, which are quite creative, and I find myself coming back to AC7 again and again and again. Huge replay value. The plot, while extremely hard to believe, sucks you in and really engages you.

The soundtrack just keeps getting better and better. Every mission's soundtrack is great one way or another, some just standing inches above the rest.

Now, is this game worth full retail price? Maybe. However, it's much better if you get it on sale, such a good deal for a lower price.

Martin Scorsese erzählt mit seinen Lieblingsschauspielern Leonardo DiCaprio und Robert De Niro die erschütternde wahre Geschichte einer Mordserie auf dem Land der Osage in den 1920er-Jahren.
Zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts brachte das Erdöl der Osage Nation großen Reichtum und sie wurde über Nacht zu einem der wohlhabendsten Völker der Welt. Der Wohlstand dieser Ureinwohner Amerikas zog sofort weiße Eindringlinge an, die die Menschen manipulierten, erpressten und den Osage so viel Geld stahlen, wie sie konnten – bis sie sogar zum Mord übergingen. Vor diesem Hintergrund erzählt „Killers of the Flower Moon“ anhand der ungewöhnlichen Liebe zwischen Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) und Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone) eine epische Western-Krimisaga, in der wahre Liebe und ein unfassbarer Verrat aufeinandertreffen. Robert De Niro und Jesse Plemons sind in weiteren Rollen zu sehen. Regisseur von „Killers of the Flower Moon“ ist Oscar-Preisträger Martin Scorsese, der zusammen mit Eric Roth auch das Drehbuch schrieb. Der Film basiert auf dem gleichnamigen Bestseller von David Grann. Quelle: paramount.de",1704642919,1704642919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story 9/10 if your into complex geopolitics otherwise solid 6/10

it took me about 75% of the game to figure what was even happening as the 3 nations OSEA, USEA, and ERUSIA all have similar names but underneath the surface level confusion it was one of my favorite military stories every especially the plot of mission 16.

The Gameplay 10/10 

There are so many badass moments in this game. Very high replay value, too. Needs wingmen controls so they aren’t completely useless. Missile spam could be dialed back a bit.

the dog-fighting is insane, when the carrier bird comes in and drops 80 enemies and there's missiles coming from every direction is peak gaming, the main story had enough variety throughout each mission that they were all unique.
    
Presentation (Visuals and Audio) - 444/10

This is a solid 10/10. The music is great, fuck you if you say otherwise. Would be nice if PC could get an even better graphics for those with beefier PCs, but the current one we have is fantastic. Solid 10/10

Multiplayer 2/10
 
Where the game falls short is the new player multiplayer experience as everyone around you will have the best jets and can out maneuver you in every aspect. and unlocking jets themselves takes quite a while.

also if you get really good you can shoot down enemy missiles with laser weapons.

---------------------

I decide to try out the Mouse and Keyboard controls.

The intro cutscene begins.

In the lower-left of the screen, it tells me I can skip the cutscene.

However, it's using the xbox controller controls, so I have no idea what button to press.

I press Esc. Nothing.

I press Space Bar. Nothing.

I press Enter. Nothing.

I press - and I cannot stress enough that this not hyperbole - every single number and letter on my keyboard, including the numpad. Nothing.

I Alt-Tab out because what I OBVIOUSLY really wanted to do was 'research', not 'play a game'.

I find out that the answer is 'F1'. It's F1 to skip the cutscenes.

How silly of me not to have known that.

No matter, I skip the generic-ass cutscene and prepare to play.

The Mouse and Keyboard controls are laughable. The sensitivity is ridiculous.

As a result, the plane on my screen is thrashing around like some kind of wounded sky shark.

I give up on Mouse and Keyboard and decide to try it out on gamepad.

------------------------------------

The game doesn't force me to quit out and restart if I want to use a controller (I'M LOOKING DIRECTLY AT YOU, WARHAMMER 40K - INQUISITOR: MARTYR), so that's nice.

I restart the mission so I can find out what the gamepad controls are.

I take off.

The plane is reacting to my controls just like it should.

Everything feels fine.

I begin to relax.

I have a few moments until I have to engage in combat, so I decide to look around.

I touch my right gamepad stick and the camera WHIPS to the back of my jet, so I'm now looking backwards.

I release the stick.

The camera WHIPS back to the default view.

My frustration begins to rise.

""Relax."" I tell myself. ""Just drop the sensitivity in the menu.""

I pause the game and go to the menu.

Nope, can't find it in the options anywhere - looks like I need to exit the mission.

I exit the mission.

The setting simply doesn't exist. A cursory internet search will show you that you have to manually make changes to your ini file.

This shamelessly expensive game, which claims it was released in the year 2019, *doesn't have a sensitivity slider for gamepad*.

That's fucking ridiculous.

At least Bethesda games let me play them for a bit before they piss me off.

---------------------------------

I tried to ignore it and just 'play'. Nope. If I want to play this game I will need to manually change the ini.

I'm more than capable of doing that (just like pretty much anyone else with a pulse). Maybe one day I will.

But in the meantime I'll be playing games that don't make me manually fix them due to having woefully subpar gamepad options.

I feel pretty confident in guessing that this game is less a game and more a collection of minor annoyances for me, minor annoyances that other people are happy to overlook.

That is genuinely awesome for them, but it doesn't affect my experience one bit.",1704132602,1704132694,False,1,0,0.463904410600662231,0,True,False,False

It's exactly what I was expecting and then some. Some great atmosphere, weather effects, planes for the plane dorks, and tight controls. A good amount of fun missions like raiding, dogfighting, combat support; there's also other missions, like escort. :)

I do have a few nitpicks here. For one, the localization is a bit skrungly. With gems such as, ""How could you talk about food?"" and ""You put the meat between those buns and that burger is well done."" You could see how this would be a little distracting while you're trying to dodge fifty missiles. Still, it has an odd charm to it; and the voice actors do their best with it, so it's hard to fault it too much.

This game is by no means easy, I think when all was said and done I game overed on just about every mission at least once. That said, there's generous checkpoints here, and even when some missions get out of control you can at least rely on a respawn after your nearest cutscene.

The story and characters are surprisingly good! It was a little confusing at times, but this is my first Ace Combat game, so eh. I can tell that there was a lot of care put into this. Solid gameplay, solid music. And hey, I'll be hearing MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE PULL UP in my nightmares for some time to come.

I don't really like hardcore sims because the learning curve is too steep, but AC7 is the complete opposite.  It's just too basic.  It's too arcade-like.  I knew what I was getting into as I have played older AC games, but this one just isn't hitting the smile switch.  After the first two missions, I was pretty much over it.  Now I'm halfway through the missions and it's just like a first-person shooter but in a plane.  It's very similar to the H.A.W.X. game from about a decade ago with slightly better graphics.  I honestly liked that game better over this.

Now, this game isn't terrible (except for the story, which is absolutely HORRIBLE!!) and if you like arcade-like shooters, this is for you.  The graphics are pretty good and it's a descent enough challenge.  As a pilot IRL, I just prefer something where a bit more flight skill is needed.  Unfortunately, no one makes mid-level flights sims any more like the Jetfighter series or the Novalogic series (F-22 Lightning 3 / F-16 Multirole).  I was hoping they would add a little more something like those games but they didn't.  So the only alternative is to go full, hardcore sim and get DCS or you're stuck with MSFS/X-Plane/etc where there is no combat.

Some humongous negatives for this game are:
- No joystick support unless you own ONE specific model.  (Controller works, but people don't fly planes with a controller!!!)
- No multi-monitor.  This was truly disappointing for my 3 monitor setup

So I guess it's still worth playing but it's just not wonderful.  Wait until it is on sale.  Sigh.",1703906138,1703906138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game wise, It's a blast, the challenge is mostly fair, save 1 or 2 places where feels a bit bullshit, a mission with lighting, fog and big spiky cliffs comes to mind!

The game is a solid recommendation if you just want to have a weekend of fun.

My only gripe is the lack of Controller options, specially a more in depth capability of making the controller as I'd like to fly, this really hampered my enjoyment for the first 3-4 hours, until I get used to the arguably worse control scheme.

EDIT(Post Playing Project Wingman): 
It's insane to me that this game has a higher budget but lack of so many features that should be simple to add, that an indie project has. Playing with a custom control scheme and Track IR, made a MUCH lower budget game SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I played AC04 in PS2 era.  That was a fine game, if not the best air combat game (I also played AC3 in PS1 era).  The first 2 sorties were okay, nothing groundbreaking but it was reasonably fun and the characters were okay (not as great as AC04, but it is okay).  What annoy me the most, is the stage design.  

First thing first, most mission briefings are misleading at best, about 80% of the mission involve both air AND ground engagement, u thought it is a air combat mission and took your best fighter, then u need to bomb ground targets.  A ground sweeping mission from briefing? You need to intercept a launching ICBM in the 2nd half of the mission and you are screwed if you are riding the A10 for ground targets in the 1st half.  Most of the time you are better off just invest and bring a good multi-role plane (such as F-35) as you will do everything anyway.  Other than that icing, sandstorm interference, these elements brought nothing new to the table but only causing harassing the players (or force them to bring deicing part on their planes).

Secondly, Easy difficulty is anything BUT easy.  Yes you get easier to shoot down a foe, you can take more beating before going down, but you don't get more time for a search and destroy mission that the time is very tight if you are not in the fastest aircraft.  And there are quite a few escort/protect mission that the escort target(s) go down pretty quickly if you don't kill the target fast enough, and they won't survive longer just because you are in a easier difficulty.

And, last mission worth a individual mention IMO, SPOILER AHEAD

[SPOILER ALERT]
The final part of the mission, require exiting the space evaluator, I had like 50+ attempts retrying and never make it to the exit (always end up crashing somewhere) and having to resort to trainer.  Indeed I died quite a few times in the last mission of AC04, which involve entering the tunnel like this one to destroy the target, but the exit is much more straight-forward than this one, something is wrong with the dev on this one I would say......

And finally I beat the game (except the very last part of the final mission) in easy difficulty, but in my opinion it is even harder to beat AC04 in a F-4 phantom in hard difficulty (No ACE is too much for me) 20 years ago.  And at last I have a complain about the DLC.  I chose the most expensive ""TOP GUN: Maverick Ultimate Edition"" but I have no access to the best planes (like CFA-44), not the best business practice IMO.....",1703665255,1703674743,False,0,0,0.45267486572265625,0,True,False,False

It is an OK game for the $10 I paid for it. Had I paid full price I would have been pretty upset. The campaign is straight-up disappointing when compared to Ace Combat 6 (one of my all time favorite games ever). Almost every aspect besides graphics has gotten worse. The story is unbelievably cheesy, and wholly unbelievable(the bar is stupidly low and they still missed it), especially in the first 5 or so missions. The missions themselves are also a lot less fun. In AC6, many missions would have a set amount of objectives (i.e defend these units, assist the fleet in their assault, defend friendly support aircraft), and achieving a certain amount of these objectives would lead to completing the mission. I really liked this system, and was disappointed to see that they did away with that entirely. I also really miss the AC6 feature of calling in allied support or setting your wingman to  a specific target. Also, the standard missiles have an annoyingly short range compared to AC6. There are lots of little things as well that bother me, such as the minimap being almost completely useless in most missions because it is just a simplistic topographical map. In the end, there were only one mission that I really enjoyed, that being the canyon run mission.

Multiplayer is pretty much completely dead so not much to say there

Don't pay more than $10 for this
You'd be better off buying Ace Combat 6",1703564415,1703564415,False,1,0,0.498257845640182495,0,True,False,False

It's interesting, but it's one of the least exhilarating in the series.
Even in the old game, there are a lot of troublesome missions that occur once between several missions, but this time there are many.
In particular, One of the drawbacks of the AC series is that it feels sluggish to fly until you encounter an enemy when retrying.
As many reviews have said, it's easy to get stressed out by doing consecutive missions with one arm tied up.
There's something quite irritating about having to restart a game under such a strict time limit.
If you say, 'The time limit is strangely strict and I only clear C rank,' then there is no problem at all. The story will move forward and you will get some money.
Even though one play tends to be redundant, they are forced to use special weapons that are not very interesting.
Having to restart the game when the time is up at the last minute is more painful than fun.
If you try to clear S rank, the difficulty will be severe anyway,
I wanted the game to feel a little more comfortable the first time I played it.

After falling down the Ace Combat rabbit hole, I still don't really give a shit about fighter jets, but these games kick ass.

If you really want a push to be interested in this kind of game but also don't give a shit about fighter jets, consider this. Fighter jets are the closest real-life analogue to anime mecha. Fighter pilots and mecha pilots are similar in that both are specialized pilots that get into a large machine equipped with insane, expensive weaponry that has the ability to kill you near-instantly as long as the pilot can see you.

Now, unlike DCS, Ace Combat 7 is very easily played with just a keyboard and mouse.  I did order a hotas for DLC, but until it arrives I am not fit to make a comparison between the two. DCS looks like an excellent game but I won't be able to make a judgment until I receive my hotas. In the meantime....Ace Combat 7 is about the most fun I've ever had playing a jet fighter combat game.  Mouse and keyboard and have an insane blast. I do highly recommend this game if you DON'T have a hotas.  Everything is very easily laid out right on the keyboard and a hotas is not necessary for this game.  Now, once I get my hotas and have a chance to dive into DCS I may come back and edit this review.  But, regardless of how good DCS is, or is not, this game is still a major blast.  It's tons of fun.

1. Allied AIs are very ineffective. This destroys the feeling of being in a large battle -- there can be many hostiles and many allies in a mission, but although the hostiles will attack the player or objective to be protected, the allies basically fly around doing nothing.
2. Compounding the above, the targeting and radar display doesn't really work well for the setting given. In some missions, player has to destroy specific objectives with many (>20) other target-able other things nearby. In this situation, cycling through targets to find the correct one is tedious, even without having to dodge missiles in the meantime. The radar display will also be cluttered, which makes it difficult to determine, for example, which direction an enemy missile is coming from. 
3. The diversity of aircraft and weapons feel a bit ""fake"". Ground attack missions switch halfway to critical air-to-air combat (dogfights involving enemy aces, chasing fast-moving flying targets while being pursued by enemy fighters, destroying components of a flying target that has a lot of fighter escorts), usually with strict time limit. Given the ineffectiveness of the allied AI, it feels like the best course of action is to always pick a plane + parts + special weapons combo that will work well for air-to-air combat. Technically we can still use a combination focused on ground attack for such ""ground attack"" missions, but it's much more tedious.

Few things to note for those who don't fall into the aforementioned categories of ace combat fans and plane-person:
- you die you restart the whole mission (basically)
- the standards control are boring asf like flying a plane on a plane simulator on a mobile phone
    --> if you do choose the expert control without any prior experience, it's hard to control asf f***, basically not friendly to new players (and it's not designed to, i get it, but the other option is standard mode and you'll be better off playing war thunder and flying planes) 
- the story is ???????? 
- half the time you'll be spending circling the same enemy trying to get a lock. you either end up crashing right into the floor cuz you're not familiar with the controls or you just get extremely frustrated that you can't get a lock on a STATIC ground troop for 10 minutes despite having the crosshair on the target 2000 times. 
- the tutorial for the controls are adapted to CONTROLLER controls. meaning that for a PC player, they might as you to change the map size with the central button of the controller and accelerate with ""LB"". 
     --> in that case, just how the f*** is one unfamiliar with the controls able to have fun in this game (meaning not use standard controls) without having to GUESS what these controller buttons translate to on the keyboard.

I pretty much brought the game because I wanted the Top Gun experience and was not disappointed. 
For newbies to the franchise like myself, the plot flew right over my head (pun intended). But the storyline is told uniquely and I found a more 'lived in' world quite engaging. The gameplay, graphics and music are where this game truly shines.

I have yet to see a game that simply welcomes you as the OP hero and lets you run with the idea with full self-awareness; and aiding you are a band of misfits, cool villain and of course beautifully rendered aircraft. I strongly suggest turning off flight aids and playing on the lowest difficulty for newbies and taking an OP DLC aircraft if the going gets tough, then do a second run with something more sane, or perhaps an A-10 only run for funsies...

Let's be honest, enemy planes can literally turn on a dime and infuriatingly break away from tracking weapons with ease whenever it suits them. No airframe should be able to handle what this game does to them, but that isn't the point. Ace Combat has always been about telling a story in a strange world where aerial combat is akin to arturian legends about epic clashings of steel and magic. It seeks to make you feel like a hero, and by god does it pull it off. At worst you'll be evading missiles and taking pot shots at targets, at its best you are the razor that cuts the sky, and every target falls to pieces in your wake in glorious fireballs. All while sweeping music blasts in your ears, mixing with the constant threat of ""MISSILE"" blaring in your hud. 

The story will always be a subjective thing, and Ace Combat has never been without a healthy helping of cheese, but it's oh so charming. You'll grow attached to your fellow pilots, and you'll grow to laugh at, and swear at both them and your enemies.

The controls are pathetic even if one looks at it as if it were an actual console game. You have like 4 possible changes you can make to your control scheme on an xbox controller. There is no option to change the sensitivity of your view or control sensitivity.

The graphics are a highlight - the lighting, weather effects, and landscapes are incredible, as are the airplane models. 

The missions come across as your standard Ace Combat options - if you've played any prior AC games, you'll be familiar with the traditional escalation of basic beginning missions, increasingly bigger dogfights and ace squadron battles, timed ground attack missions, and spectacular Death-Star-run style set-pieces. The downside is the length. With mission failures (including the frustrating ""you didn't get enough points in the time limit, do those 20 minutes again""), I managed to complete all 20 base game missions in 8 hours. For a $80 game, this doesn't seem worthwhile.

The story is also a big negative. I've played 04, 5, and Zero multiple times, as well as 6 once. I've consulted fan wikis. I still am more confused as to what on Earth (or what in Strangereal) is happening in this game. The other games provide geopolitics that are goofy but still entertaining, with characters that help ground you in the setting. AC7 feels more like a first draft. Or several first drafts in search of a main story. Incomprehensible geography and references to prior games, combined with boring, cookie-cutter characters.

In all, I would say that if you have an opportunity to track down Ace Combat 5, you would be advised to pick that over this game. The graphics aren't nearly as good, but everything else is much better.",1702327637,1702327637,False,1,0,0.481517106294631958,0,True,False,False

The Good:  Beautiful graphics, unique environments, environmental hazards, and a fun new take on aircraft unlocks with some customization thrown in. 
The Bad:  The writing is mediocre, the VO is totally phoned in, the plot is an absolute mess from start to finish, and half the aircraft in the game are paid DLC. The multiplayer is also pay to win but nobody plays AC for the multiplayer.

The story is pretty standard Ace Combat and at times you really have to try hard to believe it, but it has its moments too. The maps and missions are nicely varied, although some of them (*cough cough* escort *cough*) can be annoying at times.

The main game took me about 12 hours to complete and if you don't value replaying the missions on harder difficulties and unlocking all the aircraft, that is the what the single player experience will deliver for you. The 3 DLC missions all add about 20 minutes of additional gameplay with increased challenge and are worth picking up on sale.",1702147466,1702147466,True,1,0,0.507672667503356934,0,True,False,False

In short, Ace Combat 7 gives you everything you need to feel like the greatest pilot in history, from the crushing lows of political imprisonment to the blazing highs of hard-fought redemption and glory, set to the backdrop of distinctly unreal yet plausible war games. Also (and somewhat ironically), unlike many true simulators, this game is one of the few (official) ways to see inside the cockpits of many 5th gen jets like the F-22, F-35, and Su-57, which is VERY cool. 

It's also pretty cool how the game tries to translate the nuances of real jets into the game's mechanics, like how the Typhoon and F-14 are famous for their ultra long-range missiles (the Meteor and AIM-54 Phoenix respectively), so their jets are both equipped with Long Range Air-to-Air Missiles (LAAM) by default. Also, in real life the F-14 was one of the first jets to be able to track and fire at multiple targets simultaneously, so naturally the in-game version has the option to equip the 6AAM system that can lock and fire upon six targets at once. Heck, the Top Gun versions of the F-14 include Strangereal equivalents to the semi-active radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow.

Jets like the F-22, Su-57, and other supermanuverable/thrust-vectoring jets are also able to perform wildly acrobatic Post Stall Maneuvers (PSM) like the infamous Kobra and Kulbit, which is a nice (if impractical) touch. Much like in real life, PSMs are EXTREMELY high risk and situational techniques that leave you a sitting duck as you twirl around in place, but damn do they look cool, and in the rare cases when they do give you the advantage, you'll have earned all the bragging rights you'll ever need. 

Finally, this game works FANTASTICALLY on a Steam Deck. 60fps at high settings, no problem. I sometimes even dock it for my 55"" 4K TV, and it looks surprisingly decent with the Deck's built-in FSR (it's still just an extremely stretched out 1200x800 box in the middle of the screen, but the FSR puts in serious work to make it all extremely legible and playable).

A return to form, unless you're someone who demands HOTAS support (& doesn't own one of the officially supported sticks. See below.) But if like me all you want is a great arcade flight combat game and you're comfortable playing with a controller, this is the Ace Combat you've been waiting for.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
[list]
[*]The straightforward, classic Ace Combat gameplay I know and love (completing objectives within time limits via repetition and practice, experimenting to find the best aircraft and weapons for the mission, and the satisfaction of just barely squeaking by on higher difficulties) with none of the annoying new inclusions of recent entries (no DFM from AH for instance.)
[*]Visually stunning (search for ini tweaks to enable TAA & greater draw distance - worth it!)
[*]Typically over the top, at times cringey - but that's why we love it - ""strangereal"" story and world building narrative. Melodramatic & fun.
[*]Stable port with excellent performance on systems meeting system requirements. (One rare exception to this, see CONS below...)
[*]Weather effects (ice, moisture, visibility, lightning, rain, turbulence, etc.) add beautifully to the immersion factor, and affect gameplay.
[*]Decent length. (20 missions. Tons to unlock for replay value.)
[*]Online team deathmatch & battle royal
[/list]

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Limited HOTAS support. (See below.)
[*]Resolution issues. Some users report resolutions seemingly arbitrarily locked. Workaround is to switch to full screen, verify game files, update video driver, and disable desktop resizing. If that doesn't work, try deleting the folder located in C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\ACE COMBAT 7\Config
[*]No FOV (Fix: https://steamcommunity.com/app/502500/discussions/0/1776010325119855174/ )
[*]Lack of full key/button remapping, and mouse directional input inversion. The game really is an almost 1:1 console port, intended for controller play more than kb+m at this point.
[*]Lack of ultrawide resolution support. (Fix: http://www.wsgf.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=174483#p174483 )
[*]Load & menu lag related to Corsair & Razer keyboards, & certain USB audio devices. Unplugging/uninstalling them resolves it...
[*]VR is console-exclusive at this time.
[*]FXAA only (TAA & longer draw distance ini tweak page 1 & 2 of: https://steamcommunity.com/app/502500/discussions/0/1777135944140331772/
)
[*]Some newcomers may find the narrative slightly confusing without the context of prior games, though personally I don't think I would even without the benefit of having played the others. They provide context, but if you can overlook the series staple cheese and outright oddness, you should be able to follow and understand what's happening without any prior experience. The story is quite self-contained.
[*]The only tutorial the game offers is in the form of radio chatter coupled with brief flashes of text in the first few missions. Users are advised to pay close attention and replay the first few levels if you feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of info the HUD throws at you. Series vets are used to it, but I can see this being an issue for some.
[*]I love this personally, but expect to replay certain missions - or replay earlier ones to obtain credits for better aircraft - [i]a lot[/i] before figuring out how to achieve victory. I consider the difficulty just about perfect, and it's always been part of AC, but some may find this irksome. Checkpoints during missions are RARE, so expect repetition and practice.

[h1]For existing fans[/h1]

For existing Ace Combat fans [b]used to playing with a controller[/b]: This is the return to form we've been waiting for, at least for me. If you already know you love Ace Combat, and all you wanted was an Ace Combat experience without the issues Assault Horizon and Infinity had, then this is the game for you. It's my favorite entry since Shattered Skies, without question. It's challenging, fun, & straightforward.

For existing Ace Combat fans who [b]demand HOTAS[/b] as the interface of choice. Unfortunately, you have a valid complaint, because...

[h1]Officially supported HOTAS[/h1]

As of right now (will update review if this changes,) those are the [i]only[/i] supported HOTAS interfaces. Nothing else will (officially) work with the game. However...

[h1]Unofficial workarounds[/h1]

Some things worth knowing:.

[list]
[*]This is not a hardcore flight sim. This is to DCS as CoD is to ARMA. Or at least as Forza is to Project Cars. It's tilted heavily toward the arcade end of the gameplay spectrum. Nevertheless, it provides a fun, challenging experience.
[*]Ace Combat games take place in what has become known as the ""strangereal"" universe. A world not entirely unfamiliar to us, but fictitious nonetheless. The stories in these games tend to be melodramatic, over the top, and at times downright cringey. But if you can get into them, they are a highlight for many fans of the series. The story unfolds via cut scenes between missions, and radio chatter while flying. This radio chatter also gives you important information about your objectives, so pay attention, as they can change mid-mission.
[*]The game features a fairly straightforward radar, with three view ranges (local, wide, and widest) that you can switch between with a button press. This is useful for finding targets. You can switch between selected targets with the tap of a button as well.
[*]You have four basic weapon types per aircraft. Your normal missiles, your gun, your special weapon, and your chaff. Your missiles will lock onto the highlighted enemies and track them when fired (you can still miss however, as enemies can evade just as well as you can.) Your gun sight will appear when in gun range, allowing you to fire bullets at enemies as well. Your special weapons can be swapped between air to air, air to ground, and various types before each mission, so selecting  the right weapon for each mission is important. Chaff allows you to more easily evade enemy missiles. You also have limited ammo, so some missions allow you to return to base to reload.
[*]You can choose between Novice and Expert control options. [b]I strongly recommend playing with Expert controls[/b], as this gives you all three axes to control. However, if you are someone who tries to play this way and experiences motion sickness or other impediments, don't be afraid to try Novice. Elitism carries no weight with me and it shouldn't with you either. It's a video game. Play the way you find most enjoyable. There's nothing stopping you from trying Expert again later. It's important to me that newcomers to this series not feel put off or excluded if they happen to struggle. The option is there for a reason.
[*]Missions are timed, but don't let that intimidate you. With practice, you will have ample time to achieve victory. But it does demand practice sometimes.
[*]There is a Free Mission mode which allows you to endlessly replay any mission you've already reached or completed previously, which is a great way to earn more credits to unlock additional planes, weapons, and parts. This has always been one of my favorite aspects of AC.
[*]General tips (Credit to M88): https://steamcommunity.com/app/502500/discussions/0/1776010325118879029/

Sound design is also meh... There's no sonic boom (or anything) to add to the feeling of transitioning to above the speed of sound, the jet engines do not have their typical ""thunderlike"" roar.

Characters are bland and annoying

Lots of waiting, waiting for mission updates while theres nothing to do, waiting out timer even though your objective is completed, waiting for the sandstorm to clear, waiting for your escort to slowly reach its destination, slowly approaching enemies to ID them, slowly platforming in the valley, radar, and the elevator, lots of circling back to strafe targets from a better angle, waiting for weapons to reload.

If the air to ground missions were skippable it wouldn't have soured my opinion of this game. Air to ship combat is great though, lots of targets and anti air that isn't a cliffwall or invisible instant loss radar. The dogfighting missions are fun. Theres always something to duel and you are always under missile lock. The downside though of the dogfighting is that its very quick to complete so they add in the features that I complained about above.

- Planes are pretty

Negatives:
- Unchangeable difficulty with a difficulty ramp.  I picked normal and felt fine for the first 5 missions...  I've spent 2 hours failing mission 6.  Normally I'd click the difficulty down so I can just continue the story...  no such thing...  Just gonna put it down for me.
- If we are going to be locked in, I kinda wish we checkpoints were more plentiful (Mission 6 has none...well, that I've hit so far).

I'm sure OG players will just call me soft, and perhaps that's a fair point, but allow me to say this:  I was epically enjoying myself until Mission 6, like, a shit ton.  Like, gonna recommend to all my friends who like planes sorts of fun and...  Well, now I'm here giving a negative review.  All that needs to change is to let me adjust difficulty during the campaign, if you want to give me a little slap on the wrist for doing it, that's fine.  But let me do it.

In short, the game plays fine on keyboard+mouse but I would recommend a controller, it has historically been a PlayStation series.
Make sure you enable ""expert controls"" in the options as that is how the rest of the series plays, the default control scheme is very limited by comparison and far less fun.
Some people have problems with playing on a flight stick so don't expect great support there.
The PC version does NOT have a VR mode, that was exclusive to the PS4 version sadly.

[h3]Part 2: On the AC Series[/h3]
To begin with I would like to dispel an idea that many may have about the series that would likely repel them early on: Ace Combat is not a flight sim. Putting AC into the flight simulator category is similar to lumping the Burnout, SSX, and Call of Duty series into the driving, snowboarding, and racial abuse simulator categories respectively.
Ace Combat carries the themes of aviation one might be familiar with from movies like Top Gun with real aircraft and an attempt at air force lingo sprinkled throughout the mission dialogue, but it takes place in its own universe with its own nations and a fair share of oddly sci-fi elements often explained in a vaguely Kojima-esque way.

[h3]Part 3: Flow Gameplay[/h3]
Expanding on my statement in the intro section, I have found after having played through every mainline AC game that it can in many cases more comfortably be compared to a series like Jet Set Radio or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on the gameplay side of things.
Admittedly an odd image to conjure, Ace Combat missions will provide you with an area and some specific objective to accomplish, but will often allow you to fly around and complete these objectives with a degree of freedom, I find myself more closely making the alt sports game comparisons when it comes to how the player can achieve these goals.
While it is possible in many cases to take the safer and more realistic approach of taking out one target per pass over an objective area before retreating to high altitude to avoid any risk, in the same way one might take the easy route in Tony Hawk of grinding one rail in between manuals over and over again to rack up your score, the fun starts when the player begins taking risks. With some practice a player can be moving at high speed very close to terrain, making rapid use of their plane's unrealistically high stock of bombs, missiles, and bullets to knock out many targets in a short period of time while dodging missiles and gun emplacements with ease. These situations I can compare easily to the feeling of being in-the-zone in a skateboarding game, where you make full use of your environment and skilled movement to string together as many tricks as possible.

[h3]Part 04: Gameplay Balance[/h3]
Many planes can be unlocked in AC7 for the player to fly, a currency earned through completing missions allows for an unlock tree to be explored that leads to not only new planes, but multiple weapons for each as well as parts that can fill a slot on any aircraft to affect their abilities.
Given the branching paths present in the progression tree and the existence of useful parts scattered throughout, you will eventually end up funnelling money into another fork and acquiring half a dozen planes that would never be viable to fly in order to get one part to minmax the configuration of your current ""best"" plane.
While player freedom is a nice convenience, the result of the parts system is that your plane choice midgame will be mostly determined by the weapons they come with and ammo capacity, while at the endgame your choices will be around if the plane has cobra or kulbit manoeuvre capability (advanced movement techniques).
In previous games your plane unlocks were linear but you could choose not to buy the newest one and keep saving or get a new weapon for an owned plane if you wanted, in some cases there were planes you could only unlock by putting more time into a certain plane before it even if this meant using it for a short while after the plane was viable. In the original Air Combat you would even lose a plane if you crashed it in a mission and that would set you back somewhat in your playthrough. 
In AC7 the only reason to not use the most expensive plane you currently have with a combination of your best parts would be to intentionally nerf yourself, though there are some weapons like long range AA missiles that would force your hand and have you use a worse plane (unless you bought the Top Gun DLC for the special F14)

[h3]Part 5: Story[/h3]
The story for Ace Combat games is never exactly Shakespeare, but I would have to say that AC7 is maybe the worst in the series that I have played.
Most would agree that the ""holy trinity"" of AC games released in the PS2 era are the peak of the series, with 4, 5, and Zero's cutscenes utilising still manga-ish images with voiceover, shoddy 3d anime models, and full-motion video with real actors respectively.
AC7 decides to take the worst of these three and go with the shoddy 3d models again. Sure this one is down to a matter of taste, but another more egregious thing taken from AC5 is the amount of in-mission dialogue in the game.
My personal favourite of the series, AC4 would unload most of its plot and context through the slides in between missions, and then a bit more in briefings, but would include one or two lines mid-mission to give characters a bit of personality. These lines would always relate to the mission at hand, but almost always your teammates would be focused on the mission. The small bits of levity you hear when you save another plane or a ground unit from being destroyed were like a reward for your performance. 
By comparison, every character in AC7 talks CONSTANTLY, there is hardly a moment of dead air on the radio in some missions, and a lot of it is fun chatter from characters who are according to the plot supposed to be less professional, but even the most elite groups in the Osean forces will just keep chatting about nothing throughout the game and it came to be a pain in the ass for me.
The higher level of chatter worked in AC5 because it was almost exclusively between the three other pilots in your tightly-knit squadron who were characters that you follow through the whole game, but in AC7 everyone joins in like we're in a public Discord call.
In AC4 the still image cutscenes in between SOME missions would tell the story of a civilian during the war who has seemingly no bearing on the player character's mission, this served to add context to the war and provide a small amount of background to a squadron you encounter in the story.
AC7's cutscenes try to mix these elements from AC4 and 5 but manage to nail neither of them, introducing too many characters that don't matter, giving tons of info that the player does not care about, while providing too much info on a villain that is supposed to be mysterious.

[h3]Part 0: Music[/h3]
AC7's music covers a few genres and does well to match the tone of each mission, really pushes you forward and greatly elevates a gameplay system that already feels awesome. I wouldn't say that the music is the best in the series by a longshot but that would be like saying that Dark Souls 2 is the worst Dark Souls game, that still leaves it pretty up there.
I also kinda hate the main motif in the soundtrack and especially the vocal version but that's just me, there're plenty of awesome songs like Stonehenge Defensive and Last Hope I & II that are super memorable along with their missions.

[h3]Part 7: Conclusion[/h3]
This is not the best game in the series, however it is a fantastic starting point, an accumulation of every improvement to controls made in the series.
The game also goes on sale pretty frequently, for like 80% off you have NO excuse.

I had a bunch more to say about VR, multiplayer, and how this game is the Dark Souls 3 of the series and copies AC4 heavily for mission structure but this review has a character limit.",1701164082,1701164082,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

So to sum it up, ITS ADDICITIVELY FUN. 

In terms of gameplay, you get some pretty good graphics and lots of fun blowing up some poor suckers with hundreds of missles, railguns, lasers, just to name a few weapons to choose. The story is alright but im really happy that we are finally back in strangereal. The soundtrack is absolutely godlike as always with any ace combat game and there are these musical moments that WILL send chills everytime. Who needs realism and physics anyway since the just get in the way of fun. 

DLC content really cranks up the fun with more fun planes, more missions and SALVATION, and some classic liveries to eat some enemies in style.

I really enjoy the cinematic view after every mission. I have one problem though. What the actual fuck is with the bombing missions? That is the one thing I have the most difficulty with in this game that it is actually distracting. The spacing of the bombing targets and the time you have and the ammo you have is so small and far away its so damn hard to finish it. It took me hours to get the first one down, although the second one is the best cause all the targets are all in one simple place and it felt good and fun to take it down, but once I got to mission 11 I just stopped playing for a while. That one is giving me the most trouble because you have fifteen minutes to bomb but you gotta take the time to get to each area and maybe refuel once or twice due to the small amount of ammo. So I get five minutes of having to fucking just fly around and only ten minutes to do boring ass strafing runs. Look, I will continue to play the game looking forward to the other missions, but the bomber missions are what make me put down the game and walk away and not play it for a while. [/strike]

🛦 If this is your first ACE COMBAT game or if you are not accustomed to flight simulators, then expect some 'turbulence' during learning phase. However, you should get used to it pretty quickly. I highly recommend using a controller.

🛦 After finishing the main story, I wasn't satisfied. I wanted to get back up in the sky and become better at dog-fighting. Luckily there's ACE difficulty which unlocks after finishing the main story in hard difficulty. There's also lots of medals to chase and a whole lot of aircraft, skins, and emblems to unlock.
If you are not into that, then there is online multiplayer, which, to my surprise, is still somewhat alive. However, it's mostly played by veterans who are highly skilled obviously. Nevertheless, multiplayer is great fun. You can invite and play with your friends too in a private lobby, if I am not mistaken. All in all, ACE COMBAT 7 has great replayablity.

Oh, and one last thing...

Ace Combat might look like a Flight Simulator game, but it is the completely opposite.

This series focuses on a lot of crazy political plots that are mainly secondary to your Flight Missions that gradually go from your typical military operation, All the way to flying through a tunnel within a giant WMD Railgun so that you can hit it's weakspot like Han Solo. lol
It is very stupid at times, while keeping a serious tone throughout it's plots and twists.


But i'm certain that the main question will be something along the lines of: ""what's the appeal of Ace Combat to it's fans?"", and the answer is quite simple: it's the same kind of appeal that Modern DOOM games have: 

The Adrenaline Rush of being a unstoppable force of nature that could be put down at any moment with a few well-placed hits while being constantly placed in the middle of unwinnable odds.

Ace Combat is the ""Boomer Shooter"" of Flight Simulator Games, while keeping itself grounded in it's Military Realism roots.",1700427212,1700427292,True,17,1,0.687263786792755127,0,True,False,False

Personally, I'm not much of a flight sim person, though I've played a few space sims (like the X series) and that utterly forgettable Star Wars combat game (Squadrons, was it?). Nevertheless, the different available control schemes allowed me to succeed without a steep learning curve.
Jet fighter enthusiast will be happy to see that many modern fighter planes are represented in the game. Allegedly these planes come with different specialisations, and there's an ""Aircraft Tree"" to unlock new ones. Knowing nothing about planes, I figured that higher numbers are better and just went with the planes that seemed the best allrounders...
Most of the combat, at least for me, is done with homing missiles. You have an unlimited amount of those, plus a limited amount of ""special weapons"", which are typically more elaborate missiles or bombs for ground combat. 
Playing the game at highest visual settings still made it look rather mediocre. I think that's a known bug, though. And to be honest, I was typically flying through the scenery at such high speeds that I couldn't see any details anyway. 
The combat is fun. I played on the lowest difficulty setting (specifically recommended to newcomers of the series) and found the experience challenging enough to be fun without frustrating me. I particularly enjoyed the missions where I got to fight ground targets, but perhaps that's just me. 
The story is surprisingly good. I played through the game in a single weekend because I genuinely wanted to know what was going to happen next. One of the support characters is a a bit of a stereotypical anime waifu, but, well, that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
All in all I enjoyed Ace Combat 7 a lot, much more than I expected. I'd love to see more of this!
The Campaign playthrough took me a bout 10h. I don't think the replayability is very high. There's a Multiplayer, though, which I didn't try out. 
I'd recommend buying the game during a sale; the full price seems a bit ridiculous to me. There are DLCs but I don't plan to buy them.",1700388596,1700388596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This franchise was my Childhood. The first one I played was Unsung War, then I went from there and playing all the others. When I saw Ace Combat 7 I knew I had to get it. One of the best decisions in my life. Playing this game made me feel like a kid again. Having those air battles, dodging missiles, together with the characters and interactions, this game is everything I could ask for. I highly recommend this game.

[Single Player]
The story is amazing. The scenery, the characters, the planes, everything here is top quality. It really helps you get immersed in the game. The story is a typical AC story, with a lot of memorable and breathtaking moments. The gameplay is tight, the new maneuver are really nice (Even tho I didn't use it all that much). The jets are incredibles, the ones in game and the ones in the dlcs a well. Overall a very solid game for a Ace Combat Fan AND those who want to get in to the game. {9/10}

[Multiplayer]
Well, Here the things are not all that good. I like the multiplayer, it's not bad. It's just not my type. I'm way out of the skill level of anyone there, but it's nice to see what others can do and how good they can fly (Except the hackers, there are a few of them and they destroy the experience). I just wish we had a co-op  campaing, or a couch co-op mode like the old games. {4/10}

This version on PC does not disappoint. 
It really is a pure Ace Combat experience with really tight graphics and great sound effects. 
The story mode unfolds really well the first playthough, and subsequent playthroughs allow you to skip it and get right into the action.

The licensed aircraft from top military aircraft manufacturers is what makes this game a bit on the expensive side I would imagine. But securing these licenses and being able to fly the planes in the game just adds an extra layer of polish to the game.

The ""story"" is total dog crap and the characters you fly with can be very annoying sometimes. From ""Let's make a bet"" to ""Going to tell my son this story"". Even trying to ""follow"" the story makes little to no sense. 

The game play however is amazing. The in game currency to buy planes and upgrades are a bit annoying. However, the planes and how they fly feel amazing. Locking on and dog fighting never gets old. I found myself replaying missions just to push myself for a better score which I normally never do. 

You and also customize your ship with different parts. More armor, fighter flying, or more missiles. 

If you like the idea of flying a jet with over +100 missiles and a special missiles 30-100ish or curious about these type of games. Then this is the perfect one to start. I thought this game was going to be ""oh, this is neat. Ok, I'm done."" and move on. I played it every chance I got. It's great.

There is a multiplayer, however I don't care about that so if that matters to you. Look for other reviews on that. I'd suggest Thrust-Adjusting Steering Device (MSL) and Multiple Enemy Detection Device (MSL) for ARM.. Basically anything for Reload, Load Limit, and Homing feels the best. On top of Automated Fire Extinguisher and Queen's Custom for body.. 

So the DLC is a bit weird. They have a Season Pass, but it does not include all DLC. There's 3 25th Anniversary packs with 3-4 planes and a Top Gun colab and I think that's it. I got the bundle with the base game, Season Pass, and Top Gun. From what I can tell the DLC aren't super amazing. A lot of the base planes outclass them when you go better into what you can own. Rafale M really feels like it is way better than the DLC imo. I do wish they had included it with the season pass or make a ""Definite Edition"" instead of this confusing crap. That's my ""biggest"" personal grip besides the story.

Hopefully more of these games come to Steam or I find other IP's like this.",1699350633,1699350890,True,31,0,0.728856146335601807,0,True,False,False

Edit: It just became extra abusive as they rocketed up the prices to give a bigger discount and land on the same price.

It is one of the weakest (and probably last) game of the franchise. It is a passion project and has some memorable moments but mostly in boss fights. OST is good, multiplayer is either dead or unbalanced. 

Graphically is good but UE4 makes scenarios LOD be blocky and its a pain to fix it. There is also some grind for weapons to ""increase replayability"" but only makes the game more annoying. The time trials are fun, though.

Also check out the community mods. Unhinged and cringe weeb shit, but very fun!

In my reviews I always like to include both good and bad things about games but as I stand here now I cannot find a single one in the campaigns that I have had.  The game is honestly a model of graphic advancement with awe inspiring sights, great cloud cover, realistic mountains and forest (for when you are flying lower than you need to be), and enemies and allies who stick with you. There will never be a wingman like the Count and never an enemy quite like Mr. X. 

To top off these amazing graphics we get a story that is just as amazing with narrative twist, a futuristic war, and surprisingly moral dilemmas with political intrigue that remind me of the Metal Gear franchise which are so lacking in modern gaming.

Add on an unlock tree that features over 30 aircraft both old, modern, and futuristic with weapons to match and you get a single player experience that just can't be topped. 

My only hope is that we will see other Ace Combat games released in the future or see the older ones make their way to steam and other launchers. Until then I hope to see you all in the skies.

As a long-time fan of the franchise, I can confidently say that Bandai Namco has outdone themselves with this latest installment.

Graphics and Presentation: ★★★★★

From the moment you take off, SKIES UNKNOWN impresses with its stunning visuals. The aircraft models are incredibly detailed, and the landscapes are breathtaking. The transition from calm skies to intense dogfights is seamless, creating a sense of immersion that few other games can match. The attention to detail in the environments and the aircraft is truly remarkable.

Gameplay: ★★★★★

The gameplay in ACE COMBAT™ 7 is where the game truly shines. The controls are tight and responsive, allowing for precise maneuvers and exhilarating combat. The wide variety of aircraft to choose from, each with its own unique characteristics, ensures that there's something for every type of player. Whether you're an ace pilot or a newbie, the game's accessibility and depth strike the perfect balance.

The mission design is superb, featuring a mix of intense dogfights, bombing runs, and thrilling set pieces. The evolving objectives keep you engaged throughout the campaign, which is further enhanced by the inclusion of an engaging and well-written storyline. The addition of the ""Strangereal"" universe, which connects to previous games in the series, adds depth to the narrative for longtime fans.

Sound and Music: ★★★★★

The audio in SKIES UNKNOWN is a treat for the ears. The roaring engines, missile launches, and radio chatter create an authentic and immersive experience. The soundtrack, composed by Keiki Kobayashi, is nothing short of a masterpiece, perfectly complementing the game's atmosphere and providing an emotional backdrop to the intense aerial combat.

Multiplayer: ★★★★

The multiplayer component of ACE COMBAT™ 7 is solid, offering various modes to engage with friends and players worldwide. Dogfights and team battles are thrilling and showcase the game's strengths. However, the lack of more diverse game modes and larger player counts is a minor disappointment.

Replay Value: ★★★★

With multiple aircraft to unlock, numerous difficulty levels, and the desire to perfect your flying skills, ACE COMBAT™ 7 offers excellent replay value. The VR missions (PlayStation VR exclusive) are a fantastic addition that breathes new life into the game and are a must-try for VR enthusiasts.

In conclusion, ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN is a triumph in the world of flight simulation and combat games. Its captivating story, breathtaking visuals, and exhilarating gameplay make it a must-play for aviation enthusiasts and gamers alike. It's a game that soars above the competition and leaves players with an unforgettable experience in the skies.",1698622206,1698622206,True,23,0,0.678089380264282227,0,True,False,False

Daredevil.


Let's be honest.  If compared to other dominating combat games, this is like comparing a Lamborghini to your buddies rice burner.  But you know what, you still ride with your buddy cause it's awesome. 

You play this game for the story (WAIT, slow those keyboards!) I'm not talking about the Surreal world that the game is based on, but what it feels like when you're flying at top speed against 100's of drones vs an impenetrable force field and the shield drops and the (@#*&@#^$ MUSIC swells, and you forget you're in your 15 year old computer chair being held together by duct tape, but in the combat seat of a next-gen fighter with questionable armaments. (Yeah mai dude, I know that's not how missiles work.)

I'm late to the series, and after doing some research was amazed to find what I found endearing about it was ""what"" they wanted to achieve, so hats off to ACE 7 for doing what it set out to do and not flutter it with well, all my fellow gamers know what environment we deal with now.

Overall -

Arcade style combat with decent replay value.  Oddly, like in most aerial games, easy is harder than normal?  Minor bugs, occasional crashes, but not game breaking.  AI are useless, unfortunately, but not so annoying you cringe.  Story is, well it's there, but previous points in above section.  Lots of unlocks via just playing the game, and some DLCs that should have? but not included, preference there.  Enough variety that you don't have to always use the superest (that a word?) plane to do anything.

This is a thrilling symphony of speed, strategy, and story, all masterfully orchestrated to deliver an experience that truly stands out in the flight combat genre.

Graphics & Visuals: The game is a visual masterpiece. The aircraft models are meticulously detailed, with every rivet, panel, and insignia rendered with impressive precision. But it's not just the planes that shine. The game's environments, from the expansive blue skies to the varied terrains below, are breathtaking. Dynamic weather conditions and realistic cloud physics don't just serve as eye candy; they play an integral role in your combat strategies, making every mission feel fresh and unpredictable.

Gameplay: Ace Combat 7 nails the fine balance between arcade fun and simulation complexity. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned pilot, the game offers controls and difficulty levels to cater to your skill set. The addition of new weapons and tech encourages strategic thinking, and the dogfights? They are nothing short of exhilarating. Outmaneuvering enemies, dodging missiles, and lining up that perfect shot feels rewarding every single time.

Story: The Ace Combat series has always been known for its engaging narratives, and Skies Unknown does not disappoint. The story is a riveting tale of war, betrayal, and redemption, woven together with cutscenes that rival many cinematic blockbusters. The voice acting is top-notch, and the soundtrack, with its grand orchestral scores, complements the game's tone beautifully.

Multiplayer: The online multiplayer mode is a fantastic addition for those who wish to test their skills against other pilots worldwide. With various modes and challenges, there's always a reason to jump back in for ""just one more match.""

Final Thoughts: Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is a testament to the passion and expertise of its developers. It's a polished, captivating experience that will resonate with fans of the series and newcomers alike. If soaring through the skies, engaging in intense dogfights, and being immersed in a rich narrative sounds like your kind of game, then Skies Unknown is an absolute must-play.",1694918946,1698007582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, replayability is barely there; it's only present in a handful of missions.

The graphics and gameplay are pretty solid, though; gazing back at its graphics since its release, you can see some areas where it doesn't totally age very well, but otherwise are just easy to overlook since all you're really doing is flying an airplane and shooting things down and blowing things up.

The whole ""RAMIREZ, DO EVERYTHING!"" in the single player missions gets very boring and very irritating rather fast when you have a squad full of allied AI that could have made it easier for you to do; they only act as depressing filler.

Ace Combat 5 actually did a decent job at making it so you can directly command your wingmates to assist you directly instead of just meandering off on other random tasks while you are expected to carry 90% of the team; this concept dropped since Ace Combat 6. However, this wasn't entirely reliable, which is a shame that it was left that way since then instead of improved upon with Ace Combat 6.

In comparison, Ace Combat 7 really [i]is[/i] a shell of its former self.

Multiplayer experience gets very mid as all you're dealing with are either Team Deathmatch and Battle Royale; I don't exactly know what went thru the development process, but it seems things such as multiplayer co-op, which this game on multiplayer is clearly online-only, wasn't either considered or was put off from the game entirely. The TDM/BR experience is plagued by people who are either already adept or very skilled at flight manoeuvres, or have probably a DLC aircraft or other aircraft with higher agility and better firepower and equipment; late-game issue, I know. This is pretty much where the concept of ""fun"" is instantly sapped out and becomes actually very boring; it doesn't help that hosts generally don't think beyond the norm and choose to make a specific budget out of the planes. It might be better if, like any other multiplayer online game, you're playing this with friends, but good luck finding anyone who actually plays games like this.

The campaign isn't bad, per se, but as I mentioned before, it reinvents the wheel with roughly the same tropes in the Ace Combat series: big bird, big sub, big gun, big cruise missile; get this, get that; main character syndrome. It's... nothing new. Project Aces really needs to start writing up a better storyline than this if they want their next title to actually be more enjoyable, otherwise I don't see any reason why the Ace Combat series should be getting new releases.

Also, I will mention that almost every other character that I've ever come across this game is potentially forgettable and/or wasted potential. It's weird because Nagase is actually the only character I even [i]remember[/i] as she was basically a titular character in Ace Combat 5, Chopper being (I hate to throw him under the bus) an honourable mention. Actually, even then, the dialogue and each character interaction was actually more memorable and meaningful than anything after AC5; your decisions, or lack thereof, had [i]some[/i] level of impact in the overall gameplay and how other characters responded to you. AC7 was incredibly hollow on that front.

A pointer, however, is that while the aircraft tree is interesting, trying to get almost every plane will be a grind/chore, and most planes I do think are [i]not[/i] worth the effort; most either have highly similar traits, are not that great, or have very similar special weapons. Also, the laser gameplay is, as I expected, rather suboptimal: it [i]is[/i] powerful, but having them available on multiplayer other than the pulse laser is pointless, since it's heavily PvP. Even in campaign mode, the laser beam weapon (as I can only bother to call it) is painstakingly difficult to use when almost every threat is a missile that's waiting to eat your arse every five seconds, and you are already in a fast-paced environment where every second and shot [i]literally[/i] counts.

Overall, I guess if you want Ace Combat because silly basic plane game where you shoot shoot and go boom boom, I wouldn't complain. But if you're looking for something that may be better than AC6 or AC5, this isn't it chief.",1697951092,1697951712,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FULL REVIEW
Dont get me wrong, i love this game's campaign but dawg it is not worth 60 bucks. A decent campaign that is barely 10 hours long and thats it. 5 dollars each for a single mission is near scam dlc. yes those missions are quite good but not worth an extra 15 on top of 60.

The multiplayer is impossible to get a grip in as a new player and there is nothing to do but pvp with no real end goal except upgrade parts that cant even be used in the short campaign without a mod. Sure you can replay the story missions to try and get better scores but there is literally nothing else to do except the two mode pvp. Sure having pvp at is pretty sick but there is no reason to keep playing it after getting destroyed by homies who have been playing the pvp since release. you will struggle to get even a few kills without the massive amount of pvp only upgrades.

This game sorely needed some kind of survival or arcade mode like the older games. I do really like the story itself but its not enough to make me come back to this game. Im currently replaying the story right now and im already half way done in 4 hours. Some of these missions arnt fun in the slightest and feel like they just get in the way of the missions after that are much much more entertaining. 

The game play itself is quite good though (like down right perfect in my opinion) dont let my review sway you if thats all you care about. (despite not even being able to use any flight stick for pc, if you dont have a controller, good luck playing this at all.)

Gameplay  8/10
Story  6/10 (its pretty good and well written but the lack of any replayability saddens me) 
Multiplayer as a whole 3/10 (good gameplay if you could keep up, nearly no reason to keep playing other than killing other players.) 
Overall this game is a 5/10. 

I love ace combat so much and have been playing the series since i was like 8 on ps2 but this games lack of content is sad. The well written story does not save it at all. it is really good on the gameplay front. But for 15 dollars. not 60. The diehard fanbase waited 12 years for a game that takes barely 10 hours to complete if even that. I do think you should play this game so im not going to put a thumbs down. The game is far from bad. I just cant justify paying 60 bucks for it.

Ace Combat 7 is a jet-fighting game where you play with modern and/or near-futurish technology.  You play through 20 missions with set-timers and scores or objectives that you need to achieve before you see your next mission through.  As you progress, you unlock real life planes (F14 Tomcat, F16, A10 warthog, etc.) and components you can use to modify your plane, including weapons.  The controls in this game can be set as realistic (roll and pitch on a joystick, yaw on controller bumpers) or simplified (you go where your joysticks points to), but either way I would play with at least a console controller rather than your mouse and keyboard!  

Overall I give the game an 8/10.  I don't feel that AC7 put anything new on the table as far as an Ace Combat game goes, but it had fun and unique missions with graphics that were pleasing to the eye.  I like its premise of being in a war with a neighboring nation but after appearing to shoot down a VIP,  you have been put in a 'penal unit' of fighters to serve your country.  To compare it to AC6 which feels more like an all out war, this game is focused more on special operations.  The story told through the cinematics are alright, I cared a lot more about the chatter in game than out.  I didn't play more than a round in multiplayer, but as of the time of writing I will say it is well populated.

The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",1697701970,1697701970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-  story plot is actually good but it's presentation is just mediocre, boring and sometimes annoying. It will be more entertaining to read about it on wiki than playing through it.
- voice chatter is distracting, annoying and far-fetched. A lot of useless talking, joking and even when some drama happens you just don't care, because of how everything is put together.
- sound is good but put poorly: voice chatter and music always get in a way of explosions and action, and overall, both are feeling like TV noise. Music itself is orchestral but makes 0 impact, it's either too graceful or doesn't fit to what's going on the screen in 99% cases, it's like listening to Beethoven whilst watching 2 men arguing at butcher shop. I've put it to 0 on 11th mission because it was enough for me. I would do that to voice chatters aswell but then I'll miss those remaining 5-10% of plot, since I've lost 90% of that because of poor presentation overall.
- another point to not good sound design: there is no feel to airplane's engines, you can barely hear them, no ""juice"", no drive whatsoever, and thus, speed is translated poorly.
- no option to change controls during missions - you always need to quit the mission and change everything in main menu.
- looks like FOV is fixed to 60 and you have no option to change it, thus, making ""no feeling of speed while flying 2500 KM/H"" situation even worse.
- replays are also made strangely: no view from target perspective, ""fly by"" option is too short and always interrupted by ""fixed outside cockpit"" (or similar) mode and beside that there is only 1 option for that whilst it could be much more like in older games. + again, FOV set to 60 makes it even worse when watching them. So the only thing/place where I could enjoy watching my dogfights is also made poorly.
- gameplay is ok. Yes, repetitive, yes always concludes in making circles around your target until 1 of you is victorious. Instant break feature only makes it worse so I never use it. But despite all of that it plays OKAY which is surprise for me considering all that being said. That's probably because of big variety of weapon arsenal which add some ""juice"" to pretty standard gameplay for such game.",1697629358,1697659369,False,0,1,0.46875,0,True,False,False

Developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment, this installment successfully blends the classic elements that fans love with modern graphics and gameplay innovations.

Graphics and Sound:
One of the standout features of Ace Combat 7 is its breathtaking visuals. The aircraft are meticulously detailed, and the landscapes, from cityscapes to open skies, are rendered with stunning realism. The attention to detail extends to the weather effects, with raindrops streaking across the cockpit during a storm, adding a layer of immersion.

The sound design is equally impressive. The roar of jet engines, the whistling of missiles, and the radio chatter all contribute to the game's atmosphere. The musical score enhances the drama of the aerial battles and complements the narrative beautifully.

Gameplay:
Ace Combat 7 excels in delivering a visceral and enjoyable flight experience. The controls are responsive and intuitive, making it accessible to both veterans and newcomers. The variety of aircraft available, each with its unique characteristics and loadouts, adds depth to the gameplay.

The campaign mode features a compelling story set in the fictional world of Strangereal. The narrative unfolds through a combination of in-game cutscenes and radio communications, giving players a sense of the broader conflict. The mission variety is commendable, ranging from intense dogfights to strategic bombing runs. The difficulty curve is well-balanced, offering a suitable challenge for players of all skill levels.

Ace Combat 7 offers a robust multiplayer mode that lets players engage in thrilling dogfights against opponents from around the world. The competitive multiplayer adds longevity to the game, allowing players to test their skills against human adversaries. The cooperative multiplayer missions are a welcome addition, promoting teamwork and strategic coordination.

A standout feature for PlayStation VR owners is the inclusion of virtual reality missions. This takes the Ace Combat experience to a whole new level, immersing players in the cockpit and providing a genuine sense of scale and speed. The VR missions are a testament to the potential of virtual reality in enhancing gaming experiences.

Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown successfully revitalizes the franchise, delivering a visually stunning and engaging aerial combat experience. The combination of a gripping single-player campaign, robust multiplayer modes, and the immersive VR experience cements its status as a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned pilot or a newcomer to the series, Ace Combat 7 offers a thrilling ride through the clouds and beyond.",1697587523,1697587523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Controls aren't terrible but they're really not the best, I mean people had to make guides on how to make the controls slightly better, that really says it all. Especially compared to previous AC games. Doesn't at all feel like you're flying a fighter jet going 500-5000m/s

Honestly, just play Project Wingman instead [i](if you have to pick between them)[/i]. The devs for Wingman recently returned with a huge 2.0 update and are planning workshop support, mission editors etc. It's just better.

* The third person view lacks information that you need to know how steep your ascent or descent is when you have 0 visibility, so it will lead to a lot of accidental crashing. The cockpit view blocks half your screen. This leaves first person view as the only usable camera.

* Allied planes do nothing and are useless unless the plot decides that they are not, which doesn't happen often.

* The planes designed for ground attack feel like garbage (they made the A-10 bad at attacking ground targets lol). Expect to never need to use anything other than multirole fighters.

* The game later takes IFF away from you and it does so in the shittiest way: Everything will shoot at you until you mark it as an ally. This is compounded by having useless teammates who will not mark anything for you unless the plot demands it and by needing to look at whatever you want to mark by having it dead center in your screen (this results in you needing to dive at ground targets which is likely to cause you to eat missiles/gunfire or crash).

* All escort missions suck either by virtue of being slow or because the IFF issue makes it so you don't know what is going to attack what you're escorting. The game's love of spawning enemies out of thin air often means enemies spawn next to ground escortees when you're far away trying to ID enemies.

* The checkpoint system is supposed to lower frustration but it saves so infrequently that the usual result is that you will have to do half a mission every time instead of the whole thing at once if you die.

* Zero single player replayability unless you're a perfectionist, which also means you have to plan which endgame plane you want since you won't get enough to unlock them all without grinding.",1697248588,1697266767,False,15,2,0.524488747119903564,0,True,False,False

Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't.

Overall enjoyable to play but very short and lacks replay value. It gets the job done but ultimately feels uninspired. Only buy on sale if you are a fan of the series or interested in jets.
 
Here is my rationale:

Too short: There are only 20 missions, most of them can be finished in less than 30 minutes. If you skip cut scenes you can beat this game in less than 10 hours. There isn't much replay value. It's super annoying that it's so short and they want to sell you extra missions as DLC.

Too easy: There are four difficulties: Easy casual, Easy, Normal, Hard. I assumed since there were two easy modes, normal might be pretty tough. Wrong. I played on normal with advanced controls and only got shot down a few times, 90% of my deaths were from hitting obstacles. I'm not a veteran player, my only experience is Ace Combat 4 and that was probably 10 years ago.

Gameplay lacks depth: Ace Combat feels like a shooting gallery most of the time. Enemies are helplessly obliterated before you as your worthless allies tell you how great you are. Allies do basically nothing and you destroy probably 90% of the targets. Essentially they only distract enemies. There should be a wingman system or something where you need to use teamwork. The gameplay is fun if repetitive which makes the lack of missions more problematic.",1696994030,1696994200,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game looks great, the pilot comms create good atmosphere in the heat of battle, likable in-game allies, handling is nice, music awesome as always for AC. A great game to play through once or twice

However, I can't stand Scrap Queen as the character narrator. Just an annoying girlboss archetype which could have been likable if given an actual fleshing-out or given a better reason for being edgy than just straight up saying things such as ""my dad heroically died for his country to save his comrades in a retreat during a war that started by the other country. I hate him"". She's nothing compared to the reporters from 5 and Zero which gave unbiased documentary and investigative atmosphere, and Pixy adding to the intrigue and mystery of the plot. Even the narrator of 4 was MUCH more likable despite the acting being as flat as cardboard, he actually had a direct personal stake and much bigger grievances which grows from wanting revenge on Yellow and into being wow'd by his presence and growing a bond. Scrap Queen's entire existence is just to complain all the time.

No real aces, Mihaly is a joke to be honest. Even his name is a joke because it's like 10 names long, I honestly couldn't tell if Namco was trying to be funny. He's nothing more than a tool for creation of the real enemy, which is just a faceless and no-personality AI cannon fodder that goes rogue so there's never a connection of you, an ace, and an ace's motivations for 90% of the game. He just kinda shows up a couple of times and picks on rookies, I hardly get a sense of him being a scary threat. He even bugs out the first time you fight him just because ""oh no satellites gone"" rather than him taking this opportunity to continue to push his limits like his character implies that he always does. 
This could have been slightly alleviated by giving named ""green target"" aces actual backgrounds just like in Ace Combat Zero, every ace had a story and demise. Here they couldn't be half-a**ed to do that despite the conditions needed for aces to appear being extremely specific or tedious nonsense rather than feeling more naturally occurring like in Zero. Hell, there are only 24 aces compared to Zero's 170! You could go an entire playthrough without seeing a single green ace. 

The [i]special[/i] special weapons are a joke. Seemingly just like every other game that is released in the last 10 years, they have to ""balance"" (read nerfed into uselessness) because of the multiplayer/e-sports mindset of devs/publishers rather than actually making the game fun. For example ""Whoa holy crap AC Zero's legendary TLS and MPBM are in the game!!!"" only to find out that the TLS barely damages anything, hitbox as skinny as a needle. MPBM does pitiful damage-over-time rather than massive burst damage. Even the laser machine guns are almost pointless, the low rate of fire alone should have already been its handicap, but no... the clouds stop them dead in their tracks as well. You know what this game is completely filled with? A lot of clouds. There's almost no reason to choose the ""wonder weapons"" over the conventional weaponry, in fact you probably end up with less damage because of lower ammo count and/or the need for extreme precision... in a game about close-range dogfighting and missile evasions

The plot and resolutions are honestly just bad in the sense of it intertwining with gameplay and story telling.
 I would think the loss of world communications would have a much bigger impact than just a couple of missions where you need to ID the targets or the scientist annoyed he can't do his Steam updates on his drones. How is this major worldwide disaster resolved? Just say ""it is what it is"". 
 Civil wars and terrorism at a global scale on a massive rise? Rename a few targets among other normal targets, and never mention or show what the breakdown of society looks like in the city streets between civilians.
 Belkan scientist that caused all of a world's woes finally cornered? ""Ok I'm good guy now"" after annoying little girl gives a cringe 2-sentence speech about love or something

All of the shortcomings of the old AC games in the eyes of modern gaming could definitely be chalked up to being on old tech, awkward early gaming localization, or not having the modern AAA funding. This game however does not have that excuse as it had the backing of AC vets, internet presence, piles of Namco money (they have official Top Gun DLC for christ's sake), oodles of disk space. This game is honestly only a step up from Ace of Duty Assault Horizon only because it's set in Strangereal and doesn't have Dogfight Mode. I honestly don't have high hopes for Ace Combat 8 because after 20 years of the PS2 trilogy it's more than likely that most of the staff those games fell under are probably retired",1696988695,1696988695,False,7,0,0.52890700101852417,0,True,False,False

Much like a family or a tight knit community: even if we go each our way we'll still have a sense of kinship and belonging; I can't help but cheer the team on, when they say they're working on the next 3 games already!

I've followed the series since I was just a kid way back in the 90's. My dad was the one who introduced me to the series, while also having finished the second game before me.

The first game I tried was Ace Combat 2 and later Ace Combat 3, these were amazing. Especially Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere.

But I didn't get a chance to try the rest of the games from 4 to X since I couldn't afford a PS2, PSP or PS3 at that time in life, but later I did get an Xbox 360 to play Ace Combat 6(wow!), the feeling of losing everything in the beginning of the game hit me hard, since my parents lost both their house and company back in the late 2000's, I could truly associate with the emotions being felt at that moment in the game. Then the feeling of mastery and heroism later on became intoxicating, Ace Combat 6 was truly underrated.

The game then became my favorite for many many years, comforting through hard times such as moving to a new town, entering new schools and being less popular than most, and frozen out. I could still have the sense of mastery and heroism through Ace Combat 6. It kept me going when the going got tough. (Nowadays I'm working in Design and Commissioning in a big firm)

But picture the look on my face when I played Assault Horizon... yikes. I was very disappointed with the direction the game was headed(rail-shooter in the skies), then I later tried Ace Combat Infinity at my friend's house on their ps3, I was so happy so see the original format for gameplay and mechanics very much back in action. It gave me hope that I may get to see the true form of Ace Combat once again.

Lo and behold I had my faith fully restored with Ace Combat 7, they returned to their roots while establishing a new platinum standard.

You cannot go wrong with Ace Combat, most of the time.

Aside from no widescreen support or PCVR integration, [b] this game will not disappoint! [/b]

Despite my disappointment with the previous installment, the overwhelming praise from the franchise's fans convinced me to give this one a try, even purchasing it at its launch.

Let's start with the story. Although it is a significant improvement over Assault Horizon, it fell short of my expectations. The narrative had its moments and introduced interesting characters, but I found it to be oddly told, leaving me somewhat disconnected from the events unfolding. The constant references to states, places, and various elements left me confused most of the time, and I struggled to comprehend the motivations of different parties involved. While my lack of familiarity with the previous games might have contributed to this, I believe the game should accommodate newcomers as well, especially since it's only the second title in the series to have a PC release. Furthermore, the lack of a visible protagonist, their silence, and lack of personality made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the story. The one-sided radio communications, where other characters interact with the silent protagonist, didn't sit well with me, as I prefer more engaging interactions in games. To clarify, I don't mean to say that the story is bad, but it could have been executed better. On a positive note, the cinematics were well-done and added to the overall experience.

Moving on to the graphics, they are undeniably stunning. The game boasts beautiful scenery, an amazing sky, and impressive effects. However, I couldn't help but feel a bit let down by the ground terrain textures, which seemed low-resolution in comparison to the other aspects of the game.

Now, onto the gameplay, which I can confidently say was perfect this time. Despite my initial disinterest in this genre, I had an absolute blast playing Ace Combat 7. The sense of accomplishment from successful kills was incredibly rewarding, and I thoroughly enjoyed the controls and flying mechanics, finding them to be smooth and responsive. This held true for both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. While I don't envision spending an extensive amount of time in the multiplayer aspect, I can understand why many players would be drawn to it.

For achievement hunters: the game has 49 achievements. I am planning to do them all sometime in the near future, but from what I've heard it is not an easy task. I will come back with an edit.

In conclusion, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown proved to be an enjoyable experience for me, despite my reservations about the story and certain graphical aspects. The exceptional gameplay ultimately won me over, turning me into a fan of the franchise. If you're willing to overlook the minor shortcomings and are seeking a thrilling flight combat experience, this game is undoubtedly worth playing.

This game is definitely not a traditional Ace Combat game. It will be a waste of money and a horrible experience if you buy this game expecting that.

This game also copied segments from Battlefield 4's China Rising dlc and has the commanding operators always treating you like a piece of trash for no reason. It's like the Shogun or World War 2 era of Japan embedded into a game where the superior officers always act arrogant and just act like trash.

I have never played another game that literally made me want to remove it from my account and waste $20 like this game did.

Valve refused to give a refund because I ""played"" the game for 10 hours on hard difficulty with many retries. I didn't even beat half of the game and yet I am denied a refund because I might have beaten the game in 10 hours or some garbage logic like that. So I was forced to remove the game from the account and throw $20 in the trash because I refuse to be a walking billboard for this game being listed as being owned or played on Steam.

For those whom are not familiar with aviation and have not been consumed by it's allure this can be a very mundane question. In creation of Ace Combat there is one feeling that it portrays better than any, that feeling of what it was like to imagine being a fighter pilot as a little kid in a living room or outside playing pretend with a toy model of an aircraft. Whether that toy was a folded piece of paper, a cheap piece of plastic that looks like it came from an off-branded star fox, or a $500 model of a MiG-29, you had one feeling in mind, to soar the skies and feel that unrivaled feeling of freedom, to feel cool, to feel unrivaled, to feel like an ACE. This game became the major comeback of a franchise that had forgotten how to give you that feeling. Ace Combat 7 became that shine of light in the dark for those looking for not a realistic flight sim but a fun one that is unrivaled in terms of letting the player have fun with its absurd lore, concepts, and physics.

 Please go and watch this video by Timmm called ""Ace Combat is a simulator, but not of Reality"" Many of the things I have said in this review are reflected by his video. I've always loved Ace Combat but he managed to put into words how I have struggled to explain my love of Ace Combat and he deserves more exposure for his content as a smaller youtuber with quality content.

 When I look to the sky I think back to those days of imagining flying around shooting down aircraft, pulling seemingly impossible, death defying maneuvers, to soar up and up watching the world get smaller in the blink of an eye. Regardless of which color the sky is, it brings me back to that moment of blissful simplicity. That is what the color of the sky means to me. That is what Ace Combat means to me. Now i'll ask you...

At the very least, this seems to be limited to the few bosses in the game. Most other planes behave largely alright.

Level gimmicks can range from challenging and fun to just plain annoying. But that's the nature of gimmicks, it can be hit or miss depending on the player. YMMV.

I'm of a split mind here. I'd review this as neutral tending towards negative - the game's pretty, it's got fairly decent customisations, but the annoying bits of the game (overuse of gimmicks, physics-breaking enemies) really detract from the enjoyability of the game. I find only a few missions are actually fun - the bossfights range from frustrating to ridiculous.

Any fights involving Sol Squadron in particular are irritating, as these guys can accelerate and decelerate well beyond whatever the player can do. Same goes for either of the end four boss fights on the last mission.

First air combat sim game that I've played. The controls takes some time to get used to at the start. But once it ""clicked"", damn it feels good to control. I recommend to use the other control scheme, not the default one at start, as it gives you better control of the plane. And Maybe try starting on Normal, if you really have a hard time, then switch to easier modes.

I played about 3~5 missions on third person perspective, I've eventually settled on first person (not cockpit view, some planes have very bad view of the sky).

I know it's more ""arcadey"", but I think this is a good game for people who want to play air combat sims for the first time.

I first thought this is a casual  flight game more into the arcade direction but is just made stupidly difficult, so that the fun factor slowly but surely faded away for me.

Why think at a more engaging manner to make the game more difficult when you can just add stupidly short timers to complete missions and create a strong anxiety which will take all the fun away from the game?

Why to create challenging situations where you need to think when they can just stress you with the irrational timer EACH mission, and all this on ""normal"" level of difficulty.

The games combat holds through and through in each very specific but seemingly necessary story mission and after a full run of single player you ""should"" have enough of a grip on how the game functions to hop into a multiplayer lobby and play with other players.

In addition to that, there is a mission where there is a speed gate for your aircraft where if you brought a slower aircraft due to the misleading mission briefing you're given beforehand, you would just not be able to complete the second half of the mission.

For example that when the enemy contact is at 45 degrees relative bearing, it does not get into a corner, as circle has no corners. Why did they not go for a triangle? Would it not be even more ""fun""?

For example the radar interface, it can not be worse, in mission 17, bombers are approaching the island, as always game has the time factor as a major difficulty agains you, do this in this time window or fail.  So the bombars are approaching they are all indentifyed but impossible to select some of them as targets, as the nearest so called more detailed radar view is so cluster fucked, impossible to understand what echo is what and impossible to select the enemy with target selection key, they key cycle only around dummy air targets not the bombers. It becomes frustration at some time, as guy who has 30 years in simulation game, fewer air combat games gave me this frustration. This game is more for the controller / console / arcade masses, cause they will accept what they see, but when you have all the experience this game is trying to fly an aircraft with chop sticks instead of sidestick, or a flight yoke.

Time is UP, mission failed ! And fk you who ever decided on mission timer. Extremely annoying and difficult due to mission timer and spawns of enemy which you did not know before. Also it is again annoying that all the enemy airforce is picking you up with missiles, so it is missile, missile ... missile non-stop at some point.

Very impressive graphics and artwork, very good cutscenes and cinematics.

Aside from beautiful cinematic graphics and artwork, there is so much to be desired, sometimes unclear mission objectives, dumb friendly ai, dumb checkpoint save system / yet I have not seen any checkpoints that helped me to save some time, it mostly starts over.

This is a difficult game to evaluate, very annoying at times, but beautiful and nice arcade flight which somehow  capture the feeling of air combat.

The few annoyances just lowers my game score to 7.5/10 but the difficulty makes it hard to recommend time to time cause some missions so annoying.

The Good:
[list]
[*]The aircraft handle very well
[*]Classic Ace Combat mission progression
[*]Introduction of new gameplay mechanics (clouds, wind currents and storms) that don't change the whole identity of the game
[*]The OST
[*]Aircraft Tree and upgrade system
[*]Story and dialogues are cheesy, with plenty of fanservice, following into the footsteps of previous games
[*]Game runs well
[/list]

The Bad:
[list]
[*]Lacking SP content, besides different difficulties (which are less in number than AC6), there's no extra modes after you finish the campaign
[*]Lacking MP content, there's only two modes (DM and TDM), no co-op
[*]MP is very meta-driven and unbalanced. Furthermore, bombers and multi-role aircraft are essentially rendered obsolete, due to the MP modes being only about dogfights
[*]Graphics are good, but not breathtaking. Especially in the texture department
[*]S-Rank criterias are unclear
[*]Low-tier aircraft will always be low-tier (even with the best parts equipped; #BuffF4-E)

The campaign is good, but I was dissapointed by the game in the MP department.
I was hoping for co-op missions in a similar style to AC Infinity, but instead we only got two basic modes with no reason to ever use any kind of planes besides fighters.",1549290281,1694641591,True,23,0,0.576690733432769775,2,True,False,False

If you ever wanted to know how Top Gun would look like as an anime, play this game and you'll have an idea.
 To be completely honest, I've never thought I'd like this game as much as I did. The only experience I have with ""fighter jet"" games are Top Gun on NES and River Raid on Atari xD. 
But man, I had a lot of fun with this one. It's completely arcade and SF. The main plot considers if AI will overtake real pilots in the future, there are huge ground railguns, enormus planes carrying hundreds of drones, fighter jet drones etc. There are also many well directed cut scenes and briefings.  
However, the best part of this game, for me, is the soundtrack. It's godlike. Absolutely perfectly fits the game and is one of the best soundtrack in a video game. Also the graphics  are excellent, especially cloud simulation and simulation of weather effects. In addition to that, the game is very well optimized. I could run it with 40–60 FPS on an integrated Vega 8 graphics card in 1600x900 resolution. 
To sum up, I bought it on sale and thought that will play one mission or so per day. It turned out that I've finished it in a few days, playing several missions in succession. I hope they will make more AC games in the future.",1694638097,1694638097,True,0,0,0.496239930391311646,0,True,False,False

I had played Project Wingman (A game similar to Ace Combat) for a while and caught this while it was on sale. For the price I paid, a little over $10, I'd say it was well worth the price. The story is pretty concise and fun, it isn't a masterclass in writing or surprise but it doesn't have to be. The characters are pretty likable, though the goals of everyone by the end of the story seems a little confusing, but even still playing the game feels rewarding as your reputation slowly builds mission after mission. If anything I'd say the campaign is actually too short. I think to be a really great one it could have gone on for another 3-4 mission. Not only that but the main antagonists of the game feel sort of lackluster. Mihaly seems like a really cool character and I enjoyed the multiple dog-fights you have with him, but his defeat feels really out of place and just thrown in with very little resolve. I like the idea of drone fighters too, but the launching of the two really good ones at the end doesn't seem to have any consequence other than to push the story just a little bit further in order to feel just that more over-the-top. Other than that I don't have many complaints with the story, it has it's problems, but so does every other story from any other game, I think Ace Combat 7 excels in its gameplay. From someone who's only other flight-focused game was Project Wingman this game was very different feeling. It still had arcade-y controls, but the system felt a lot more developed than PW's. For example, I was able to, and still am able to, enjoy and play PW's story to completion using nothing but mouse and keyboard. On the other hand, Ace Combat 7's opening mission and subsequent other missions felt almost IMPOSSIBLE to beat with just mouse and keyboard, so much so that I ended up plugging in a control during the second mission just to play. That being said, the controller controls feel a lot better and smoother too. I genuinely enjoyed the game with a control so if you don't have one I'd heavily suggest purchasing one. Other than that I have nothing more to say, I haven't played the Multiplayer, nor have I played the DLC, and I haven't maxed out the Flight Skill Tree but there are a large number of planes and upgrades to look forward to buying while playing the game casually that by the end of a single playthrough you should be able to max out one part of the tree and about half of another.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, bias on the table, I'm an old-school Ace Combat fanboy, but I'm gonna try to judge this game as objectively as possible. 

Personally, I think its just OK. A 7/10, or a 3.5/5 or whatever scale you prefer. Not bad, but not great. It's not for lack of trying, though. While this game doesn't quite match my personal favorite Ace Combat games ever, those being Ace Combat 5 and Ace Combat Zero, it does come surprisingly close. There are only really two things holding this game back. 

First problem pertains to story. Certain elements of 7's story are a bit weak and under-explained, or just outright weird. And the game tends to lean a bit too far into nostalgia for previous entries, particularly 5. Nothing too egregious or blatantly nostalgia-baiting, but it does come across as distracting how much the game references or uses elements, locations, or plot points from previous entries. Makes it feel like the game can't really stand on its own, which, I think, is a major flaw. It also kinda suffers from being a ""bridge game"". No spoilers, here, for obvious reasons, but the game's ending kinda implies an Ace Combat 8, should one ever happen, will have a pretty radical paradigm shift to it, so, yeah.

The second problem is the music. That isn't to say the soundtrack is bad. It isn't. The vast majority of the music is perfectly solid, nothing extraordinary, but nothing terrible. But when you compare AC7's soundtrack to, say, the soundtracks from AC0 or AC5, its not even close. ""Daredevil"" is a great little track in isolation, but compare it to ""The Unsung War"" from AC5 or ""Zero"" from AC0 and it doesn't even compare. I still get chills listening to ""The Unsung War"". ""Daredevil"" has just never hit me that same way. It's a real shame too, because it feels like it had the potential to get there.

On the upside, though, the gameplay feels stellar and the graphics are lovely. Easily the best Ace Combat has ever looked and even the most hefty and laborous planes feel great to fly. There's a great mission variety in the campaign too, and a lot of replay value if you're the type to grind for higher scores or hunt down the rare aces in each level. There's a great range of DLC planes and skins too, including a collaboration with TOP GUN: Maverick, which is genuinely fuckin' sick. The Darkstar plane from that DLC is insanely fast and very fun to use. Highly recommend, if you're interested!

Overall, Ace Combat 7 is a solid game, but as a continuation of the Ace Combat franchise, it falls just shy of true greatness, for me at least. Its still easily worth the price, especially on sale, and the DLC is pretty good too, if you've got the money to burn, but its nothing ground-breaking or a definitive ""must-buy"".",1694348467,1694348467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat mechanics excel in terms of engagement and entertainment value, warranting a score of 9/10. While the campain possesses its merits, it is marred by numerous instances that lack coherence: 7/10.

The multiplayer mode provides an exhilarating experience; however, it is accompanied by subpar communication features. With offerings such as Battle Royale and Team Deathmatch, featuring five to six enjoyable maps, it would have undoubtedly benefited from the inclusion of a cooperative mode: 8/10.

While the game has a solid foundation, it doesn't quite reach its full potential. However, I must admit that I genuinely enjoyed it. The game managed to surprise me with numerous thrilling moments, and the overall experience it provides is quite impressive.

-Super pretty, plane models look (mostly) badass, Some of the models look pretty janky when you first unlock them and it does the close in glamour shots.  The Rafael springs to mind.  The refueling probe looks like it's a grand total of 4 polygons...  probably only meant to be seen in close up the one time though...

-Controls are simple, whether you're using advanced mode or basic mode. Game feels like CoD in a fighter jet. Some sort of haptic feedback to speed inputs would be wonderful though. Without looking directly at your HUD, it can be very hard to manage your closure and not overshoot.

-It is arcadey goodness, nothing more, nothing less. (Try to) Shelve your ""flight sim"" expectations at the door and try not to pick up any bad habits that translate to DCS :D

-Yay, Top Gun aircraft!  I've watched the movie 14 times, so of course I wanted the DLC.

-Oh look, an F18E!  And another one with padded stats!

-Whizzing into the AO in the dark star, dropping a single bomb, and being gone before anyone can even lock you is super entertaining, if very very inefficient for beating campaign missions.

-Ran buttery smooth, well done on the optimization Bandai Namco! *side-eyes Bethesda*  Seriously, not. one. single. hiccup, crash, slowdown, freeze.  Nada. Zip. Zero.  *applauds*  If only every gaming studio produced as polished of a product.

And now cons (aviation pun intended)

-DLC aircraft are fun, but make the campaign super unbalanced initially.

-Then the AI bosses show up, and the unbalance switches in the other direction.  Now AI bosses can accelerate at ridiculous speeds and put 4000 *units* of whatever they measure in game with between you and them, turn around, and bake you with a super laser instantly.  ""Watch where his nose is pointing"" says the AWACS.  Hard to do when he's barely a red and black pixel on my monitor...

Also, the entire time you're trying to focus and fly a sortie, every single civilian numbskull is expositioning in your ear. I do not need to hear someone *grunting with effort* over comms during the most difficult dogfight in the game. Don't get me wrong, there's some tactical chatter... but there's a whole lot more blah blah blah from characters I've already forgotten about who aren't even in the air.  SHUDDUP WOULD YA!

Cinematics in between missions are excruciatingly long and long-winded to the ADHD prone like myself. I'd watch about 2 minutes of the cinematic and smash the start button as soon as the ""I don't care"" came along. I'm not even sure I could piece together the entire story tbh...  It was forgettable at best.  But that's like reading certain types of magazines for the articles...

Having played plenty of DCS and a few other sims, I realize most of my gripes stem from this not being as Simmy as I would like. For example:

-Stall mechanics, instead of just *not* generating lift like a real aircraft would, causes you to violently steer directly into the ground, as if you gave it the control input to do so. It's a built in self-unalive button for flying like a granny, apparently.
-Couple that with the energy management challenges you have to do in order to stay behind super drones that basically have VTOL, in close confines, and it results in a lot of really annoying crashes, 40 minutes into a dogfight that hasn't has a checkpoint yet.
- I heard SCP5K has a problem with not having checkpoints too.
- Did I mention checkpoints?  More of them.
-Some aircraft can go faster than 3000.  I have no idea what 3000 means, but it's the number in your hud...  It feels really fast, until the AI outruns you by a factor of 6.
- using a controller when I have the option of over 1000$ worth of Virpil flight stuff is just gross. I don't need to use all of my buttons, just let me map the 12 or so basic button presses and do my thing???  The thrustmaster options are awful... sry not sry.

I realize my complaints here are a personal problem, and it's hardly enough for me to regret buying the game for 20$ on sale and beating it over the weekend. It was entertaining, but strives to be waaaaaaay too story rich in a game with no real rhyme or reason except blow sh*t up.

TL/DR, if you're looking for a Sim, this ain't it. If you're looking to scratch a Battlefield style Air Superiority itch, this'll probably do it.  You're probably going to be way in over your head in multiplayer, because you're way behind the curve if you're starting now, and real world BFM is pretty useless.  But it makes you feel like you're going fast and there's lots of dopamine on a steady drip.  Get it on sale and it's even better.",1694315879,1694316177,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the only other ace combat game ive played im pretty sure was the belkan war.

and i was like 10 or something i hardly remember it.

this game is absolutely worth the money. ( although i got it for 8 something dollars)

loved the story the graphics during the cut scenes rival Final Fantasy.  and the gameplay grpahics are still very good imo.

everything about it was fantastic. 5/5

100% buy it, on sale not on sale you can waste your 40$ or so on something way worse.

The campaign is fun for all of five missions. Most of it is a slog, and artificial difficulty with scripted invulnerability for major enemies isn't fun either. The story is pretty mediocre as well. The gameplay is also mediocre. Everything that was fun about past Ace Combat games has been stripped away. No wingman mechanics, no diverging story, but you can do backflips so that's cool I guess. It's like they deliberately didn't add all the nice things that have been in the game since Ace Combat 5, but all the build-up for having a functional squadron is still there in the dialogue and story. Why bother being part of a squadron at all if you're just a lonewolf who doesn't cooperate with anyone? Also, your allies don't have working missiles anyway. They are nerfed to the point of being useless, so any missiles shot by allies are just for show. This is not a bug. This was done on purpose.

Does the game redeem itself with multiplayer? No. Project Aces was by far the laziest with this.

The multiplayer is dead. Assume you find a lobby, it will have a hacker because this game has no anti-cheat. Assume you get no hackers, you get two boring gamemodes; free for all, and team death match, and you get five maps to play them on. I think. Really, they're all the same except that one level with the cliffs that you can fly through. That's the only map with any character. Except, the fun is suddenly lost because RNG lightning hits you every few seconds and screws up your screen.

There are no cooperative gamemodes at all. Allegedly, the engine can't handle rendering other enemies... even though they could have literally just re-used the same engine as Assault Horizon like they did with Infinity.

Ace Combat: Infinity was better, but they shut it down, so you can't play that anymore at all. I fear this marks the beginning of the end of a franchise I have loved.

""Sure when VR comes out that will be cool,"" I said years ago. VR is never coming. Ever. Project Wingman made a better game, and I said that long before I ended up being a part of it, so that's not my own bias speaking.

This game has no replayability. Even the one play through sucks. I loved this franchise, but I will not be buying the next one if it even lasts that long.",1549156402,1693970889,False,0,0,0.434782594442367554,2,True,False,False

You get a wide variety of planes to choose from, with the aircraft tree splitting into three routes, American jets, Russian jets, and EU jets. Getting new planes and armament for those planes can feel a bit overwhelming at first but don't worry about trying to get every plane and just focus on one tree. I will say that I think BamCo is going a little nutso-mode with the DLC for AC7 but I suggest getting the ones that bring DLC missions.

As a result, it can cause a TON of frustration (if all you expect is extremely simplistic arcade plane game where you press a button and stuff goes BOOM! I know I expected that and was shocked to find out it's not THAT simple... although once you learn to fly well enough, it's exactly that - you press a button, stuff goes BOOM! with fancy explosions and nice graphics). Sounds is pretty decent, too, and I've encountered no software issues, crashes or performance issues, in this regard everything's well.

At first I didn't like the game. As I said, I had a lot of trouble with certain missions (most missions after third, I think). I kept losing despite playing on easy difficulty, I crashed a whole lot, I failed objectives a lot more than I crashed and overall I did not like the game. It was HARD! It seemed like the game was made in a way that caused a ton of annoyance.

After some 30-40 hours (there are some fun parts in the game so I kept on playing), after beating the entire campaign on easy, then on normal, and then going after every Ace and shooting them all down I finally learned to fly a little. I started my ""hard"" playthrough (for the achievement!) I managed to get S rank for the first 8 missions (without even trying!). I also shot down all aces before that, I guess knowing their spawn conditions and how to approach certain missions helped a lot. Overall, now I'm finally having fun playing the campaign. After switching to ""normal"" controls (from expert). I thought I knew how to fly a plane on expert controls from playing a lot of similar games and BOY was I wrong!

Basically: I can recommend this game if you:
- are a fan of series, know how to play Ace Combat series, what to expect and you like it
- are open to new experiences and are not easily frustrated when things don't go your way from the very start (that's me!), and are ready to put forth effort to learn the game, learn the missions and win conditions and adapt (that's also me! although these two sides are in constant conflict)

In short: after suffering through first 10 hours and playing for 30+ hours I finally like this game and can recommend it, as long as you know what to expect!",1690190691,1693593575,True,0,0,0.489272624254226685,0,True,False,False

Overall it's a great arcade flight game if that's what you're looking for.

5. Even completing campaign missions on normal difficulty can feel impossible at times, and paying them real money for better planes will solve that issue for you
6. The campaign is literally the only single player content it has, if you want more content, better pay up!

Ace Combat 7 is by far one of the best air combat games that you can play. Now with that said it's no DCS, But that doesn't mean it's not fun. I have play through the game 2 times on pc and Xbox. The controls are very simple to get used to (With context needed). I would recommend playing with a controller, as I have tried with mnk and it's not quite as natural and it has a huge learning curve. The game play is amazing. The missions are thought out and you get the story in a manner that makes it easier to take in then some titles. The aircraft models are relatively accurate. I can't shame the game or studio on that front as I understand hoe the government(s) are with things of that nature. I got the game on sale during Christmas 22, and I got a version with more DLC but it doesn't change the game play in a matter where it's too much pay to have fun. You can get the base edition and have the exact same amount of fun. What I would say is that for anyone who has this on the wish list or in cart and can't pull the trigger I would say wait till its on sale and you won't regret it. 

Overall: Ace Combat 7 is a fun arcade air combat game that at full price I would say is worth it. Con(s): Getting new aircraft can take a bit of time. First play through you can get decently far in the progression tree but you will have to play through like 2-3 times if not more to get all the aircraft and upgrades/parts. It's a niche con but there's only 2 real air to ground main missions, I feel like more missions with more air to ground combat. (There's 20 total missions). Pros: Easy to learn, Aircraft variety, Story/story telling, Characters, Combat, Ability to return to the game after a long period of time and being able to get right back into it without needing to re-learn controls.",1693267058,1693267058,True,0,0,0.461538463830947876,0,True,False,False

Bandai Namco did everything they could to make Ace Combat 7 a top title and they succeeded.
The variety in missions is huge and in terms of graphics and audio, Ace Combat 7 is one of the flight combat titles on PC.

Watch a short gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrngIJjkrSc

The story is a bit faded, but that won't stop you from getting a lot of fun out of the game.
The length of the missions can vary enormously. There are missions that can be completed in five to ten minutes, but there are also 20 to 25 minutes. It is often difficult to predict in advance how long you will be working on a mission. Fortunately, there are checkpoints. If you make a mistake, you don't have to redo the whole mission. But… these checkpoints are sometimes very far apart.

The game works great on a steam deck too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feNkWRXlk0M

Each mission takes place in a different setting, so you're always anxiously awaiting what's to come.
What also makes you want to keep playing this game are the graphics and the sound.
You really often stand with your mouth open looking at the fantastically designed aircraft, the various types of terrain and the clouds.
Dynamic weather conditions sound nice on the back of the packaging, but the great thing is that it really adds something in Ace Combat 7. When you fly into the clouds your visibility is reduced to five meters and your cockpit is covered with rain and/or ice, but your enemies can't see you (and vice versa of course).

The Ace Combat series has developed over time from a fun game to a full-fledged Combat Flight Action Video Game that also forces you to think about the use of fighter jets.
There is also a nice multiplayer option that provides variety. If that wasn't enough, the many options in the tech tree give you plenty of options to complete each mission to the best of your ability.",1665795716,1693232678,True,34,4,0.747066020965576172,1,True,False,False

Speaking of physics, this is the first game where you can intentionally initiate post-stall maneuvers. Unfortunately there's almost never a reason to do so since you need to slow waaaay down to do it. That sucks.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",1692503596,1692503596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're a hardcore PC Flight Sim player, this game probably isnt for you. If you've never touched the original Air Combat/Ace Combat games (outside of Assault Horizon) you may not enjoy it as much. To each their own. If you expect to play this with mouse + keyboard or a high-end flightstick...you're gonna have a bad time.

As of this review  I only have an hour and a half (starting mission 4). 
My specs- 
Intel 3930K 6-core@3.8Ghz
16GB DDR3 RAM
1TB 7200RPM HDD + 2TB 7200RPM SSHD
Gigabyte Windfore OC GTX 1070 8GB GPU
Xbox One wired USB controller/ bluetooth XBone S w/ Steam Link
 Ive seen all the negative comments and nasty discussion boards. DON'T LET THESE DETER YOU!!!
If your gaming rig is half decent, and you have a USB joystick controller available, you can play this. I've suffered no issues whatsoever running it on high settings. 

The gameplay itself is a mixture of AC 6 and Zero, there are no squadron controls like those in 5 or zero. The hangar layout is exactly like Zero, including special weapon selection. The Aircraft tree system includes aircraft, special weapons, and also upgrades that can be added to aircraft via slots. The story in the cut scenes follows that of an NPC rather than the protagonist, as well as one of the main antagonists, the first being similar to AC 6 and the latter more like AC 4. 
The Launch edition pre-order package came with the Phantom II pre-unlocked, as well as 3 additional aircraft skins. Of these was the Su-37: Yellow 13 from AC 4,  F-15C: Pixy from AC Zero,and AC 5 Razgriz  F14-D, so far my favorite.
If I find any issues later in the game Ill update this review. So far, Namco and Proj. Aces have done a Damn good job IMO.

Update: I finished the campaign and i gotta say, the character development improved a lot.
My only complaint thus far is that the online multiplayer seems pretty empty whenever I jump on. Hopefully the DLCs fix that.

Update 1-4-2020: Finally started playing again, but I have one major complaint: Runs like piss via steamlink over wifi. Even in Campaign missions on balanced settings. I suspect it may be something in windows 10 (have a new pc as of this update) or 1 of the 18-20 steamlink client updates I had to install before playing. This probably isn't the game's fault, but it is annoying.

Update 8-13-2023:
Having not touched this game in a while, building a new PC since the last update here and having purchased the Alicorn DLCs (as well as completing Project Wingman) I decided it's time to return to this game. For recording purposes I did have to drop the settings a bit and I didn't bother with steamlink, game still looks great on 1440 x 2560 @ 120 fps (with a 1080 ti).  Main complaint I have now is the lack of a discount on 
 or second season pass for all the 25th anniversary + Top Gun Maverick content... almost $60 USD combined as of updating this review, with the latest of these already a year old at this point. Come on Bandai-Namco...cut us a break. Or atleast remaster Fire of Liberation :/",1549000992,1691959497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You get a pretty decent fun Pearl Harbor experience, now I understand why the Japanese did it.
Some narrow flight between the valleys, a jolly good time that gets your heart pumping.
Buy it now especially when it's on sale, it's basically a steal. Can't say the same with full price, but I'm cheap so that's that. Even at half price, it's pretty worth.

I tried everything I could to get my hands on the subsequent releases but due to me living in a 3rd world country and rather young age at the time (I think I was 8 or 9 back then? Can't quite remember), it was next to impossible for me to get a hold of anything else due to either monetary reasons or just because the games and consoles they used were too old at that point. Despite all those setbacks, I finally got my second chance at fulfilling that nostalgia in the way of Ace Combat 07: Skies Unknown (AC7). I played it on a shitty laptop barely hitting 30 fps on low settings but I finished nonetheless and all that's left for me to do is kill all the Aces in Ace difficulty. Tbh, this is more of love letter to Project Aces than a Review because now that I can finally pay for things myself, I will buy every Project Aces game that belongs to the Ace Combat franchise.

I have minimal experience playing Flight simulator games, my only other experience being Xbox 360's H.A.W.X, (And with a flight stick no less). 
That said, I found the story to be typically Shonen, something that was made and wrapped up with a good level of emotions involved. The gameplay is everything that one could expect, providing two options, a Starfox style turn in the direction you want ""Simple"" Control style, and a Typical Flight simulator ""Complex"" Style. The added bonuses unleashed over free updates and the expanded flight tree provides a fantastic slew of options to earn your way to amazing planes and fantastic weapons. 
Truly an Ace in a genre like Flying games. 


I'd give the game an overall 8/10.

I cant express how happy I am to see a childhood franchise, not only being still made, but being made well and passionately. 

The short of this game is that you are playing basically Japanese TopGun with great English VA and fun (all be it simple and bit arcade-y by design) combat. The story? Umm well something about a country trying to take over your homeland and you have to defend it. 

My biggest complaint is that you suffer from a case of ""Main Character Syndrome"" where basically it feels like you are the only semi-competent air force pilot in the entire army. Your wing men generally have some plot armor and cant be shot down and down enemies at a snails pace. Unfortunately this means allied units function more as a distraction force then anything else. I wish I knew more about some of them. Gave me more of a reason to care about them.

Such a brilliant game, especially when picked up on the sale with all the DLC (Top Gun aircraft and special aircraft and missions).
I cannot recommend this game highly enough, it's even fantastic on the Steam Deck, holding a stable 40 fps while still looking great.
I need to find and kill all the ""special"" aircraft and obtain all the aircraft and skins, but I was selective (based on personal bias) on which aircraft and weapons to unlock.
I'm a JAS 39 Gripen fan, I'd like some more Swedish aircraft (Viggen? Tunnan?) instead of the majority of US aircraft, but still, a very challenging game on hard difficulty, a nice ""milk run"" on normal and easy.

I have played every Ace Combat released on console since Ace Combat 2. Namco learned a lot about making a quality Ace Combat game over the years and I don't think they applied any of that to this game.

STORY
I know Namco can do engaging stories, I remember the ending of Ace Combat 4 with its epic music and how it made you feel like you were a real Ace ready to end the war and the sense of urgency during the Search & Rescue mission from Ace Combat 5. Those missions really got me invested in the story, but there is none of that here. The story is confusing and not at all engaging and I found myself being bored by the cut scenes. Plot points feel contrived, pointless, and predicable. 

FLYING
I could forgive a lot if the flying was good, but my god how do you mess this up. I initially thought that clouds, weather, and terrain would be a nice addition to the tactics, but it’s just annoying after the first 3 missions. Clouds just blocked my own missiles and made hitting enemies harder, you’re not going to dive into the clouds to shake a missile, plus staying in them too long just makes your plane ice up (like we haven’t figured out plane deicing over half a century ago). There is some kind of modeled weather that can randomly take away the precision I needed by introducing wind, I guess? It always seems to happen when I needed that precision the most, like when I was flying through a radar net or I needed to hold the targeting pod on a silo while getting shot at by an AA gun as my wingman watches on and does nothing as the timer ticks down the last few sounds of the mission, which leads me to difficulty. 

DIFFICULTY
The game isn’t ‘challenging’ hard, its ‘annoying’ hard. I want missions that are a challenge and perhaps require a thought about tactics and give me that since of accomplishment when you beat them. This game, however, just finds ways to make the missions as painful and annoying as possible. When I finally beat them, I didn’t feel like I had accomplished anything, it was mostly just “thank god that’s over with.” Namco found several ways to make missions more annoyingly difficult like marking all targets as unknown until they randomly decide to mark them as enemies, hiding threats on escort missions until you get close to them, not showing you the health or status of friendlies your suppose to protect, and adding in “weather” to mess up your ability to fly through tight spaces in missions that require you to fly through tight spaces. Enemies in the air will sometimes dodge missiles for no other reason than F-you.

GAMEPLAY
The AI in the game is horrendous. The game was telling me to shoot down drones to protect the other friendly squadron but at one point one of the enemy drones was just flying in formation with the friendly squadron while I race from one side of the map to the other listening to them scream on the radio ""he's on my six."" Many of the missions have almost a dozen friendly aircraft in the air with you. You don’t get to give them orders and they don’t help you out at all. I watched as a friendly fighter would fire a missile at a SAM site, watch the missile explode, and nothing happens. 
On the first playthrough I ran into a few missions that are just unnecessarily hard for no reason other than it was my first playthrough and I didn’t have the special weapons I needed unlocked for them. Without the right parts unlocked there are more than a few missions where I just ran out of missiles by the time I got to the obvious boss I knew was coming and all I could do was just crash and reload at the check point to restock. 
This game adds terrain and weather as more of a thing, but it sacrifices the size of the skybox to do it. I remember the fun of being engaged in an air to ground fight in previous games only to hear the alert to intercept bombers coming in at 30,000 ft and the trill of racing up as the sky turned a darker blue and getting into a high-altitude dog fight with the escorts. In this game they tried the same thing but with the smaller skybox they were flying at 8,000 feet and it just didn’t work. To me this made it feel like you were fighting in a confined space where dogfighters are too close to the ground, and it doesn’t feel like you have room to really move around. 


MULTIPLAYER
I used to spend hours in Ace Combat Infinity’s multiplayer playing the co-op missions. Those multiplayer matches were some of the most fun I have had in an Ace Combat game, and I was looking forward to getting to relive those glory days, but at last, no. The multiplayer is strictly TDM or battle royal, both where you are taking on other players. While skill does matter, unless you find a room that limits the cost of the aircraft when you’re starting out it’s completely dominated by veteran players who are higher on the aircraft tree than you are. Not that any of that matters anyways considering there is hardly anyone on the servers so it’s not like you get to be picky about what room you join.",1690411088,1690411844,False,2,1,0.473619639873504639,0,True,False,False

The story itself was really enjoyable, one of my favorite parts being the jpg of the dog. The combat itself was really fun, it provided the right amount of realism and arcadeyness which made the game really enjoyable for me personally. Not all people will love it, but if you're okay with the arcade style, then I say buy it when it's on sale lol, $60 is not worth it at all, but when it's on sale it's a great purchase. The usage of modern day fighters in an era of drones was really fun, you are challenged with the development of unmanned dog-fight capable aircraft and you in your F-16 in the beginning is really an enjoyable experience. There's different routes you can go on the aircraft tree, whether it be the JASDF, USAF, European, or RFAF line of aircraft, all of them are enjoyable and have their own perks. Arguably, the F-22 is the best endgame aircraft except for the X-02S Strike Wyvern which is after you beat the game. You can also do a sort of new game plus if you beat it on Expert difficulty, unlocking Ace difficulty which I still have yet to complete, but so far it is a bit more challenging, but you do keep your previously unlocked jets which is nice.

TLDR; Game is great, arcadey, has great aircraft, good story, F-22 best jet, Ace difficulty cool, highly recommend",1690367110,1690368179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a fun game but imo it doesn't offer much in replayability besides repeating the story missions or the few ""special"" missions. Even repeating the story after you've done it gets old really fast. I haven't bothered with the multiplayer but from what I see in other reviews thats pretty dead anyways. I've only played through the story twice, first time like a couple years ago and now again this July 2023. Once done its just like... ah ok thats enough I don't wanna play this anymore.

The story is so wacky and the cutscenes are fairly goofy in a cliche japanese way. It's trying to be deep but falling flat. But you shouldn't be paying attention to it anyways because airplanes go bbrrrrrrrrrrttttt   ppssheeeeewww!

I really wish the user-interface and the menus didn't have that animation that slows everything down. Like if I unlock something in the aircraft tree I don't need to spend the next 10 seconds watching it outline the next unlocks as if I'm retarded and can't tell where the lines already go anyways. Or if I want to back out of the menus to quit the game it takes waay longer than it needs to. Probably easier to just kill the game in task manager, you'll exit faster.

As for the game being a console-PC port...it's not great. Actually it kinda sucks (without mods).

I needed to modify the game to work on my ultrawide monitor, and there's a video on YouTube posted by the channel ultrawide Nexus titled: ACE COMBAT 7 SKIES UNKNOWN ULTRAWIDE GAMEPLAY FIX. Check that out on how to do it. Worked well for me.

While I did get the game to work on my ultra wide monitor, you cannot adjust the HUD to the boundaries of your screen, so the HUD is centered on the screen with wasted space near the edges. When I tried playing from my PC on my TV, while the game looked incredible the HUD was off-center and I had no idea how to change it; reinstalling the game without mods and playing on default settings didn't change anything. Such a shame, cause this game is a blast to play on a bigger screen.

As expected, Ace Combat 7 delivers an adrenaline-filled thrill-ride. The game features state-of-the-art graphics that bring to life the intense battles between player and enemy aircraft. The controls are tight and responsive, allowing for a precise and maneuverable experience.

The game’s story makes for an engaging narrative, with plenty of twists, turns, and thrilling missions. With a variety of aircrafts and weapons to choose from, the game offers plenty of customization options with which to tailor your experience to your own tastes. The game also boasts an impressive lineup of voice actors, who add a layer of realism to the proceedings.

The online multiplayer is especially impressive, as the game allows up to 16 players to battle each other in large-scale battles. The matchmaking system is responsive and the connection is rarely laggy, meaning that players can expect smooth and intense battles. Furthermore, there is plenty of additional content such as leaderboards, tournaments, and ranked playlists, which facilitate competing for high scores.

All in all, I would highly recommend Ace Combat 7. It offers an exhilarating experience filled with plenty of exciting missions, customizations, and engagements. With the huge variety of aircrafts and weapons, the game offers plenty of tactical options, so that no two battles are the same.

The game is pretty straightforward about what it is so if you think a combat flight sim with metal gear undertones, a banging soundtrack, an amazing and probably very familiar vocal cast is even remotely up your alley, you'll have a lot to appreciate here.

The game is not without problems, as no VR support and a lack of support for certain resolutions is a pretty big disappointment. The DLC hasn't seen certain updates it needs either, one of the features is a music player added to the menu but the available music does not include any of the great multiplayer songs or the music from the 3 DLC maps, or the Top Gun crossover song. The structure of the DLC is pretty strange too, since the highest tier package deal of the game available includes the Top Gun and season pass, but will still leave you missing a fair amount of the DLC planes. Just seems like a strange choice is all.

That being said, I don't think any of that takes away from the overall experience of the game, there is a lot to love here and I think this is a game well worth playing. The story is a great cheesy kind of fun, the combat is smooth and the map gimmicks feel fun with so much room to optimize each attempt and even approach maps in entirely new ways between attempts. When it's on sale, this game hits some pretty low prices and it might just surprise you if you end up trying it. Would definitely recommend it and many other games in the series to anyone interested.",1689981506,1689981506,True,23,1,0.710060656070709229,0,True,False,False

Gameplay - 8/10 (9/10 with mods)
Glorious. The biggest reason to buy this game is the gameplay. High-G turns, PSM's, the variety of special weapons, facing off against the harder enemies, and in the later half, hearing the cheer from your teammates and the fear from your enemies. S-ranking, no-damage runs, gun-only runs, and playing with the sheer variety of planes and special weapons (especially if you got all the DLC's) further increase replayability.
BUT, your 'teammates' are absolutely TERRIBLE. You may be an ace pilot, but these teammates exist to just draw attention away from enemies - they don't actually shoot them down lol. As well, in the campaign, [SPOILER START] it can be a bit infuriating to 'defeat' the enemy ace without actually defeating them (until the final arc). His plane's invincible, and even in the mission where you kill him, he's still invincible until he says all of his lines. Only then can you kill him. As if his monologues are magic spells that make him invincible. [SPOILER END]

Story - 7/10
What a silly melodrama this story is lmao. Lots of, well, interesting choices made by the nations. The 2nd arc of this story has the most comically evil commander I've ever seen. And it can be kinda jarring to hear them speak of doing so well, when in reality they probably took down a small target or two, when you've taken out 30+ already.
Crucially, however, in the 4th (final) arc of the game, it really tries to hammer home the idea that 'war is hell'. Which, after celebrating for taking down some hard to hit targets, can be hard to digest. To put it simply, the delivery was not impactful - I just shot down the massive boss airship in the most brilliant display of aerobatics ever, I don't think I care about a few refugees that died thanks to the enemy's collateral fire. Not my fault bro.

DLC - 10/10
You HAVE to get the DLC's - the new planes, some new weapons, and the greatest character you'll ever meet in Ace Combat history.

The story didn't really get my attention, but I assume it does make a lot more sense and has a lot more impact if you played the previous games. It's not tightly tied to them as far as I know, but there are references and characters that are shared. I know this because I played AC5 a very long time ago and some names sounded familiar, although I remember next to nothing about that game. 
The controls are good and it's fun to play, although the targeting system can be a bit janky at times, it seems to prioritize enemies in your FOV, even if they're much much further away than others which you don't immediately see, and this can prove to be a bit annoying in missions where you have to target specific enemies or low-speed, ground focused missions.

There isnt realy a solution but you can download a keychanger or how its called to set your hotas buttons to work as controller buttons now since you cant change anything in this game you are very limited and also if you have a throttle this wont work either you have to manadge break and afterburner with buttons just like a controller...

So the campaign is actualy prety sweet but as i said you cant experiance the game at its full potenital and now your also pissed of becouse your hotas doesnt work. The multiplayer is pretty dissapointing so dont you buy this when your looking for a multiplayer dogfight game

So what do you do ?
Just buy Project Wingman its cheaper and reads all type of inputs, very good campaign and you can do veeeery nice maneuvers everything is just 10times better then in this game trust me",1664294803,1689540689,False,0,0,0.5625,0,True,False,False

They have simple steering mode for the casuals who just wanted to shoot down enemy bandits and have fun or you can pull 12Gs, do cobra maneuver, or become an acrobatic pilots as you progress and learn some skill sets to finally move on from casual control. 

The base game planes are also very good, the unlock process to the end of the tech tree only takes about 7-9 hours of gameplay, this system allows the casual aspect to have somewhat of a challenge so that you be considerate on how to spend your MRP, do you want to spend it on parts? or do you want to get new toys for your aircraft? or just simply buy a new and much more powerful aircraft. They also have 1st time completion bonus for each chapter, so it tremendously helps you on grinding your favorite jets. 

The graphics is also still up to date, the planes looks very wonderful, the sun is too bright in some occasion and I don't know if taking screenshots are possible in this game, I'm not too deep in the mission replay where it shows a recording of you at the end of the chapter. The UI is also very simple and not so crowded with too many information, the main menu is also unique because it made me feel as if i'm accessing through secret military files.

Not to mention that the story not very easy to understand if you don't play any previous games, but in the text dialogue there are some foreshadowing about what happened before this game but it is easy to get hooked on to the story speaking from my perspective :D

Overall 8.5/10 game

So in conclusion great graphics, easy for casuals to enjoy, challenging games for those who wanted to play it on hardest difficulty, easy progression system, Nice UI, and Great story.

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
Our story takes place in a universe somewhat different from ours, but with many similarities, such as having developed, designed and built the same fighter models and military planes as our world. This story takes place on the continent of Usean, a place where we find large cities, and also beautiful natural landscapes, such as beaches, forests, deserts and various other types of landscapes, unfortunately all this exuberance is found, where more than a decade ago in 2001 , there was a great war that affected the entire continent. ^^

A war that involved the Kingdom of Erusea, against the other nations of the continent and ended in an armistice. After the end of the war, the other nations, during their reconstruction process, allied themselves with a large military force from another continent, the Osean Federation, which now has troops on the continent for ""protection"" of the countries, as well as starting the construction of a huge space elevator in the southwest region of the continent, very close to the border with Erusea, bothering and worrying the leadership of the kingdom. Now it's 2019, with the construction of the space elevator completed, and the continued presence of Osean military troops on the continent, making Erusia decide that the time has come to put an end to this, with a withering strike from they air force that would start to a new large war. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ An excellent game of military fighters, with the most varied types of aircraft, weapons and twenty missions with different objectives on maps with several kilometers in area, to test the aircraft and skills.
+ Twenty-eight different fighter models, each with its own three special weapon options, plus numerous upgrades that can be used on all, including two fifth generation models.
+ Beautiful graphics during combat, including options such as viewing from the cockpit's point of view, and having the camera follow the last missile fired.
+ Impeccable soundtrack, with some really good songs, which I listened to over and over again.
+ Story despite being shown only from the point of view of our squadron and a few other characters, it is easy to understand.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- If you plan to unlock all the planes and upgrades, you need to be patient to collect all the necessary points, as there will be many.
- Some achievements require a lot of repetition, such as completing all quests on all difficulty settings. In addition to achievements that can only be achieved in online mode.
- The game has a considerable amount of DLC, including several aircraft that could have been in the base game but are DLC-exclusive.

[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]
This is how the player's participation begins as a fighter pilot, of one of the divisions of the Osean Federation stationed on the continent of Usean, being awakened by a call to battle on the first day of the invasion by the troops of the Kingdom of Erusea, as the novice and ""very communicative"" pilot Trigger, performing various types of missions, such as shooting down targets in the air, destroying installations on the ground, protecting allies, among several other types of military operations, throughout the twenty missions of the story mode portraying the war. ^^

In addition, the story starts with only one model of aircraft and a special weapon released, but as the missions are carried out, the player earns points, which can be accumulated to exchange them for more options of special weapons, improvements that can be used in any aircraft, and new fighter models, including a fifth-generation US and Russian fighter, to soar through the skies and shoot down enemies. But be careful, even when piloting the best fighters, the bosses still provide an excellent challenge, especially on the highest difficulties. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
Produced by the Japanese studio Bandai Namco, I really liked the graphics of the world and the units on land and sea, but mainly in the modeling of the various fighters, which are the focus of the game after all, with the player piloting them throughout the duration. But the highlight really goes to the sound part, with good sound effects but mainly an impeccable soundtrack, with great songs that even get muffled when we are inside a cloud, some that I kept repeating the mission several times to hear again. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown was my first contact with any title in the series, I admit that I had never played an Ace Combat, but I really liked what I saw in this one and I just think it's a shame that I don't have more missions to do, so I can only repeat the missions to try to get the best possible score. Anyway, for those who like military plane games, especially fighters, this is a game that I strongly recommend, whether you are experienced or just like me, a newcomer to the series. I would also be very grateful if Bandai wants to release a sequel one day. ^^",1682310923,1689390432,True,28,1,0.729831099510192871,0,True,False,False

Honestly the time limit almost ruins the game. It doesn't make it harder it just makes it way less fucking fun. You cannot turn it off. Oh it is also worth mentioning that you are the ONLY target it the sky. Missiles, whether they are SAMs or AAMs will only seek you. You will have at least 2-3 missiles locking onto you at any given time. Normally you would evade and engage the source but you have 3 minutes to rack up an arbitrary score based on pretty much nothing. This game is fun, you will have fun.

In comparison, this game feels like (really it just IS) a a low effort port of an otherwise great console game, whereas PWM feels like it was a purpose-built homage to AC for people to enjoy on PC.

The biggest issue with AC7 is the fact that there is no native ultra-widescreen support. I run dual 2k 3440x1440 monitors, and in a day and age where Ultrawide screens are becoming more affordable and commonplace, it is inexcusable to resort to letterboxing players with these aspect ratios. It especially makes even less sense knowing that the game allows you to natively scale texture detail by 200%. it's such an issue that you have to download 3rd party software that unlocks the game from Steam DRM and use a python executable to force widescreen support. Doing so, MAY result in you being incapable of enjoying multiplayer due to this mod being picked up as cheat software. The installer for the fix even states this. So fixing the issue has the potential to lock you out of playing half of the game. While I will admit this is a very specific problem to Ultra-widescreen users such as myself, it is still an inexcusable oversight from such a big developer. 

Further indications that AC7 on Steam is just a poor excuse of a PC port, is the fact that the in-game mouse&keyboard controls seem to be bare-minimum ""usable"". This game doesn't just have ""full game pad support,"" to enjoy this game you essentially MUST use a controller to experience it to it's fullest extent. Drawing comparisons to PWM again, that game's m&kb controls are not just serviceable, they can be an optimal way to play if you so choose. The game's menu UI also has no mouse support and you must use your keyboard for menu controls. This may not seem like much, but it shows again how much effort was really put in to making this accessible for PC users. To take it to another level, the game assumes you will be using a controller to such an extent, that the in-game control tutorials from the first few missions will display controller icons for keybinds even if no gamepad is recognized on your system. The final straw for me was that there is no way to invert my lateral movement on mouse, AND there is no way to change keybinds while in a mission. You MUST exit to the main menu from whatever it was you were doing to then adjust your settings. More low-effort port clues.

Is the game good? YES, it can be amazing, but only if you're expecting to play the game exactly as though you would on a console. but with my specific setup, it's only a chore to play with clunky controls, has terrible PC hardware support, and bad UI contextualized for console/controller players. If you are a PC player in a similar situation as me, pass on this, and pick up Project Wingman if you haven't already. In many ways it is the better game, at least for people who want to enjoy a arcade fighter game on the PC.",1689194819,1689194819,False,2,0,0.464480876922607422,0,True,False,False

The music is good, but not as part of the game. I can highly recommend getting the OST, but not the game. The flight controls are fine. That's the best things I can say about this game.

I can kinda see what the game is going for, but it's not working. Every mission has some gimmick or another. The amount of instantaneous fail states is extremely punishing, and checkpoints in missions are very badly paced.
Allied units are useless in combat, and the player has to solve every little issue. Just as an example: I left a single helicopter enemy surrounded by ~10 allied air and ground units. The allies lost, stating that they were ""surrounded"" and had to surrender.
The game tries to make the player feel like some one-man army, but it only makes allies seem like incompetent idiots.

The difficulty curve is also very harsh. By mission 6, the player either has to be a masterful pilot, grind prior missions for better equipment, or use DLC jets.

Missions often feature hazards, which is fine, but they stack them too much. One of the early missions requires flying in an area with thin, high mountains, while fighting the strong winds in the valleys, and having to react to randomly getting struck by lightning, all while trying to kill an opponent that is far more agile than the player's planes could ever be. Two or three of these things would make for a fun challenge, but all four just lead to frustration.

The onboarding process of Ace Combat 7 is very, very weak, not even teaching the player that they have a machine gun on their plane. I found this out on mission 18, by checking the controller layout.",1689185145,1689186842,False,6,1,0.539822995662689209,0,True,False,False

I don't play multiplayer but was expecting a immersive single player arcade experience. Unfortunately the game was a disappointment with the limited time I had with it. For example:

No Ultrawide support:
I got it working using the github easy but sad to see no native support.

Canopy:
Wet effects look like white dots that show up instantly compared to Project Wingman water effects which slowly accumulates and streak transparently. Also the FOV in the canopy is really small.

Sound:
I like to turn down the BGM to zero so I can hear the sound of fighter, guns spraying, missiles firing, systems locking on, planes exploding, and the radio transmission. But most of the sound was really quiet and muffed. I was really surprised there was no sonic boom or the effect after breaking the sound barrier at 700mph. I was also surprised there was no boom sound when going head to head with an enemy fighter jet and passing it extremely close. 

CONTROLS:
This is what caused me to refund the game. I use Battlefield controls: joysticks for all movement and throttle so I can use my triggers for gun and missiles. I do this so I can adjust and sustain the angle of attack. I only play with expert controls since Ace Combat 5 and I use my guns 90% of the time compared to my missiles because of the immersion. This is how I like to play. But the gun play for the planes are not great. The crosshairs keeps flicking back and fourth too fast which makes it hard to adjust. I prefer the Project Wingman's gun play that depends of positioning and angle, and shooting ahead of the target. Project Wingman's crosshair does not snap back into the middle of the screen unlike AC7.

Overall I really wanted to play the campaign and enjoy it's story but the immersion and controls is what disappointment me because I expected from a triple A game for the quality compared to a indie dev team for Project Wingman. I hope to see AC8 with these features. Razgriz out!",1689106494,1689106494,False,4,2,0.496973961591720581,0,True,False,False

First of all, the epic music is creating a cinematic Hollywood atmosphere. It gives power to your heart to beat faster. Furthermore, the cut scenes between the missions are also amazing. So the biggest mistake during playing this game you can make is to skip the cut scenes. They are the half, while the missions are the other half of Ace Combat 7. Yes, sometimes they are a liitle bit long but you just have to consider them as a movie and you will love it.
In conclusion: Do you like epic cinematic movies? Do you like epic music (e.g. Hans Zimmer or John WIlliams)? And do you like to feel the freedom. It does not matter if you like to feel the freedom of the streets, the freedom of the skies or the freedom of open world games. If you just like the feeling of beeing free, this game is one for you.

While the core gameplay is okay (not much different over previous iterations for better or for worse), the campaign is astonishingly bad. I don't mean the writing, which is delightfully cheesy and awkward, as is the voice acting. But while a handful of the missions are fun, the bulk are tedious and frustrating. It's like they deliberately set out to design missions that take the fun out of flying a classic combat aircraft into battle. Hope you enjoy destroying ground targets under a tight time constraint, because that's the bulk of what you'll be doing. 

Whether it's lightning strikes causing your plane's electricals to malfunction, or random gusts of wind pushing your plane sidways into rock formations, or sandstorms or IFF malfunctions rendering your radar useless, it seems that the campaign is designed to make air combat feel like aggravating busy-work. I get that there's a need to have variety in missions, but the frustrating part is that every once in a while you get a fun mission thrown your way, requiring some trick flying or having to mark targets for bombers. Then the game stumbles over itself to throw in some monkey wrench into the whole thing which instead of enhancing the experience by providing a new challenge just frustrates the whole experience.",1688713889,1688713889,False,3,3,0.486595183610916138,0,True,False,False

Bought the Top Gun Maverick DLC and the F-14 definitely helps in campaign mode. Whether you’re a rookie or a veteran, I highly suggest you give it a shot.

Pros: 

- Most likely the best fighter game ever 
- Better graphics than previous Ace Combat titles. Flying through clouds has a nice condensation effect on the cockpit, facing the sun will blind you, missiles can unlock while target flies through clouds, getting struck by lightning blurs your HUD. Play on a wider screen, not the Steamdeck if you want to enjoy it
- Very challenging campaign. It can take a couple of tries for certain missions. Obtaining S rank is also a little harder than in previous games. It can be a little frustrating to learn expert controls if it is your first time but don’t give up!
- Story is intriguing, it takes place in the Strangereal, the cutscenes are made to reflect the atmosphere in preparation to each mission but dialogue could be worked on a little more. Some conversations sound a bit flat.
- Many DLCs including experimental aircrafts from previous games with crazy special weapons to obliterate and conquer. 
- Interface is nice and clean, soundtrack is fire like always. Charge Assault and Daredevil are my favorites (Thank you Kobayashi!)
- Brings you back core memories (Stonehenge, Farbanti, basically invading Erusea again)
- Great variety of mission style: Obtain X points in a time limit, Escort an ally, Destroy refueling platforms, Fly through a tunnel, small and gigantic targets to take out etc... (you will need a variety of aircrafts to fulfill each mission like air-to-air or air-to-ground) This is what makes the game more dynamic, you can’t beat with only one loadout
- Great number of drones to shoot down in a gigantic furball. It can be annoying at first but just get to the 8AAM and you should be fine
- Customization is nice, wish they had some more skins but there are many emblems/nicknames to compensate. Named Aces require some work to spawn them, but hey that skin is worth it right? 

Cons: 

- Multiplayer is dead. If you want to play PVP, you’ll have more luck on PS4. The most lobbies I have seen so far is 2-3, or am I doing something wrong, and that is during the peak hours (10AM EST, no idea why). Multiplayer needs a make over as you can simply get shot down instantly by someone with a top tier load out.  Also no cross platform play
- Definitely not a game with realistic physics, but that’s what all AC players should know by now. Speed is through the roof
- Anything above Normal difficulty is trivial, they need to make it more difficult/aggressive
- Kinda wish they added few more planes in the vanilla game like the F-117 or the AV-8B one day. No Chinese planes, probably due to legal and political reasons
- No way to modify the controls in the game as I was used to old games mechanics on PS2
- The game crashed for me a few times. I suspect my GPU takes a huge hit and had to lower the settings (currently with an RX480)
- No wingmen control like in AC5 or AC0 
- Story is linear, no choice of missions like in AC5
- They need to add Danger Zone to their soundtrack

All in all, if you are an AC veteran: Buy it
If you are a Top Gun Maverick fan: Buy it

You'll fly completely stable as long as your wings are level, but if you roll at all there is just the slightest bit of pull towards the earth. Really difficult to get used to it, and precise movements required to get guns on target are extremely difficult. Especially with how 30g are considered the upper end of what's humanly possible in this game's lore, the enemy just dances around and pulls out of your sight... Can you imagine that? 30 times the force of gravity.. Jeez.. I really don't recommend this if you are used to actual Flight Sims. If you're a hard-core DCS player, forget it. All in all I have to say, play Project Wingman instead.

Personally, I rate this game among the original trilogy. The singleplayer story in this game is fantastic and provides a fair amount of replayability. However, if you're getting this game for its multiplayer then I would not recommend it. The multiplayer servers are practically dead for the most part, and if you are lucky to find a match, hope that you don't find one of the many hackers that unfortunately plague this game. Don't get me wrong, the multiplayer is fun if you either play in private lobbies with friends or you manage to find a match without hackers, however, the main focus of most Ace Combat games has never really been about the multiplayer, but rather the singleplayer. I absolutely recommend this game for its singleplayer alone, although I would only recommend buying it if there is a sale as there is not much else other than the story that you can really do at this point.
Edit: After playing through all the DLC missions I can easily recommend them to anyone wanting more story. The multiplayer is still very dead though.",1561786852,1687767922,True,4,0,0.538619935512542725,0,True,False,False

Then it's a constant back-and-forth between it being dark & rainy and too bright because of the spotlights shining directly at you.

Mission 12 was another annoying one towards the end as [spoiler]you are tasked with destroying the propellers on an Arsenal Bird. The problem?

I think the game captures pretty well with ""Try again if you fail"" in such modern day, where failing often frustrates a lot and so devs made game either too easy or too hard.
It's simple but challenging, with great dialog and music.
Definitely recommend if you like aircrafts and wasn't looking for hardcore simulation gameplay, but arcade style fun time.

Maybe it's because this is my 1st AC game ever, I found myself too sh*t to complete and unlock everything. Which lead me to decide to drop the game after the main story missions completed.

I do not recommend this game. At all

It's got good gameplay yes, but the combat literally becomes hard for hard's sake. Gets to the point of Mary Sue levels. Unmanned fighters that flip in ways that are unnatural. Missiles that later do the same. It gets to the point of utter dumb

I'm for challenge, but this is Mary Sue level difficult dumb

They use references from Ace Combat 5 to make this seem interesting. Which means they used fan nostalgia to gain interest. Which has seemed to work, except that's literally all it is

They had an interesting story setup, and that's what got me into it. Then by the end it makes literally no sense.

You have like 20 planes hovering over, let's just call it the Ark Bird. Guess what those other 20 planes do? Nothing

Once you take down the unmanned fighters they just hover above the ark bird, and maybe on occasion fire a missile that does nothing. Worse, they muck up your radar. So while the arkbird is firing a bajillion missiles at you that can flip around, and are better than qaam missiles, you can't see them on your radar when there's 20 planes that aren't being targeted by said missiles sitting there

Better, your supposed to do all these maneuvers and such to take it down whilst, again, you have all these planes to help you where we could just shoot it with missiles to kill it. But oh no I forgot it has a shield that...doesn't get used again during your battle with it.

Better yet, right after, a girl randomly decides, I'll jump off this really high spot, and it's fine cause I have a parachute. Why is she jumping you ask? We don't know. All we do know is she gets shot out of the sky by one of these new unmanned fighters that was supposed to not be produced by doing the same mission you just did. Why they shoot her in midair is also not explained.

It's a random set of events that continues to get dumber and dumber as you go on.

And oh, when those two planes appear, the mission just ends. We just for some reason leave to land on this random aircraft carrier, that just happens to have the admirals name from the last game on it, as well as apparently (quoting the game) a buttload of planes, which makes me think of ww2's aircraft carrier to hit Japan. And that is the only time I've seen that.

This...made no sense

Oh, and the Ace pilot you fight against through the game that you fight literally in the beginning for some reason, he just randomly shows up at one point, you shoot him down, and that's it for that story with him. No interest increased in the story, nothing. Biggest villain, just gone.

You don't even know why your playing at that point except for gameplay. Except once you do the next mission you encounter Mary Sue levels of dumbness and really story to question if it's worth it to do the possibly last level

Dumbest game in the Ace Combat series I have ever played

Story was worthless. Had no substance of its own. Only gets any from Ace Combat 5. Without it, it's nothing

Set in an Earth-like world but featuring real jet planes, the game is a great 'arcade' game as opposed to a simulator.

The main story features 20 missions plus 3 dlc missions and enemies comprise both air and ground targets. Aside from standard missiles the player can utilise a wide array of special weapons and plane parts that act as perks before starting the mission.

Missions are varied, sometimes its pure dogfights, sometimes you have to use a particular weapon to destroy certain ground targets, sometimes you have to fly through valleys or avoid radar detection circles and sometimes you have to destroy a set number of targets in a given time.

There are 4 difficulty levels, and admittedly once the player has become accustom to the game the challenge really comes from a few 'boss fights' in which the AI makes for difficult dog fights especially on Ace difficulty.

The story was fairly interesting however the soundtrack is honestly one of my favourite aspects of the game.

Multiplayer is still somewhat active as of writing this however you will need to arrange times with other players if you want to play team death match as opposed to regular death match. 

Multiplayer is fun however unforgiving to new players who do not yet have the best parts to attach to their plane, this along with the fact that some of the best planes and special weapons are locked behind DLC adds an unfortunate imbalance to the experience.

Overall I would recommend it both to people who enjoy jet games and newcomers like me.",1687291801,1687291801,True,19,0,0.703764379024505615,0,True,False,False

In AC7, there are basically no options besides graphics and control scheme, there's no FOV or camera options, which is very important in a dogfighting game. The camera is stiff and weird in AC7, and the FOV is way too low, (It can be changed with Cheat Engine, but it's a pretty big hassle.) 
The missions in this game are good, mostly, there are annoying ""Protect the character who can't defend themselves!"" missions, there are some missions where you can't tell which plane is on which side, and those suck. Overall I don't enjoy the missions in this game.
Now I'm gonna talk about Project Wingman, and why you should purchase it instead of AC7.
The aforementioned problem with settings in AC7 is removed in PW, you have FOV sliders for 1st and 3rd person you have more settings for your controls, even a War Thunder style mouse control thing, which I love, there are options for everything that AC7 neglected.
The camera in PW is absolutely wonderful, especially with the War Thunder controls, and helps you to realize just how bad AC7's camera is.
The petty missions in AC7 aren't present in PW, you don't have to deal with your teammates getting themselves into trouble and have to do everything over again. In fact, you don't have to worry about your team at all, they just sit there and take out some aircraft for you. 
Final note on PW, Prez is awesome, 'nuff said.

On one hand, the game play is incredible, the art design is beautiful, and the story has great moments that I'm never going to forget. On the other hand, certain gimmicks for levels don't really add anything and are negligible at most and sometimes downright annoying at worst. I think the best one (imo ofc) happens late game after a certain event, and really played well with the tone of the story. Another fun one is the canyon run, just a really good concept that's challenging but also one of the most satisfying. However, wind mechanics, lightning, and sandstorms really only feel like they drag out a standard mission for too long and are just not very fun to play around with. Another element is the story, and i'll be honest if you haven't played any Ace Combat games or know any of the lore of the games, your going to spend the majority of the game confused. It doesn't help that 2 separate factions on different continents but in the same faction hold the name Osea and Usea and operate closely with each other. I didn't realize they were different factions until my second playthrough, though then again I'm not exactly a paragon of intelligence. The story overall suffers from this, which is a real shame since the actual message and narrative are very interesting and thought provoking. What does stick the landing though will be enough to invest you and keep involvement until the very end. The actual gameplay sections of the game are incredibly fun, and man are the bossfights a good challenge to overcome. Overall, while flawed, this campaign is still a blast and I would recommend checking it out.
As for the multiplayer, its a pretty mixed bag. Theres only 2 gamemodes, TDM and BR. Its pretty shallow in this aspect, and I'm sure a few extra gamemodes would have really increased the variety and overall enjoyment, such as a VIP or eliminate objectives on the enemy team, which would give more utility to the wide sandbox of aircraft. As it stands now, if you arn't running at least a 4.5 generation fighter with QAAM's SASM's, HCAA's, or Lazers, your gonna have a bad time. Theres nothing to mix up the objectives from simply kill other players, so obviously people only use the weapons that most efficiently kill players. At the same time though if you've got some buddies to spar against, this can be a really good time. The community as a whole isn't very toxic, and matchmaking in short bursts can be a good time.
TLDR: Campaign is flawed but fun, multiplayer is difficult to get into but with friends is very fun. I hope this review helped out",1686238379,1686238379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Than you endup in mission 16 and 17... game breaker.. who thought of this should be fired on the spot, the gameplay is that you have to visually determine if a (yellow)target is friendly or foe.. so while closing in being shot at... keeping the target focussed, getting close enough to light my cigarette from theire hot smoking barrels, and still NOT getting a confirmation the target is an enemy...

More like a lightweight arcade/shoot-em-up game that can help you relax after a long day at work. 
Cons- 
Not enough good to love AC7, but enough to make me miss AC5 & 6. 

You do not have the ability to control other NPC's like in AC6 which means friendly NPC's are of no help. ""I should keep my distance because I can't keep up with [human player]."" Translation: You're on your own, good luck. Like seriously, your lone pilot might as well carry the entire war effort. You might have heard of plot armor, but now we have plot holocaust and you're the only one that can do anything. 

Story was nothing compared to the previous AC's. Rather disappointing. 

The soundtrack is one of the worst things about this game. 1st mission, great. The rest? Mute it. 

Lacking of originality. Mission types seemed copy and pasted from previous titles to this one. 

Cutscenes had a lot of cringe moments. Like, a mountain of cringe. I improved my experience by skipping the cutscenes.

You know how Star Wars Rogue One was just the original trilogy story like ""oh no, it is another death star. whatever will happen next?..."" It's like that.",1685036258,1685036258,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The release of the game follows the reintroduction of Colonel Sanders into KFC's marketing campaigns in 2015, and is part of the company's strategy to make the Colonel a ""part of pop culture"", reimagining the historical figure for modern times.[3][4] The game successfully received public attention due to the ""can-you-believe-it"" premise both before and after the game's release.[5]",1684796517,1684796517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Did I have a blast? Yes. Yes I did, it was so, so worth the money, even if I bought the game on sale
The story is really amazing, bright and all sunshine and rainbows, however, it takes a quite dark turn into a lot more depressing setting.
You can buy planes (with in-game currency, shocker) (in game currency is easy to get, no real world paying), but not just randomly, because it's all an aircraft tree, so if you want a shiny F-35C, you'd also have to get some other planes, which are all worth.
I kind of recommend finding a way to record your gameplay, just to see how you flew your planes when you started, and how you fly your planes when you finish the game

Slight spoilers ahead:
Story starts at a low skill, enemies are easy to maneuver around and kill. Then a twist happens, skill ceiling goes a tiny bit higher, and your character is at a low point in this career. You then gain more popularity for your skill and become a well known and liked ace pilot.

Once you finally finish the game, you can restart the story with all the things you have unlocked, so if you want to fight barely flying planes with your high-end, futuristic jet, go ahead. 
Once you finish a mission, you can replay the mission on a different difficulty, or in free flight, which is a very neat option because it just spawns you in the map, with no enemies or missions

TLDR: Game good, buy if you can and want.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",1622704993,1684088006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ace Combat got my attention because of the funny drum game and the few Ace Combat themes in there, just like another namco game i've played before *cofcofScarletNexuscofcof*. My favorite was Roca Roja, and I heavily considered playing this game because I heard more of its soundtrack and fell in love with it.
... Buuuut I never actually bought it because I couldn't really afford it, and there were more games that I had already saved up for (latin american struggles).
Fast forward lots of months, I'm talking with a friend ... And she asks me if I want this plane game (big thanks to her. Of course I said yes because hell, I listen to the soundtrack every once in a while and I LOVE it. 
I start playing this game, she gives me a few tips (I only listened to like half of them - that's why I play on expert now !) and ... I start making quick progress on the game.
Look, I *know* that 12.4 hours don't say a lot sometimes, but ... I am obsessed with this game now. Not even a week has passed since I played for the first time and I'm a really busy guy.
I'm really into this game's story and I think I'm in love with Trigger's character. I also like the gameplay A LOT and I'm currently on mission ...13, I think.
This game has given me a few headaches but I don't really care. It's stunning ! It's a really nice experience, this game made my old special interest with weaponry and planes rise up again and it makes me happy.
Hell, this had such a huge impact in me that I now dream of PLANES ! And I ... Also hear ""Caution ! Pull up !"" in my mind a lot .... It's still nice tho.
It may have a LOT of objectives but shooting them down is real fun.

After all of this I can only say ... I like this funni plane game a lot. I'm really thankful for such an amazing game and soundtrack, the devs did an amazing job - shoutout to them !!!

Everyone shits on the story and I think that's fair. The world building doesn't really exist and the characters are basically one note but it isn't offensively bad, just a bit boring.

I highly recommend turning on expert flight controls as the default controls in the game are far different than previous Ace Combat entries. I think playing without expert controls is like playing DOOM without the ASD keys, it's extremely limiting. Without flight controls, your aircraft can't roll or really make those high G zero turns.

I can't wait for an Ace Combat 8, been playing these games since I was a little kid. The story can drag on a little in place, the narrator goes on for far too long in some cut scenes, but all in all, it was a very fun experience for me. It was also really cool to get updated on aircraft that's been developed over recent years and how far along certain prototypes are. Of course, with Top Gun 2's release, I was rocking the skins and finding myself saying stupid cheesy lines from the movie. 

I think one other area of improvement would be to allow the controls more free-flow during replays after missions, other than that, I think the game is pretty damn good.

Like the Previous Ace Combat games before it, AC7 Is an absolute blast to play. With a great story, Dialogue, And gameplay, It is a masterpiece that in terms of gameplay, I would consider 10/10, For this review however I gave it an 8/10 for one reason- Price. The game is coming on five years now, And it is still being sold for 60$, And thats BEFORE any DLC which can easily make the price jump to over 120$. In my third playthrough, I did hard mode and a No-Hit challenge for the entire campaign, And even with this difficulty the time it took for me to finish it was about 10 hours over a few days. While it is an absolutely lovely game, I personally would only recommend waiting until a Sale to get it for a little cheaper as 60$ for the base game 7-8ish hours of campaign gameplay is in my opinion a little too pricey.",1683805520,1683805520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So several million years before the dawn of man,
(That is technically where the lore starts)
So The Ulysses asteroid
which is real
Does a funny dance and leaves the orbit of jupiter
Some smart person with a telescope looks at it and goes ""Yeah that'll fuck up our shit""
So as a sane and normal response, the Osean Federation (The U.S. but Japan) decides to build Stonehenge
A twelve piece, rotating multi targeting anti-aesteroid Railgun Artillery emplacement in the middle of the desert
It's supposed to be able to cover the entirety of the expected Ulysses impact zone
About a year after the discovery of Stonehenge, a country called belka snaps
Belka was basically Germany
Their economy went to shit
Lost a bunch of money
Sold territory
Trying to survive
Some territories vy for independence
One, Ustio, is supported by Osea
Who is the US
After becoming independent, Ustio finds a SHITTON of resources
Ace Combat is Japanese, so the Japanese perception of erica
All the cool freedom shit none of the bad
So Belka, a country renowned for their air force, says fuck it
They proceed to invade anyone they can
This includes Ustio
This is where the events of AC take place
Ustio hires Galm Team, two mercenary pilots
Galm 1, Cipher, and Galm 2, Pixy
(There are 16 Ace Combats)
(7 mainline)
8 actually
5 is my fave
7 is great tho
Anyway so Galm 1 and 2 proceed to wreck shit
Ustio goes from being almost completely overrun to fine in like 2 months
Then the Allied States (Ustio and Osea and everyone but Belka) push into belka
Then Belka decides to do a power move
They whip out their giant fucking laser
BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ANTI-ICBM LASER
Built during the Osea-Yuktobania Cold War
This is 1995
It's called Excalibur and it's bigger than most buildings
Of course, this is after busting like 18 megastructures
Anyway so Galm Team attacks and destroys Stonehenge
Then they go to this nice little town called hoffnung
No wait shit Excalibur not Stonehenge
Hoffnung is a little industrial city
So Galm Team gets sent in to escort some prescion bombers
Except sike they aren't precise
And they don't mean to
So the city gets whacked
The Belkans go ""Oh Shit""
And, as a perfectly normal response
They burn the rest of it down without evacuating civilians
So Galm 1, Pixy, gets the sad
So pixy, your wingman, is lagging behind as you get sent to another mission
He's sad
OUT OF NOWHERE
Belkan bombers ""headed for Ustio"" armed with WMD's are spotted
You get sent to intercept
Cipher shoots down all the bombers because
And then Belka calls everyone a bitch and shoot themselves in the liver
BY NUKING 7 OF THEIR OWN, UNOCCUPIED, CITIES
TO CREATE A BORDER
Northern Belka is basically switzerland
With a nuke border
So in the confusion, Pixy goes
""Fuck this""
And tries to shoot down Cipher before fleeing
Belka just kinda disintegrates after nuking themselves
They get their shit rocked
BUT NOT BEFORE THEY USE A GIANT PLANE
THE XB-0
Imagine if someone tied a US military base together, wrapped it in Armour, and slapped wings on the bitch
That
It's being defended by Espada Squadron
Who are from Sapin (shitty spain)
But Sapin's fighting Belka
So it turns out that due to the war there's now this Massive Terrorist Organization thats full of fed up soldiers from everywhere and like the entire belkan military
Anyway so they're gonna nuke the whole world with a super MIRV
Because Posadism
They hate borders
And wanna reset the world
So Cipher goes to destroy the launch facility
Which is a dam for some reason
And they do
But SIKE
Pixy's here and he wants to kill you
He's got this dope new plane called the Morgan
Shit's got Lazers, Pocket nukes, and an ECM system so powerful that it can jam bullets
So Pixy launches the big fuck
And Cipher has to shoot him down from the front because the jet intakes are the only weakness
And pixy gets his shit rocked and the nuke gets fucked
Detonates mid air and somehow is fine
Anyway so in 1997 they realize the Ulysses Asteroid is hollow
Turns out it's range is doubled
Yuktobania (USSR) decides to also build a bigass railgun, the Chandelier
Because Stonehenge now can't protect everyone
The country of Eursea (kinda modern russia) builds a shitton of bunkers
Yeah impact is doubled
Thats game 1 of like 5
Oh shit I forgot the Civilian murder
Anyway
So the estimated impact now covers the continent of Osea
Eurusea tries to build Megalith, an Anti-Asteroid ICBM launch silo, but it's not finished in time
So in 1999, the Ulysses Asteroid Enters Earth's atmosphere and begins to break apart
Loads of chunks fall to the earth
The ones that would land in empty areas are ignored, while Stonehenge attempts to shoot down every asteroid heading for a populated area
Bad News - A sizable chunk is headed towards Farbanti, the Capital of Erusea
Stonehenge gun 7 goes to shoot it down
40 seconds before firing, turret 7 is knocked offline by an asteroid
The Chunk slams into one of the most populated parts of Farbanti
The crater creates ""The Sunken District""
Oh yeah and Osea was fine
Cause Erusea and Stonehenge are on the Continent of Usea, but Osea itself is vibin on also Osea
So Basically Erusea decides ""Fuck It"" and goes to war with the ISAF
(Independent State Allied Forces)
So as a first strike, in 2003, Erusea takes Stonehenge in a surprise attack
Some erusean Genius goes ""Hey guys you know this 1km long anti-asteroid railgun that shoots at like mach 7? What if we pointed it at planes?""
And so they do
Basically gaining Continental Air Superiority overnight
ISAF flips their shit
Erusea bad
So ISAF GHQ and any survivors from the entire continent regroup on North Point
Which is Britain but somehow worse
Anyway ISAF are getting their shit rocked
So Erusea decides to finish this and sends over a wing of strategic bombers to wipe ISAF GHQ off the map
But they're intercepted by an ISAF pilot
Mobius 1
The only member of the 118th Tactical fighter wing
Anyway Mobius 1 proceeds to wreck shit
ISAF then mounts a series of offensives to destroy Erusean Logistics
And then the Aegir Fleet, which is this big ass fleet the eruseans have
Anyway so Mobius 1 destroys several small countries worth of infrastructure
Then they mount an offensive on the Aegir Fleet, which can't move cause they blew up all the fuel
And they wipe it off the map
Also after this mission there's a cutscene where the pilots sing the ISAF National Anthem for like 20 seconds
It has a Voice Actor you never hear before or again
It's suspected to be Mobius 1
Anyway Mobius 1 keeps wrecking shit
No just a pilot
Apparently a rookie too
The only one to either A.) Survive Stonehenge out of a wing of other pilots, or B.) Be the only pilot sent to an entire wing
Yeah Mobius 1 is player Character
Anyway Mobius 1 does some more Pilot shit, and eventually is sent to destroy Stonehenge
Which works
And Mobius 1 is sent to singlehandedly defend two defecting passanger planes who Erusea is trying to shoot down
Basically ISAF rocks Eruseas shit
After the Battle of Farbanti, Erusea surrenders
But these cool and hip Erusean Zoomer Officers decide to be wacky
They decide to use the (just finished) Megalith
So Mobius 1 is sent to destroy it
In the only way Ace Combat knows how
A tunnel run
4, actually
so, from where I left off
Mobius 1 destroys Megalith (which has a pog theme)
and established peace forever
anyway 5 years later there's another war
This time Its between Yuktobania and Osea
Before the war, Yuktobania and Osea were working on the Arkbird project
which is a Space Station but it's a plane
anyway so a Yuktobanian SR-71 is spotted over Sand Island
The Wardog Squadron of Sand Island is sent to intercept
A Yuke Squadron is sent to intercept them
They fight but both nations cover it up
Wardog Squadron is then sent to disable a Yuke spyboat
Oh yeah Wardog are all rookies except for the captain because everyone else got ganked by Unidentifed Aircraft
The Yukes defend the spyboat and shoot down the captain

It's a stupidly fun game with a high skill ceiling for those who stick around long enough and want to get invested in the game's systems, but simple enough that you can dive in without knowing anything beforehand. 

The story is a sort of Metal Gear Lite political drama with a cast of fun characters that are all pretty well voice acted, and while the dialogue is a little hammy, it's by no means a bad thing. 

Also, this game's music goes fucking HARD. Everywhere. All the time. It's fantastic.

My two biggest criticisms would be that the main currency is kind of hard to gain for like, 90% of the main campaign, so you won't have a lot of freedom to unlock a huge variety of planes and weapons to try them all out without a bit of grinding, and that the game itself is pretty short-- only 20 chapters excluding the DLC.

The game is quite fun, once you work the controls and such out, get them down pat. And able to execute them quickly and effortlessly, missions are a breeze. Some missions require more braincells to work out you should favour an ATG jet opposed to an ATA jet. 

As well as sometimes needing to line a shot up/missile up to hit a target properly. 

But there only issues/things I would say that are more or less negative/make the game feel unfair:

On Point missions (You need to accumulate enough points to pass) You have a return line, this is sick. But sometimes the mission quickly goes from focusing on ground targets to dealing with swarms of Air Targets, if you are like me, and have very few aircrafts at hand, which are multi-role and can do both ATA/ATG effectively. (Either with multiple lock ons/bombs) then it becomes a case of trying to unlock aircrafts which are a middle ground, or simply buying a DLC plane to get really powerful weapons.
(They should give an option to pick a backup jet, on these missions so you can plan ahead, have a main ground attacking jet, then if the mission changes and jets swarm in, you can hit the return line, swap jets and continue on)

The controls for joystick are not clear. This really isn't a lot game devs can do, other than try to update to keep ontop of the new Joysticks/Throttles published by big brands (Logitech/Thrustmaster etc) so players have an easier time learning the controls and not be like me, where I realised the rudder control to go left/right whilst at a flat level, is to twist the throttle.

For someone new to the franchise I agree with what most of the players who did not recommend this game are saying.  For someone who is mostly PC this wont be the game for you.  It is a bad conversion from a console game.  These have been mentioned by others but mentioning it again here.
-No mouse support at all
-Buttons shown in some of the menus are from a console controller so you have to guess which keys to push
-No joystick support (other than the one they sell)
-If you can get a different joystick or Hotas to work through hacks and what not you have to guess which buttons do what since there is no way to set them up the way you like - even if you have the expected joystick there is zero button customization
-The controls are designed for a console controller so using a joystick setup doesn't feel at all natural and you have to completely relearn how to fly compared to any other flight game
-It sort of has a stall feature that really doesn't do anything and doesn't make sense since you cant go slower than 600 knots despite having the throttle at zero
-You cant skip dialog even if you have done the mission previously and some of it is long
-No co-op
-In the missions not all enemies are red on the mini map so while you are chasing a red target someone that looks like a friendly comes up behind you and starts shooting.

The fact that they put zero effort into converting this to PC with no joystick or hotas support and still charging for a full price game is disappointing and an obvious money grab.  That and the flying just doesn't feel right.  Perhaps its too arcade style for what I'm looking for.  
Conveniently for the developers its obviously worked.  Video game players sometimes are too hardcore and will put up with a lot because they are fans of a franchise.
Will be requesting a refund as I have no such attachments to this franchise and now know its not for a PC player.",1682831621,1682831621,False,2,1,0.445615291595458984,4,True,False,False

And for that price I can recommend the game, if there's no sale I recommend buying the standard edition and then buy any dlc you have interest in after you finished the campaign.

Having fond memories from playing Ace Combat back on the Playstation 2 I finally came around and gave Ace Combat 7 a go. And I can say it was totally worth my time, it's an arcade action flight model that brings you right into action of dogfighting with several different planes.
Of which you unlock through an Aircraft Tree, each plane and their special weapons upgrades need points the player gets for playing through the campaign missions, which are all repeatable to ""farm"" more points.
Repeating campaign missions, separate single player missions or playing multiplayer are needed to ultimately unlock everything on the tree.
_______________

Gameplay
The gameplay is very arcadey which has always been a staple of the Ace Combat series and which is also the reason why I like this game so much, it's very easy to get into and encourages fast paced action.
Before you start a campaign it gives you the choice selecting a difficulty, which can't be changed mid campaign.
Hard - Normal - Easy - Very Easy
I've played the campaign on normal difficulty and having failed certain timed objectives in the campaign, crashing or being shot down a few times I can see why a Very Easy difficulty is even an option.
Some missions do not have checkpoints, meaning if you fail the last minute of a 15 minute mission you have to replay the whole thing again, there's no hand holding in that regard.

No hand holding is not something I like either however the friendly AI that accompanies the player is borderline useless, there's sadly no interaction between the player and his friendlies, other than maybe the few missions to protect them from incoming enemies.
You can't order them to do anything specific nor do they actively try to help you in a dogfight, it feels very much you are the only one able to save the day, which is probably the point by the devs but in my opinion a missed opportunity.

The majority of the planes are licensed real world Fighters and I can see any Fighter Planes enthusiast would enjoy unlocking, upgrading and flying them through the roaring skies.
Each plane has different characteristics, and choosing the right plane for the next mission is part of what makes the diversity so great.


Graphics
The ingame VFX and details are all focused on the planes and everything that is above ground, the highly detailed planes, the explosions and even the clouds that have a real volumetric appearance, which have gameplay mechanics to them, look and feel great for a game from 2019.
The ground environment is serviceable and won't blow you away but the hard ground is not were your plane belongs anyways! Ground environment and the different maps do look great from above though and you'll fly above deserts, green farmlands, mountains, canyons, oceans and dense urban environment.
What lacks in graphical fidelity on the ground is being saved by the diversity the game presents.

Sound
The overall sound design is good, planes closely flying by, missiles exploding or swooshing close by gives you a great feeling being in the skies with some of the most expensive military machinery.
Sadly your own plane, even though each plane sounds different even each machine gun sounds have a different pitch depending what caliber and rate of fire they have, sounds somewhat weak compared to everything around you, the audio mixing could be way better in that regard.
An example for that is no matter what camera perspective you choose to fly in the sounds your plane make give the same volume and direction, honestly it's the biggest gripe I have with the game.
Accelerating for example just doesn't give enough audio feedback to the player, flying 700kph or 2000kph is almost no audio change, the screen shaking and playing with a controller that gives you vibration feedback is trying to save that aspect of the game.
Oh and the music is freaking amazing, the OST for every mission is epic and gives you the feeling of how important and dire a situation in the current scenario is.


Story
Oh boy the story is probably the weakest part of the game, you play a mute and faceless pilot that just exists and all the other characters that are being portrayed in high quality pre rendered cut scenes are basically the focus, they interact with the player only sometimes by talking at you while you're in missions.
The overarching story is okay and there are a good amount of twists and turns, but truly at best nothing amazing.
Your squad mates are all so forgettable that even right now just writing this review right after finishing the campaign and a few multiplayer sessions, I already forgot their names and the game never even tried to become close with the people that your character flies with.
These are the people that you trust with your life and yet the writing and story implementation is so bad that they are the most generic disposable characters in a story I've tried to get into. BIG L

After playing Ace Combat 7, I must say that the game is not worth the investment. Instead of delivering an exciting fighting game with a compelling story, it falls flat with a subpar flying experience and a painfully predictable storyline.

Cons:

    Poor story: The game's narrative is riddled with anti-war political rhetoric, as characters continually discuss the horrors of war and the importance of peace. This is a departure from the thrilling combat experience players might expect.
    Weak male characters: The only notable male characters in the game are a stereotypical evil scientist who reforms and an old man who dies of old age. Neither adds much depth or interest to the story.
    Overemphasis on refugees: The storyline focuses too heavily on refugees, rebuilding a better future, and a queen character who inspires her subjects simply by talking on the radio. This detracts from the action and excitement of the game.
    Missing main protagonist: The lack of a strong, engaging main character leaves the story feeling hollow and uninteresting.
    Cringe-worthy cutscenes: The game's cutscenes are awkward and poorly executed, adding to the overall negative experience.
    Mediocre music: The music in Ace Combat 7 is average and fails to enhance the gaming experience.
    Predatory DLC policies: Mission 19 is incredibly difficult for average gamers to complete without purchasing overpowered DLC planes. Namco's approach to DLC in this game is predatory and frustrating for players.
    Politically charged: The game's heavy-handed political messages make it difficult to enjoy the gameplay without being constantly reminded of the developers' agenda.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend Ace Combat 7 or any future games from Namco or its Japanese director. The game's politically charged narrative, weak characters, and predatory DLC policies make it a poor investment. I regret paying full price for this game and will be more cautious about researching game directors and publishing companies in the future.",1549149810,1682112952,False,0,0,0.426344990730285645,0,True,False,False

I really do like the F35.

Pros:
- Story is really good. I won't summarize, but take my word for it. IT's a nice blend of realism and ridiculousness. It doesn't try too hard to be realistic, but somehow allows you to suspend your disbelief. The characters don't have much depth, but have the personalities that allow you to have your own opinions of them.
- Graphics: Beautiful. Gorgeous. My eyes are in tranquility. The environments are beautiful, the models are detailed... *mwah
- Sound design is awesome
- The lore is nice and connected with other parts of the series which, overall, is a fruit basket for lore.
- brrt... lots of brrrt

Cons:
Controls are kind of jerky and don't feel all that fluid in terms of visual movement. There's just not a lot of freedom. Kind of wish it was more like Project Wingman.

I don't know how else to put it. I love AC7 and I can't wait to see where the series goes from here.

A week later and I completed the entire game- one of the very few games I can say I have finished. And still, i'm going for a second playthrough.

First and foremost, the gameplay mechanics are simply out of this world. The mission design is top-notch, providing the perfect balance of challenge and fun, and the flight controls are incredibly responsive and intuitive. It's no wonder why fans of the series keep coming back for more, I mean, who doesn't want to fly high above the clouds and engage in epic dogfights?

Now, let's talk about the planes. The attention to detail in the aircraft models is nothing short of astounding. The developers have done an amazing job in capturing the unique nuances of each plane, making it feel like you're flying the real thing. However, the game does lack customization options, which is a bit of a bummer for players who like to tweak and tune their planes to their liking.

As for the story, it's not the strongest aspect of the game, but it's serviceable enough to provide context for the missions. Honestly, the missions are so good that the story takes a backseat in my opinion.

All in all, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is a must-play for fans of the series and anyone who enjoys fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping air combat simulations. Based on my experience with the game, I'd give it a solid 9 out of 10.",1681294960,1681294960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After 5 hours of experiencing the game, I've been left disappointed and feeling misled by the comparison so many have made. 

This game is objectively inferior, with a 3x greater price tag. The controls compared to Project Wingman are clunky and unresponsive, even comparing early game planes to early game planes; the enemies are gimmicky and feel borderline unfair, the drones this game uses as its main plot point in the early sections are so small even well placed missiles feel like a coin toss on whether or not they're going to hit; the gimmicks the missions use (especially 7 and 8, the point where I stopped playing) are annoying and only further contribute to the negative experience already brought about by the prior two points. 

These gimmicks, the lightning in 7 that messes with your ability to see or lock onto the enemy drones (which are already annoying to hit) is coupled with needing to keep drones off of allied planes, and if one plane goes down you have to restart that section of the mission. In 8, sand blocks your view of tiny trucks driving through a sandstorm, making it so you intermittently can't lock onto them unless you're within around 1000 feet. For reference, your plane can frequently exceed 2000 feet, and turns like the Titanic, so you'll find yourself circling these trucks aimlessly waiting for them to pop up on your radar again so you can *try* to get within the range to see them normally. Even worse, once you destroy 10 of the 20 trucks, drones fly in but thankfully aren't priority targets, and aren't actual threats to your survival due to firing missiles occasionally, and having no other means of offense. These, coupled further with a timer that, while not strict, is stressful, just leads to a disappointing, annoying, and lackluster experience. 

If you want to play a plane game with an engaging story, fun mechanics, good controls, and entertaining characters, play Project Wingman, which entirely lacks every fault I've laid out here.

The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented.

I also played the Assault Horizon one but ehh, it was ok but it didnt blow me away really...
But THIS ONE, oh boy, it really flew me back to those days. (get it? flew? haha funny)
I know it wasn't really revolutionary nor innovative, but I really enjoyed it's simplicity and how classic it felt because it made me feel like I was a little kid again booting up my ps2 and playing on a saturday morning.
Of course my review is mega-biased, but I really liked the game and I totally recommend it if you want to get in the Ace Combat series.

If your looking for a fun fighter jet game, but aren't looking for too much realism, then this is the game for you. I'd recommend 'Control Type: Expert,' for a more realistic feel. Overall it controls well and supports controllers and flights sticks very well (Although not all flight sticks work in the game). I just completed all the achievements for the game and I would still go back more more. There are some many more in-game achievements to get that will really put your skills to the test. The overall story is pretty good, not the greatest story in ever, but well written enough to keep you engaged. It has plenty of various difficulties that make it easier on new player, and a real challenge for veterans. The missions and boss-fights are great as well, and while a few missions are somewhat tedious (depending on your difficulty), it still an overall great time. Would absolutely recommend, although it is a little pricey. If money is an issue, they go on sale every so often, especially if a new fighter pilot movie like Top Gun Maverick comes out, so be sure to look out for those sales.

And missiles whizz with a deadly cry
There's a place where pilots reign
And the thrill of dogfights is the game

Ace Combat 7 is the name
And its gameplay is nothing tame
With stunning graphics and sound design
It immerses players in a world of crime

The campaign takes you on a journey
With twists and turns that will leave you yearning
From the skies above, to the seas below
You'll fly to places you never thought you'd go

The missions are varied, each with its goal
From bombing runs to dogfights that'll take their toll
Players will need to adapt and adjust
To the challenges thrown in with trust

The planes are many, each with its perks
From agile fighters to massive behemoths that lurk
Every aircraft has its own stats and style
And mastering them is worth the while

But the game's not just about the planes
It's about the thrill of dogfights in the planes
Of flying in formation and taking down foes
And executing maneuvers with graceful flows

Ace Combat 7 is a game of skill
Where every player can fulfill
Their dream of being a pilot of the sky
And taking on challenges that'll make them high

So if you're looking for a game of flight
That will keep you engaged all night

If you'll let me talk about the story, it's tends to prefer to ""tell"" rather than ""show"", which is actually amazing at telling a story during missions and integrates the story well into the gameplay where a lot of information and action is delivered to you via comms, almost like a radio show. However, it carries over this ""tell don't show"" philosophy into the some of the SILLIEST cutscenes I have ever seen, which, depending on the person, might have been a positive, if the English voice actors didn't have such strange delivery during the cutscenes. 

Overall the experience was really hammy, but fun, imo. Feels way difficult by the end. 

I've done some reading on this game, and apparently, the development process for it was troubled all the way through. It would explain a lot of things about the story- the two squadrons probably would have been separate routes, and the difficulty probably would have had a less unforgiving ramp up rate. Overall, I still think it's a good game despite its flaws, even when not considering the development of the game.

Final verdict from me is ""good game heavily marred by the last 3 missions, which are all bad.""  It's also probably the absolute worst flightstick plane game I've ever played. There were sections I was forced to switch to 3rd person kbm because there's just no way to use a flightstick and 1st person (with or without cockpit view) to do some of the missions. In fact, playing 3rd person just gives all your equipment larger lock angles and autoaiming on stuff like the PSL. 

The plot is insane but entertaining, whatever. I enjoyed all of the missions up to the end as well, but between insanely bad checkpoints, dumb as hell instant failure conditions/missions, and wild context swaps, whoever made the last few was a malfunctioning individual.

If you like flying games with flightsticks/etc, there's better options. Prepare to be frustrated at times. If you like flying in 3rd person with KBM, it's an easy buy. Especially on sale I feel I got my money's worth.",1680708387,1680708387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the narrative can be a bit off sometimes with a couple of characters narrating the story in the most botched way possible.
Narration aside, visuals are beautiful with meticulously designed aircrafts that are really enjoyable to look at during gameplay and replays. Audio design is good, it has signature Ace Combat dialogue design and music, with memorable tracks during some missions and mission briefings.

Gameplay is fun in general, BUT a bit frustrating if you're playing with keyboard & mouse, especially during tough air to air fights or with tricky mission objectives - better use a controller or you'll rage like I did during climactic boss fights. And the multiplayer's still alive and is really challenging, but has a minuscule player count, maybe 2-4 dozen players at a given time.


Overall an 8/10 experience, pretty good especially for a 4 year old game.

People just need to remember that Ace Combat is a combat arcade game & not a flight combat simulator & stop expecting it to have extremely realistic flight mechanics & physics.& if you hate the default flight settings you can change them back to the classic style where you have full pitch, roll & yaw control like fighter jets are supposed to be able to have. Graphics seem good & story is a typical but decent and love to see the return of the strangereal universe Ace Combat 4-6 was set in and it is a better Ace Combat title than Assault Horizon. My biggest complaints are SP weapons suck also you can no longer command your allies to defend you or attack specific targets like in older Ace Combat games and you sill cant choose your squadrons aircraft like in 5. I'm just glad Ace Combat has finally started coming to PC officially.I do wish there were cheats. Would love a god mode cheat that enabled invincibility & unlimited ammo & maybe a money cheat so we don't have to do yet another play through just to earn more credits for all the planes, weapons & parts in the aircraft tree which I also am not a fan of. I miss just unlocking a certain number of aircraft after certain missions. The DLCs are decent and glad we don't have to spend game credits to buy them. They just come unlocked with all weapons & paint jobs I'd say my main gripe is how terrible they have been at developing & designing SP weapons. Seriously nearly every SP weapon is just two missiles that may as well be standard missiles or a single mostly useless bomb. Rarely is it up to 4 or more SP bombs or missiles or a unique SP weapon(laser, railgun etc.)  that is actually useful.

This was my first Ace Combat game. It was very pretty. The canyon mission was fantastic, bombing runs - OK, story mostly just there but the dogfighting... I just don't understand it.

The AI usually flies directly at you to get behind you. If you try to get behind them, you just both start circling each other. If you straighten out, they shoot missiles at you which forces you to circle more. You basically have to circle around aimlessly and wait until the AI straightens out to let you hit it. It's not fun, it's a dizzying waiting game. When the AI gets distracted by your buddies, it's mostly fine, but the ""Boss"" 1v1 dogfights are horrible.

The constant ""WARNING MISSILE, WARNING, MISSILE"" and incessant screeching of the missile targeting system put the final nail in the coffin. It makes the otherwise great sound game unlistenable.

I finished it over a course of a year. I took a break 4 times. It is pretty unique - there aren't many flight games out there, perhaps this is why. I like the idea of a flight game, but the reality is very different.",1638629986,1680395032,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It sat on my Steam wish list for a long time since it's normally not the genre of game I play. After a Steam sale (and being obsessed with Top Gun Maverick,) I decided to finally pick up. Right away I knew my mistake on waiting as long as I did to get it.

First off, the graphics are beautiful. If you have a PC that can play this in ultra, you're in for a real treat.

Secondly, the game play is a perfect balance for anyone who enjoys challenging missions but also likes just cruising around blowing up tanks from the sky. There's a few missions that took me a few retries and the handful of ""boss fights"" are pretty tough for any skill level in flying games. But it's not over the top difficult and makes it more enjoyable when you finally complete the mission. I was very impressed with how easy the controls were to learn and how you have a lot of options to play around with them during intense fights or missile dodges. I also appreciate how the lock on system is very responsive when switching between targets quickly.

The campaign story lost me around halfway through and then caught my attention again towards the end. I didn't play this game for the story, but it's a nice addition for those who don't want to just aimlessly fly mission to mission without a purpose.

I think a real high point in this game is the many different types of locations each mission takes you to. One mission you may be zooming past skyscrapers in a night time city. The next mission you may have to be carefully flying through a foggy mountain overpass while maintaining a certain altitude to avoid detection. It kept the overall experience exciting and fresh throughout.

The last mission is by far the most challenging (as expected.) Make sure to be properly upgrading your jets as the game goes on to make it a bit easier for you. With that said...the last half of the last mission blew me away by its originality and ""high stakes.""

After the campaign, check out multiplayer where you get to go head-to-head with actual real life war heroes (probably) who you don't stand a chance against. At the time of writing this, you can still find lobbies pretty easily, but limited to many options.

If you are someone who enjoys flying games or someone like me who just wanted a change of pace from the normal, I can't suggest this game enough.",1679571122,1679571122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As the great Starscreem, I have seen my fair share of aerial combat. And I must say, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is the perfect combat simulator for those who seek a true challenge. The game boasts stunning graphics, realistic physics, and an intense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Ace Combat 7's gameplay is nothing short of exceptional. The controls are smooth and responsive, allowing you to execute even the most complex aerial maneuvers with ease. The combat is intense and realistic, giving you a true sense of what it's like to engage in air-to-air and air-to-ground battles. Whether you're dodging missiles or unleashing your own arsenal, Ace Combat 7 delivers a true combat experience.

[b]Story[/b]
As a Decepticon, I'm not usually one for human stories, but I must admit that Ace Combat 7's storyline is engaging and compelling. The game takes place in a fictional world where a conflict between two nations escalates into an all-out war. The player takes on the role of an ace fighter pilot, fighting on both sides of the conflict to uncover the truth behind the war. The story is well-written and the characters are memorable, adding a deeper layer to the game's already impressive gameplay.

[b]Graphics[/b]
The graphics in Ace Combat 7 are simply stunning. From the detailed cockpit view to the expansive landscapes, everything is beautifully rendered. The attention to detail in the aircraft is particularly impressive, making each one feel unique and authentic. The game's use of lighting and weather effects adds another layer of immersion to the experience, making you feel like you're really soaring through the skies.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
Overall, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is a must-play for anyone who loves aerial combat. The game's combination of realistic physics, engaging story, and stunning graphics make it the perfect combat simulator. As Starscreem, I can attest that this game is challenging even for the most experienced pilots. So, if you're looking for a true test of your aerial combat skills, look no further than Ace Combat 7.",1679554289,1679554289,True,4,2,0.537070214748382568,0,True,False,False

So now I have to spend some time hacking .ini files to get my joystick to work, which works fine in games like Project Wingman (that also supports VR).

Visually, the game is gorgeous, I initially was skeptical when I saw that the game was in Unreal Engine 4, but Bandai's art team has come in clutch big time, because the environments range from cityscapes to mountain ranges, all beautifully detailed and realized. Sometimes when the sun catches on the water or a plane the right way, a screencap from the game would look better than real life. I am VERY excited to see what Bandai can do with UE5. Combat is great, my one big complaint is that as far as I can remember, the game never even tells you that your plane has a machine gun, and that part of air-to-air combat feels like an afterthought. However, trading missiles feels fast and exciting. This game frequently goes on sale for ~10 dollars, and at that price, I don't think there's a single person I wouldn't recommend this game to. I intend on playing it again soon.",1679324601,1679324601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-a wide array of secondary weapons. From air to ground to freakin lasers, it feels good to not JUST shoot only missiles.
-multiple enemy types, not just aircraft. multiple ship types, different ground targets, etc.
-a rich story, narrated from multiple viewpoints, and 20 missions, 23 with dlc.
-a lot of aircraft choices, each with their own unique charm.
-everything is well thought out. from defending a allied jet to refueling and landing sequences. you can be thrown off course if the environment is windy, or, your canopy can freeze, reducing mobility, if you're in clouds too long. heck, if it's stormy, you can get STRUCK BY LIGHTNING, and your HUD will glitch out. how many games do THAT?
-lastly, it goes beyond plane stats and ammo types... there are parts to upgrade your jet, like more speed, missile homing boosting, to stealth coating and even mobility enhancers, all of which can be put on or off at your convenience. it really makes you think.

if you want to know any bad points, the only i can think of are:
-in the story, the characters swear and cuss. a LOT. so if that's not your style, you may want to be aware of that... though you CAN turn off radio chatter volume, i dunno if it includes subtitles. not to mention, if your a first timer, it can be hard without it, i.e. mission updates, sudden orders, etc.
-you don't get all aircraft and parts right off the bat. there's an aircraft tree of sorts, and your mission kill points buy planes and stuff. thing is, it's a branching tree, and if you didn't buy plane A before plane B, you cant buy plane B. basically, you have to buy this to unlock that. if a plane you really want is at the very end of the tree, tough luck. you'll need aaaaallllll the other stuff first.

And for the most part this is what I got, it plays like I remember, feels like I remember and even has some of the planes I remember. On a broader spectrum (and for those unfamiliar with this series) AC7 delivers an engaging flight experience that's easy to pick up, tough to master but is entirely about the fun aspect and not demanding you spend 500 hours learning the actual controls of a Jet Fighter. You'll be in the thick of the action within minutes of booting up the game and you'll be presented an interesting and well narrated story through to the end. As long as you have a passing interest in fighter planes, you'll find enjoyment to be had here.

However on the downsides the graphics are starting to look a bit dated and hardware can certainly do more than what's asked of it here, overall though it looks alright considering this was originally for the PS4. Though my two biggest gripes with the game come in the forms of menu design and the lack of boss fights. I would like to see a return to form in the next game for the menu system especially for the hanger, letting you preview the aircraft you intend to buy and not having to wade through a tree that you can see only 1/20th of at any given time. As for the bosses, there are effectively only 3 bosses here to fight (Arsenal Bird, That One Pilot and That One Pilot V2), that wanes in comparison to earlier entries. Additionally not allowing the player to actually kill a boss until the game says so is really frustrating, seeing the hit markers come up repeatedly but no indication of damage and the enemy continuing to fly is a bit demeaning. 


Pros / Cons

✔ Great soundtrack
✔ Wide selection of Fighter and Multi-Role aircraft
✔ Interesting story (if a little short)
✔ Great narrative cinematics with solid voice acting
✔ Game runs as smooth as butter (2k Ultra GFX 144FPS+ always - 5900x / 3080Ti / DDR4 3200MHz)
✔ Mission variety is great, lots of different tasks and mission types
✔ Controls are well setup for a controller out of the box and the planes respond well to inputs
✔ Planes are very detailed with the interiors being fully modeled and visible from outside the cockpit
✔ Solid graphics for a PS4 title

❌ Very few boss fights
❌ Game doesn't let you win some of the earlier boss fights until it wants you to win 
❌ Poor selection of bombers - A10 and SU are the only options, seriously?
❌ UI layout for menu's and Aircraft tree suck (Old PSP hanger was better!)
❌ MRP is a bit of a grind to unlock the base tree. MP items should've been more expensive.
❌ Graphics look dated even after 4 years

Overall: 7.5 / 10

All in all AC7 7 is a great game with enough content and depth to satisfy the casual plane enthusiast, and would make a great entry point for someone who wants to play more Aircraft related games or is interested in the AC series.",1678628932,1678629127,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Since g-forces indirectly produce weight, any g-force can be described as a ""weight per unit mass"" (see the synonym specific weight). When the g-force is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object, the reaction force to this push produces an equal and opposite weight for every unit of each object's mass. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. Gravitational acceleration (except certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall. [/strike]

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is now is the position that it wasn't, and if follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa.

People can talk about it being a ""simulator"" all that they want, but it's not as if this game has a ""race"" type mode or agility courses to test your flying skills in. It has a story mode and multplayer, both centered around aerial combat, so I feel confident judging this a videogame and not some transcendental modern jet aficionados club.

There is no ""skirmish"" type game mode, which would go far in providing replay value and fun. A nice, random map with some enemies in random positions to keep things challenging and engaging would make or break this game. Since it doesn't have a skirmish mode, well...

Multiplayer is solely the domain of head to head competition. That's fine for some, but I'm not interested in that. I rarely play online multiplayer these days as a matter of course, but being that this is a game with literally dozens of aircraft and customizable loadouts for each and I don't need to be clairvoyant to know I don't even want to attempt to see if it's balanced or not.

The campaign is...okay, I guess, at least your first time through. They way events play out and the way people talk...well it feels to me as a ""westerner"" the way I imagine a Japanese individual would on hearing a weeaboo talk about ""honor"" and ""the blade."" I find myself wincing every so often. 

It's a shame, since there are a lot of neat things at play. Seeing a sliding padeye in the carrier hangar was a nice touch for me. If you don't know what that is, don't worry, because it's not important. It was just a neat thing for me to see and I'm sure plenty of others will find something appealing to them.

Outside of that, though, the actual gameplay is where it soils the bedsheets. It really has no other speed than to go ""Oh hey! You want a challenge? Well here's a missile every other time you go to shoot the bad guys!"" That might not sound like much, but since your allies rarely do much and the enemy is spread out around the map it can get old very quickly having to break line of sight yet again to evade yet another missile.

From the standpoint of a ""game"" it would've been better to just follow the war, storywise, and have you control faceless, nameless pilots in the cockpit Battlefront-style. As things stand I find myself desperately dodging missiles again and again until the game finds yet another excuse to block my vision, whether with sandstorms or clouds. Eventually it just gets to the point that it is ""challenging"" in the same way it'd be a challenge to knock a brick wall down with my scrotum. Sure, I could do it, but why?

Maybe this is normal for the franchise, but I don't care. I didn't pay $60 for name recognition, I paid for a game. If I even need to ask myself if I'm having fun, there are already serious problems, but I just find myself getting mad trying to play this. Every little thrill from the ""jet pwane simuwator"" is brought down by frustrations and annoyances.

Tragically the other half of the levels were designed by some interns or something and they consist of blowing up x amount of ground targets before a timer runs out and it could be a skill issue but every time I play those levels i get 99% of the required points before the timer cuts me off and boots me back to the beginning. Sometimes the devs throw in a wildcard and have you crawl around in 0 visibility conditions waiting for your radar to lock onto something like you're playing the electrifying game of beach metal detector. Other times you get to have your eyes glued to your minimap to shuffle your way through a maze of radars. Honestly i'd rather the game was just half the length and pure action instead of these filler/gimmick missions I'm uniquely bad at but nothing's perfect and the good half of the game is really really good.

Pros:
1. The gameplay is very smooth and fun, there is no way dogfighting could not be fun
2. the variety of planes is great, it was super cool to fly planes like the Berkut.
3. The design and graphics of the game are beautiful and somehow were not too heavy on my aging gaming laptop.
4. Details like lighting, weather, plane roles... were well implemented
5. A10 go brrrrr

Cons:
1. The story was written by a 2 year old and at some point stopped making any sense. Towards the end they cram so much information and characters, most of which were completely meaningless and stupid
2. The characters are not even 1 dimensional and bordering on cringe inducing.
3. Speaking of cringe inducing, wtf is wrong with that dialogue? WTF IS WRONG WITH THOSE CUTSCENES??
4. The ally AI is completely useless, while enemy AI is fixated on you. After my last session, i fell asleep hearing the ""WARNING MISSILE LOCK"" lady in my dreams. The only time something happens to allied AI is when the script wants them to be killed or to get a kill.
5. Some missions are just weird. Flying a stealth mission in a valley while only worrying about search lights? I never knew jet planes were that quite. But i guess this was my least concern.
6. You need to play like 4 missions perfectly to have enough MRP to unlock a plane, and if you are expecting to unlock all the planes you must have nothing else to do in life but replay the missions over and over. Best you can do in one playthrough is reach the last gen aircraft by following one line.
7. You cant customise your plane's looks until yyou finish the campaign, yet they keep unlocking stuff for you.
8. I finsihed the campaign in around 7 hours and yet i had absolutely no idea what the story was about except that DRONES BAD

Overall, if like me you picked up this game on like 80% discount it is probably worth it if you are planning to only play the campaign.",1678526977,1678526977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game play i.e. actually flying the plane, actually pretty good.
All of this is let down though by the stupid targeting selection. At times I feel like I'm spamming the 'Change target' button just to select something that's right in front of me. Especially frustrating in annihilation missions.
e.g. trying to target an aircraft carrier with a cruise missile but even though I'm pressing the change target button 10 times a second I just rotate between it's weapons and planes rather than the ship itself.

I'd say the soundtrack is fantastic.
I like how the game lets you toggle between third person, first person, and cockpit view, depending on your preferences. I think the fact that the game shows you a replay at the end of every mission is a sign that the devs knew that players would want to watch how they were flying and even take some screenshots.

The two main antagonists are an old man, who has god mode turned on and machines. To counter said machines, high-G turns from a button press were invented.

Plane variety is fine, but come on, this is nowhere near what we've seen in previous games. Besides, so many planes are paid DLC, at insane prices. I bought the ultimate mega giga deluxe edition for 80 bucks before release, yet I still don't own half the released DLCs and would need to shill out another 103 dollars (or just 83, if you don't consider the Top Gun stuff to be anything more than a novelty) to have everything the game has to offer.

Ultimately, this game is very popular as the first mainline Ace Combat game to release on PC, but it's a sore disappointment for me. A plain old cashgrab, disgustingly filled with DLCs, recycled content, lack of creativity and just generally nothing much going for it.
The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is good - but scripted events can get old fast. Not a lot memorable about this game. I like that they tried making the old AC formula a bit more fresh with the high-g turns, but if it stays for a new game, I hope they refine it a bit more.

In recent memory, Bandai did the same thing with Elden Ring (they rushed to release the game with unfinished quests for example, lots of recycled content, but atleast FromSoft can work on it without cashgrabs after Bandai stops pissing on them) and banked on the goodwill of the people to sell. This is nowhere near the quality of what you'd expect from an AC game, but atleast it made me like Assault Horizon in comparison.",1677920397,1677920397,False,0,0,0.473372787237167358,0,True,False,False

In the game menu's there are only icons for console controllers and that's it, you cannot use an analog rudder and don't even think about using a separate throttle with its own connection. You will need to use the steam controller input configuration to use your joystick at all.
To sum up this mess is simple, the developer made a cheap port to the PC without putting in a minute of thought about other controls than a console controller.
This game could have been a fun and simple alternative to DCS and any other decent flight game. But the controls are worse then old DOS games like Wing Commander or EF2000
If you play this game with a decent Hotas the game will even be harder then when you have a console controller as things only partially work and you'll need to be pushing the stick to end of limits all the time.

The about the game itself
There are many cool planes in this game that look great, like the F14,F15,F16,F18,F22, Mirage 2000, Gripen, Eurofighter, Mig29, SU 30 etc. This is just great for modern military fighter jet lovers. So that's definetly a plus.
Except for the realistically looking planes there is nothing realistically about flying them, except for the fact that you can stall, crash and your turn ratio gets worse if you speed is higher. The stats of the planes themselves do not even somewhat resemble the real planes. Due a progression tree with incrementally better fighters you need to unlock.
And if you get the ultimate edition or some other DLC there will be planes with the best stats already which you can use in the campaign to somewhat cheat to the top

There is a story line that is somewhat interesting and insanely weird at the same time. The story line is totally irrelevant to the game and can be skipped if you want to.

If you get this on sale its OK I guess but don't pay full price for this console port.
If you have one play it with a console controller of be prepared for much frustration if you want to use that Hotas as you'll need to invest some time to get it working and then its working only half.

PROS :

+ Very beautiful graphics
+ Very well polished : clean, no bugs, high framerate.
+ Very fun core gameplay. The combat & flight are quite arcade, which make it closer to an Action/shooter game rather than a flight simulator game, and that is cool. Also, I don't like games that require a 3hrs tutorial, and this one is very quick to learn & enjoy. To sim players : it is not meant to be played with a joystick, it is made to be played with a gamepad (because it is a franchise coming from consoles).
+ Fair amount of content for a AAA game that is not an openworld. I spent more than 20hrs to finish the main campaign on normal difficulty. A couple more hours for the special missions.
+ Missions diversity. They really tried to find different ideas for every mission, and the game does not feel repetitive.

CONS :

- Progression tree (that unlocks new planes and gear) is nice, but poorly balanced. I really wanted to play the F22 raptor and did not manage to unlock it before the end of the campaign. I did not completely rush it though, I bought a few other ones along the way to try different gameplay options. But the last planes of the tree are so expensive that they require hard savings along the campaign if you want to have a chance to play them. Quite frustrating, because as players, we just want to try everything that the game has to offer.
- The lore. I am fine with the overall story, but there are way too much unnecessary dialogues and cinematics that interfere with the gameplay. NPCs keeps spaming the radio during combats which is very anoying when you try to concentrate on a difficult fight. Many things in the cinematics and the briefings do not teach you anything interesting or useful, and just feel like they are retaining you from entering gameplay.
- The weapon system could have been better. The game only allows you to take 1 weapon on top of standard missiles. But many missions contain at the same time Air combat + Ships to destroy + Ground targets. On top of that the briefing almost always fail to inform you on the type of targets you will really encounter during the mission. So in the end, you often feel frustated to not have the right weapon at the right time. It would have been way better if planes could handle several types of special weapons at the same time (like in Project Wingman), at least for the later planes in the progression tree.
 - Some frustrating gameplay mecanics. As they tried to diversify missions, they added additional gameplay contraints : storms that can blur your HUD and constraint your movements or IFF loss that prevents you from identifying your enemies. I am fine with the Idea, not the implementation. I found myself restarting missions several times because the game was forcing me to fly in the storms during fights, which lead to many frustating crashes. IFF loss is awful : you have to keep your crossair on every target for 5s to identify them, which is just horrible when you have dozens of ground and air targets that are already shooting at you. At least they could have implemented it so you identify targets immediately when your crossair passes on it.
- Boss fights are not fun at all. The enemy makes impossible moves, and you cannot deal damage to him before the game decides you can. It just feels like boss fights are scripted, and the enemy would kill himself at the defined point whatever you do something or not.

IN THE END :

I still recommend the game because it contains a good load of fun. I just hope that they will fix the few design flaws for the next Ace combat game.",1677362433,1677545353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has all the classic Ace combat missions and story. It is an arcade game, so don't compare it with software like DCS. The game is basically: ""pick your favorite plane, except the A-10, and enjoy"". The DLCs with missions add more story to the game and are actually good. The graphics are a bit old and non-perfect but it still holds pretty awesome when you are in the middle of the air combat.
The campaign is good if you take away some weird non-sense events, but you can forget about that thing called AC: Assault Horizon and pretend it never existed.
I play the multiplayer a little (3 matches) and it is fun. However, you are going to find (like in all games) the guys that are using the best plane with the best ammo and, by obvious reasons, they are going to be the winners. They should add some cap to this.
The planes DLCs are not needed for the campaign and I would advice to not use them in the singleplayer as they make the game too easy. I haven't try them in the multiplayer yet. However, it is nice to play with planes from previous Ace Combats.
If you are an Ace Combat fan, buy it.
If you like flying planes and don't mind is arcade, buy it.
If you like multiplayer, I don't know but I had a good experience so far.",1677382206,1677382206,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved HAWX many years ago and have often looked out for a more modern version. The flying, sound effects and controls are all excellent and I REALLY enjoy the gameplay. The major drawback is.. everything else. The voice acting, the writing, the endless cutscenes all detract from what is otherwise an extremely enjoyable air combat game. The first half hour is one 10 minute mission, and 25 minutes of cut scenes. Multiplayer is dead, and I completed the campaign in 11 hours, so I can't recommend paying 60 euros for it.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Looks fantastic
- Really good controls
- Sound effects and combat feedback are excellent
- The game makes you feel like a badass
- Blowing up targets on the ground is especially satisfying
- 20 campaign missions
- The voice acting is good, but the writing isn't
- Large number of planes and equipment to unlock
- Using numbers to designate planes makes them difficult to tell apart
- Really satisfying to fly around blowing stuff up
- Good variety of enemies between different planes, ground vehicles, planes and boats

[b]Cons[/b]
- The nation names they chose are confusing. I spent most of the campaign wondering who's side I was on between Erusea and Osea, which sound very similar
- The Aircraft Tree where you unlock new planes and weapons does a terrible job of showing you the differerences between planes
- Waaaaaayyy too many cutscenes
- You can really tell the voice acting and writing for missions was translated. Sentences make almost no sense, topics change immediately (even between sentences), voice intonation is totally off - like they got someone to read each sentence in isolation then glued them all together
- No checkpoints in 20 minute missions, and no repairs. I regularly get shot down right before the end of a mission which is really frustrating having to play through the whole thing again
- If there IS a checkpoint, and you die after reaching it, you get all your health and missiles back
- The difficulty spikes a lot. Some missions it took me 6 attempts (with no checkpoints) to finally complete. Some I did with no thinking at all on the first try. Fleet Destruction is a good example - it took me a long time to work out how to get enough points without being shot down. Followed by a mission where you just fly through a canyon then shoot down a small number of helicopters.
- The boss fights are boring. There's a few missions where an enemy plane shows up that defies the laws of physics, jinks out of the way of missles and is impossible to hit, so you just fly around aimlessly for 10 minutes trying to get an angle to shoot at it

While the story can be a bit wild and weird, and hard to understand, this game, much like Doom, is more about the gameplay.

This is not an aerial combat simulator with all pilots and environments acting the way would in the real world. However, it's realistic enough to make you feel like you're in exciting dogfights with all kinds of aircraft based on their real world counterparts. Now, there are indeed some fictional aircraft that fly and bank more like magic flying objects - which gets super annoying sometimes. And don't expect your wing-men to do anything. NO OTHER PILOT IN THIS ENTIRE AIR FORCE WILL HELP YOU DO ANYTHING! They are props to make the combat look more realistic. You are the only pilot that matters, and you have to do everything in every mission single-handed. Of course, that's to be expected because, again, this NOT a simulator. 

The game's plot is that you're a criminal forced conscripted into military service against your will, and who is mistreated until you prove yourself worthy of a pardon, and where they put you BACK into service with the regular military. You will strike military and civilian targets all over. And if all of this sounds like a BUNCH OF WAR CRIMES, you are CORRECT. The game's plot is just one huge WAR CRIME, that you ignore for the sake of having fun. 

And fun this is. I had to take it in small doses, as the missions get more hilariously challenging - because your superiors have no idea how to execute joint strike operations, sending in jets where helicopters would be way better. But, whatever - Just have fun, and ignore that you were forced into military service for 1/2 the game.",1676859958,1676859958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing 7 now, I find myself going back over and over - even after finishing the campaign three times now. 
Completionist Mode has taken over -- Incredible replayability. 

My biggest 'issue' being the incompatibility with any joystick, other than the one sanctioned by the game. Fully understanding that the game was never designed to be compatible (plug n play) with whichever peripheral one might want to [nose]dive in with; the lack of any update to the game, even opening up more options is where I get a little bummed. 

However, this does not abate my desire to play or the rush and enjoyment I experience while playing (just need to do some research, take some specific steps, and it should be doable!)

- The story is a little hit-or-miss for me (including the DLC missions.) A lot of unfinished business, if you will - curiosities left wafting in the proverbial wind. In the end, it has it's blockbuster missions, several opportunities to really implement your cunning and wit, strategize, and so on.  After a couple of completions, you are also [likely] left with some challenging challenges to conquer (medals, player stats) 
-Multiplayer, I've only spent a handful of sorties-worth playing so far.  Initially, it was unexpected and in the face. Everything is ramped up to 10. A little time (a few matches) will have you more capable of survival; a sizable store of earned credits (from campaign, freeplay) will bring you up to par even quicker - just keep in mind, some people are stupid-good at a game like this (yes, even without actual cheating - the full use of a three dimensional space governed by [artificially simulated] physics quite closely resembling that of our experience(s) in the real world, is well complimented by a good grasp and understanding of it.

In no way is a firm understanding of physics required to enjoy this or any other flight simulator, but it can be a benefit. (lol)

Great game. Great replayability. Controller controls are good+. Controller options are.. meh (at the express level)
Would, will and do recommend!

I put the game away for a while, and came back for a bit after watching Top Gun, but the missions here are still bad. Frankly I felt dogfighting in Star Wars Squadrons was better than AC7.

The game framework has a lot of potential- Nice looking aircraft with differing special weapons that make them perform different (ex: the aging F-14 can still outperform an F-35 in bomber interception with its phoenix (LAAM) missiles, A F-18 carries LASM that make it great against ships, however an F-35 or F-22 will be better in dogfighting with better agility).

However a lot of the missions are made annoying by gimmicks- short time limits, sand storms/thunder storms blinding you and hiding enemies while the clock counts down, missiles out of nowhere if you leave the clouds that are not evaded with flares , tunnels not much bigger than the collision boxes of many fighters on mission 20 (get the ground defense upgrade it seems to make the plane collision box smaller), etc.

A comment I read about another game holds true here: ""it's not made to be fun, it's made to be a challenge"" basically instead of crafting a well balanced game they rely on a player's inability to accept the ""mission failed"" prompt, and just put it down. In the absence of a better option (not a lot of good flight combat games on Steam) I have kept working on getting past some missions over time in the hopes the next one will be more fun- usually not though. Remember when games used to be made to be both fun and a balanced challenge?

As an Earl who holds an extensive collection of video games, I've played all sorts of flight simulators, but this one truly stands out. Not because of its beautiful graphics and immersive gameplay, but because of the existential questions it raises.

Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown explores the theme of human agency and responsibility, which is reflected through its intricate story, where the characters are forced to question their own actions and their effect on others. The game, through its portrayal of warfare, poses a philosophical question about the very essence of humanity and its capacity for destruction. It asks us whether or not we should accept the destructive power that we wield or use it for the greater good.

Moreover, the game delves deep into the concept of free will, as it allows the players to make their own choices, affecting the outcome of the story. By offering players the choice to make decisions and follow their own path, the game highlights the importance of individual will and the impact it can have on the world.

In essence, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is more than just a video game; it is a thought-provoking experience that challenges the player's perspective on human action and morality. It reminds us that we have the power to make choices, and with that power comes great responsibility. For this reason, I would say that Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is a must-play for anyone who values introspection and reflection, as it will undoubtedly leave you with a deeper understanding of the nature of human existence.",1676484120,1676484120,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I remember playing the PS2's ""Holy Trinity"" ([i]5[/i], [i]Zero[/i], and [i]4[/i]--in that order**) at a time when the seventh generation of video game consoles (PS3, Xbox 360) were starting to ""trend."" Even with the Trinity's now-archaic graphics, they still had a charm that stayed with you. Was it the admittedly cheesy, yet lore-rich stories and worldbuilding? The memorable, memeable and anime-like characters and antagonists? Was it how the games made the player character feel like an actual ace? Was it Keiki Kobayashi's awesome music? Or perhaps it was the lovingly rendered combat aircraft with their unique quirks and weaponry?

(**Side note, I also played a bit of [i]6[/i], but wasn't able to clear it--much less play with the DLC planes--because of the whole ""console exclusivity"" thing back then.)

In any case, I wondered when I could return to Strangereal, and what it would look like if it were available on multiple platforms with current-gen graphics.

[i]Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown[/i] is the answer.

[b][i][u]Ace Combat 7 - The Good, Bad and Ugly[/u][/i][/b]

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*] The return to Strangereal. And all the tropes/lore/worldbuilding related to it.
[*] Nostalgic call-backs (and some calls forward) to previous games.
[*] Breathtakingly good graphics. And I thought [i]6[/i] would hold the gold standard for good [i]Ace Combat[/i] graphics.
[*] Weather effects that can affect your flying. Clouds reduce visibility and cause your plane to ice up, but nerf lasers and can help you lose enemy missile lock. Crosswinds can mess up your flight path, lightning can mess up your HUD (and lower your altitude), and sandstorms combine the worst (and best) of clouds and crosswinds (thankfully only in that one mission).
[*] The music. (Keiki Kobayashi does it again!)
[*] A good set of challenging, yet rewarding DLC missions. ([i]""If I can't watch Marine-chan...""[/i])
[*] Free-LC. As much as I hate the ""Modern Gaming(TM)"" trend of overwhelming the buyer with a truckload of DLC and MTX, I do appreciate Project ACES not leaving base-game fans in the lurch with free-LC skins and emblems.
[*] The [i]Top Gun: Maverick[/i] collab. It's a good bet that the genesis of most present-day military aviation fans was from watching the seminal late 80's film, [i]Top Gun[/i], and that same movie also inspired Project ACES. Talk about coming full circle.
[*] A small, but fairly active modding community. (Though sadly only on PC.)
[/list]

[b]The Bad and Ugly:[/b]
[list]
[*] No ""Definitive Edition."" The closest thing is an ""Ultimate Edition"" that's available only in Japan, and even then doesn't include the ""F-4E Phantom II + 3 Skins"" DLC pack. What is this, Ubisoft? (*vomit noises*) And on that note...
[*] The aforementioned ""Modern Gaming(TM)"" trend of overwhelming the buyer with a truckload of paid DLC. And then there's the FOMO-inducing uncertainty over how long the [i]Top Gun: Maverick[/i] DLC will last. (Flashbacks of [i]Ace Combat 6[/i]'s [i]iDOLM@STER[/i] DLC planes being removed from the Xbox LIVE Marketplace in 2016.)
[*] A bare-bones Multiplayer mode with a non-existent anti-cheat system. No additional (co-op) multiplayer game modes (a-la [i]Ace Combat: Infinity[/i]), an option to create private rooms with passwords (if any), and griefing cheaters who hot-join to ruin the multiplayer experience for an already dwindling playerbase.
[*] Multiplayer multi-platform crossplay? Zilch (though probably for the best under current circumstances).
[*] Nerfed superplanes. But out of all the superplanes that got hit hard by the balance nerfbat, none have it worse than [i]Zero[/i]'s ADFX-01 Morgan. (Partly because of the weather effects [affects TLS], partly because of multiplayer balancing [MPBM].)
[*] Not really a fan of the 8AAM/AGM, especially with its tendency to sometimes lock two or more missiles on one target (only useful if a target's pretty tanky like F-22s, Su-57s, MiG-31s, YF-23s[?] Tu-160s, actual tanks, Aegis Ashores, large cargo planes or cruisers/battlecruisers) and waste ammo. And if there's a 6AAM, why isn't the 6AGM a thing? (The number ""6"" looking like a capital ""G""?)
[*] In-game Music Player doesn't play multiplayer music from the older [i]Ace Combat[/i] games and the [i]Top Gun[/i] music remixes. (Unless those are unlocked by, well, playing multiplayer[?].)
[/list]

[b][i]Other Notes:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*] If you do want to buy the DLC, go for the Season Pass and then the DLC plane packs/bundles to get the most bang for your buck. Wait for a sale if you have to, the DLC bundles have gone as low as 50% off so far.
[*] I'll be doing DLC Pack/Bundle reviews on their respective pages. 
[/list]

[b]My Anniversary Updates Wishlist (Better Late Than Never):[/b]
[list]
[*] Comprehensive multiplayer updates (anti-cheat and create private rooms with passwords included).
[*] Rework the Onboard Self-Defense Jammer part as a way to increase countermeasure (chaff/flares) and IEWS charges (at least for single-player). And/or include a new part in the multiplayer aircraft tree that does the same thing (keep it at lvl. 1 if it's too OP to go higher).
[*] White, Black and Grey digital camo skin for the MiG-29. (a.k.a.: The Ghost[s] of Kyiv)
[*] [i]Iron Eagle[/i] skin for the F-16.
[*] A friendly shout-out to [i]Project Wingman[/i] in the form of Monarch's (two-seater) plane skins.
[*] Emblems for the rest of [i]iDOLM@STER[/i]'s 765 Pro and 346 Pro girls, or better yet:
[*] Bring back the [i]iDOLM@STER[/i] plane skins as free-LC. (Bonus points for contemporary versions of the 765 Pro girls, new skins for the 346 Pro girls, and colored missile trails.)
[/list]

[b][i]The Verdict/TL;DR:[/i][/b]
- A welcome return to Strangereal with a single-player experience that's reminiscent of the PS2 ""Holy Trinity,"" but somewhat bogged down by rudimentary multiplayer, multiple paid DLC (while acknowledging there are worse examples) and the lack of a ""Definitive Edition"" that includes all of them.

[b]4/5 Stars.[/b] (If all DLC was included in one big Definitive Edition, this would at least be a 4.5, if not a 5.)

Meu primeiro contato com mundo do Ace Combat foi pelo Ace Combat 3 (NTSC-U) nos bons tempos de PlayStation 1. Lembro-me perfeitamente do meu amigo me emprestando esse jogo, falando que era de ""nave"" e que era bem difícil (não saiu da terceira missão) e eu topei pelo suposto desafio. Com falas iniciais de ""Engage"" ou ""Intercept"", ""Bullseye"", ""Caution, damage"" durante missões, dentre outros, fui me divertindo com a vastidão de fases que o jogo proporcionava, junto a diversas aeronaves diferentes de nosso mundo (algumas somente similares em visual). Strangereal não era uma palavra familiar, o jogo em si foi ""castrado"" quando saiu do Japão (2 CDs) e virou um mero Arcade como Air Combat e Air Combat 22, nem mesmo se tinha elementos de compra e venda de aeronaves do Ace Combat 2 (jogo que, ironicamente, conheci e joguei bem depois do Ace Combat Zero).

Na chegada do PlayStation 2, eu clamei pelos jogos Ace Combat de tal plataforma, tanto que Zero foi o primeiro jogo quando adquiri a plataforma e eu fiquei em todo hype possível para os outros jogos. Por algum motivo eu não conseguia encontrar o Ace Combat 4, mas o 5 foi deveras fácil.

Porém houve um choque um pouco desagradável, inclusive quando se tratou de enredo e narrativa.

Ace Combat 3 (NTSC-U) mal contexto tinha, somente um punhado de informações jogadas estilo Metal Black, G-Darius ou qualquer outro jogo Arcade dos anos 90 (ou meados de 80). Ace Combat 2 foi mais elaborado, mas Ace Combat Zero conseguiu se superar com seu vasto enredo sobre uma guerra que dividiu nações, opiniões e foi o tapete vermelho para o advento de algumas ideologias mais extremas. Com diversas nações envolvidas, muito se deu pra tirar desse jogo, assim como do 4 e do 5, mas com menos impacto.

Todavia, o meu ponto, agora, parte-se do ""nichismo"" da NAMCO em querer prospectar uma fanbase diferente com uma jogada de enredo estilo anime e personagens com características bem comparáveis ao Shonen. Apesar de ter sido lançado 2 anos antes do Zero, Ace Combat 5, com a tentativa dos desenvolvedores em promover uma ""aproximação maior do jogador com os personagens"", debruçou-se numa caracterização desnecessária dos seus aliados, empobrecendo um pouco a narrativa e preenchendo buracos de criatividade com clichés. Quando cheguei no Ace Combat 6 (fiz questão de comprar o Xbox 360 só para poder jogá-lo), decepcionei-me mais ainda com a evolução reversa que foi-me proporcionada, desta vez não somente pela narrativa e enredo fraquíssimos, como também pelas novas mecânicas desastrosas que aplicaram no jogo numa tentativa frustrada de dar aquele ar de ""muitas unidades em combate para enriquecer o campo de batalha"".

Recuso-me a falar sobre Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, quem já jogou e possui ao menos dois neurônios funcionando já vai entender.

Após um certo tempo e alguns jogos catastróficos, eles voltam mais uma vez com outro jogo exclusivo (eles não aprendem), chamado Ace Combat Infinity. Eu não tive interesse em comprar o PS3, larguei o Ace Combat de lado, mas fiquei com aquela falta de um bom jogo de aeronaves de combate. O jogo não foi muito bem aclamado, já que muitos jogadores raiz reclamavam de um uso de certo 'combustível' para realizar missões, fora as microtransações que infestaram o jogo junto às diversas atualizações. O jogo foi aceitável, mas poderia ter sido bem melhor (isso não querendo dizer que NAMCO e Project Aces estavam no desespero, mas já dizendo).

Depois de anos em hiato, e com o lançamento do ilustre Project Wingman, NAMCO se sentiu no dever de lançar algo ao mesmo nível, senão superior, mais robusto, com muito mais características e algumas do próprio Infinity. Fãs ficaram 'hypados' com o anúncio e aquele trailer daquelas aeronaves em combate, mostrando as bandeiras de Osea e Erusea, da mesma forma de (mais uma) outra aeronave gigante que serviria de ""chefe"" para derrubarmos. Houve pré-venda, muitos, inclusive eu, já adquirimos de cara na hora que ofertaram.

Mas foi outro desastre de narrativa e o enredo foi pior que Morbius.

Como se já não bastasse a decepção no enredo do jogo em si, recheado de 'cliches', momentos altamente cringe estilo Ace Combat 5, versão kumbaya, e péssima implementação de personagens que colocaram em risco a lore inteira do Ace Combat, implicando num ""reboot"" em alguns aspectos da série, destruindo a herança e legado de alguns títulos impressionantes, como 3, 4, Zero e X, o multiplayer conseguiu cavar mais fundo a cova da NAMCO (Bandai NAMCO agora), com dois modos absolutamente ridículos que tentaram seguir das febres do nicho dos First-Person Shooter, como Call of Duty e PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, respectivamente, sendo Team Deathmatch e Battle Royale.

Team Deathmatch, como o próprio nome sugere, times (somente 2) lutando pela supremacia, porém somente abatendo uns aos outros (alvos extras, competição PVE/PVP? Esqueça).
Battle Royale, por outro lado, seria algo do tipo 64 aeronaves? 32? Mapa com 64x64 ou 128x128 quilômetros? 256x256? Você está pedindo demais. Dou-lhe 8 aeronaves numa embalagem de geladeira e olhe lá.

Última vez que toquei nesse jogo foi há quase 2 anos atrás. Esperei por muito tempo uma atualização, uma esperança de que o jogo voltasse a valer a pena de jogar e ser devidamente 'rejogável', mas, depois daquelas três missões do Senhor Dez Milhões, fiquei bem cabisbaixo.

E tinha como piorar mais ainda. Você quer um novo modo de multiplayer? Espere enquanto aloco toda a equipe para unicamente em banir jogadores que utilizaram trapaças e realizaram outras atividades maliciosas. Você quer mais aeronaves? Quer usar aquela sua favorita do seu jogo favorito ou uma pintura específica que você guarda no coração? Pague por eles. (Existem 'mods', para quem não sabe). Filme está para lançar? Por que não extrair mais leite desta vaca moribunda e esbelta?

O jogo tinha muita capacidade e até um mero jogo que começou com crowdfunding conseguiu ser infinitamente melhor, completo e com planos futuros a frente (planos que podem ser tão grandes quanto o jogo em si e eu pagaria com prazer se fosse DLC, assim como meu outro favorito, Stellaris).

O mais triste é ver que os desenvolvedores do Project Wingman se inspiraram no Ace Combat, eram fãs assim como eu e vocês, mas tenho quase certeza de que estão tão decepcionados quanto eu (e as mentes sanas da fanbase), tão decepcionados quanto Elon Musk quando Neil Armstrong, um herói para ele, disse que o projeto do SpaceX e vôos comerciais espaciais eram uma catástrofe.

Mas, é aquilo, se tem bajulador pra comprar e não se arrepender, sempre terá títulos catastróficos assim e status quo seguirá o mesmo, usando nostalgia para vender, mas sem entregar com sua devida dignidade.",1551447586,1675886370,False,3,0,0.501437902450561523,0,True,False,False

Already played through this plenty of times on PS4 + the VR Exclusive Campaign, but saw a too good steam sale and re-bought this for PC, including my idea of essential DLC's.

Regardless if it were on sale or not, I highly recommend this!
For a PC port, it's very well optimized!
Even a mid-range PC could handle this game, as long as you have a dedicated GPU or a decent APU.

As for gameplay, it is by far the best in the series.
Aside from High-G turns which were introduced in Ace Combat 6 (Xbox 360 Exclusive), you have clouds to deal with. The latter can affect your aircraft's overall abilities and maneuverability. It adds more strategy in the game vs. the previous titles. It's a double-edged sword to keep it short, but when used correctly, it can yield victorious results in a dogfight.

Of course this isn't Ace Combat without its amazing soundtrack, composed by the venerable Keiki Kobayashi!
There are moments where the soundtrack will either pause or intensify in certain story scenes/events in missions.

The story, it is basically what you would expect in an Ace Combat title. It always starts with a rookie pilot racking up their kills to a point they become feared by opposing forces and a rival of a venerable enemy ace from said opposing forces. Then you got your waifu figures, and cutscenes giving a glimpse of the opposing side, seeing who really sent the game's two nations into fighting the whole time.
#BelkaDidNothingWrong

There are quite a few things I wish were brought back into this however...
-Squadron Commands 
 *Introduced in Ace Combat 5, last seen in Ace Combat 6 with additional features.

-Squadron Plane and Weapon Selection
*Introduced in Ace Combat 5 but only limited to planes, Zero only lets you change SP weapon, 6 lets you do both.

-Plane Animations/Interactions while in the hangar or before a sortie 
 *Animations were a thing since Ace Combat 5 but interactions were introduced in Zero where you push a button and the plane will close its canopy while all the moving bits do their thing. (1/2)
 *The interactions were taken a step further in 6 wherein you could inspect the cockpit, and move the ailerons, flaps, elevators, etc. manually while in the hangar as if you were flying the plane but stationary. (2/2)

-Mission Choices
*Ace Combat 3 was the first to implement this with multiple story paths, Ace Combat Zero had its own solid concept which ace styles and operation choices, alongside with Ace Combat X Skies of Deception's mission paths that affect other missions and the story's outcome.

-Co-op or Versus Co-op
*Ace Combat Infinity had fun PvE modes where two teams of players fight against enemy AI and try to get the highest kill scores possible until the end of the match. Whichever team/squadron that has the most points wins. This would be a great ice breaker from the sweaty PvP Dogfights where meta planes, set-ups and etc. would be less of a problem and still breathe more life into the Multiplayer aspect of Ace Combat 7.

All these nitpicks aside, I knew that Ace Combat 7 went through development hell, considering its well deserved success at the end of it.
I'm sure some, if not most of these past features will be re-implemented in their next title.

Give this game a shot and the praise it deserves!
Be patient with it, even I struggled when played my first AC game back on PS2 in childhood.
You'll eventually get the hang of how the controls work, locking on targets, etc.

I mean, the graphics are vastly improved obviously and there are some gimmick weapons now but the core gameplay is still the very same as well as the interface when flying around and locking missiles onto enemies. 
What I really liked was that they really nailed the atmosphere. I really enjoyed flying around and the game showed me how cool these planes are. 
I finished the game in roughly 15h which easily could've been less because of 2 reasons.
1. The game kinda gave me this constant feeling that I will not achieve the mission goal in time. The timer in the top left corner of the screen and the constant stressed out radio calls in my ear made me fly more risky. This basically lead to several re-dos of missions whenever I crashed or got shot down. And since the checkpoints are ackwardly placed that meant repeating a 10-15 minute part of the mission several times, Getting shot at is especially nervewracking when you can't clear out non-objective targets to give you more room to breath without risking a barrage of rockets on your ass, because you feel like the time will run out otherwise. Especially in combination with the fact that the missions take unexpected turns, it felt like I had to focus on objectives only without taking care of non-objective targets. 
Also the story is absolutly bonkers. I don't know if it it because of me skipping so many games of the series or the actual writing but after 15h and a whole campagain, I still only got a general sense of what the game wanted to tell me. I still don't really know which country is which and it didn't help that the game introduced several other countries as plot devices later on. Also, telling a story in-mission and over radio calls while me plane is pursued by 1829 missiles at once, is always a brave decision. 
Other than that, I had a good time and I'm looking forward to the next entry. But not at full price :)",1675192705,1675192705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The campaign is filled with excellent missions with action and surprisingly some puzzle solving as well. 

Its not that easy, you will crash, fail missions, get shot down - and there are no checkpoints. 
You could be on a 20 minute mission - crash on the last minute - and have to start again. 
But once you figure out what is required - either it be tactic or setup - you will want to try again and get that S ranking on the mission. 

There is a big tree of upgrades and planes for you to grind out 

Multiplayer is ok - easy enough to find servers, you will be flying in circles a lot - its the best and quickest way to get credits and unlock the planes. 

Graphically it holds up - you can tell a lot of care and detail went into modelling the planes - but this is not a sim, don't expect perfection here. 

Overall - I have enjoyed my time in Ace Combat - it can be infuriating or exhilarating and I'm here for the ride.

It is to flight sims what something like Forza Horizon is to racing games - something that's way more realistic than a Mario Kart or Ridge Racer, and focuses on gorgeous presentation of fully licensed vehicles, but which nonetheless takes a lot of liberties to give you a fun experience moreso than a strict simulation.

It is the first mainline entry in the series since 2007's Ace Combat 6 (X360), so it was the revival of a dormant series. This arcade sim flight combat genre is one that was really popular back in the day with Ace Combat 4, 5, Zero, and the very similar Rogue Squadron games, but which has basically ceased to exist in recent years. I don't know why that is, but I'm glad it's been revived.

---{ Graphics and Art Direction }---
☐ I want to live in this world
☑️ Beautiful
☐ Functional
☐ Bad

One of the fortes of the game, for sure. The art direction is excellent so that, even running with the settings turned down on Steam Deck, the game looks gorgeous. The planes are (with one exception) all real and modelled with enough care to make /r/warplaneporn blush; the clouds are beautifully rendered; as you pass through them tiny droplets form on the camera and refract sunlight as you emerge from them again; sunsets are like photos. Weak point is ground and building textures, but if you’re close enough to see those you’re about to crash. 

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Hall of fame
☑️ Keeps me coming back for more
☐ Fun enough for a few hours
☐ Watch paint dry instead

The other forte. The controls are wonderful and there’s real joy in zipping about dogfighting enemies. It’s just plain simple fun. 

---{ Story / Writing / Lore }---
☐ Deserves a Pulitzer
☐ Wouldn’t be out of place on a bookshelf
☐ Nothing special
☑️ Written by teenagers
☐ No Story

Awful. The plot and characterizations are barely intelligible drivel. You can skip story cutscenes, but unfortunately a lot of the stupidity is shoved down your throat during mission briefings, which you kind of need to pay attention to because they tell you what your objective is.

---{ Music and Audio }---
☐ Earned a permanent spot in my playlist
☑️ Enjoyable
☐ I didn’t notice it
☑️ Mute immediately

Music is good, though not as good as some previous entries. Planes sound great. Unfortunately, the terrible writing continues to be forced down your throat during missions as your wingmates chatter stupid shit nonstop. I would suggest muting it, but unfortunately the radio chatter sometimes give you important mission updates that are essential for you to know what you’re supposed to do. 

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Walking simulator
☐ You can technically die, but you probably won’t
☑️ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☑️ Frustrating
☐ Dark Souls

Not exactly Dark Souls, but surprisingly difficult. Basic enemies are no pushovers and will dogfight you hard. Even on Normal, some missions needed multiple runs before I succeeded. I would say it sometimes leans into frustrating territory. One particular type of enemy is almost unfair in its mobility, and too many missions have multiple « mission updates » where the goalposts are moved in the middle of the action. You usually get checkpoints when this happens, but it’s annoying. Sometimes the new objectives don’t match the kit you’ve brought on your plane, and if you want to back out and change your loadout you have to start the mission over from the beginning.

---{ System Requirements }---
☐ Could run on a Samsung smart fridge
☑️ Modern console or decent PC
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

Runs great on Deck

---{ Length }---
☐ <10 hours
☑️ 10-25 hours
☐ 25-100 hours
☐ Hundreds of hours, if you want

About 15 hours to play through campaign, although these games are designed to be played through multiple times - you won’t be able to unlock all planes on your first playthrough for example.

---{ Value }---
☐ Buy it twice
☐ Worth full price
☑️ If it's on sale
☐ Not recommended

Overall 7/10 - there’s the bones of a stellar game here, but it’s a bit buried behind some poor mission designs and writing that saps your will to go on. Only recommend this if you’re a fan of the genre and you can plug your ears sometimes. Otherwise not recommended.",1674860864,1674860864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- It is Ace Combat and it is finally on PC  
- None of that Assault Horizon nonesense just plain good old Ace Combat gameplay.  
- //edit: Denuvo has been removed 

Con:  
- Game was delayed after console launch.  
- No Ultrawide Support (there are some user made solutions on WSGF, but this really should be officially supported)  
- No Field of View slider (if Forza Horizon 4 and even Anthem can have FOV Sliders, so can this!)  
- Flight Sticks are only supported for Thrustmaster, because Thrustmaster has some promotional contract with the Developer, but they only thought about Consoles so only the Thrusmaster HOTAS Flight Sticks that happen to work on Xbox and PS4 as well as PC are supported. -> so Xbox gamepad it is. (i hope you like stick drift)  
- VR Missions one year exclusive to PS4, don't expect them to add it to PC after that time.  
- They sell a Season Pass, don't tell us what is inside or when the content is being released, i would have liked to support this game with more money to welcome them on PC as i love the Ace Combat series, but i'm not buying content unless i know if its single or multiplayer.  
- The game has been released a while ago now and i find the Patch Support lacking. The game doesn't have huge technical issues but there have been few patches and the latest one didn't even have patchnotes posted.  

Well, those are the technical pro's and con's.  

The game is very much fun, and i do recommend it to anybody who ever played and liked any title in the AC series and to anyone who wants a simple short Arcade Jet Shooter game.  

Sadly this is a lazy Console Port and it is obvious that PC has been an afterthought for the Developer, none of this is rocket science to address but they just don't seem to care.",1554658082,1674839066,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

FIrst, squad is naught but formality. ""Mantain element""? Hah! That aside, why couldn't they bring feature of older titles like choosing wingmen's aircrafts and commanding them? At least make player capable to command AI wingmen and their kills is counted as squad leader's so players don't have to be frustrated if their kills are stolen. And also, I do really wish there's time where I can change my wingmen's aircrafts like Ace Combat 5 did in the future. Then the story and levels, I find it as strong as Ace Combat 4, okay a bit stronger since there are less ""destroy until certain amount of score reached"". Quite straightforward. I don't have issue with that except three striking Osea, Erusea, and even nation aren't felt necessary because the enemy is still Erusea, the enemy we're facing from start, and we're playing for Osea or coalition cause. Compare that to Blaze's story as Osean soldier which see him fight against radicals of Osean and Yuktobanian and his involvement along with his squad and people they who support the cause to rescue the leaders for respective nation. And also I think Project Wingman is better at making single player story.
Even all the drawbacks I've mentioned before, using back the Strangereal to the game is something is good to see. And story about princess itself is quite serviceable, from a princess that declares the war for brighter future only for her to see how bad battles and war could be, even her people are divided. So finally she wanted to redeem herself, by doing some risque acts near the end of story. And then finally, Ace Combat 7 brings post-stall maneuvers without QTE like Ace Combat Assault Horizon. Also, combination of Strangereal world and more recent technology made the world more beautiful. Despite the beauty, my computer that is mid can keep the FPS consistent and smooth animation. This is something that I found in Ace Combat 7 but not in Project Wingman (of course it's reasonable, since PW gives more enemies to shoot and the gamr is full of bright orange-red lights). Plus some additional stuffs like checkpoint making 4 tier of difficulties instead of five are welcome. Control is easy that using keyboard (and mouse) for me is enough to enjoy the game.

The gameplay is similar to the previous games but it still manages to keep me interested. You'll do everything from destroying ground targets, sinking fleets, providing escort, and dogfighting other pilots and you're given lots of choices on how to do it. Ace Combat 7 isn't lacking depth. The game added new things like a weather system which change battle conditions in drastic ways. Some people understandably find the weather system to be annoying, as it makes even basic actions like navigating and finding targets harder, but I appreciate the new layer of challenge in a game which can already be challenging at times. 

The campaign is very replayable. You can't do everything in one playthrough. You won't unlock every plane in one playthrough but your progress carries over to the next run. You'll likely have missed out on challenges on a normal playthrough, like shooting down every enemy Ace pilot. The hardest difficulty isn't available until after the first playthrough. You don't even unlock plane skins until the second playthrough. There's even a multiplayer mode I haven't touched yet, which undoubtedly makes the game more replayable.

Ace Combat 7 doesn't reinvent the wheel but that's not a bad thing in this case. It reminds me of the legendary PS2 trilogy of Ace Combat games it's not too far removed from the PS1 games.

This game went on sale and honestly just had to give it a shot.   got it on sale for I think 9.99.  
this game by just as a flying game and not part of the AC series.  it was an alright arcade game.   I got it on sale and helped with some of the bad taste i had when i first tried the game at full price.   

I tried to appreciate development of this game but it still just wasn't a great game.    a few extra planes some better models with more polygons.  I understand this is a semi-realistic arcade flight style game and I just hoped they pushed closer to realistic.  

 I honestly feel like it was just repeat of Ace combat 5.  fly a mission and defend a base getting attacked.  defend and counter strike - something happens and now you are the hero/protagonist and all other pilots hate your presence in the air until you show them that you are the ACE.    missions feel similar.  a super structure of vehicle shows up and drones attack.  oh no. run away.   engage elsewhere super weapon able to fire large scale weapons and avoid the circles where the bombs blow up.  survive and go again later.   attempt rescue of important political figure.  fails.   fly a mission around radars attack a base.  main enemy shows up.   do a surprise attack and fly through a canyon under radar.   there are people guard posts with spot lights in the canyon that if they see you you fail the mission but can hear a jet flying at low altitude near them.   ( understand arcade but come on)  insert a couple more missions and chase the boss underground through a tunnel underground and fight underground and blow him/it up. yay end campaign.  

I personally wont buy another AC series game again unless they revamp their flight style.  
again the game by its self and not comparing it to anything.  its an alright game almost 4 out 5.   but for me.  this game was a good way to spend several hours playing but once it was done did not want to go back through and replay the campaign.  

sorry for such a sourpuss review.  if you like arcade style flight games this would be a great game.  if you haven't played the AC series again a great game to experience.  In my opinion this game has done so well because of nostalgia compared to breaking the limits of game development.  




(first review July of 2019)-
Ace Combat 7... I have been a fan of AC series for a while.  AC 4-6.   So when i saw they had 7 in the oven.. I was a little more than excited about the release.  And just as i was to my father... this game was to me... A disappointment.   so here is the run down.  

Graphics pretty good.  a couple moving gauges in the cockpit.  okay thank you.   sound ehhh 50/50/have nothing good or bad.  that is about it.   played the game on the hardest difficulty played for about and hour and a half and just could feel the pain.  like taking a puppy from a kid.  The good hurt.   I was hoping that this game that came out almost 12 years after the last one was going to tap into something more.   NOPE for the price of 59.99 you get the same physics/handling/and terrible AI that you would get from a game that is 15-12 years old.  but hey the water affect on the canopy while doing mach jesus makes it worth it.  

So if you are new to flight ""sims"" go ahead i think you will like it.  If you have a little bit more experience with games like this or you are looking for the new and revamped installment of Ace Combat.

It's story only challenges your patience and left me feeling or thinking jackshit except writing my disappointment and describing the disengagement. At least they didnt start rapping or play the racecard all the time. Actually one part of the story is sort of unexpected non-pc in that regard, but I wont spoil that part if you actually wanna buy the game. But I doubt it would manage to create any wowzers.

The videos are really nice looking , the average grafics are good, but the pacing of the storytelling feels just weird. It tries to be poetic and fails mostly. Would rather watch Snake talking about nanomachines or just  watch some action flic, because there is just not much that I even care to remember here.

Gameplay was ok at times but I see no point getting more airplanes since most missions feel rather tedious and dull. I wish they'd just embrace the arcade part more, ditch the expensive licenses and did more gameplay testing / design more cool enemies, a sense of accomplishment... 

Instead you just slow down , do a u-turn-  shoot missile, hope enemy does come from the right angle or else missile of course misses despite lock on or just fly in their face and shoot minigun... or force yourself to reaally fly super slow. Actually a lot of time thats the key to victory..being slow..in an action game.. ok.
A shit ton of time the game creates tension by protecting someone or something or stuff thats hard to miss (have fun crashing against tunnelwalls, flying against walls in a hall , yes a hall,  etc) . Is it even an action game ? A patience game ? A dont hit anything accidentally game ?  OH the terrible checkpoints at times.
A few missions are a bit of a tech spectacle, the clouds are nice and the first thunder is cool... but that doesnt make it a classic , especially with time moving on. 

I'd give it a middle thumb, but that does not exist so there it goes, a thumb down to balance the other reviews eh ? No hard feelings..

Flight stick controls work, but i couldnt change the sensitivity of the stick inputs, only mouse sensitivity can be changed.  
Gameplay is good, but the lack of ability to change the yaw axis, basically breaking pitch and roll out to two different sticks on a controller or map yaw to a mouse x axis instead of using a keyboard makes it so any BF player who has flown like that for years has to relearn controls to be able to enjoy this game.",1673292869,1673292869,False,1,0,0.497942358255386353,1,True,False,False

And oh boy this game is spectacular, although it only does well what it set out to do, which is an arcade flight game.

Visuals and sounds are really good, but I would've preferred it if there were actual damage marks such as bullet holes or lingering fire effects instead of a small burst of flame that goes away after a few seconds. Engine sounds are also pretty quiet, but I've heard that they're very audible in VR mode, so give that a try if it feels underwhelming in the main game.

Gameplay and flight mechanics are in line with my previous flight sim experience, and they're pretty tight. Highly recommended to use a controller as it's pretty frustrating to play with a mouse (possible, but had to bind pitching up/down to the back/forward buttons). I was a bit surprised when there were no blackouts/redouts when doing consecutive high-G turns, but having played through the campaign at least once I hope they will never add them in because it'd be impossible to play.

The story on the other hand is in a pretty weird spot. It's not bad, but as the 7th main installment in the series, the game assumes you have a general understanding of the preceding plot events and characters, which can be tough for a lot of people who have this as their first AC game. But there are a lot of YTers out there who do a pretty good job at summing up the previous AC stories to give you better context of AC7, so it's not exactly a huge problem.

Aside from the main campaign, there are 3 DLC missions that I would recommend getting via the Top Gun Maverick Ultimate Edition during a sale to save the most money possible (it's 80% off so don't be tempted at any time during the normal prices). DLC planes are up to personal preference as they're quite pricey and not in any way necessary to enjoy the full game (note that the Season Pass [b] DO NOT [/b] unlock access to all the DLC planes, only the 3 specified in the description alongside the extra missions).

Story is sub-par with complex background and annoying NPC's, unlocks are pricey and required too many missions to unlock planes and parts. Missions are often boring, tying you on a leash: escort a cargo helicopter or plane, stay in the clouds, remain as low altitude as possible ... You are rarely free to just fight other jets. Mission will often require you to pick a specific jet to use a specific special weapon (like long range air to ground missiles) to help you complete objectives. Some mission will have a secret objective who would require a completely different plane then the one you choose for the main mission.  

Overall its not a bad title but I was expecting a lot more freedom for an arcade type jet game ...

So I ended up replaying every mission where you have to get a certain score in x minutes because there aren't, or i couldn't find, any weapons to effectively destroy ground units.  One mission has you guiding in bombs by holding you cross-hair on a target for a few seconds while constantly being shot at by missiles etc.  It's fine because there are 10 or so targets but a similar mechanic happens again over the course of a handful of missions where to even figure out if you should be shooting at any target, you have to ID it by flying close with it in the middle of your screen for what seems to be way too long.  Another mission where you need to shoot trucks that blip in and out of radar for whatever reason.  I gave up on the game in the fly into the death star mission these games all seem to love because it's a maze of nonsense where I'm constantly crashing.  The tech tree is another source of frustration because it's 1) too zoomed in to view any reasonable amount of info for what to get and 2) an annoyingly long little animation plays every single time you purchase something.

This game is a lot more playable to a non-flight combat avid player, its a lot more ""arcade"" like than DCS.

however, the controls and options are absolutely terrible.

There is not even mouse support in the menus.
The most basic options any game that ""supports"" flight sticks should have are not there.
You cannot adjust sensitivity or set deadzones, which makes the game almost unplayable with my setup.

So you have to stick to a gamepad. But even there you cannot set any buttons or any sensitivities whatsoever.

If you want to play this game with a flight-stick: don't, unless you don't mind messing around with 3rd party tools and the games files for (probably unsatisfactory) results

For some reason, Steam refuses outright to detect my Extreme Pro 3D, and in AC7 the controls weren't mapped by default in the game. Even though the controller was detected I couldn't control anything, and from what I found searching around it's a somewhat common issue (both with Steam not detecting, and button/axis mapping within AC7). With no joystick mapping available within the game's options, I had to edit the input.ini file in C:\Users\*user*\AppData\Local\BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\ACE COMBAT 7\Config\Input.ini with the proper mappings and it works alright with some fine-tuning. Just wanted to leave this as a heads up, maybe save somebody a headache.

That being said,

Very fun, easy to get into and just enough customization to feel meaningful without getting complicated. I'm only on the 6 or 7th mission, and so far the missions have been engaging and varied in objective with a pretty decent story line (as far as I've seen, anyway).

I don't see the credits roll often for games, but this was a fun and engaging game through most of the 15 hour campaign. The controls took some getting used to playing on the controller, but you can't rebind any of the controls however. The 20 missions were varied enough while still focusing on what this game does best, and thats bombing runs. Sadly dogfighting became monotonous near the end, watching enemies on radar and in sight just defy the laws of physics (and sometimes reality). The missile warnings were  annoying as well near the end and you can't mute it without muting the game. The story was fun but yet a little disjointed.

It's still a pretty good game, it felt amazing launching multi missile projectiles and seeing them all reach their target in unison on the ground, dodging rockets, and pulling maneuvers like a Top Gun graduate. I only wish the controls were rebindable, the AI didn't cheat so much, and the storytelling be a little better.

oh, you think dogfighting is the best part of the game, do you? here, have a fucking POS mission where you hunt down trucks in the middle of a storm. bombing is fun, isn't it? it isn't? well have about ten more

this game is at its best when you're dogfighting, but unfortunately i think that dogfighting was only about 30-40% of the actual campaign, at least in a way that actually progresses the mission. the rest of the 60-70% is hitting static targets on the ground, repeatedly doing bombing runs to grind up your score/fulfill a target quota (fucking trucks in the storm) and accepting that C- so you could get to the fun bits again.

I understand that bombing is integral to the core of aircraft combat in general, but ""oh wow they're so faithful to the aircraft experience"" was the last thing I was thinking every time i failed a point mission because I didn't hit enough or I was shot down when the POS allied AIs did nothing to distract the four enemies shooting missiles at me simultaneously while I was hitting targets.

Unironically the best point mission was where you hit the oil fields, and it wasn't because it was fun; it was because it was conveniently fast due to chain reaction explosions and that meant I could get to the dogfighting parts quicker, rather than true entertainment.

I like this game a lot, even if I seem really negative toward one particular aspect of it. But that aspect is so bad that those aforementioned missions are impossible if you went down an aircraft tree branch that has subpar bombers, requiring you to farm (yes, farm) earlier missions or the multiplayer for currency so you can unlock better bombers. In my case, I straight up rage uninstalled the game, didn't play it for nearly a year, and literally restarted the campaign with my previous progress made in the aircraft tree. It's so bad that I don't think I can in all good faith tell new people to buy AC7 without adding in a lot of asterisks about how shit the bombing/ground attack segments are and how prolific they are.

TL;DR game really fun when you're doing literally everything but bombing, which is unfortunately 60-70% of the overall game

Let me know if there's an alternative way to look at this, because I would love a way to stomach those bombing run missions without wanting to punch my screen out. (or tell me git gud, I'll take that too lol)",1672036056,1672036056,False,0,0,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

The game looks gorgeous, huge, beautifully rendered landscapes and models, I know they're using tricks and it looks better because its small and far away, so they don't have to model them as well to make them look good, but good god does everything look bloody amazing. Its incredibly cinematic and really lives up to the AAA standard. 

Soundtrack is legendary, definitely go out of your pay to put a bunch in your playlist tier.  It fits the mood so well, and something about it makes it ""feel"" like ""flying high"" music. They nailed the theme. 

Gameplay will take hours to learn, but once you do it becomes very smooth. Even by the end I still don't really know any fancy manoeuvres that I see on YouTube and Reddit, and I still got through feeling like a badass. 

Story is B tier, great, but not quite ""obsess over the lore tier"", maybe if I play more if the games I'll get into the lore more. It seems like something thats up my alley. 

The closest game to AC7 in terms of scope, quality, and fun that comes to mind is Yakuza 0.

Really good story that expands on events of previous games (you can play this game as a standalone thing, but you'll understand a lot more if you play at least Ace Combat 04 and 5), a soundtrack score that has no business being this good (a staple of Ace Combat and just Namco games in general), and the most important thing, thrilling arcade dogfighting action that really makes you feel like an awesome ace who can do anything in a fighter jet. 

In terms of graphics, it's not just the most beautiful Ace Combat game to date (obviously), it's one of the most stunning flying games I've played, period. The way vortices form around the aircraft, the effects of condensation when you fly inside of clouds, everything is beautiful and cinematic in this game. 

Flight dynamics are phenomenal for what this game is, an arcade dogfighting game, and hit just the right spot of being accessible and arcade enough to implement it's over the top cinematic missions, while still having enough realism to give you control over the plane. This is NOT a simulator, you have no control over any of the systems of the aircraft, you carry dozens of missiles, and obviously the physics are very simplified.  Falcon BMS, DCS, IL-2 Sturmovik, etc, those are simulators, and they're great at simulating. This isn't a simulator and isn't trying to be one. 

There's also a lot of choices when it comes to aircraft and loadouts. Unlike the buying and selling of planes and weapons of the PS2 game where you could essentially experiment with different planes without having to commit to them, in this game there's a progression tree of aircraft, upgrades and weapons, and once you spend your points, you can't get them back. So there's a certain weight to decisions there, especially during campaign gameplay, although I believe it is possible to eventually unlock everything through multiplayer. I feel neutral towards this system as the simpler ""just buy and sell whatever you want"" approach of Ace Combat 04, 5 and Zero worked really well for me. But it does add a bit more depth and progression to the campaign.

Overall in terms of gameplay, I think this is the best game so far, it is the most polished, has the best flight dynamics, controls really well on both gamepad and more hobbyist input options like HOTAS and flight sticks (which you really don't need for this game, but definitely makes the experience a lot cooler and more immersive), and it also has multiplayer which might add a bit more longevity to the gameplay after you're done with the campaign, if that's your cup of tea. In terms of story, it is a solid entry in the series, although I still rank 5 (The Unsung War) and Zero (The Belkan War) above it. Speaking of Zero, it is a bit sad that the Ace Style system from that game (which I liked to call the ""war crime meter"") never made a return, would be awesome to have your playstyle influence the story like it did in that game. There's also some points of the plot which I found a bit forced (I won't enter in details to avoid spoiling anything), but overall, it's a good story regardless.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",1671668776,1671668776,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Fun gameplay
Enjoyed being able to fly about in my favourite jets
Easy to learn, bit more difficult to master

Cons:
In order to make ""boss fights"" more difficult, the enemy planes will do manoeuvres which would cause 60,000Gs and tear the pilot/plane in half (I saw planes literally stop midair and turn 180 degrees right in front of me). Not very realistic if that bothers you
Campaign story is hilariously dramatic, not just a ""we're fighting a war"" dramatic, I'm talking over performing voice acting/insane decision making dramatic. I am told this is classic Ace Combat/Japanese storytelling in video games so if you like that style then you'll be fine!

The story itself is entertaining enough, the cutscenes are like from 2000s so that was nice nostalgia for me. The game runs perfectly but I do have high-end PC.

*Spoilers in black boxes*

I wouldn't recommend this to someone starting out Ace Combat as a series. Find a PS2, or... figure out other ways... to play AC4, AC5, and AC0 before playing this game. You'll be lost in the story without them. The story is a bit of a mess and begins to ""unwind itself"" the longer you play. Not only that, but it doesn't feel like the stakes are that high in this title, compared to the previous titles. Finally, most of the characters feel forgettable and/or unlikable. I was not a fan of Scrap Queen.  [spoiler] What I feel the game lacked was a strong villain, because the DLC villain was incredible. He made the DLC feel better than the actual campaign because he brought in higher stakes. Corsette or the Belkan scientist could've gone that route, too. (""Proper and calm in the spotlight, but evolves to be unhinged like Torres with UAV's instead of nukes) [/spoiler] However, Count is awesome. Even though he became one of my favorite Ace Combat characters, he can't make up for the blandness of the other characters.

Now, the good:
The soundtrack slaps. It's unfathomably good. It's like the Seraphim from the Bible came down to create Ace Combat OST's. The gameplay and graphics kick ass. It plays very well and looks great while doing it. I thought the utilization of cloud cover would be more akin to a gimmick, but turns out I utilized it quite a bit. It felt natural. The PSM was fun to utilize too, even though I didn't use it as much. The plane selection was great, too. The ""parts"" seem overwhelming at first, but then becomes simple to understand after a mission or 2.

Overall: 8/10

Story - Not only is it the worst story in the Ace Combat franchise, it is the worst story I have ever encountered. There are more moments that you go ""Who one EARTH would even consider that a good plan?!"" and plotholes than there are plot. Like, I ranted about the terrible story even before I was halfway through my first playthrough. You're better of just skipping cutscenes completely. 0/10, absolutely atrocious.

When I listened to music for it on YouTube and saw a mission, I thought it looked like it might be a lot of fun. Based on the comments from people who loved it, I was wondering if it was like Ace Combat 5 with a super well crafted storyline that would make me feel powerful emotions.

Instead, it felt like an Ace Combat 6 knockoff. Most of the characters who are supposed to be your 'allies' are just annoying, and I don't really find them memorable. I didn't care at all about the person that was supposed to be my rival, and my ultimate goal fell pretty flat. It also didn't help that I never really saw the threat posed by the airships. In Ace Combat 6, you see the airship's interference constantly becoming an obstacle and a threat that they agreed needed to be dealt with. But in AC7, it seems like they're just off somewhere and barely a footnote in most situations.

I felt like the ending came too quickly, and I felt really underwhelmed when it was all over. This game apparently received a lot of high praise from people, but I just do not understand why.

Never had this problem before on any other flight game.  Who doesn't love spending an hour tweaking emulation software before jumping into the latest fighter jet game?!

Game play is okay I guess but it feels very different from previous titles in the sense of how your enemies fly their aircraft. They go slow when you are on their six and fly at near stall speeds which usually forces you to overshoot if you aren't disciplined with your throttle. It's tolerable at first but gets rather annoying as the game progresses with almost every single enemy aircraft flying at stall speeds. I don't remember the other games doing that, but then again its been awhile since I played the originals . It makes some of the boss fights more enjoyable though, as the aces tend to actually fly at faster speeds.

The story feels half-baked and is very confusing at times. Lots of info dumps, and lots of cut scenes that look right out of a B movie. Dialogue is particularly cheesy even for an Ace Combat game. Most of the characters are forgettable with a few that are actually likable with the rest being edge-lords. This was the one area I was expecting this game to shine as all (most) of the previous games tended to have engaging stories and characters. 

The game is pretty good looking though, I will give it that much, and as I said it does feel like how an Ace Combat game should feel like. I guess it just doesn't have the spirit the originals on the PS2 had. I wouldn't recommend this game over the others like Zero and The Unsung War, but since it is the only one that can run on a modern PC with out an emulator then I guess its worth it.

I'd recommend getting Project Wingman instead, You'll have more fun with that and it does a better job at capturing the soul of Ace Combat.",1670204603,1670204603,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It also uses scripts to its detriment, it is full of escort and defense missions and there's always a timer to watch out for. Now, where does that leave us? That's a good question.

Like its ancestor Air Combat, AC7 is an arcade game with a bit of simualtion. True, planes can stall but regaining their control when that happens is fairly easy. There are points, score, a notation at the end of each mission (with S being the best) and a timer. It couldn't be more arcade except by making you fight giant alien ships while riding a dragon shooting lasers. And although the aliens and the dragons aren't here, the lasers are though. You'll also find a lot of F planes and Su/Mig in there; you obtain them by buying them and you can add parts to them, which you also have to buy. Once you're in the middle of the enemy forces, your plane will constantly reminds you that a missile is coming for you, and indeed, enemies are abound. Fortunately, your plane carries almost a hundred missiles on it, just don't ask me where they are hidden, but the action is continued and you will have to constantly be on your toes.

The story takes place in a fictive world, on a continent called... Osea? Usea? Erusea? And that's one of the problems with this game, even after multiple hours of playtime I still don't know who is who. At least, I know you play the role of a new pilot nicknamed Trigger that will become a part of a conflict between two countries, or was it one country and a federation? Now, who has started the war and for what? Well, that's the story of AC7. Along the way, you'll encounter your Sasuke/Sephiroth type rival (= mysterious and super strong) here nicknamed Mister X, make new allies (that are quite forgettable, except for two characters), and attempt to end a war. By the way, about your allies, they are totally useless. In AC6, you were able to choose their planes and give them order. Here, it's like they do no damage to enemies. If they shoot.

One thing I can't stress enough is that AC7 is a fun game. It's quite arcade, full of action and ""Missile!» My problems with the game don't come from the gameplay in itself but rather from what surrounds it.

One thing that's particular is the design of the missions. They are indeed very varied and you won't find a lot of repetition while playing AC7, which is a good thing (at least, if you're new to the franchise). On the other hand, those, in my opinion, are badly designed because of the constraints they put on you. Although the missions are varied, in their attempt to bring something new, the designers also made them annoying: one time your radar won't work, the other time you'll have to watch out for the wind or the lightning, the other time it will be the light (sic), etc. Furthermore, all the missions are timed and sometimes very strictly. They are also a lot of escort/protect missions; mostly, when I had to restart, it was because I weren't able to protect something or someone. It is not as grating as protecting a certain Ashley but you have to be prepared for that. Also, and this one might be a very personal grievances, but in order to make things more cinematic, the game don't hesitate to use scripts. Thus, a boss won't go down until the game has decided it's time for it to go down even if you manage to nuke it to Pluton; and that also means you will often have a ""surprise"" encounter when you think you're finally finished with a mission. Lastly, although there are checkpoints, those are used sparingly, therefore making you sometimes restart a whole 10 minutes of play. 

Because of the design of the missions, AC7 is the hardest Ace Combat I've played. I've only played three of them before playing this game, Ace Combat 2, Ace Combat 6 and Ace Combat: Assault Horizon but never have I felt greatly frustrated while playing them. In fact, the Ace Combat games were always in my eyes some sort of comfort food, a game to play when I want to chill and have fun. But it isn't really the case with AC7, even in normal. You might have to retry some missions a fair amount of time, moreso if you're not familiar with the franchise. And to make things worse, there are some hidden mechanics that can make things easier which are never mentioned like the post stall maneuvers or how to make the camera follow a target (by holding Y/triangle).

So, like I said, where does that leave us? It's an Ace Combat. That's the first thing that sprung to my mind the first time I played it. I always liked the franchise and AC7 didn't betray my expectations. It didn't really surprise me though but I guess you can only go that far with an arcade flight game. If you're a fan, chances are great you will like it. If you're not, there might be a certain period of time needed to adjust yourself and gain some automatisms. I had fun while playing but it also frustrated me more than I expected, so in the end I don't regret buying it for only 19,99€. So, yes, you can go for it, especially on sale.

With the controls set to advanced the game has a steep learning curve and throws a lot of crazy missions at you early on in the game.

I think that alone is criminal, seeing as that some levels can take an hour on their own due to how many times you have to restart, with mission 6 and 19 being the greatest offenders. The game on a technical and gameplay level are of a high quality, aside from most of the English voice acting which can be pretty half arsed; its a Japanese developer/publisher so its to be somewhat expected. There are a variety of aircraft you can fly, but as for where to fly them, you can only replay completed campaign missions. There aren't any other modes like wave defence, shorter skirmish missions, or dogfight against tougher ai outside the campaign. Your only incentive is to try campaign missions again is for a higher score, which feels very lacking for its price point. Even with the campaign, most missions felt very samey, with only a small handful of missions I went ""wow, this feels amazing, with missions 14 and 16 being standout.

I’m pretty sure that the game that I played when I was very little at my friends house, was ace combat on the ps1. Her older brother wouldn’t let me play it for long and I think we took turns. It was a fun game. It’s so nice to finally play the game again but this time with better graphics, and what I think is the most recent version of the game. I didn’t know that there were so many of these games. Do they all have a story? I thought it was just a realistic jet fighter simulator where all you do is missions?


The good
Graphics are great
Story is alright
Music is really good
Controls are pretty great
Customization with parts for your craft and buying new planes is cool
The 3 story dlcs are alright. The 10 million, being the best one.
There’s a casual easy mode.
Every mission was a new set piece.
This game reminds me of starfox 64 in some parts but with no characters that you care about.

The bad
You can only change the vertical or horizontal controls to inverted from the main menu, once you are in the game and playing, when you go to the controls and change it, it doesn’t work. It only works for a gamepad.

No way to change resolution. It is locked to whatever the game thinks your resolution is.

The main character that we play doesn’t talk, I actually thought that he might be a drone but I remember a character mentioning, after a completed mission, that he smiled while they were in the room after some successful mission. I truly think it hurts the story so much and the writer makes the characters mention how Trigger doesn’t talk even while they are talking to him. And at one point near the every end of the game, a character asks Trigger if someone is okay and of course he doesn’t answer. It’s just terrible.

Two parts in the story that come to mind, is just too anime like or done with no logic. One where the princess prefers to parachute down some very tall structure even though a battle just occurred. And another in two DLC’s where in the first 1, the intro with the brother and sister. He calls her an idiot and she’s just like “Don’t call me an idiot or I’ll kill you” or something. Like to me, they are acting like children and bickering the whole time and yet they are flying these very expensive jets. Oh and they also did some aerial thing when they into battle. It was like they were flaunting and showing off. I dunno, I didn’t like it cause they were so edgy and I didn’t feel like it fit the game that we were playing.

The brown woman in the story really serves no purpose.

Don’t know who most of the characters in the story are.

Some people in the story don’t seem to die even though we killed them? I guess everyone ejects from their plane but don’t show up on the screen?

The game kinda forces you to do the uturn move in the game for battles. Because I had to do it a lot, to try and quickly get a kill, it ended up hurting my hands and arms.

You don’t gain money when you fail a mission. Imagine playing a mission for 15-25 minutes and then making a mistake and just hitting a wall or letting a missle hit you. The sunk cost is your time and your life.  You should gain the money or at least half of what you got when you lost.

Timers in missions. There shouldn’t be any. They always sucked.

I think the game expected players to redo missions and grind for money? Cause one aircraft is good for mission 15.

I hate mission 15. It sucked so much. I had to use a DLC planes b to beat it cause I was tired of losing because I just missed 4k points. Though, I am thankful that a DLC plane helped me beat it.

I feel like maybe the extra DLC planes aren’t worth it. The game is better being played normally by upgrading your planes and buying new ones along the way. Some DLC planes are really OP though.

Scripted battles. When you know it’s happening, it’s like why? Trying to uturn and wasting time trying to get a lock on sucks so much, cause the boss enemy will never give you an opening to attack it. And when you do get a hit, it doesn’t matter cause they have endless health. I pretty much don’t like how they programmed the ai, I guess.

Cloud saving only

Can’t switch to easy mode at any time during the story.

Don’t really like how the enemy ai is programmed and how it always felt I was doing everything. Though in the DLCs, my ai teammates appeared to actually help me which was odd to see.

Multiplayer doesn’t work and it single-handedly tanks my internet when I try.


Conclusion
Anyways, the game is good and it truly had some epic moments in the game. I personally feel that the game is best played on easy or probably the casual easy mode and I wish I did for the main story. I just wanted a story with my realistic planes, going fast, and seeing things blow up. If there ever is a new one, I would totally play on casual.",1669806342,1669842004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember it fondly, especially our 1v1 skirmishes that were always super intense. Our battles were legendary, and took a long time because we wouldn't let the other get a lock for very long.
I remember the campaign as well. A collection of highly varied, objective-based skirmishes, which were not very complicated to complete but terribly difficult to master. The voice work was fantastic.

This game is a very similar feeling. I have long since burned out of PvP multiplayer, so I can't speak to that, but the campaign is amazing so far. The plane details, gameplay, graphics, sounds, and voice work are all amazingly done. 
I am also running this game on integrated graphics. My Ryzen 5 3400G can successfully run this game with everything on High, and rarely dips below 30fps. It feels well optimized, while also looking absolutely stellar.
The story also feels very familiar. It is a heavy political conflict, leading into war. I found myself wanting to keep playing just to see how things develop, which is how I view a GOOD STORY. There is a heavy plot twist at one point that actually made me start to feel things deep in my heart, and it leads into where I am now as I write this review.

The gameplay is why I'm writing this review. It feels just like the amazing time I used to have while playing AC04 at my friend's house, all those years ago. Flying at 2250+m/s through frozen clouds that are actually freezing your plane over, being able to fire anti-ground cluster bombs to clear out AA guns that cannot even track you at that velocity, and barely maneuvering successfully through gigantic rock spires while dodging fire from an opponent with as much flight skill as you, WHILE ALSO DODGING LIGHTNING... It's a genuine intense rush and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

The plane unlocks feel pretty fair, and while I've gotten a few in so far, the benefits come from the mid-point unlocks between planes with upgrades; allowing you to hold more missiles, be more resistant to having your plane freeze over, improved turn rate, and many more.

Well, this is a great option for [spoiler] you maverick wannabes [/spoiler] air combat lovers who want to have a good time other than war thunder and dcs. Mechanics are simple to understand and the overall sceneries in the game are just splendid. And particularly the soundtracks ingame [spoiler] hail to Kobayashi-san [/spoiler] are incredibly phenomenal, which every game throughout the entire franchise possesses, they will not let you down.

[h1] About the Singleplayer... [/h1]
[b] The base game [/b]
The lore is okay-ish, storytelling is fine [strike] hey at least you got a pretty nice looking waifu [/strike] and it's not very hard to figure out the whole background and it's totally not a problem if you haven't played any of the previous games. The missions are time limited and can be a challenge if you are new to the game, with more practice you won't have any difficulties dealing with them [strike] yes you can speedrun the whole game[/strike] . Almost every different weapon in the game offers a unique playstyle, you can focus heavy strike on a single target with highly maneuverable QAAMs, or getting rid of a large enemy group with 4/6/8AAMs. The game almost offers a varieties of futuristic weapons like the Tactical Laser System [strike] an onboard laserpointer [/strike], the EML [strike] basically a railgun [/strike], MPBMs [strike] multipurpose tactical nukes ;) [/strike] and so on. Some of the missions provides special mechanics [spoiler] contains but not limited to: low altitude breakthrough/valley runs/gigantic super weapons/tUnNels [/spoiler] which add more fun to the campaign.
[b] The DLC missions [/b]
Definitely worth the price, has another huge air to air only combat apart from the base campaign, more mechanics and adds a fantastic and attractive villain, play it yourself for the best experience.
[b] The mods [/b]
Yes this game supports modding and oh boy, the communities are just went all out. You can have completely new aircrafts with new weapons from iconic aircrafts in previous titles or aircrafts in real life, new hud, new effects, new skins for aircrafts and even maps with a completely different setting. Apart from those you can also have rebalanced AIs which gives you a more challenging campaign and new mechanics which tweak from the aircraft cannon firerates to new missile tracking methods. Still, i recommend trying the mods out after at least finishing the original campaign once.

[h1] About the Multiplayer... [/h1]
[u] PLEASE DO PLAY THE SINGLEPLAYER FIRST BEFORE TRYING MP [/u]
[b] Overall situation [/b]
This is where all things went down, only two game modes are available and they are max 8 players free for alls and max    4v4 team death match. Apart from those two you can also set for 1v1 games but it's really time consuming if you want to get your skills up. Also, many experienced players wander around and they will not give you a good time in MP and can easily ruin your experience and make you ragequit, [i] Seriously, you have been warned [/i], prepare for being killed over and over again if you are rookies to the game. [spoiler] Stay away from those lobbies with ""join midmatch"" turned off and theres only one player in it, you will most likely get rekt very hard. [/spoiler]
[b] Mechanics [/b]
For battle royals [spoiler] not the one you expected [/spoiler] or free for all is competing for the best, the match ends when anyone reaches 100k score. For team death matches, mostly are the same as the battle royal mode except the game ends when any of the teams reaching 250k score. In both game modes, if a player got a score thats high enough, he would receive stars varying from 1 to 3, which in turn maximum triples the scores you get from killing them. Remember to configure your aircraft set in the hangar first before entering any match or you will be end up on a stock F16. Inside the hanger you get access to different parts that can boost your aircrafts and weapons performance dramatically, but the slots and options are limited so be wise on your loadout.
[b] Some warnings [/b]
Be very mentally prepared before entering MP, it's P2P based so connection quality will impact your experience a lot. Furthermore, the game has NO anti cheat methods and it's very painful when encountering one. A point worth mentioning is that a lot of the advanced techniques, for instance backwards flying [spoiler] yes you see that correct, flying literally backwards not upside down [/spoiler] would behave very similar to cheating but they are different fundamentally.

[h1] TL;DR[/h1]
Good game if you like arcade flying with exciting combats, the SP part is around 30 hours with many content, mods add a lot more fun to the game and theres plenty of them, the MP experience is basically trash if you are not willing to spend time taking hits and sharping your skills and learning stuff. Not worth the full price, get it when on discount.

The story is back in the universe the franchise belongs in and the references/return to locations in the previous games was refreshing, and something that separates Ace Combat from lazy writing set in the real world (USA v Russia/China/Iran/Terrorists). This game is peak in terms of combat mechanics, with new features like turbulence, lightning, duststorm radar masking, and storms throwing off heat seeking missiles occasionally. Dogfight mode was rightfully scrapped, and return to the classic style of aerial combat was a welcomed one. I also personally loved the introduction of having to identify targets before fighting, as well as keeping post-stall maneuvers. I do have mixed feelings about the futuristic weapons, but given the in-universe timeline, previous games in said universe, and nostalgia for them it wasn't unreasonable. As always, Ace Combat once again has mastered symphonies to set the tone. The mission radio chatter was on-point, especially during the Spare-Squadron portion of the campaign. Characters like AWACS Bandog, Avril Mead, and Cossette are some of the best developed and fleshed out of the entire franchise, I just wish I could say the same about any of the wingmates or antagonists. Dr Schroeder dropped his vendetta with the tiniest of convincing, given the fact he went so far to instigate a global war to avenge his country's nuclear-suicide after losing a war it started... Mihaly A. Shilage was just ""only cares about flying and wants decent opponents"". It felt like a lazy knock-off of Yellow 13, but AC4 had the depth of his character explored in the context of caretaking a war-orphaned boy whose parents he inadvertently killed, took pride in looking after his wingmates (unlike Mihaly), and showed mercy on kids who personally assisted the resistance in bombing his runway and helping kill his closest wingmate. My only other frustration was that the campaign seemed short, but mission variety was excellent. I would've also liked missions that mandated the use of certain aircraft like Assault Horizon's bombing run mission, or the door gunner mission. I also miss formation management from AC:5, as well as the branching story of AC:X.

I mostly enjoy simulator-style games, so i was kinda reluctant to play an arcade game, but after finishing the campaign i can assure you that i would not have this much fun on a simulator, it opened my eyes to a new style of games that always gets me hyped.

The campaign is kinda short yet VERY emotional, it provides an incredible immersion and you can actually feel (personally) what your character feels.
Although the campaing is short, it's far from being the end of the game, it has great replayability and tons of planes, weapons and upgrades to unlock and get even higher scores.

If you fancy competitive gameplay, the multiplayer is pretty accessible, there are some hardcore players but even so it's not hard to get some kills and have fun, and the multiplayer tech-unlocking is pretty extense aswell.

Finally, this game hyped me to ACE COMBAT so much that i'm desperate to play other games on the series, but unfortunatelly they are not available to PC. I greatly recommend it to everyone, BUT PLAY IT ON A CONTROLLER.

What i really love about this game is how you can clearly see the amount of effort that was put into developing it, the graphics are insane (even in my low-end laptop), the gameplay feels REALLY nice and the music is simply perfect and it sets the mood flawlesly for every scene.
The campaign is also incredible, although i want such a big fan of the story, the missions are what made me really enjoy it. The locations, the characters that are involved and the objectives are perfect, and it truly suprised me how fun they were. The missions are genuinely challenging and concluding them is a amazing feeling
The multiplayer is nice, although i wish we could have longer matches or an open world server where we could just mess around with friends, but it is pretty fun to hop onto online rooms and just spend some time

It is definetely one of the best games i ever played, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try it",1669523846,1669523846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not normally one for promoting DLC but I'm sure a great many VR users would pay premium for an implementation of this.

In terms of story, once again Ace Combat has you flying for the evil and dull Osean Air Force against a much more interesting Eruseans, making you constantly root for your enemies and want to defect to the other side.  After Ace Combat 5 and now 7 it feels like the developers want you to hate Osea, and I think it was a big missed opportunity on their part to fly for Erusea since they clearly put way more creative energy into making them.  

Like Ace Combat Zero the game also needlessly leans heavily into the 'World Without Borders' theme, which remains as unnecessary as ever and again detracts from the overall plot.

Overall, the story can be quite cringy at points, but the graphics are quite good and at least its in Strangereal again so it can be forgiven of its faults.  Ace Combat 8 better not be another rerun of flying for the Osean villains though.  Belka and Erusea did nothing wrong.",1597174268,1669498744,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why I still give thumbs up?
+ Amazing graphic

-> You can unlock extra modifications that you can use to enhance your plane

This shouldn't be marked as ""simulation,"" it should be marked as ""arcade!"" The flight physics are terrible, there's no cockpit view and you're missing basic things like an artificial horizon. Why do I have unlimited missiles, but limited flares? Why am I affected by icing but my enemy isn't? Your AI allies are near-useless and are basically just there as plot devices - being able to issue orders, change their target priority, or change their formations would be nice.

Menus and things:
Buying upgrades and things for your aircraft is nice, but skill/tech trees are just expected at this point, and offers nothing compelling like being able to paint your plane pretty colors, or build new planes. The mission playback is a super neat feature, but camera controls are locked, so you miss some of the best thematic elements.The wireframe view had me excited for a moment as a way to actually improve my fighting tactics in review, but it doesn't show critical things like missiles or gunfire, and you can't manipulate the view except to zoom in or out, so you're basically left seeing ""Oh right, that must be the part where I kept taking 1 billion missiles and had to keep dodging instead of fighting (sic, that's 50% of the game).""

Storyline & Pacing:
The voice acting is like Metal Gear Solid 1, which maybe did it for me when I was 10 but is just cringe now. The storyline is in a fictional world that you're dumped into and instantly fails to address the most basic aspect of ""why do I care?"" While it might be an interesting show to watch if they developed the characters, they don't, and the the storyline just feels glued on to the fighter action worse than Modern Warfare 2. Dialogue between your pilots is ultra-trope-y, and makes me hate them. Being able to customize your pilot would be nice so at least you can be semi-invested in your character but you cannot; you may say that you're playing a specific character in the storyline, but are you really? When you're flying your basically just the Silent But Deadly type on par with Claude from GTA3/4. 

Overall:
The game play features the usual flying around in circles, dodging missiles, and stalling out into terrain that most flying games offer without offering anything new. Maybe I'm just not jacked up on mountain dew to appreciate it, but I can say without a doubt I was super-sonically disappointed.

The music is awesome and will give you goosebumps at just the right moments, the cutscenes are STUNNING - Ive got over 500 screenshots simply from quick 'oo that'd make a great background' moments, and the gameplay will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout regardless of whether you have a keyboard, controller, or HOTAS in hand.

I play DCS for the satisfaction of splashing bandits tens of miles away using realistic and fiddly systems and mechanics. I play this game for the adrenaline rush of doing backflips in a 6 fighter strong FFA furball with a dozen missiles on my tail, no flares, and a solid column of rock rapidly closing in on my nose.

My only qualm with the game is the native HOTAS support, but once you know how to edit the required files it's not that much of an issue.

A pretentious story with no likeable and forgettable characters, cut scenes with boring and meaningless exposition.

Enemies consist of mainly drones with an ace thrown in here and there, the only thing good was the graphics, I only played up to mission 8 and didn't upgrade that much, so can't give a fair view on gameplay, but I just found myself turning constantly whilst dodging enemy missiles and this is one of those games where you have to do everything yourself, none of your squad mates help out and the so called pilots you're supposed to help out are aces or something? but they too can't handle a drone themselves and in mission 7 if 1 of them get shot down, its mission failed. I blew all of those drones out of the sky with a A10 which is a slow flying tank... wth?

Really can't see the appeal with these positive reviews, I know its a arcade flight sim, but I'd rather play a proper tedious flight sim to this garbage bin.

The story makes no sense and you quickly ignore it and skip the briefings and cutscenes just to get on with the action. You always end up with enemies which weren't mentioned on the briefings anyway. 

The music is mostly forgettable, previous AC games had much more visceral soundtracks. Not that you can hear it most of the time anyway, over the endless tedious cringey dialogue and the constant 'MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE' warnings. The graphics are okay, but most of the time all you will see is sky or clouds. There is no wow factor. Another flaw is there is no way to change FOV so it is like you are wearing blinkers all the time, this is a serious hindrance on some missions. 

The clouds and weather are a gimmick which quickly gets irritating which interferes with your ability to simply see where you are going, or identify enemies. Several missions require you to identify enemies before being allowed to shoot them. They can shoot at you instantly though, but if you shoot them you get punished by the game. Fair? This game doesn't do fair. It does tedium and frustration. Some missions have a tight arbitrary time limit where if you fail you go way back to an earlier checkpoint and may have to play again for 15 minutes just because you fell short by a few seconds. Don't be surprised if you have to replay some missions dozens of times. 

For normal players I recommend playing on the easiest difficulty (which often is far from easy) and get the 'part' which repairs your plane so you can take more damage. Although you can carry hundreds of missiles, of course you can only carry a handful of flares, so you will either be taking damage regularly or constantly dodging missiles. All while desperately trying to identify enemies against a pale bright sky / clouds, and before the time limit runs out. Mission 17 'Homeward' is particularly horrible for this. 

The PS2 era games still haven't been bettered for gameplay, especially 4 and 5. For a story and voice acting, the unfairly maligned Assault Horizon was much better than anything in AC7's cringey, emo 'anti-war' story which will just make you roll your eyes. You have to keep dialogue on because at times you need to hear instructions of what to do or where to go.

The missions can be very long and you can't save mid mission, so if you get through a particularly tough part and then get stuck on another part, you will either have to sit there for ages while you try again, or quit and lose everything. This isn't a game which respects the player's time, it is designed to irritate you. Even at the end of a mission when it says mission accomplished, you can still fail after that point if you accidentally hit terrain, or fly out of the arena. The mission goes on for another minute while you listen to more tedious unskippable dialogue. The writer should stick to the visual novel shovelware that Japanese devs specialise in and which Steam is full of these days. Get a western writer for the next game, like Assault Horizon had, and a story and characters that actually makes sense and you care about, and the game would be much better for it.",1669280670,1669345543,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a game where you feel like you are flying an airplane [b]PASS[/b]. All planes can and will constantly turn and instantly accelerate. Feels like flying an ufo not a plane

If you are looking for a game with interesting dog fights [b]PASS[/b]. There are only 3 special enemies in this game that you “dogfight”. 1 Dude you fight 3 times and 2 special Drone types and all of those fights were dog shit. There's no real strategy you just keep on turning

If you are looking for interesting gameplay [b]PASS[/b]. The game stays the same from the first to the last mission. No improvements, no new mechanics. Sometimes you get new objectives but the interesting ones are far and few between. Most of them are “Kill all” or “Kill X in Y minutes”

The story is not great imo and more like a very cheesy b movie where you better not try to think about anything. The game also fetishishes the MC in a way that gets really annoying. It is kinda immersion breaking when you have 30 allies circling the last enemy and not attacking because ONLY YOU can do it, it becomes ridiculous.

It is also not really challenging (only played on medium though). I literally never died to aircrafts or came even close to it. I only died to the almighty enemy, the ground. Why? Because half of the map have bad visibility (clouds sandstorms rain etc) which is a really annoying combo when you constantly keep turning

Main campagne doesn't even take 10 hours.

The legacy superplanes such as the Morgan and FALKEN are locked behind DLC despite previous games letting the player simply unlock them in-game. 
The ""upgrade parts"" mechanic is basically just ""lowering the difficulty mode without actually lowering the difficulty mode"", which is funny because the game doesn't actually let you alter the difficulty mode once you begin the campaign, making grinding for upgrade parts mandatory if you have trouble beating a level. 
Missions can auditorily overwhelm you at times with ""MISSILE. MISSILE. MISSILE."" in your ear as multiple radio conversations talk over each other, all the while explosions and roaring jet engines and lock-on noises and all kinds of other audio all plays at the same time. 
Oh, and you can't even change the paint schemes of your plane until you beat the campaign...which I don't really have much interest in playing again anyway.

Basically, pros = it's Ace Combat finally on PC, but cons = it's not a very good Ace Combat game.

I hope that joystick-support would be implemented later on, since I find that playing this game on keyboard and mouse can be a bit difficult. Nevertheless, the beautiful cinematics, captivating soundtracks, and simple gameplay really brings out the highlights to Ace Combat 7.

Update:
Although this game supports only few HOTAS controls, having a gamepad control helps a lot. and I honestly think the DLC missions brought much more quality into the story!

This is not a simulation by any means, but that arguably makes it better. Your standard F/A-18 can and will carry 90 missiles yet not have enough room for 5 flares.

Special weapon variation is so high that you can go from launching eight missiles at a 8th generation fighter piloted by an old man to liquidating some unarmed tanker ship with a crack-filled laser-pen, committing several warcrimes in the process.

You get to fight everything from an oversized boomerang to a boat with more anti-air than insane crew members. What more must be added?

The game often goes on sale for 80%, and if it does i 100% recommend at that price. 60 dollars is a bit steep, but in the event of a beefy sale, pick it up. (get the deluxe edition it comes with the DLC campaign which is by far the best)

The game use unreal engine 4. It's allow to create good picture. Sky and clouds were created from scratch and looks very well. And with different clouds come different weather. Some mission will have clear blue sky and some heavy clouds with rain and lightning. And it's looks absolutely amazing. I am not a pilot so can't compare but for me it is good enough to create sense of immersion. As for ground obviously it's not good as sky. Models for tanks or vehicle not better than in RTS game. Same about amount in details in terrain. Luckily most of time you fly in big heights and if you bombing some things you don't need come to close. The planes well designed and distinguish not just by specs but also by their look. As for characters nothing groundbreaking but it's look decent. Overall it's definitely not next gen of graphic but the game's picture accomplish what it must for this genre.

[h1]SOUNDTRACK[/h1]
Outstanding. One of the best. You probably didn't hear about it because game not that popular. But it's really very good. Each mission have unique soundtrack that reflect what happened on the screen. One vs One, one vs everybody, stealth mission - everything have something special. 

[h1]STORY[/h1]
This is very tricky part. Previously I played in Ace combat 2 (1997) and two spin offs for PSP: ""Sky of Deception"" (2006) and ""Joint Assault"" (2010). Definitely not enough to know lore and background of this fictional world. As preparation I watched summary posted by YouTubeer Ace combat fan where he provided short version of events in previous games. It's definitely helps. You play speechless pilot (which kind annoying element  in 2019) that caught in middle war. After some ""mistake"" he was sent to prison and serve as expendable pilot for most dangerous missions along with another prisoners. The war continue and with it your adventure. The pilot not a single main character (but he is only who playable) so you see same events from different points of view. I like this style. Add to this variuos conversations on radio that help to develop characters a bit more. The game have couple good memorable moments and interesting enough to want to continue. Overall nothing heartbreaking but nothing cringe either. Just remember that this game from Japanese devs.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
Gameplay is divided into two parts. First is preparation for mission. Here you see briefing before launch. Unlike others military based game this part really important. It's provide critical information about weather conditions, day/night cycle, enemy type, enemy awareness about your presence and etc. Then based on what you hear you choose plane, parts and special weapons. It's highly recommended to choose wisely. Otherwise wrong set up can significantly increase difficulty. For example, if it's attack against oil fields bring A-10 with bombs that have big radius of explosion.
Second part is mission itself. The game have 20 mission. Each mission take place in different locations. Their objective are various. It includes seek and destroy, escorts, defense, destroy enough amount of enemies, stealth mission. A lot of dogfight (you can hide in clouds but it can create icing problem) , bombing ground and navy target. Objectives can change on the fly so listen to radio and do what you have been told. Also some missions have unique circumstances. Like bad weather that causes interference in radar and missile locking system, altitude restrictions. I don't to tell more because of spoilers. The game not easy and requires planning before each mission and focus on the objectives. The game have challenges and you feel good when you succeed to overcome it. By beating missions you earn money to unlock new craft, parts and weapons. And you can replay any mission that already have been unlocked. New planes and parts create good progression system that rewards players. Also very important to mention. You should play only with EXPERT control. Otherwise it will hurt your experience.

[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]
Aside single player the game multi-player with 2 modes: team deathmatch and (4 vs 4) and battle royal (8 players) . Not a fan. Unless you have friends it's good cool experience or want to grind in game currency it's not worth it. I wish they implement PvE instead PvP. It will cool fight together in order to bring down huge enemy plain defended by navy/ground forces along side other planes. The game have huge tree with planes and parts to unlock. Also high difficulty and different medals to earn. 

[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1]
I use i5 9600k, GTX 1080; 16GB RAM and Windows 10. I run game on 2560x1440 resolution with max settings (scale 150%). The game runs very smooth, fps between ~70 and 90. Zero crashes. I use XBOX360 controller and it always work. No complaints here.

[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
I am very happy with my purchase. This game offer pretty unique experience that allow you have you to have little glimpse to real piloting. Of course, a lot things were simplified but it never take away fun. I recommend to this game purchase and hope that next game full have full VR support including PC.

It's important to know that this is not in any way a flight simulator - it's a well paced arcade game that happens to feature some real life planes, you do not need to map 50 keys to play - it all works from a controller - or if your prepared for a little hassle, a HOTAS - this requires you to map keys in notepad. Honestly though, I preferred the controller.

Just a note about the DLC to help buyers - the Ultimate Edition does not contain everything, if you want it all - you'll need to buy an extra three packs of three planes and a single plane pack to get it all.  You do not need these, it just gives you more planes to fly.  Be warned, some of the DLC planes are way OP for the campaign and will make it very, very easy.  I suggest a play through with the default planes first before using the DLC ones, but it's up to you.

Overall - Highly recommended.",1669130481,1669130715,True,2,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False

Most of the missions in the campaign have some extremely annoying part to them that ruins the fun of flying. Like the one where you have to hunt down trucks in a sandstorm. You can't see, they barely show up on radar, and there's constant wind blowing you all over the place. I feel like the only reason I managed to finally beat that mission was sheer luck. Way too much of the difficulty comes from cheap gimmicks, instead actual challenging mission design.

And the core problem that makes it all so frustrating is the ever present time limit. If it weren't for that, most of these missions would be way more fun. But the fact that you simply CANNOT take your time and be careful, like any sane pilot would, just ruins the whole thing. I had to redo most missions multiple times, just because I was one target/a few hundred points short when the time ran out.

Plus, I feel like whether or not missiles hit is more up to luck than any skill. Both on you, and on your targets. I can usually just ignore all the incoming missile warnings and never get hit. But I also took down the final super maneuverable drone boss with my first random blind shot that I figured would never hit it. Guess I rolled a natural 20 on that one.

Overall, I would be much more forgiving, and give this a thumbs up, if it weren't for one unforgivable sin: The DLC. The fact that all the best planes are not even available in a $60 game is complete BS. You already have to spend a stupid amount of time grinding free missions or multiplayer if you want all the planes that are actually the base game. But then they expect you to pay over a hundred more on top of that? No thank you!

If I hadn't bought this game when it was $9, I would feel ripped off. And there's no way I'm getting any of the DLC. Not when there's Project Wingman to play instead.",1669124185,1669124185,False,10,0,0.502378344535827637,0,True,False,False

THIS ... I've been looking for! For a long time. As an old school gamer to me it's my Freespace2 meets After Burner kinda dream come true. It plays with enough story, it's easy to pick up and play casually and you can go hardcore nuts with it if you want. ~ *dragging out my OG Wingman Extreme for this. ~ And most importantly: And it Looks and Feels.... AWESOME! 

It's a delicate balance. It can look great and play like crap, or play great and look like shxt.
~ Assault Horizons was just brutal to play and it just WASN'T FUN.

This?! Wifey's going be tearing me away from it all the time... *This is going to take up countless hours I just don't have IRL.
Ever since After Burner in the arcades back in the day I've waited for a bad a$$, gorgeous, easy to play ""Arcade-y"" Jet fighting game. (I'm actually playing this on a 6 button joystick with mouse/trackball at the moment) ... ARCADE style.

Love War Thunder, love Flight/Space Sims... *but this has it's own niche place... Just Turn it Up, play it Loud.... 
and fly balls out. 

It's been on my wishlist forever. Top Gun Maverick Sale Thanksgiving.... 
NO BRAINER! ~ Well worth it... and I'm absolutely LOVING IT!!! A twenty spot for ""this?!?""
Just free-flying around in the TGM F-14 using VR/Virtual Desktop is better and cheaper than kicking it at DnB's for an hour. x'D~

This game is pretty fun for a while, but the longer it goes on the more frustrating it becomes. The standard missile never increases in range, while your aircraft and your enemy's tend to get faster, making late-game dogfighting really frustrating as you spiral in vain to get a lock at close range, then miss because the homing capabilities are pretty bad (unless you get a part deep in the American plane part of the aircraft tree, which I didn't because I like the Russian aircraft and wanted to actually get the last one before the end of the game, which I did barely). In an ironic twist, the A-10 ends up as one of the best planes for combating enemy fighters because it's actually slow enough to stay behind them and not stall, allowing you to effectively use your machine gun. 

But the levels themselves aren't super great for flexibility in aircraft choice. You may be unlocking new fancy interceptors with the actual long range air-to-air missiles, but most of the late game missions are very ground-target based. Without spoiling much, the last mission heavily encourages you to bring a very fast interceptor and then punishes you for doing so by putting you in a very small space that's difficult to maneuver in. The plane I had (Su-57) was actually incapable of going slow enough without stalling, so I had to get very creative in many, many tries. But, if you wanted to bring a slower bomber or a multirole, you'll get severely punished in the first part of the mission.

The story is barely coherent at times and often simply makes no sense whatsoever. Things just sort of happen, and one of the major plot points early on is caused by something that is never given a satisfying explanation for the bizarre events that occur. Actually, there's a couple things that cause major shifts in the story and atmosphere that just aren't explained well at all and act like a thing to just make certain gameplay aspects happen. If you just skip all the story cutscenes, you probably won't be any worse off for it.

Overall though, it's fun enough, and if you can get it on sale it's well worth the money. The last Ace Combat game I played was 4, and there's a neat callback to that one (maybe others too).",1668971074,1668971074,True,2,0,0.524691402912139893,0,True,False,False

Too many scripted events, too many stupid design decisions.
A key mechanic in several missions is to ID the targets before firing, them firing on you is not considered ID of being hostile, neither is getting close enough to read the patches on the pilots arms or count their nasal hairs.
Some targets you will identify at 1.8Km, others you can`t identify 1.8CM with your nose resting between their tail planes.
The ""strong winds"" mechanic...works without any form of logic all the way up to 10,000M above the formation causing the winds and on jets doing better than mach 5.
Guns...why they even bothered putting them in is beyond me, even fully upgraded you could do more damage spitting on target, worse some of the AI have been given godlike missile evasion but the old school technique of smashing them from the sky in a hail of bullets...isn`t available.
The basic missile hell formula with crazy future jets are all there, the developers just managed to get it catastrophically wrong.
I can only hope once again a talented mod team get their hands on this and turn it into something half decent.
The game also has the most stupid blocking of cheaters system i have ever seen...every month you have to suffer a 100Mb update that has then to be integrated into the 12 Gb of game files...just to block a set of people playing multiplayer..its a system even Rube Goldberg or Heath Robinson would look at and say...thats a bit over the top and complex.",1663473399,1668833692,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SPOILER WARNING: Once you finish the campaign you will be able to select any aircraft skins you've unlocked and you can put emblems on them too(Note: Some skins including DLC skins will have restrictions on this). 


Multiplayer is a bit limited in its options compared to most other games, you only get Battle Royal and Team Death Match, but it can still be a lot of fun sometimes. 


Whether you're new to the Ace Combat Series or have been playing the Ace Combat games for a long time like me, this one is a must have if you're looking for flight action games.

AC7 isn't just a fun fly by the seat of your pants experience. It's a story. One told through emotional beats, highs and lows, twists and turns, where you are both the hero and the villain, the sidelined soldier watching the war unfold and the hero. And it's told not through forced cutscenes and set pieces, but across the radio as you are tearing through the skies evading dozens of missiles with an orchestra in the background. This is actually a game you keep on wanting to play to see the story unfold.

The gameplay is not overly challenging if you're looking for something casual to spend 10 hours on, but challenging enough on higher difficulties to unlock everything.

Today the game has broken the 4 million mark in copies sold, so I've finally decided to write a review. Used to play flight simulators in my childhood, but now I'm interested only in multiplayer shooters. For some reason I thought it'd be fun to try Ace Combat because it's actually arcade. It exceeded all my expectations. Altough it's an arcade, immersion is so great. What also amused me is that despite the simple core gameplay, every mission feels so unique. When I finished the game, I felt like I watched one of those life-changing animes or something like that.

Aircraft: 8/10 The most fun aircraft is hidden behind paywalls.

Intensity and immersion: 4/10 Most of the ace pilots are often spawn in and then just are mostly either trying to escape or aren't even loaded to bear for combat. The best characters are paywalled and overall just felt like the dlc were mostly just fanfiction getting tossed in only cause the dev team convinced Bandai to let them add it cause they could slap a price tag on front of it. 

Overall: 31/50 AC:7 is fun but theres plenty of other games that are far more worth your gaming time.

It's the same tried and true AC formula but now prettier. The story is still weird but that's okay. It took me about ten hours to beat the campaign on easy. 

The missions aren't each a consistent length, generally 5-20 minutes. Checkpoints aren't always present or at logical points in the missions so you may have to start some missions from the beginning if you die. In some target-rich missions you can run out of missiles so dying actually puts you at an advantage since it refills your ammo when you resume from checkpoint. 

I really wish that Ace Combat had a random scenario generator for solo or co-op play. Some way to just have fun blasting enemies outside of the structured mission list.

I watched a review video before buying, and the reviewer described this games feel perfectly: ""You know how Forza is like that perfect blend of realism and arcade game play that's super fun? This is like that, but with planes."" Hits the nail right on the head.

To add to this, the story is engaging and the music is fantastic, setting the scene and creating a very intense atmosphere. During missions there's tons of radio chatter, which really completes the feeling that you are the squadron ace, fully participating in the events of the game.

I bought this on sale for like $5 with all the DLC, but it is absolutely worth the full price.

Bonus points: I love any game with a space elevator, even if it's not the best game, but this was I think the best use of a space elevator I've seen in a game. [spoiler] It's not just a cool set piece, which is generally the case. Often times the elevator is destroyed in a spectacle, maybe setting the tone of the story. However, in this case, it ends up being what I really think it should be: a symbol of hope for mankind, showing what we can achieve when we work together. At times, it seems like it may be the root of all evil in the world, which it totally can be, but it comes around!

While arcade-heavy, gameplay is involving, with tense, gripping missions influenced by your loadout and are structured in a way to help the player get his bearings at a pace.

 Apart from phenomenal quality of cinematics and the story, the game opens a door to a wider world, showcased in inner monologues and snippets of backstories. The world lore is rich and the supporting characters outside of our squadron each have their own stories. It is refreshing to see the conflict is not about cartoonishly evil empire vs alternative reality american good guys, kind of which we see in Killzone for example, but a rich, complex world influenced by collective histories of the nations that make it up.

 The soundtrack deserves a special mention - a work of art on its own and perfectly fitting for the noble aerial combat. It sets the mood and reinforces the vision of the world our squadron wages war in, providing a truly immersive experience. It's easy to get lost in the moment, just like in the clouds.

 The way conflict is waged, morals and values of combatants and leaders present a precious noble bright setting. Princess Cossette's sorrow, Mihaly's own longing for the skies and the resolve of his graddaughters provide more meaningful input for the setting and theme than most of the missions and quite honestly despite high flying ambitions, the game fails to reach its ceiling, hampered by one-dimensional writing of supporting characters and sub-par voice acting with the exception for some key characters leaves a few scratches on the otherwise pristine canopy. I know your squadron mate thing is that he's a gambler, but repetitive remarks about betting every 15 seconds make you wish he was dead and quite soon you feel a pang of shame about not feeling guilty he finally was. 

 Beauty of the game and the dignified grace it presents make it all worthwhile, however, and with the wider world to look at, flying somehow falls by the wayside. And that is all well, the war is over now and the skies beyond Earth are now within our reach.",1668174919,1668176364,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

+ Lots of new features (strong wind pushing your aircraft, got hit by thunder, icing mechanic, quick roll for dogfight, flares, enemy missiles indicator, upgrade parts, collision damage won't destroy your aircraft immediately (you can turn it off), etc.)
+ Gameplay is more challenging (I died a lot even in normal difficulty, lol).
+ Great story.
+ Good graphics.
+ Great soundtracks.

- I wish I can turn off the missile warning voice, because it's a little bit annoying, and also it sounds like it says ""nipple"".
- When the mission needs you to get certain amount of scores, the timer for each mission are too short.
- I wish there's a command button just like in AC5, that'll be more fun.
- I can't find anyone on multiplayer mode.

The cinematic cut scenes are hard to tell weither it is video or graphic or BOTH cut together. In one Cut Scene the graphics on the ""Hair Work"" was appeasing to the eyes. I ABSOLUTELY felt IMMERSED with the rain hitting my fighter jets cockpit window and the sun rays and clouds. GET THIS GAME. 

Story Line: (A+)
WELL put together! I felt a sense on emotions... like I was needed / responsible to accomplish something for those in need. I felt like I was APART of the game. Being in the Cockpit gave me a sense that ""I WAS IN FULL CONTROL"". The Story Line made it easy to transition from First Peron Shooter games into Air Combat for the ""First TIme"". Nice slow chill pace. But high pace stress at the same time. Nothing was CHEESY. Getting Locked On Too kept me tight to my seat. Well put together!!!

There's a big space elevator, there are giant robot drones protecting it,  you'll be having a war between Erusea and Usea with a veteran of Belka, you know the deal (these fake countries may have REAL LIFE analogues!! BUT NOT TOO REAL!!). Me, I've always been at war with the People's Republic of Pineland. This game comes off a lot like Area 88 / UN Squadron, with your scrappy group of POW fighters and eventually a long-range carrier group cut off from the main air force. There's a frame story that's really pretty incoherent, and they really could have done without that. I get it, but like... the whole time you can see how it would be better if your character was involved directly with the story.

Anyway, gameplay-wise, if you like other Aces Combat (not including Assault Horizon) you'll like this one, IMO. The grind system / tech tree is severely lacking, requiring too much grind to unlock what you want and causing your planes to get unlocked in a weird order, possibly to sell DLC? I don't know. It certainly doubled, if not tripled, my playtime. It's a good game, but not fun to have to re-run the high points missions over and over to grind out unlocks.

The Season Pass killer sub DLC is excellent! I kind of wish more of the game had been so tightly packed.

Overall, I'd say BUY IT. And maybe a DLC too, they're cheap, save you some grind. I think the season pass has a couple planes and the killer sub DLC, that's probably a deal.",1667614708,1667614708,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know it's important to not fix what isn't broken. but it is a major disappointment that the series refuses to innovate on gameplay mechanics much at all, still even backtracking from AC5 in some areas, and critically lacking a co-op mode or campaign that was offered with Ace Combat Infinity. 

The lack of score-attack missions compared to previous games also hampers replay-ability. I think I have 60 some runs on mission 11, half as many on any other level.

It's beautiful, highly replayable game (8 play-throughs at time of writing), that on its own, is a marvel of gaming, but I can't get over how little is done with what is here.

But!

In the end I got addicted! Even as a Gamepad noob, I had really fun time going through the campaign. The story, cinematics, mission design, action, it was all really fun and captivating.

I'm sure I will play through the campaign several times more, I may even try the PvP side of it. Anyways, to sum up, the look of planes, the feel of flight and the relatively realistic feel the game is giving is quite nice.

I'd strongly recommend every flight enthusiast to play this game. Unlock every plane and try every weapon and system.

The only problem I had was I couldn't record or keep my mission recordings on the side to watch them again or edit them to watch them later or to upload to Youtube etc. For example there was no recording to watch at the last mission. That was such a waste, it's an amazing ending mission and I'd love to watch how I made it again and again.

The story is a bit convoluted (one wonders if there are no things such as lawyers, JAG Corps or flight cameras in the Osean military) but also has many memorable moments, the gameplay is really fun, the soundtrack is AMAZING and there's a ton of replay value (unlocking planes, weapons, upgrades, paint schemes, mission rank, chasing the in-game medals and the achievements, experimenting with different planes, challenge runs, etc) so it's total recommend. 

The DLC missions were fun to play but the story was too goofy get me invested; the DLC planes are super good but it's unfulfilling since you don't unlock them. Online is okay, I guess...  everyone is using the F-22 Raptor with QAAMS, so you will do the same and it turns into a competition to see who hits the other first and when you are the one getting the kills you will get kicked out of the lobby by salty people, so it's better to just play with friends. Also, you only unlock the sound player if you buy the season pass and that's scummy. Despite this, still I played this game for 158 hours.

This game is phenomenal... It feels really good to play. Different moves and flight tricks you can use to get the upper hand against your opponents. A big selection of aircraft to choose from with different types of guns, rockets, upgrades to aircraft. You can basically choose how you want to play the game.

Start off with the more basic aircrafts, but start moving your way up to eventually unlock the kings and queens of flight that rule the sky today, as of Nov 2nd, 2022. And then eventually move into new and experimental aircraft, which will bring you to the god tier, where you can bring the hammer down on your insignificant and unexpecting foes.

There are also different types of missions to play. You have air to air, air to ground, air to sea, boss battles... and all of them do repeat, but each one has it's own little twist on it. Missions where you need to protect an asset, ones where you need to navigate tight passages, destroy targets on the ground and/or air. 

All in all, this game is amazing. Played through it like 3-4 times on my Xbox, then I upgraded to a PC, and decided to get it on here to experience it again. I also recommend a controller, as it will feel better with the arcade-like feeling of the game. A keyboard will work perfectly with it too.

I really liked the PSM mechanic in the game, especially when performing it using a HOTAS, makes it feel like you're a pilot of an alien ship, which cannot be helped more considering one of the weapons in the game, the pulse laser is like the typical starfighter laser cannon. lol

One of the things I wished the game could have or probably should add in the future (if the game continues to receive major updates) from what I have seen from one of the previous games are Co-op missions like in Ace Combat Infinity and not just the PvP the game currently has. In addition, I wish they add some options to readjust the control schemes on the HOTAS, since currently there is no way to properly change the buttons in the game's option itself.

Overall, I think this game was incredible! I truly felt the DLC missions were really one of the most exciting part in the game, mostly because of this energy that always keeps going during each stages.

[b][i] P.S. I think the devs might have been a bit evil for labeling the harder and restricted controls as ""Standard Controls"", while the easier and unrestricted controls as ""Expert Controls"".

In the final mission you have to do a Descent corridor shooter, completely without warning, and I couldn't manage it because the game had spent every other level teaching me to just fly around empty sky.
The plot was pretty dumb and was stolen straight from Gundam and Front Mission.
If you buy the DLCs, you get a plane that is better than the entire tech tree -- which is kinda nice, but at the same time completely defeats the point of grinding points to buy stuff in the tech tree.

This review will be more focused on the game itself rather than the technical compatibility.

Ace Combat 7 is a return to form for the franchise after 12 years since the last numbered title. For the most part, the game succeeds in capturing what fans love about the franchise, mainly Ace Combat 04, 5 and Zero, while also making small improvements to the formula to become one of the best experiences in the franchise.

PROS:
+ Beautiful graphics with nicely detailed aircrafts and 3D clouds that adds more dynamic to flight. Ground textures looks muddy at a closer look but that's to be expected with flight sims and it doesn't effect the overall experience.
+ Solid control schemes. 25 years of getting the controls right has led to one of the best designed controls for the entire franchise. Smooth arcade flight controls that gives you complete control of your aircraft that's perfect for both beginners and veteran players to master.
+Absolutely fantastic level design. With 20 base game missions and 3 DLC missions that will test players in their mastery of flight and battle over an estimated 5+ hour campaign. There are atleast one or two levels that doesn't really come together as you want, but overall the entire campaign is expertly crafted with the last 4 missions and the DLC being among the highlights of the franchise. Add that with the replay value to 100% the game and you got a good package. This is Ace Combat mission design at its absolute best.
+Top tier soundtrack. Keiki Kobayashi and the gang are back at it with the soundtrack which has become iconic in its own right. Archangel, Daredevil, Long Day, and Mimic being among my favorites.
+This game is hard. Perhaps the hardest in the entire franchise. But it's hard in a good way. You will be tested to make the best of what you have and prepare in advance on what plane and weapons to sortie with. I heavily recommend new players to start on Easy and veterans to start at Normal difficulty just to get a feel of the game. Having played all of the games except Ace combat 6, 7 really is a whole different ball game.

CONS:
- Story overall felt like a missed opportunity. It has The Force Awaken syndrome of pandering too much towards fan nostalgia without adding more substance to it. There are certainly highlights like Count and the third half of the story but overall, it's disappointing. Nowhere near the quality of Ace Combat 04, 5 and Zero.
- There's some balancing issues regarding the aircraft selection with the loadout strength being a tad too bias towards American planes and some missiles types feeling useless or underpowered. the biggest glaring issues being that there are only 2 Attacker type planes and having two variants of the F-15C which is unnecessary
- More of a personal preference, but i'm not a fan of the scoring system having time being accounted for. This makes missions like Faceless Soldier that require patients become too hectic to get the S rank for.
- Multiplayer while fun feels very underdeveloped. The lack of co-op introduced in Ace Combat 6 being a glaring omission.
- Another personal preference, but the lack of wingman control feels like a missed opportunity both gameplay wise and story wise. What made the wingmen in Ace Combat 5 and Zero so memorable is partly because you directly lead them in-game to battle with commands and such. AC7 opted to go for the Ace Combat 04 route as a lone wolf but with game's large cast of characters, it ends up making you feel disconnected with the rest of your Squadron and that's a real missed opportunity.
-No VR support outside of the PS4 which is a big missed opportunity.
-Shallow customization options for your aircraft. You can only select skins and place one emblem on your plane which is a big downgrade from Assault Horizon and Infinity where you can color the planes right down to the smoke of the missiles and have up to three separate emblems placed on your craft.

Overall, being a fan of the franchise since its inception, Ace Combat 7 is the game i've been waiting for in a long time for the past decade and it almost fulfill all my expectations that comes with the franchise. It may not be my favorite overall (Zero imo is where the franchise peaked.), but it does everything so well that it's up there among the best. I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for an arcade flight experience wanting to get their Top Gun fix and all that jazz.

-Campaign can be hit or miss, IMO. Too much talking, and you'll end up not knowing what happened as you're focused on piloting more than listening to the radio. Expect the campaign to be layered with plot armor. Expect to be bombarded with missiles that can track you through any maneuver you pull.
-Jets are a slow progression, you'll get the good ones at the end of the game.

a tip before you get started: if you're gonna use a controller, then make sure to set your joystick range to be square instead of a circle, because if it's circular, you get a reduced range of motion. To fix this:

* Poor introduction for new players - not easy to get into in terms of controls as there is very little tutorial - I used a search engine to find some discussions on the controls to answer some of the questions I had. 
* Mute protagonist - your character doesn't have a voice and never interacts with anyone. This is always an immersion-breaker; huge missed opportunity from a story-telling standpoint. 
* Doesn't seem to be much storyline between missions - mostly radio chatter, etc. during the missions which makes it tougher to get into as your character (whose Callsign is ""Trigger""). This is an area of opportunity for the developer if they wanted to bring in more of a story and give the player an opportunity to actually play as a specific character and make narrative choices in conversations, etc. to develop relationships with other characters in the game, from fellow pilots, to commanding officers, to romance opportunities, etc. This would add a lot to the game, IMO as the story flows in a disjointed manner. 
* Targeting system is frustrating at times. At times you'll be in a mission and some additional targets show up that are critical to the mission (like a set of bombers, etc. that you have to quickly take out) - you have no way of tracking them initially; you literally have to just fly around and hope you can find them. You'd think your targeting system could differentiate between target types to find the nearest of a certain type if you're looking for a specific type or the newest on radar, etc. 

Pros: 

* Great graphics & lighting
* Smooth gameplay
* Excellent music during the missions that fit the situations well. 
* Fun combat / controls during flight. Very responsive. 
* No additional nonsense launchers (EA, Ubisoft, Epic, etc.)

Game Length: ~11-12 Hours

Final Rating: 7/10 - this was the first of the Ace Combat series I've played. I have heard the earlier ones are console-exclusive - they should consider remastering them and porting them to PC. I would be interested in checking them out. Overall a solid game - a lot of ways the game could be exponentially better from a storytelling perspective, though, as noted in the Cons area - the main character needs to have more of an identity and absolutely has to have a speaking role / interaction with the other characters - something the much earlier Wing Commander games (90s games that were friggin' awesome) did that helped in this area was having areas to free-roam between missions where you could talk to the other pilots, and even at some points during the series there were romance options, etc which were pretty cool.

I wanted to try a flying game where I didn't have to read a manual and know how to operate a real cockpit but also wasn't on rails and this game nailed it after I used the advanced control set (otherwise it is on rails).

I didn't really follow the story at all, there was a lot of dialogue while flying and in combat and it's too difficult to listen to that and keep yourself alive. It seemed interesting but also felt disjointed. I can say the cinematic cutscenes were really well done, it seemed as if it was partially CGI mixed with reality, I really don't know if it was all CGI but it's hard to believe some of it was, if it was, it definitly fooled me.

The mission are quite varied, ultimately it's destroy a lot of things but oftentimes you had to worry about altitude, or knock out specific targets in time and under pressure. Your guaranteed dogfighting and a fair amount of ground targets throughout the game. I thought the missions were unique and interesting, it wasn't just a big field with the same rinse and repeat objectives, each mission was unique for sure.

I didn't expect a progression tree, it works and you do gain a sense of accomplishment after you unlock better jets with better armaments. It wasn't a driving factor for me but I know others will like it. You can really put some time in and unlock all sorts of jets, weapons, modifications, etc.

It even looks pretty good and the cockpit views are great. Hell the DLC planes are a blast to use and the topgun maverick promo is fun!

But the bad thing is you need to play the god-damn missions. This is by far the worst mission design I've ever seen from an Ace Combat game. Special mention must be given to the sandstorm mission and a bunch of the ""AVOID RADAR"" missions. Also loses points for weirdly scripted and janky boss fights which seem misplaced.

Another problem is the story which is also nearing Final Fantasy levels of nonsense, a far cry from the cyberpunk futurism seen in games like AC3JP (with multiple endings!) and the more grounded war stories of 4 and Zero (Even if all AC games have crazy stuff in them to some degree.)

Good thing we got Project Wingman when we did, because I feel that game is the true continuation of the AC franchise, at least in spirit. Give AC7 a shot if you've followed this franchise since its beginnings in the arcade, but beware of the absolute nonsense. Also worth it if you're into the multiplayer component. Otherwise, Project Wingman is just the better single player experience.

The airplane models are wonderfully detailed, and the clouds, terrain, and lighting are also very good.  The actual game is more of a mixed bag.  The core gameplay is adequate but uninspired.  The fundamentals are fine; the controls are responsive, the UI is intuitive, etc.  However, the planes don't feel distinct from one another.  Some planes have much higher stats than others (e.g., the F-35 is better than the F-14 in every way), but planes within the same tier all feel pretty much the same (e.g., the Rafael, Eurofighter, and F-15 all feel like slight variations of the same plane, just with different secondary weapons).

Personally, what I find most disappointing is that the planes (including the top-tier planes) never feel especially powerful.  I think that a lot of this comes down to the feeling of the planes' guns.  They're weak, and--perhaps more damning--they look and sound weak and indistinct.  The A-10's 30-mm cannon sounds just like the 20-mm cannon's on other planes, and none of them do much damage to anything.  Each plane is also restricted to a single secondary weapon.

The mission design is okay, though not great.  There's the escort mission, the trench run, etc.  It's all okay, but never feels inspired.

The voice acting and the quality of writing are bad.  It's definitely not the worst I've ever seen in a high-budget game, but it's bad.  It's not game-breaking by any means, but I found it bad enough to be distracting.

Overall, I thought Project Wingman was more enjoyable than this game.  It certainly doesn't have the production value this game has, but it mostly fixes or sidesteps the deficiencies I've outlined here.

The story is relatively nonsensical to the point of being largely absurd, there are multiple plot points which force the player to loose through cutscenes in the most frustratingly unbelievable ways, or outright negate your mission progress by arbitrarily saying that ""well, we won, but them someone came in after we left and we actually lost"".

Wingmen are totally useless and don't actually do anything at all (at least on hard), one mission I decided to test this, I only left a single enemy jet left. That last enemy jet survived over five straight minutes against over a dozen wingmen before I had to blow it up myself.

PC controls are quite frankly horrible, requiring the player to constantly ""skate"" the mouse to maneuver at all and the key bindings don't make any sense.

Not worth full price at all, if it was $20 or less then it might be a good buy just to kill time, only if you can stomach the heavy handed beat-the-player-over-the-head-with-the-story-plot style.

The only game where I fly a plane is usually GTA. Never really try out a game that solely focuses on only flying and combat. Except for Ace Combat X in PSP, but I have no memory of that game. Although daunting at first booting up this game, Ace Combat 7 is actually very simple and fun. I thought it was simulation heavy like Microsoft Simulator but no, the game is pretty arcadey in its flying controls which very much up my alley.

You play as a pilot known as Trigger and do missions sent by the higher ups of the government. I'll be honest, due to my inconsistent playtime and just other games distracting me, I did not focus much on the story. Also my brain just can't focus two things at once, like flying, dogfighting, and then listening to the dialogues between pilots that fleshes out the story. Hell, towards the end I finally knew each of the casts' name. This is just a me problem. With that being said, the story here is one of the best I've experienced. The story is not generic at all like my initial expectations. There are twists and turns and things going wrong in a mission. Not for the sake of subversion but just to show horrors of war, putting characters you know in danger, and just overall fun story stuff. I do hope I just focused more on the story, but damn I never expect it to be this good.

With me being new, I found combat to be fun. There are multiple jets to choose from with different types of special missile equipped. Choosing and customising your jet is key to complete a mission successfully. A mission usually lasts for 30 minutes and you better know what to equip and such. The missions can be hard if you don't know what you are doing. Dark Souls styled, if you know what you're doing than its just easy. But if you don't then back to the hangar we go starting the mission all over again. 

The soundtrack is very fire and Keiki Kobayashi is a chad. It is a crime that the tracks here is not available to listen (atleast not on Spotify). I need this now.

On to the downsides, nothing much really than a me problem. Missions can be very hard if you don't know what you're doing but I have very high tolerance for that. The 2nd half of the final mission can go to hell though. 

Overall, best game I never thought I'd play.

Ace Combat 7 is a good arcade-style flight shooter, with a fun variety of missions to fly.  It's exhilarating, has a lot of replability, iconic moments you'll want to revisit, and tons of polish at every step.  It's a solid 8/10.

If you have an itch for a flight game that doesn't bog you down in the tedium of true sim, and gives you some fun challenges to face for several hours, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better candidate for your free time.  The AC franchise practically defines the arcade flight genre and leads it in innovation and style.

Gameplay, graphics, music, and story are all solid.  Tweaking aircraft performance via parts is a very interesting new dynamic to the game.  Weather effects giving you real “terrain” in the sky that you have to work around (or if you're smart - worth *with*) was an inspired choice and I love it. 
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
Now when AC7 first came out, I wrote a review with opinions that I feel should be revisited now that I've learned a bit more about how and why certain things happened.

In the broad strokes, I accused AC7 of being a good game, and a good AC game, but lacking certain standout features that players have come to expect from this pedigree.  Specifically, “no real incredible/epic final battle”, and “[this game] fails to have a legendary final music track which helped define and elevate it's predecessors like AC4, 5, and Zero”.

Moreover, I also made remarks about the game's story.  Namely that some characters were just badly written, beginning of the story was kinda iffy, and important characters lacked development and kinda just disappear for a while then show up for the finale.  And the core theme of the game, “relegating war to drones and missiles allows you to keep the horrors of wars at arm's length comes at the cost of making you a monster wholly ignorant to the atrocities you're committing remotely”, is definitely present but I really wish they'd actually put it more at the forefront.

Well, long story short, these problems have some overlap and there's a story to it.  First, let me say I WAS WRONG IN SAYING THIS GAME DIDN'T HAVE A LEGENDARY FINAL BATTLE WITH APPROPRIATELY LEGENDARY AND TRANSCENDENT MUSIC.  Basically it comes down to something that happened late in development (you can probably find the full story if you Google it).  Someone on the production team made a phone call and asked the music director to make a legendary music track

...and he did.  He absolutely did.  He created an absolute banger of a music track, music so inspired and incredible that it will live on in the hearts of fans until the end of time.  And I really mean that - I wouldn't be listening to this soundtrack on a 30-minute loop on YouTube if it wasn't completely amazing.

The producers of the game rearranged a lot of things to synchronize this godly music with an epic battle to match.  But the problem is how late this happened in development. Certain things just didn't fit quite right after the changes because those things were set in stone.  So that created a situation where this amazing music and final battle...isn't /actually/ the final battle.  There's still one more mission after.  So when I had talked about “no epic final battle”, I was thinking too narrowly and focusing on what is a somewhat anticlimactic final mission instead of recognizing that the game is  meant to end on mission 19, not 20.

I was at fault for missing the forest for the trees.  While I was not really thrilled with that final mission (mission 20), the thematic end of the game and where this epic music comes into play (mission 19) is every bit as amazing and legendary as the final missions of the big three (AC4, 5, Zero) and deserves to stand with honor alongside it's predecessors as some of the most epic climactic battles ever put into games.

The game is beautiful with excellent sound and an easy to use UI, and the in game controls and UI are everything I've come to expect from Ace Combat. It makes for a fun, fulfilling experience as the difficulty continues to increase throughout the campaign in steady, fair, and most important creative and interesting ways. I never felt cheated by a death; if something was hard, I was able to see what I did wrong and how to correct for it (even on one particularly difficult mission where my failures boiled down to ""I was getting in a rush and getting sloppy"") and the checkpoints are well placed to leave the player staged in a position to quickly reengage without breaking the narrative should they fail.

QA absolutely knocked it out of the park as well- I didn't notice a single bug from start to finish and I'm paid to find that stuff, haha. Usually even very minor defects stick with me but there's absolutely nothing that I saw wrong in my start to finish playthrough which was immensely satisfying on a personal and professional level.

If I were to make any suggestions at all it would be to have hidden items on the aircraft tree shown as ? boxes or something (I ended up spending a lot of points on minor upgrades which I could have used after the campaign was finished, leaving me with the annoyance of having to grind a huge amounts of points to unlock an aircraft I could have taken into multiplayer immediately otherwise). I also found myself somewhat confused by how the narrative was delivered between missions at first, though this cleared up as the game progressed and some of the events made more sense in retrospect- I think localization may have played a part in some of this.

This game does well with capturing the feel and gameplay of the old Ace Combats while adding new features such as upgrades and other environmental and flying movements such as hard banking. The gameplay and story has the classic ace combat feel with clear science fiction inspirations. I recommend this game.

However, it is not perfect. As classic Ace Combat the story is. The biggest complaint I have with the story is that it is sort of short with only 20 missions vs. 30 in Ace Combat 5. Now there is a season pass that comes with this when I purchased it and I bought it alongside the game. I expect Bandai-Namco to update the game with more planes/missions as time goes on but I can't help but feel there should be more to begin with from the start. 

The other complaint I have from the story is that while there are some familiar names and people that show up indirectly in the story. There is no real character to the real bad guys in the game. In Ace Combat 5 you had the 8492nd squadron that had so much personality and mysteriousness to them. In this game you have Yellow Squadron Mk 2 and basically you never directly fight the real bad guys in head to head combat, only drones. While I like the combat and difficulty aspect in this game, your enemies lack real personality. If there is any real complaint from the game though that is it.

As for the first Ace Combat to make it to PC on Steam, it's pretty good.
I'm running on an 8700k and a 1080 ti at 4k. It is VERY well optimized.

In terms of Rank I'd put it

ACZ > AC5 > AC7 > AC4 > AC6 > ACAH

Their main extra missions DLC is good, provides new mission to play with, but it's the high tech aircraft from previous ace combat being sold piece by piece is the problem. Hardcore fan would know that you would have to fly missions to get money to buy these, but now they can be yours for $20!

Other than, this is one of the best arcade jet fighting sim. You play through missions from 1-20, it has an OK story enough to keep you entertain. Lots of aircrafts to choose from, some out right crap, some better than others. The game is friendly to all skill rangers, so don't worry about difficulty. 

My last wish, is that this game could really use replayability. They want to sell us cool aircrafts as DLCs, fine. But please update the game with more modes for us to play. The multiplayer is ass, laggy, hacky, and a mess to play. If they choose to add CO-OP however, now that would be cool. But then again, campaign AIs are completely dumb and easy as a single player.

If you want to play only in multiplayer and make your own story in your mind, this might be a great game.
If you mute all radio/story audio, turn off subtitles, and use the campaign as a ""I don't care why, just give me a fighter/etc and put some targets in front of me"" this might be a great game.
If you want to have a story and a meaning to the campaign's progression and characters you will love (or hate or respect, etc) and an arc of progression that makes you feel immersed and like you are a part of what you have played through - this game will be shit by most standards. 

This is not a game for those who care about anything other than gameplay and/or flight-simulation/

The right decisions:
1- Return to the world of strangereal
2- Focus on story and player impact around characters
3- Innovate on gameplay 
The worst possible direction [spoilers ahead]
- 'let's sprinkle in some geopolitical tensions... but they will not matter at all by the end'.
   Namedrop cities and events from the other series... with no meaningful consequence (you even get to -- once again -- invade a city you invaded 4 games prior; but this time you don't even win anything you just enter a weird limbo state).
   Characters in the cutscenes will openly talk about loving the princess from the nation they're supposed to be at war with because they hear her broadcasts in prison. ""enemy of my enemy"" except they don't ever say what they like about her and her messages or politics are left to the imagination.

2- Save for your wingman... well, your wingman from mission like... 4? Nobody else becomes a mainstay. Some characters come and go in-game but none really get to make much of a statement -- some are even killed-off ingame as part of a ""woooo we're so clever we put in this... wait, we thought we'd make a point about war-time secrecy and the expendability of troops that may pose security/espionage risks; but save for a single radio comment, nobody even seems to notice or care so we're gonna forget this happened"" moment. Everybody is ""gruff, emotionless bastard"", ""vulnerable fodder"" or ""I have a comic-relief gag about food and I tease a guy | guy loves it and me and pretends not to"" personality.
3- Thunderstorms are fun and the ""clouds-mess-with-missile-locks"" mechanic is fun at first (idk if realistic in any way). Some late-game mechanics are also interesting in their own right; I actually have no complaints on this topic though I'd like to have seen some improvements like... for once in the series having the instruments on my planes in cockpit-view actually work and do things (at least give me a screen that mirrors my in-game radar ffs...)

Oh, as for story? 
You either get 5 stories in 1, all bland and half-baked
 - ""I'm the gifted-asshole stereotype -- my talent is making jets good -- and I got drafted into slave-labor for Brosea because I happened to fly a plane minutes after war was declared. I have no lawyer, no rights and no prospects even though I have friends in the top-brass due to my granddad. I am anti-war and anti-this-war except I end up not actually trying to leave.
- Colonel ""I am an asshole and want promotions - that's it, that's my character arc""
- Everyone you meet up until mission like... 10 or something - ""I am kiiiiinda rightfully imprisoned for very obvious crimes I readily admit - unlike you protagonist - and I don't even have a heart of gold I'm just a normal-ish guy who's also an ace pilot who's also either going to die or not be mentioned again soon""

I was excited on the prospect of a simple point and shoot shooter and with sightseeing involved while flying my favorite plane of all.

But right of the bat we  have a problem... The Logitech Extreme 3D Pro nor the the any of my other more expensive HOTAS does not work. So i can only play it with either a keyboard or an Xbox 360 controller as those works.

But having played other flight sim. The feel of flying an aircraft on a gamepad wasn't really a good experience and it greatly detracts from the experience.

Despite being cheap i found the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro to be a good fit for my hand and with every important action could have been mapped on the head which makes for a simple and intuitive controls.  The game pad jsut doesnt give you the same range of motion and precision that can be had on a Flight Stick. 

The next issue is on the game mode itself. I have played the snot out of AC2 and that was probably my most favorite iteration aside from AC5. And having played both games a lot. I was excited to play those same missions under a different skin.

And here is where my biggest issue for the game lies. It got boring... Doing the same mission as i did from before turned out to be boring and repetitive for me. The time element on each mission was still a challenge especially when you stubbornly use a single aircraft for each. But yeah. I have outgrown it.

The multiplayer mode is what you would call chaotic. As each weapon is point and shoot. Every engagement devolves in who gets lucky enough to score the most hit using the most OP plane in the roster. Having no Flight Dynamics to speak of there's no point in knowing fighter maneuvers,,, 

So yeah. Unless your an actual 12 year old. There's no joy to this game.

Update September 25, 2022 Game is still has no HOTAS SUPPORT. This game is basically just sitting in my inventory unused i dont think i would support the game and its developer anymore.",1552193229,1664106656,False,3,0,0.452202260494232178,0,True,False,False

- You can't direct your wing-mates like you could in AC 6. And the friendly AI in general is completely useless.

One of my favorite parts of AC 6 was that each mission had an enemy ace that wasn't specifically pointed out as a target, but if you found them and shot them down you got to read about their history.

For one, the story is all over the place, unclear, and very hokey.  I tried to get into it and really paid attention to the mission briefings and cutscenes, but in the end it all just felt like a bad anime with poorly-developed characters and a plot that got lost before it was ever really found.

Missions are frantic.  Your wingmen, allies, and commanders yell and scream at you every second; and their instructions often conflict.  Objectives are not always clear, and failures are far too easy to just stumble into even when you feel like you're flying a million miles per hour doing everything one human being can possibly do.  And that leads me to the fact that your wingmen are utterly useless.  They talk and talk and talk and ultimately do nothing.  If there's too much going on, you can bet they'll do nothing but yell at you to take care of everything.  This makes many of the missions, especially the addon missions, ungodly hard.  Maybe some people find ball-busting challenge like that fun.  I do not.

Everything is either timed, gated behind a point threshold, or both.  You cannot just get into a mission or dogfight and have fun with it.  You're not only racing the AI and the mission design but the clock and performance thresholds as well.  This makes every single mission feel like a gut-wrenching tightrope walk along the razor's edge of instant failure.  While that kind of tension and suspense can be fun here and there in a story's narrative, having every single mission function that way leads to adrenaline fatigue and burnout.  Not fun.

I really wanted to like this game.  Had been thinking about getting it for some time and took the opportunity to snatch up on it while it was on sale.  But between the bad storytelling, frantic and unclear nature of every mission, and sheer insane difficulty, I just can't recommend it.  Pick it up if you catch it on sale and are prepared to keep expectations in check while enjoying feeling like a fighter pilot.

Great game if you're into blowing shit up and feeling like a badass. The plot is weird and isn't all there at times, but that hardly matters in games like these. You don't play Ace Combat for the plot (though they can be good), you play it for the power fantasy and the god-tier soundtrack.

I don't think this needs clarification but this game ISN'T a flight sim so don't expect hardcore realism. Expect pulling ridiculous high-G turns that would 100% push your organs out your asshole, 120 missiles + bombs on your plane, and being a one man air force. That is Ace Combat, and it's bloody awesome.

If you are an aviation enthusiast and you're not a realism snob, this is a solid choice for you. 

9/10 Honks, though admittedly, this franchise is what made me pursue a career in aviation and holds a special place in my heart, so I'm a little bit biased. Take that score with a grain of salt.",1618361503,1663896500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The bad parts are the story, characters, but worst of all it's fatal flaw too much ground attack missions and bad mission design compared to older ace combat games. Your ai wingman is so useless in this game I may as well be fling solo up there. The constant bitching and hounding of your commander and squad as they once again scold you for doing the misison and doing well and taking the credit. The enemy boss mikay was so boring and forgettable and kind of too easy compared to final boss fights of the past. I know it sounds like I hate the game but it's not the worst ace combat game ever it's just a little bit dissapointing and forgetable.

The story is a continuation of the previous storyline so don't worry if you're confused at first, the story is very cool to deep dive into (I definitely did) but if you're not into that, don't worry, the gameplay has you covered. 

Firstly, if you aren't playing with a gamepad or HOTAS, YOU SHOULD BE USING A GAMEPAD OR HOTAS. This game really isn't great on keyboard and mouse. You can play it that way kinda, but its not designed for that at all. 
Also, if you want the full freedom of movement, USE THE EXPERT CONTROLS. The default simple controls prevent your plane from going upside down and basically is star fox style controls. It works, but the expert control give you the feeling of really controlling a multi-million dollar piece of military hardware going mach 5 with its ass on fire and blowing up a ground target while doing a midair somersault (which is something you can do in this game). It takes maybe 15-20 minutes to get the hang of the expert controls, its not a big deal, and the game is soooo much more rewarding when you do.

I cannot recommend this game enough. If you have the slightest passing interest in this game please get it, it is sooo worth it. Also, The DLC with Patchy the Pirate's SALVATION tour is S tier, so if you like this game get that too. 

Also Top Gun Maverick has a crossover with this game.
