I suffer from CPTSD. Trauma is intertwined in every aspect of my life. I've been working really hard to improve my life and integrate my trauma, and this game has become a step in that journey. 

Six months ago, I was emotionless, going through life in a state of constant dissociation. I couldn't cry, couldn't get angry, couldn't feel joy. As I've gone through therapy, my emotions have slowly begun to come back to me. I realized this when I took the first character to the Everdoor. My eyes welled up with tears. I was actually feeling things. Emotion!! 

This game is an utter masterpiece. It weaves complicated themes of trauma and loss and betrayal so well into the story line and characters. The gameplay is simple yet satisfying. The amount of hours it takes to complete the story is just the right amount; not too much to which you get tired of the repetitive gameplay, and not too little where you wish you had more. Each character is unique and feels whole, not like a trope. The dialogue is engaging. The loading screens don't take too long. The music draws you in and helps to bring out those emotions deep within you. It's a masterpiece of a game. I doubt I will find another as good for a long time.",1709002584,1709002584,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can't get this upgrade unless you get these 3 resources.

I want to finish because it has great art style, characters, cute as heck, plenty of good story elements and I think it's overall a good game.

A lot of it is genuinely beautiful and heartfelt, and had me sobbing my eyes out. The gameplay loop is satisfying, the platforming tight and the characters fun.

That holds true for the first 30 or so hours. After that, the quality didn't just fall off a cliff. It jumped into a deep sea trench. Suddenly there was no reason to try anymore. I had more money than I could ever spend, more resources than I could ever use, and my boat was populated by spirits who I couldn't care less about. There was a wonderful whimsy about the world before, now it just feels like trudging through tar.

The breaking point was Elena, a pretentious, prideful, stuck up bitch who, after you're nearly done with the game, walks up and decides she has to tell you how horribly you've been playing and how wrong you are. The fact that after you do her arbitrary tasks, gathering resources you have NO USE for at this point. And then she tells you to gather treasures that link to the past of your character, Stella, that are linked to people you've NEVER HEARD OF and treating them like losing one would be a massive toll on you.... I can't.

My interest with this game peaked with Alice, who I love very much. But after Beverly showed up, who is basically a diet version of Alice, and then Atul's ending.. this game lost all the respect I had for it.

Up to that point, even with Astrid's and Giovanni's storylines which I really didn't like, I considered this game an 8/10. With Elena, Beverly, and especially Atul's stories, that brought it down to 6/10. It's carried hard by it's early game and gameplay loop. But after that, there's no point to keep going on.

I would recommend everyone play this game, regardless of the type of games they usually play. The core gameplay loop (the cozy) of gathering resources, crafting, and completing quests is fun and well understood (even if the location is unusual). It stands out for the characters, world building, meticulous detail, and the unique premise it is built on (the dying).

Reviewing other people's opinions, many found that their foundational views on life where impacted by this game. And I can absolutely see why. Beyond the cute, vector art style are stories based on real, hard, life challenges, told with empathy, care, and a sprinkling of subtext. After playing it, I have a lot to reconsider.

That is not to say the game does not have flaws.
- The characters will hilariously get stuck rapidly pacing on ladders or in buildings (although bugs are extremely rare).
- Being mostly open-world does mean it is difficult to know where to go to complete quests (especially when people are mentioned and not locations), and you often need to talk with very similar appearing people (who sometimes have a lot to say). Thankfully, there is a very thoughtfully made wiki to help if you get stuck.
- And, being open-world, you can do quests out of order where you will miss dialog or even events near the end of the game (although it is unlikely to impact your overall enjoyment).
- I also made the mistake of not bringing the remaining spirits to the Everdoor after the final spirit, ||Setlla and Daffodil||, asked to be brought to the Everdoor, thinking it would end the game when the boat is activated, leading to a build-up of extreme sadness.

The core gameplay loop is unfortunately boring. Once in a while you place a pre-built building on your boat and the rest of the time you are just fishing or watering your plants. Your passengers have storylines that trigger after a period of time and in between they just give you some fetch quests. At first the story captured me but it quickly got old since you just get new passengers and the same thing repeats again, and you just waste time in between, but each feels less interesting than the last. I do not think the story amazing, so I quickly got bored with the game. 

Also tried to get into this with friends but it's kind of bad because one person has to play as the protag's cat and can't trigger dialogue. So they can literally only water plants and fish... and run around. This is awful because the game's decent part is the story, but they can only interact with the lacking gameplay elements.

If for any reason you have trouble with emotional stuff or have something in your life you aren't ready to tackle I would suggest watching Youtube clips or something to see if you are emotionally ready to play this. I notice a lot of negative reviews tended to lean into the fact that this is an emotionally turbulent game that can exasperate pain of loss, or something similar, so just keep that in mind. I personally absolutely loved this game and while I do not express emotions in everyday life well I was on a roller coaster of sadness yet peace the entire game. That in its own way was very helpful to me in letting out some emotions I was unconsciously holding onto. 
With this game comes a sense of understanding, if you are open to it, on how life and people within it don't just leave us after their passing as the memory of them stays. Someone else put it well when they said this is Stardew Valley except its on a boat and everyone you meet, feed, house, love are people you've met throughout your life and who you will eventually help pass over.

You may find you get annoyed with the amount of time it takes to get around, earn enough money, and find people at first but once you get in the groove of things it becomes more about the story line with the activities a sort of add on. I also find it really fun to do the activities the spirits have while they are still with you as it just feels in a way a type of bonding moment, whereas after they've gone it kinda just become tedious. Most of the characters I felt connected to, which doesn't tend to happen for me with games. On top of that some of theses characters had characteristics that I had previously thought annoying, crass, thoughtless, and down right not what a good person would have. Yet, here I was connecting with them and their story line in a way I had not expected to. It gave me a real aha moment that has stuck with me and made me a better person in the real world. 

Anyway, all the characters have pretty well created backgrounds, the visuals of the game are fantastic, the little side quests and activities are fun, and the main character's life is told in a way that doesn't overpower anything else yet is told clearly and skillfully. At this point all I'd say to a new comer is let yourself be immersed in the story, keep an open mind to all the spirits and their personality traits, and just let the game lead you. 

Overall, I found it cathartic to say the least. With every hardship you hit with character's backgrounds as well as your send off of them you find peace knowing they are going to the Everdoor ready, with no unhappy ties or unwanted feelings from their life holding them back. 

SIDE NOTE:

I really hope this developer makes another game like this one with more and new characters, a new protagonist, more interactions with the spirits themselves, a bit more push to find certain information out (like the favorite dish idea in this one) before sending them off, and maybe a different environment. Though I love the boat idea so I'd be interested in seeing different island environments instead of a completely different world. Someone else discussed a train world which would also be amazing!
In the end I have to say this is my favorite game and hope to see similar ones with similar art styles come out tackling emotions people tend to avoid or have trouble processing. And then having cameos of characters of the first cropping up (I.e. Buck, Susan, maybe even the spirit constellations) would be interesting. Even starting the new story using this spiritfarer's story as a entrance would be really fun and would definitely entice me pretty quickly.",1708295500,1708295500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

those that love the aimless grind to get lost in menial tasks will like but you cant even relax because of the time constraint so it feels like you are working a job always taking one off orders every moment while having to spend regular and significant time to maintain like i mentioned earlier that really begins to feel like a chore you need to finish before you can play the real game. 

this drags it out and i guess gives more value to some thru extended playtime .. again some people love this about the game but i think they fell short by not making it easy to automate away for those who dont like it.

hate:
-npc harass you constantly to farm and build a thing they needed yesterday and feed them

-no way to just relax and not feel like everything is going to shit if you dont get off your ass to cook farm and water etc. stress.
-fulfill demand and hit w another to farm. feels like ai thinks you are a dog slave who loves to lick toes. no ability to enjoy 1 part of game for day because mood drops and npc bitch and complain w annoying visual amd sound queuez and fckin gaslight you for tryin to spend 1 single fucking day trying to have peace. 

maybe make it so only 1 npc can join because w 3+ feels like you are pulled in every direction and you half ass and skip thru storyline

love:
-art, music. beautiful.
-controls. physics. feels nice to double jump and slide thru roofs. really smooth.

The first bit of the game is a long tutorial. Collecting resources is tedious, boating around takes days, everything is expensive, quests are all over the place, and I kept hitting physical roadblocks on the world map.

But then, my fishing pole got upgraded, fast travel to checkpoints became available, an antique dealer bought all my junk for thousands of the in-game currency, and I took my first passenger, Gwen, to the Everdoor. It was very emotional, like I was saying my goodbyes to a loved one, because canonically I was, Gwen is the lifelong best friend of Stella, the player character. I then realized, all my passengers who I feed, talk to, hug, house, do events with, and help cope with the end of their days... are going to die... Really die... They will want to enter the great Everdoor and pass from the spirit realm, from my ferry, from the home I built them, into the afterlife.

I feel like a nurse giving end of life care to those on their deathbed. It is taxing, but I feel good. I am making them better, I am getting them ready.

I do personally believe in spirits and a life after passing, so some may say I'm biased in my opinion of this game. But even putting that aside, the depth of care put into each spirit you take care of is so intense that they feel real and believable. It's truly hard to put into words.

When I say other games haven't made me cry, I mean it. I've teared up before, but this game gave me a full cry session. I'll talk about specifics at the end of the review.

In terms of gameplay, the only complaint I could have is trying to get back into it after not playing for a while. There's a lot to remember, and it's very easy to get lost in that situation. But otherwise, the gameplay loop keeps you engaged and busy, and I rarely remember having moments where I thought ""I don't have anything to do""
Movement is extremely satisfying, and not complicated. It's super fun just moving around your ship, and building it in a way that compliments it.
I won't bring up specifics due to spoilers, but certain events that happen throughout the game (The ones you do to get materials throughout the ocean) are so enticing and have so much good energy to them. I never thought ""Ugh, I have to go get this material"" It was always ""Ooh, I get to do this again!!"" and that's such a good feeling. I can admit that I was never bored playing this game.

****SPOILER FOR THE GAME****
-The moment I cried-

[spoiler] The moment that made me truly cry was when I brought Bruce & Mickey, a pair that I wasn't able to relate to from my real life experiences, to the Everdoor. From the start, I didn't think I'd like them at all. But as I learned more about them, I realized why Bruce seems like such a 'bully'. Throughout his time on your boat, he talks of how him and Mickey ran things on the street. How Bruce always looked up to Mickey and practically built his life around him. And having grown up in a life where it seems like everything is against you, Mickey was the one good thing Bruce had. While Bruce does lash out at others, comes off as a jerk, and really doesn't know how to handle other people, he still knows how to love, he just doesn't know how to properly express it. On his way to the Everdoor, he says ""...The only thing I'd rather be is true to myself. That might make me an asshole in the end. That might make me a loyal brother to this man here. None of this shit matters. None of it."" He knows how he comes off, but it's the only way he knows how to act. It's how he shows his love to his brother Mickey, and he never grew out of it. A kid that never got to truly grow up. He then mentions ""More importantly, I can't see a life beyond my brother. If he goes, I go. ... Funny thing is... He went a long time ago. I just didn't want to admit it to myself."" Throughout his time on the boat, Mickey never really was 'there'. Bruce just couldn't let go of him, and became a literal weight that he carried even into the afterlife. That hit.. hard. Had Bruce been shown compassion outside his brother and family, he could have led a more positive life. But he was never given the opportunity, so he grasped to what little he had for dear life and ended his own when he lost it. His brother. [/spoiler]

Pros:
* Exploration EXTRAVAGANZA.
* Passengers are (w/ a few exceptions) very well-written, relatable NPCs.
* Beautiful music and artwork.
* Tons and tons of minigames.
* You really, really don't want to let some passengers go... but forcing them to stay feels like torturing them.  (listed as a ""pro"", as this is [u]excellent[/u] character writing)
* One passenger, Stanley... OMG, fav NPC so far this year.

Cons:
* Only had one bug, and relaunching the minigame made it go away.
* One minigame... pulsar...shower(?)...  Pulsar something, anyways.  OMG, shoot me now.  Way too tough w/o upgraded abilities.
* One of the last passengers is really, really hard to please - kiss goodbye to the ""Really pleased all passengers"" (not its name) achievement if you've released too many passengers w/ passive crowd-pleasing bonuses.

Meh:
* Really, really addictive - we're talking repeated ""juuust 10 more minutes"" addictive, at 4am.
* Auto-switching from harvesting to planting takes way too long IMO.  Only ~1 sec, but it constantly throws me off.
* Two achievements are exclusively paired - at about 1/2-way in.  Meaning you can't get all achievements in one run w/o manually caching your savegames.

For folks w/ disabilities:
* Some of the ""collect rare resource"" minigames require nimble fingers or judicious planning and construction of your boat's infrastructure to help you.  You can repeat any of 'em, just not right away, and there's no penalty for taking your time in this game.
* That hard-to-please passenger has several timed challenges before you can resolve her - you may want to ignore her, and lose out on a cpl achievements.

With its stunning hand-drawn visuals, heartfelt storytelling, and unique gameplay mechanics, Spiritfarer offers a deeply touching and introspective experience.

Visually, Spiritfarer is a feast for the eyes. The hand-drawn art style is enchanting, creating a whimsical and ethereal world filled with vibrant colors and charming character designs. Each location is beautifully crafted, from lush forests to serene sea vistas, and every frame exudes a sense of warmth and serenity. The attention to detail in the animations and environments is remarkable, breathing life into the game's richly imaginative setting.

At the core of Spiritfarer is its poignant and heartfelt storytelling. Players assume the role of Stella, a Spiritfarer tasked with guiding spirits to the afterlife. As you sail through mystical waters, you encounter a diverse cast of endearing spirits, each with their own unique story and emotional journey. The game delicately explores themes of mortality, acceptance, and the importance of cherishing relationships. The writing is beautifully crafted, evoking a range of emotions from joy to sorrow, and leaving a lasting impact on players.

Gameplay in Spiritfarer revolves around managing your ship, exploring various islands, and tending to the needs of the spirits under your care. As a Spiritfarer, you build and customize your vessel, cultivate resources, cook delicious meals, and engage in heartfelt conversations with the spirits. The gameplay mechanics are intuitive and complement the game's themes seamlessly. Whether it's fishing, farming, or engaging in meaningful conversations, each activity is purposeful and contributes to the overall narrative and character development.

One of the standout features of Spiritfarer is the sense of serenity and tranquility it evokes. The game's calming soundtrack, melodic tunes, and soothing sound effects create an atmosphere of introspection and peace. Sailing through the vast ocean, accompanied by gentle waves and the soft hum of the ship, instills a sense of mindfulness and contemplation. Spiritfarer encourages players to slow down, reflect, and appreciate the beauty of life's fleeting moments.

Spiritfarer's replayability is another strong aspect. The game offers a wealth of optional activities, side quests, and hidden discoveries, ensuring that each playthrough can be a unique and personal experience. Additionally, the relationships you build with the spirits are shaped by your choices and interactions, providing multiple narrative branches and outcomes. The depth and nuance of the characters make revisiting the game a rewarding endeavor, as you uncover new layers of their stories and forge deeper connections.

In conclusion, Spiritfarer is a beautiful game that delves into profound themes of life, death, and the human experience. With its stunning art style, poignant storytelling, and serene gameplay, it delivers an emotionally resonant journey that will leave a lasting impression. Spiritfarer reminds us of the importance of embracing life's fleeting moments, cherishing relationships, and finding solace in letting go.

In all seriousness, Spiritfarer is a truly heartfelt story (several ones actually) about death. I cannot say for sure that this game will or will not help you deal with loss and grief, or fear of death, that is in the end a very personal experience. I will say however that if a piece of media were to deal with this subject matter, I cannot imagine someone doing it better.

As a game, it has aspects of platforming and base building, but these are just there to support the narratives, to get you more invested in the characters. And you will be invested, as their stories are more realistic than what you'd expect from such playful designs, and I'm sure a lot of people will relate with them through personal experience.

And in most games, death is never seen as strictly a positive outcome. Some games encourage you to keep trying, because death is rarely permanent in video games. Other games are simply torture devices created to psychologically torment the player (*cough* Jump King *cough*). In any case, you will have to keep dying and trying until you succeed in whatever you need to accomplish in that game. Many variations have been created around this concept of death, but very few games have managed to twist this concept in an unique way that is different and feels fresh. 

Spiritfarer is, without a doubt, one of those games. 

Similarly to other games, you kill people in this game as the main character of said game. However, the big twist is that, at least for most of these characters, it is because they directly request that you to take them to the Everdoor (this game's concept of the door to the afterlife). And they do not do this from the get-go, because the player first needs to help them to take that step and run errands for them. It is therefore really ironic that Stella, the most kindhearted person I have played in a game, has to be the one to help them to die and play ""the reaper"".

Is this game perfect? No, absolutely not. Not all ""management mini-games"" are fun, nor do I resonate with all characters nor do I think that it is perfectly paced. It became tedious at moments, I traveled many times to the same places, etc.

HOWEVER ,

I have rarely seen such a large amount of quality for a game with such a beautiful and unique vision ; gameplay, progression, character/world building, character development/story, art style and music are all stella(r) imo. 

MAN . . . . . . . . . . , what a masterpiece.



Also, on a more personal note, it helped me grief the death of my grandparents, even if this occurred quite some time ago. Sadly, my own grandfather and grandmother did not have such a peaceful passing compared to characters like Alice and/or Beverly. I hope they now have found their peace, wherever they may be.

It's somehow both a practical archetype of the leisurely cozy game and emotionally devastating. The characters are always interesting, the art style is beautiful, the music is powerful, and the gameplay is memorable.

Having said all that, there are a few things it could have done better:

There are some surprising quality of life features absent from the game. The most obvious is that there is no quick way to process multiple materials. For instance, if you want to convert logs into planks you have to press the enter key for each log. You can't just hold down the key to keep adding, and you certainly can't type it in. This is fine for small batches but obnoxious if you're processing 50 things or more. I also would have liked some easy way to keep track of things you're cooking/growing. I was always worried about food burning (I didn't realize it could cook for 36 hours!!) so I sometimes found myself leaving a place early to check on it, etc.

Although the characters themselves are well-developed and interesting, it's a little disappointing how they rarely interact or even generally acknowledge one another (outside of Astrid and Giovanni, anyway). Maybe this is partly by design, given what we learn by the end, but given that the characters are actually supposed to be interacting with each other (their mood meters will often mention one another, and there are occasionally ""group"" events), it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity for some interesting dialogue and interactions.

Another issue is that the game feels too linear, with several points in which there is only one way in which to proceed. For instance there is a general order in which spirits need to be sent through the Everdoor, especially towards the beginning  of the game. There are also no real choices in the game that have any significant bearing. There really isn't any story reason to limit this order, and it can sometimes be frustrating when there is only one way to proceed that you have to discover on your own. I think the biggest reason for this was just that it prevented players from jumping too far into the endgame too quickly and while I think that is important to do, with some more work it could have done in a way that better preserved player choice.",1706321750,1706321750,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

She died this year almost near my birthday on January 20th 2024. To say i'm heartbroken isn't even a word i'd describe how i feel. I played this game again a few weeks ago with my partner and before the incident of my baby. I think in some way something was telling me to play this game again after years of not finishing it, almost like to prepare me for what was about to happen. 

This game has made me cry numerous of times, and it's wholesome in its own way! This game is super calm and relaxing. I feel like it helps those with burden and grief who are going/have gone through sad and tough times. I feel this game has helped me through current events of right now to know that my baby has done all she could and is now resting peacefully across the sky. The Sun rose today and shined so bright like the Everdoor when the characters shine before becoming one with the night sky becoming stars!

I'd recommend this game if you wanna play solo or with a friend that if you think sadness and hard times will get worse and worse and it'll never go away, hopefully you can accept them in a healthy and happy way and to know that nothing last forever but to enjoy those moments while they last!

The plot is relatively loose and interpretive at times, but the story is carried very well by the characters. The beautiful art and amazing soundtrack also work synergistically to create the emotional atmosphere that is so wonderful in this game. And on top of that, the game is fun! There are several aspects of gameplay that get introduced as you go and keep the game interesting, from platforming, to little minigames for material collecting, to organizing your ship. I never felt bored while playing, which let me appreciate the emotionally-rich story.

If you've ever lost someone dear to you, this game is bound to touch you. For me, it was Alice. My great-grandmother passed away just a few months before I played this game, and Alice's storyline reminded me very much of her, both in personality and in her gradual cognitive decline. I SOBBED when Alice went through the door, but it helped me process my grief and accept that death is just another part of life. It's so nice to see stories that adopt a death-positive attitude (as weird as that is to say), that shows that while death can be sad and scary, it is also natural and maybe even peaceful. That is why I would not say this is a sad game! It is a game that will make you feel many things, but at the end of the day will leave you with catharsis and satisfaction and an appreciation for the simple beauty of human connection.",1705779237,1705779237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is engaging for me and it's not a bad thing at all. It only points out that games like this lets you practice your micro-managing tactics. You cannot go idle on this one because everyones got their needs and mains to finish plus the sides on the journey. With the story of the passengers, you kinda want to learn everyone's past and empathize. But for me, it felt short. Stanley could bring out more sentiments and Atul goddamnnn it uncle, WHY DID YOU VANISH!!!!!! But did I cry atleast once? YES!! once. The one with Mickey and Bruce. That hard exterior they are showing will never fool me and so I was right, they did had one of the backstories that made me bawl. Though, in the psychological context, atleast for me, I find it cliche but daaamnnn, That reminded me of My Blood sung by Twenty One Pilots. Our entirety in the face of psychological trauma will never cease to exist but will manifest everything just to cope up. Just to make ourselves feel better. Too technical now. I should stop.

Im far from done so review might get updated further in. Im 12 hours in so far.

What a truly wonderful and immersive game!

Everything is just incredibly well made and its such a big game with more than u expect.
The controls and ui are great, the whole interface system is great tbh!
You need to get used to another key than left and right when steering inside the menu tabs as left and right doesnt seem to work inside the hub. Im using alt for right and shift for left here instead and everything is convenient and easy to get to once u learn ur way around.

OMG with the cute cat animations and cat hugs, they are the best!
All the hugs and love and friendships are the highlight in this game imo.
There is a lot of dialogue but its easy to read and fast. A lot of it is hilarious too, LOL at the jokes like the shipyards LOOM joke hahaha.

The music is great and cat'chy!

Im not that far into the story yet but I cant wait to see how every life changes and moves on.

I love that the main character is not the obvious big breasted blond female, however i DO think its hard to tell whether its actually a girl or a boy character ur playing. 
A bit more female lookiing eyes would have been purrrfect and ended any doubts.
But its a great touch and u can tell its a girl in many other areas, and I like that its not the steriotype woman.

Its a world Ill be sad to leave once the game is over and Im loving the building and crafting aspects very much, its so much more than I thought it would be.

The pacing is a bit all over the place and clunky depending on who you find when, my last ~10 or so hours were mainly spent playing with a zipline waiting for time to pass so could finish all the requests since some do need mutiple days to pass, still a pretty decently enjoyable game and great experience.

An emotional, yet wonderful journey this game takes you on. When I first started, it had a unique concept that kept me interested. Later the story got much richer and more captivating, and I got to a point where I didn't want to stop playing, and kept on going for hours, each time I played it. You both want to proceed with the story to learn what happens next, but also want to enjoy it and take it all in. 
It has some crafting, some ship design elements on top of the story. At any point, you can choose to chill and relax, look at the stars while fishing, or move on with the story and at times feel happy, at times sad, and sometimes get surprised by the events, or if you are a completionist, you can try to get every chest, fish, cook every recipe, find every island, etc, most of which are achievements on Steam, as well as rewarding in-game.

As a sum-up; if you want to immerse yourself into a fascinating story, meet various characters with interesting personalities that will stay with you for a while, I definitely recommend this game.

I had heard so many positive things and I really enjoy games that attempt to craft an interesting narrative experience. In terms of the art, animations, and music, this game is great, and clearly a lot of work was put into those aspects. However, I think this game is just....not that good with its fundamentals.

I won't go into detail about the nature of the story, I'm sure you've seen it on all the other reviews and in the description. The basics are that you are carting a bunch of spirits into the afterlife by completing various fetch quests for them and learning more about who they were in life as you unlock their dialogue, to eventually drop them off to their final resting place.

Seems like a really interesting thematic idea no? And it is! So...what's the problem? Its the gameplay. God, is it the gameplay.

This game is astonishingly boring. It is so, so boring. I don't mind a game that has minimal gameplay, I loved Disco Elysium and other games of it's ilk that are nothing but reading and talking. The problem is, this game is not that. It has gameplay. A LOT of gameplay. It just sucks.

This game will demand that you spend 30 hours of your time running pointless fetch quests, completing brain dead easy jumping puzzles, and doing some of the most pointless resource management that you possibly could imagine. No part of it is fun. I would even go so far as to say it is a grind for some of the later spirits, spending hours of your time running back and forth around your boat cutting logs or farming silkworms to advance the dialogue. It's not even fun in a stardew valley way where you have a constant feeling of building up your farm and making progress. After the tenth or so hour of the game your boat is done being upgraded and you're just darting around it managing resources in an effort to get the goddamn game to advance. 

I really don't even think the writing is that good in this game. It's okay. If this game was about 15 hours shorter it might be something charming, but it massively overstays it's welcome and by the time I reached the ending I was practically cheering when spirits would get off my boat. 

It wasn't for me. Clearly I'm in the minority in this so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but if you're the type of person that gets easily burnt out by endless meaningless fetch quests and starting at the exact same set of four animations on your boat over and over again, it may be worth a miss.",1705562763,1705562763,False,9,0,0.628378331661224365,0,True,False,False

[h2] art [/h2]

And the first thing id talk about is the art this games art style is so gorgeous and the animations are so smooth and fluid everything flows into each other  the sites are gorgeous and every second in the game feels like you are inside an art book 


[h2] the characters [/h2]
As the game is heavily story based so the characters are very important and every character has charm in the game and a clear personality which makes every new encounter suprising as you figure out what these people like what they dont as you guide them to grow even side characters have charm and humor that a lot of games would  strive for this type of world building


[h2] the task [/h2]
The chores now this is the part that takes people outta it due to the fact it seems you need to farm a lot but in reality this plays into the game very well every tool you learn is a subtle reminder of the knowledge youve learned and a reminder of the people who taught you it and the game play resource loop  always seems to feel to feed into itself i never felt starved for resources as my profits doubled almost always and even when i did run out of something it was super easy to get or even farm its super satisfying to build and grow your boat and see the results of these labors

[h2] overall [/h2]

Gameplay is pretty basic though, involving farming, tetris-ing houses around on your boat, and making sure everyone gets what they need. It has it's high points when the gameplay really reinforces the story, but became really monotonous after a while. In the end though, I was left feeling kind of ""meh,"" about the game due to the fact that it's emotional high-point came many hours before the actual ending and all the characters that had emotional weight were gone, with the rest being either rude or not interesting at all.

Unfortunately, the game has quite a few minor bugs, none of which are game-breaking, but many of which affect the storytelling. For example, many quests will wait for a day or two before a character tells you where to go next, but if you coincidentally arrive at that location before then, the game will just skip ahead in the quest, and you'll completely miss why they even wanted you to go there! For a game that relies so much on character interactions, that's frustrating.

The graphics and stunning, like from when Disney was hand-drawn. The character design was like little else. 
As I started it I treated it like the cosy game I was told to expect - with the music and characters endorsing that approach. I sat with my hot chocolate, wrapped in my oodie and played a good 12 hours. 
By the end, I almost felt numb. And at the finale, I have never bawled so hard at a game. It's an outcome you come to expect, and perhaps I am soft but all the buildup did not prepare me for the last quest. 
It is masterfully set up, story-wise. It is hard to explain to friends who have not played it, but something you can understand to your very bones.

My only complaints would be having some issues with glitches [Giovanni not going to the Everdoor] and not fully understanding where some objects could be obtained. I don't like to do so, but I did use the Fandom Wiki 3 times. I find it can spoil me sometimes,so I only use it if I am well and truly frustrated,

Otherwise, I will be listening to the credits song for the next few days on repeat.

Thunder Lotus art is now on another level, this puts their previous work to the test and surpasses in every single technical detail. The art is mesmerizing, the style, the designs, the drawings, how well though everything is. It's just too stylish for me to handle, it's awesome.

The writing, I have to talk about that but not much so it won't ruin it for you. The game's writing is sublime, the character motivations, likes/dislikes, mood, activities, quests, it's just grand, and also shocking at some moments.

Now, why did I call it a decent management game? Well, the game has a few shortcoming in the gameplay department. Although all the minigames are fine and the cooking is INCREDIBLE, the late game can be very stressful, where you have to wait for some events to trigger. Of course each player will have a different experience based on which characters they get or not in the boat, but truth is, my experience could have been better. I found the RPG dude waaaay too late, and had to wait for his quests to trigger, like, literally wait... While watching a video or something.

Another issue is that it drags on for too long, although the new characters are awesome, not sure if they didn't hurt the flow of the game, in this case, maybe less was more? I wouldn't sacrifice any of the characters tho, they really are awesome, so... Yea...

Overall, Spiritfarer is awesome, it's a game I will cherish, recommend, and remember for a long time. I already loved Thunder Lotus games, but this is on another level. Thank you for the memories!",1704901785,1704902057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. If you're friends with me you're also a hurt/harm lover in your media such as myself.
On that note, this game is my favorite game I've played to date. I love it with all my heart. Please play this game, let yourself fall in love with the characters, let them annoy you, make you smile, make you cry. It's a beautiful game about grief and letting go. There will be times when you're overwhelmed, there will be times when you're not ready to let them go, there will also be times when you go to the wiki for help.

Story
Probably the biggest part of the game. You play as Stella who is the new Spiritfarer and your job is to make the last days of different spirits the best they can be. Every character has it's own story and they often times are linked to other characters. Your end goal is to bring every spirit to the afterlife and it's just the saddest thing. You get really attached to the different characters and it's really painful to see them go but it's kinda the point of the game. They all have their own unique story which I won't go into detail about but you do a lot of quests for them. Each characters have their preferences, for example a character could prefer a certain dish or a type of food. They could hate their loud neighbour or love that you installed a workshop on your boat. You get to learn about them and it just makes it sadder when they go. I'm not gonna say too much because I don't wanna spoil anything, but just trust.

Boat
The boat. THE BOAT. I love the boat. You're on a boat and it's very cozy and you build little houses for the characters which you can upgrade and you build little gardens and a kitchen and it's just so cute.

Gameplay
It's a very relaxed game. It's not grindy like Stardew Valley. Yes you can grow crops but you don't have to grow an industrial amount, like just a few so you can cook a meal for the characters. Resources like iron and coal are also fairly easy to get. Every rock you break gives you a ton of its resources so you don't have to go back constantly to get more. The setting is on a sea with a bunch of islands. You can explore each islands and they all have different things to do. Some of them even have spirits you can rescue. When you accept a spirit on your boat you get an obol which is a currency with which you can buy different new parkour skills. You basically go to a shrine on an island and you buy things like double jump or bounce.

Soundtrack
The soundtrack is just crazy good. I listen to it on my free time and I've even learned some parts of it on the guitar. Every character has their own background music and I think that adds a lot to the game because every time you listen to the soundtrack there are pieces that remind you of the different characters.

Other
Cute cat. In multiplayer you play as Stella and the other person plays as the cat. Very cute. You can fish, very cozy, especially at sunset. You have a guitar and you can play a song or two. The characters sometimes help you with stuff.

I haven't progress much to the game but, my favorite is the frog (I forgot his name) he's honestly so cute. Besides that, it's easy to play and the missions are not really hard to achieve.

A fun platformer/farm sim with a deep and often sad story woven throughout. 

The story makes you cry. It can touch on very personal moments inside of you, esp if you've experienced loss in your life similar to the characters in the game. But you also get the satisfaction of getting to know the people you'll be mourning.

The farm sim/resource collection game helps take your mind off of the sadness. It's very cute and thankfully there are little minigames to help with the resource processing.

The platforming is fun and fluid, with more abilities unlocking as you progress. I found it very satisfying to cruise around areas in fast and exciting fashion, often going ""faster than the camera"" which really adds to the illusion of speed.

The writing, outside of the larger story, is delightfully sardonic and had me chuckling at many moments. Many, many NPCs to talk to, both for plot/gameplay purposes as well as just general world flavor.

I logged 50hrs on the game but you don't necessarily need to. Plan in the 10s of hours for sure, but 50 was me trying to do everything. You can do less, still have a heap of bleary-eyed fun, and then go cry with your cat like I did.",1703952178,1703952178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not finished the game yet but already have so many thoughts. Unfortunately, mostly not living up to the hype. Spiritfarer suffers in both its game play and story telling, which is essentially all it had going for it after its artistic vision.

Originally I was extremely hyped to play because I was expecting a Hades-like amazing mix of fun game play with a highlight of story telling. And the beginning got me hooked. Everything was pretty, the music was amazing, the character designs highly stood out. The beginning felt like a proper story about to unfold. But then-

The game play ended up being a literal chore. Not in the sense of fun - chill - chores that make you strategically think about how you're going to organize your Spiritfarer day to complete some tasks. No you're mostly stuck completely every task one by one which commonly required to go to the opposite side of the map just to grab some ore. Every task is decently frustrating and stays exactly the same the whole time. There's no significant increase in difficulty or change in pace; the formula is always the same. 

Progression is very linear, to the point where you will get stuck just because you lack an ability or a spirit on your chip. It was especially frustrating when I needed an Obol to progress at all, and had to wait multiple days for the spirit I got to finally talk about their quest. There's zero difficulty to this either. Most of the time you will have every resource you need except the time it takes for spirits to talk to you about their quest. So you're stuck doing nothing (for six in game days :) ) just to progress. Just a side note there is no interesting exploration; almost every island feels the same apart from the abilities you can use and resources you can get. 

Secondly, the story telling, or lack there of. The largest issue is the main character has no personality apart from what others say about her. This is because Stella doesn't talk at all, so every interaction with another character is essentially a monologue from them. This leaves very little empathy for Stella or any spirits which ruins my interest for most characters. Most of the game was me trying to get rid of most of the spirits as fast as possible while the ones I liked went too quick. 

I would talk about the overarching story, but within 20 hours it essentially got no progression, so I will have to see once I finish the game.

I do not recommend Spiritfarer if you're looking for a meaningful well written experience or riveting game play. But it's fine for a simple no brain game you don't have to pay attention to.

I really enjoyed this game, its story and characters... sadly I wish there was something between Yes and No in Steam reviews, because my final verdict of the game after seeing its ending and 'big reveal' would be - Meh.

[spoiler] I really HATE when stories, in games, books, moves and so on, are ending on the note that everything was but a dream! In Spiritfarer after it was dropped I just stopped caring about everything... what does it matters what we do, if everything is but a dream and/ or a delirium of dying/drugged mind? What is the point of narrative having 3 layers (one in 'spirit' world, one in 'real' one and another being our own)?

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] This game was incredible... the whole world visually was astounding as well as the soundtrack and story that went along with it. Each spirit you meet is a fully fledge character with there own unique backstory and personality none of the writing at any point of the story gets stale. I love the aspect of the ship management where you get to build onto your way and slowly become self sustaining over time. The soundtrack that goes along with the game is unforgettable once you hear it. The art style mixed in with the gameplay is just perfect in everyway shape and form. I wish you could go on forever helping spirits in that game but eventually you too have to hand of the baton to another brave Spiritfarer as you venture into the next life. [/i]

It's a cozy game about the extremely broad topic of ""death."" It tackles it in a very real and hopeful way which makes it perfect for the genre. Gameplay is split between exploring islands, upgrading your boat etc. and about helping your spirits that join your boat along the way, before said spirits must move on to the afterlife. It gives you the hours to just sit there and do mindless tasks, which gives you a good amount of time to just let every character's story digest.
Beautiful visuals and a soundtrack that doesn't get boring after hearing it for hours.
Favorite part is just how incredibly well done the characters are. So much impact in all their short exchanges of dialogue make up this really beautiful story. 

Up there as a certified Favorite game of all time. I could tell it was going to be when I was still playing, that this was going to be an once-in-a-lifetime experience, when the character who leads you through the first hours of the game made me sob like a five year old.

The story is charming although very sad, it's all about our mute main protagonist although the way the game sells itself keeps pointing you to the direction of the other characters.
If you're not into loss, depression, grieving themes and dealing with it, then I do not recommend it! For instance, I'm a person that do not come into games to have a catharsis of my emotions, so these games for me are always kind of a pain... I think we already deal with a lot of drama in our own lives!
Now, in terms of gameplay it's very basic and simple: you need to pile up buildings, catch these glittering stars, cook, farm, and especially fetching things for your guests. For me the worse was fishing, the mechanic was a bit hard and stressfull.
I also didn't liked that the protagonist Stella was a mute character, and many times I felt that I was wasting my time talking to NPCs - I mean, sure they give you side quests, but there's just so much clicking and nonsense dialogues with those.
Visually the 2D platform with this cartoonish feeling to it is great, and honestly what made me buy the game.
This game could do better with voice acting added though.
Performance and menu accessibility are also great, lots of languages to chose from, you can change keybinds, I felt though that sometimes certain movements would get cluncky, not responding (I was playing with the controller).
My biggest issue was how the days would pass so fast! I mean, you have no time limit, so it's fine, do not worry. The thing is, I would wake up, just navigate somewhere, and... already night! it disn't left me with a lot of exploring time.

Sadly, the game distracts you with endless tasks, combined with (imo pointless) minigames you have to complete all the time.

You will build relationship and empathize what they feel along their long life journey to how they become now in front of your eyes. This game teaches a lot of life lessons from various point-of-views so you will definitely learn plenty of those.

Basically couch co-op where the 2nd player is not in ""little sibling"" mode. They actually fully contribute to the gameplay. There's like only 1 thing they can't do that the main player does. It is the ""talk"" action which makes sense because they're a cat.

Side scrolling platformer with emotional storytelling. Though the story seems linear, the gameplay isn't entirely. Because you can drive your ship all over the map. You slowly build resources and make upgrades. The pace is slow so you can get to know the characters and story. 

It is a very aesthetically beautiful game. I have been taking a lot of screenshots. The forced day-night cycle means you get a lot of lovely dawns and dusks. 

My biggest annoyance is the fishing, but I hate fishing in all games. The string is white when you press and hold to reel the fish in. It turns yellow then red when need to release the button. The color can sometimes be hard to see against certain backgrounds. Plus some fish are just really hard to catch, though this is expected. 

Because there are 2 main players, if you're far apart from each other, it can make seeing the screen difficult because it zooms out to fit everything on one screen. Good if you hate split screen. The second player does not have a button to transport them to the first player. All players *must* travel together. I'm playing the main character and personally suck at jumping and double jumping. 

If I install any mods, if will be for perfect fishing and more forgiving double jump timing. I'm a very casual chill gamer, so feats of quick, precise timing aren't really my favorite. I dig the resource management, improvement, puzzles, and storytelling.

I hate to give this a negative review, it's a great improvement by the company after the horrible misstep that was their first game and I subscribe to their newsletter and it appears they truly care about this project, I'm glad the devs made this and I hope they made enough money to continue trying things out, but this is still amateurish and a little dull and lacking in polish

there are a lot of bugs but very few effect gameplay negatively and those that do the devs have answers for in the forum.  characters clipping thru objects or supposedly being asleep but still being found outside of shops when you're at certain cities are present, sometimes quest objectives don't load when you open the quest log, things like that.

animations are repetitive and slow (watching your character fall on her ass while picking cabbage is cute the first time and the first time only) and some are just ill suited (no matter what food you give to another character the eating animation is the same, giovanni is always eating spaghetti or whatever (even more frustrating is that characters don't actually allow you to feed them the same food twice in a row, it's like the devs are fucking laughing at you)). you could argue that in a management game that's supposed to have a slower and more contemplative nature such as this it's okay for animations to be slow and repetitive but you'd be wrong and I'd hate you, it's still irritating.

there are some obvious quality of life improvements that are missing, when you're in your ship looking at the map you can see what is left to be found at a location but when you're actually at the location there's nothing for that so if you're wondering what you're missing you have to go back to your ship to check then go back to the location. also menus don't wrap around from right to left and scrolling is a tad slow.

having a near silent protagonist makes scenes where characters get weepy about how great you are feel a little canned and insincere, like they're trying to sell me a story that they didn't bother writing (Death Stranding did it too), especially since other characters don't even interact with each other on your boat and only make reference to one another in a couple quests in the whole game. generally I find all the characters you're ferrying to be somewhat 2 dimensional and bothersome and when hugging characters to keep their mood up is a requirement it starts feeling less sentimental and more mechanical in nature.

I recall finding it silly that one reviewer didn't understand why the afterlife was treated so opaquely in this game and having completed the game I find it even sillier 
I also find it silly that Yahtzee gave this his 2020 game of the year, I know he likes boring management type games but I'm wondering if him feeling cooped up and unloved cause of the pandemic had something to do with it

all in all this isn't a truly BAD game but
you have limited time on this planet
why would you spend it on this

I could say more so I will

the minigames are all shallow and repetitive, playing music to make plants grow faster is nothing but tedium, it is the same every time. I can't understand why there's a day night cycle in a game like this, normally I'm into it but here it's just another loading screen you have to go thru. there's no rumble on the fishing minigame, blah blah blah

in a somewhat similar game like Stardew, things change over time. you get sprinklers, you speed up, and you can actually manage things. None of that is true about this. it's got the grind, it's all chores, but there's little progression from a gameplay standpoint.
What I can say as a positive about how things change in this is that when you do go to bed you see your whole boat at once, a reminder of the community you've built (and subsequently lost), it's a nice enough visual even if the deck of your boat is comedically stretched out.
even doing the moments that are clearly supposed to be hard hitting and meaningful, the characters you're talking to are cycling thru the same idle animations, making the same idle noises, the same music you've heard a million times is playing again, it's just so awkward. and of course there's a big owl to guide you thru how to think about the progress of your main character with incredibly ham fisted dialogue.

it's so frustrating, in small parts this game is great. if you do play it then hey play like 2 hours a week, that's probably healthier anyway, and 6 months when you're done you'll have forgotten about the good characters because the game frontloads them. I don't know, I can't make this game good.
few of the characters interact with one another. it's just brutal thinking about what this could have been.

some of these quests and sidequests are just nothing. ""go collect 45 berries"" are you fucking kidding me this is an end game quest? you can't even farm them you just have to go from place to place doing nothing.
the very end of the game is the most punishing. maybe you've sold some diamonds for cash earlier. guess what now you need fucking 7. snooze. grind time. got 100k dollars? useless. Go farm a starting item. good thing you don't actually have to do it but good god how can you make your end game 100% content SO BORING. 

Frustratingly there's a good part to the end game content. Jackie and Daria's quest is some of the most interesting stuff in the game (even if jackie's quest is sorta just you urging him to suicide) but by its very nature it circumvents and ignores most of the game. it's almost embarrassing how much better that addition is. You don't leave the area where it takes place, it's largely not reliant on farming from the other mechanics, it's just a nice self contained story. It's also a reminder that none of the other spirits ever fucking interact meaningfully. The writing in this game is so shallow, and so is the gameplay. 

If you've played this game, imagine it without the music. What would your rating be. be honest. This game just doesn't cut it no matter how hard you want it to.

It's a journey that takes players through an emotional rollercoaster, allowing them to experience the joy of life, the inevitability of death, and the catharsis of saying goodbye.

[b] Life [/b] in Spiritfarer®: Farewell Edition is represented through the vibrant world that players can explore. The game encourages players to engage with their surroundings, build relationships with spirits, and create memories. It's a celebration of life's simple pleasures, from cooking meals to fishing, and it's a reminder of the importance of cherishing every moment.

[b] Death [/b] in the game is not portrayed as something to fear, but rather as a natural part of life. The spirits that players meet are all at different stages of accepting their mortality. Some are ready to move on, while others need help coming to terms with their situation. This portrayal of death is both sensitive and respectful, and it encourages players to view death not as an end, but as a new beginning.

The theme of [b] learning how to say goodbye [/b] is perhaps the most poignant aspect of Spiritfarer®: Farewell Edition. Players form deep connections with the spirits they meet, making it difficult to let them go. However, the game gently reminds players that saying goodbye is a necessary part of life. It's a lesson in acceptance and letting go, and it's a testament to the game's emotional depth.

In conclusion, Spiritfarer®: Farewell Edition is a philosophical exploration of life, death, and saying goodbye. It's a game that doesn't shy away from these heavy themes, but instead embraces them, creating a unique and heartwarming experience. It's a reminder that life is transient, that death is a part of life, and that saying goodbye, while difficult, is a necessary part of the journey. It's a game that will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly, reflect on the beauty and fragility of life.

First, the good stuff: the art and the music. Can't really say much other than it looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous, the artists clearly put a lot of effort into their game. Each major character has unique, mostly handdrawn sprites than look very good. A lot of the animations use splines to reduce the costs, but I can't say that some of those look really good as they sometimes distort in uncanny ways. Also Stella's hat is a 3D model, which is funny to me.
I do have to note however that this game loooooves to you its animations so much, it also really likes to lock you in place for much longer than necessary to let it play out, which makes repetitive tasks more annoying.
The music is very orchestral and carries a lot of the emotional weight the game can have, it's always pleasant to hang in the starting area just from how serene and pleasant it sounds.

Now, the reason I put a negative review.
Somehow, despite how polished it looks on the graphical and sound side, it looks very rushed and the other parts, being the story and gameplay.
The gameplay is pretty cute at first, but gets very tedious and repetitive as time goes on. Your main form of progression is just getting the resources you need for the next upgrade, but some of those critical resources are locked behind characters that need you to sometimes find a specific spot on the map.
Talking of the map, the boat navigation makes so you'll have to wait very often as the game progresses and the number of passengers shrink, especially when you notice that there's no real advantage to passengers being maxxed out in happiness, their benefits are literally inconsequential and you can just let them starve without much consequences. Also, the more you progress, the more empty and bland they becomes, even the more unique locations like ""Sandwich Platform"" (or however it's called) have barely anything to them in the latter parts.
The ""open world"" in this game is also an annoying illusion, the game is pretty linear in how it wants you to progress, so unless you know exactly what you need to do, you'll just be wandering endlessly on uninteresting side quests (which most don't even have reward????!!!), and chest hunting, which rarely have anything interesting when it's not a blueprint.
Lastly.... the minigames....... oh my god are they bad and grueling. I understand what they were going for but... just no, let me craft without having to do annoying maneuvers I beg of you.

The story is also... vague, but not in a way that feels intentional, more like, y'know, rushed and unfocused. Most of the ""OG 5"" are muuuuch more thought out, once they pass on, you're left with flavorless husks that are just here to pad out the game, and most of their deals are pretty hard to get before they get to the Everdoor, and even then some just make no sense without you looking at the wiki. They even wrote the same character twice....
The DLC part is also, odd. Now, confirm me if this is wrong, but it looks like to me than before this was released in the original version of the game, Stella's story didn't even have a proper ending, just a random cryptic entity spewing nonsense for most of it and pretending it said anything at all.
Anyway, the part that really grates on my the most is that this DLC part WILL happen during a part of the game where there's basically nothing else to do, most of your passengers are gone and you'll probably only be left with a character that literally cannot pass on (and was based on a developer's friend). And so they has the great idea to make the progression... time based. Yeah. So you just have to wait for most of it; and once again the story of the two ""new"" characters are either rushed or nonsensical (mostly due to cryptic flourishes).
I do appreciate the ""special"" character that appears when enough passengers has passed on however, and it gives a proper conclusion to Stella's story (even if there was very little of it).

This game is just a grind to me, a grind that became very grating at around the midgame where it falls off VERY hard. It took me 30 hours to finish it fully, all the way to the only character that cannot pass on, meaning I also did much more than necessary, and yet I feel like this game would've benefited a lot from having the cast and playtime slashed in half, because, right now, the game gets quite boring the longer you go.
A shame, the premise was very interesting, and the early game pretty enjoyable, but it falls off massively.",1701413658,1701413658,False,1,0,0.446662306785583496,0,True,False,False

The game mechanics are sometimes a bit too hard for me since I have to run up and down catching something. The caves really made me mad sometimes because I was not good at using the zip line. Spiritfarer was the first new game I played in my adulthood. I did not grow up with consoles, I did not play anything that would consume my life because I never had proper devices for games. So, you could consider me as a newbie back then, and it was challenging. Of course as time went by and I played more, it became easier, but this was not a game that you would easily recommend to a newbie who probably would love the story so much.

But, regardless of those points, I still love Spiritfarer in its entirety. It really showed me the beauty of indie games, what these small companies can give me in experience that an AAA company probably would struggle. The music is superb, my favourite is actually the Thunder Harvest. Each strike actually makes the already beautiful and powerful piece even more impactful. The art is beautiful and the dedicated hug button? Yeah, that hits hard. The story? I think each of us has our own favourite, mine is unironically Stella's story. I just.. I just feel that her story was relatable. At first I was unhappy that there was no way to personalise the main character, but I got over it quickly as I began to know Stella.

I think one of the best aspects of an indie game is that you get more after purchase service. I love the wallpapers and newsletters, some behind the scenes stories and such. It makes me appreciate the hard work that developers do to make a game. It is always fun to receive a mail from Med at Thunder Lotus. Hi, Med!! :D

It has been a while since I finished my first playthrough, which as you can imagine, wrecked me. I did not play it much afterwards, I reckon I just wasn't ready to face them again. Even though it's been so long, the music, the art, the animation, the voices, the mini games, and the cutscenes sometimes will pop up into my thoughts. It has such a strong impact on me, maybe also because when I played this, I was dealing with a matter of life and death as well. Sometimes I wish I could just avoid the mandatory task, but it's just one of those things that makes you think about life. I can run, postpone, avoid, deny, anything, but in the end, I have to face it because it has to happen. Why pay for therapy if you can figure it out yourself by playing a game? lol Jk jk.

Showers the main character with compliments that feel forced due to the lack of backstory and the fact that this spirit  it's demanding and spoiled. You are never conected to this spirit. If anything after that you feel really reluctant to care for this ""spirits"".

For a game this slow, it's incredible how you don't have a compelling story for why we care about this first spirit, it recognizes you but we don't really get an explanation of why we should care about this annoying thing.

I'm yet to see the deep meaning people say they found, I haven't really seen any indication that the story isn't just going to be a series of annoying characters that you have to take care of for no reason, without knowing anything about them, and a bunch of chores that are even worse than doing actual chores because they have zero real impact.",1701236246,1701236246,False,2,0,0.477328360080718994,0,True,False,False

The game tries to be a plat former in parts, which does not work with the character controller (except for a specific part in one of the updates, you'll know it when you get there!). The game also has meh level design, leaving it often unclear if I am supposed to be able to get somewhere which led to be trying for sometimes 10+ minutes at a time to get somewhere I only found out after I wasn't supposed to be yet. (This added probably 5 hours to my play through, to give perspective on how common it is)

There are also undisclosed trigger warnings for [spoiler]mental hospitals (mild, its a regular hospital that operates like a psych ward), emotional and physical abuse (mentions only), major mental health struggles, implied suicide[/spoiler] and insults directed at the player, along with the obvious death and loss of loved ones.

Overall it was good but not great, it would benefit significantly from more fleshed out characters and cleaning up some level design, Jackie and Daria did this very well though so at least we can hope to see that level of content in whatever game they make next. A lot of the characters were cute and enjoyable with their own personalities which made them unique and interesting, but a lot also felt boring and there because they liked the idea without bothering to flesh them out (See: bruce & mickey, giovanni, gustav).

Overall its an experience I would recommend if you like management games and story heavy games with a lot of reading (seriously like half this game is reading).

[h3]TL;DR:[/h3] 

""Worst parts of 2D platformer, collection-farm, fishing sim, immersive rpg with sometimes clunky controls and a neutral to sad story. But hey, the music's good, there are cute animal characters, and it's ""pretty.""

[h3]The Bad:[/h3]
* WAY too many collectables. There's a set to turn on at a 'semi-secret npc' and a set for the wandering merchant you find early on. Both of these ""collect-a-thons"" are suuuuuuuuuck. There's too many things to find/get/do and it's outright -painful- to complete them. Especially the fish. Could simplify the menu too, lots of same recipe for different ingredients.

* The controls are spotty and some 'power-ups' feel clunky or annoying to use. These two, [spoiler] Gliding [/spoiler] + [spoiler] Zipline [/spoiler] are particularly bad. Sometimes they do not work when pressed or get cancelled by being used too close together. 

* The damn boat speed. Even with max-upgrades, and max size, I never felt like I was getting anywhere quickly, particularly for longer journeys. This still felt way too slow.

* The ""warp to zone"" mechanic still requires to the zones to use it. There should just be a different mechanic in place, accessible directly from Stella's shack, and not a bus-stop/taxi system.

* Too many materials to grind out/collect just to advance through the game. Literally these could have been cut down by a third, and it would have not influenced the story much, besides getting through the already slow-feeling game faster. I felt like I did a pretty good job at most things, but I will not catch all of the fish, I will not collect all of the figurines, I will not cook all of the dishes, and I won't think I'll go back to finish the remaining 7 achievements I'm missing. It's that grind-y.

* You cannot salvage the ""unique"" buildings, besides one that was a 'mistake' and went unused. I understand -why- they did this because I've finished the game, but I still hate it. If they wanted the spaces for the ending itself... Why not just have a specialty building instead that you can only build after you've [spoiler]send someone through the Everdoor and gained their flower. (You could even have this change and with more flowers in it the more characters you get sent-off.)[/spoiler] done a requirement for it.

* All of the non-square/weird shaped buildings. This bothered the hell out of me. I have ocd, so that's not necessarily an 'every person' problem, but it was for me. It felt like I was juggling my own brain to ignore the horrible clump of buildings I shoved aside.

* Base story quests will not clear out the fog of war from the entirety of the map. I left literally at least a third of the map undiscovered, and due to the boat-speed I didn't feel the need to explore further either. 

* Timed material gathering 'events' ALL felt annoying to complete (at best.) Because they're all the same with different hit-boxes. Assuming you've managed to build your ship in a way that makes it manoeuvre-able, all of the events will play out and feel the same. Run/hit each 'target' zone, collect drops. I however, had more of an issue not climbing up unnecessary ladders or platforms constantly in the way, thanks to the way the buildings were made and gaps between spaces that were too small for unlock-able traversal props to help.

* Some NPC's you send off are objectively terrible and I felt horrible helping them. I get that there's a broader appeal by having more personality types and/or perhaps it's based off of real people, but I could have honestly left a few of them behind entirely.

* End story is 'complete-able' before you have all the passengers on the boat completed and sent off. I get why they did this, but it's probably something, someone has screwed up. Should not be able to talk to [spoiler]Lily[/spoiler] that quickly as it spoils some character information that you might not have had figured out yet. It just felt out of place for me.

* [spoiler]Daria's flower really should have a quest attached for where it is post going through the Everdoor.[/spoiler] Had it not been me looking up a different quest entirely, I wouldn't have realised this is in a different spot than it is for -literally every other spirit.-

* [spoiler]Night-time sailing.[/spoiler] This takes way too long to find and have. That should be something you get at companion 2 showing up, regardless of who it is.

* The ending is a cliche and predictable before [spoiler]Hades' third meeting or Lily explain it to you in full making it so that you can guess exactly how and why [/spoiler] it happens.


[h3]The Good:[/h3]

* Music is great, I had no complaints, all of it was good, drew me into the situation at hand, and made sense per scene or character. I enjoyed the sound-track the entire way through, none of the music felt off or wrong to me.

* Art style/direction is really good, the characters all kind of felt like that's how they should move/act. Animations looked great, and the overall transition from one thing to another wasn't jarring. It all flowed nicely.

* Most of the colours look good with one-another, even if the buildings are clumped together.

* Overall I did like the general plot and story. If the ending was different, I'd have no complaints about it.


[h3]Detailed summary:[/h3]

There is not a single word that covers how I feel about this game. The closest I have is that the game is just ""boring."" For me a game really sucks when the more I play it, the less I actually like it, and by the end I have zero intention to go back to it ever. Once this review is posted it's being uninstalled forever. It just isn't good. If it had no positives, I'd feel ripped off lol.

This game just wasn't a fun experience for me, at all. The story was a bit depressing and the controls felt BAD at times. It's not the worst set of controls I've used in a platformer but it didn't feel crisp or fun to me to play through. The platforming doesn't -feel- nice to do. It's got clunky, slow feeling controls that don't always work well together when you need to do stuff quickly, and the cool-downs on these two skills [spoiler]Dash[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Light Burst[/spoiler] can make it annoying to difficult to complete [spoiler]Elena's[/spoiler] quests.

Every 'timed event' felt the same, with a different thing to chase down. All of those quests felt the same, only with more need for specific skills mentioned in the spoiler above, to complete. Oh and they are necessary to complete some of the upgrades, so you do need to do all of them more than once. Painful. The story wasn't interesting enough for me to enjoy the grinding or slog of gathering all the materials just to upgrade the ship, to get to specific parts of the map or upgrade things on the ship, or to turn in for quests. 

The ending is a total cliche and not at all surprising. I saw that one coming a mile away even before I finished the specific story parts with 2 specific characters. [spoiler]Hades and Lily[/spoiler] I feel like [spoiler]Lily[/spoiler] doesn't even like Stella, and resents her for how things go down. The first character just doesn't need to exist, or the second character doesn't need to exist. They both show/say the same things essentially so why not just have it be one character? Convoluted.

In other words, I didn't enjoy the game play at all, I didn't like the ending, and I didn't like the way the game made me feel about the characters you're ""supposed"" to care about. There's some where I legitimately felt they were a ""good riddance"" because of their specific dietary requests or their annoying traits.",1701096857,1701096857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being completely upfront, this game will break your heart. It'll do so in such a wholesome way though.

This game has a beautiful soundtrack and visuals, absolutely great writing and story, and each encounter with the spirits you meet feels so personal. Full disclosure: this game made me cry so many times. You experience legitimate feelings of loss, and I find myself still missing those I first met several weeks ago. They all just feel so... real. 

I feel as though I've gained some wisdom on life; lessons that I wouldn't have gained on my own just yet, and they're taught both directly and indirectly. Some you don't truly grasp until later in the game. I feel more prepared for what permanent loss is like, and this has helped me come to terms with those I have in different ways already.

This will touch your heart, so have tissues nearby. This is single-handedly one of the best games you'll ever play if you're the loving/empathetic care-taker type.

That said, I picked this game up for a cosy laid-back experience but it was honestly ruined for me when they started introducing timers to platforming mini-games in the late stage. I went from exploring every little thing to actively avoid events and the mini-games that were even required to gather resources because of its association with the timer. My initial reaction was, 'Nah, I'm not doing this. Cue the final Everdoor sequence'....

It's a relaxing game, one that through the gameplay loop itself makes you feel the whole range of emotions from contentment and happiness to grief, a wistful sense of nostalgia and sadness. The dialogues are masterfully written, everything is beautifully drawn and animated and the music fits the tone and world very well. There are more than enough other reviews that cover the rest.

Local co-op works well and while it is a pleasure to experience the game alongside a friend, it's still a little clunky that the co-op character can't talk to the ship's residents (well, in the game's defense, the co-op character is the cat and it wouldn't make all that much sense for Daffodil to talk, but still). Steam Remote Play is also a pain to get to work (it always is, but in this game there's some days where it just won't work at all), so be aware of that. 

Should you, after seeing the Overwhelmingly Positive rating of the game and reading the reviews still question if this game is for you, play the demo. That's what convinced me, at least. 
While the demo is actually pretty bland story/character/dialoguewise, it still manages to capture the artstyle, the delightful music and the main gameplay elements (farming/building/etc). The game is absolutely worth the full price, but it does regularly go on sale for up to 75%, so be aware of that.

But because of the positive reviews and the sale, I gave this game a shot. I have to admit, at first I didn't feel much connected to the characters as I hoped, but they are well written and diverse and different in their own ways.

It was until, I let the first one pass on... The game will often times throw new faces and characters at you, and because of that, you feel like everywhere you go is a place of unfamiliarity. But this works. The ones you once deemed ""Stranger"" becomes more and more like an anchor to run back to. This works because, each character will sometimes reel you in giving you advice and task that will help progress the adventure. Being with them makes you feel like you're going in the right direction of where the game wants you to go. There can be a lot going on at times from collecting resources and uncovering new locations, to building up the ship and fishing. There have been times where I felt lost on what to do next. BUT.. when you decide to hone in on a familiar character, especially ones that been on your ship for quite some time, you can't help but to feel a sense of comfort and calm with them, even at times of being lost. This feeling slipped underneath my radar when I decided to let them pass on. When continuing my adventures, I start to realize that I miss them more and more as time goes on. This game has made me realize I am someone who doesn't know what they have until they're gone. Of course I can restart the game and have them back, but it wouldn't be the same.

The game started out feeling like it was my style, but then I drifted away from it as tike went on. That doesn't take away from what the game achieves, though.

As a game that involves dealing with facing death, interacting with characters who are based on real life people and situations, I LOVED that aspect. There were moments that I connected to this game, and it brought me back to times where I had to face passed loved ones in my family. The stories are wonderfully articulated, the characters feel real, and the difficult trauma and trials that all the characters go through are relatable. 

As for the gameplay, I did like the loop for a bit. Find Spirits to work through a quest line, gather resources to build their home, build related equipment and buildings to make more unique items, etc. However, it got kind of ho-hum after a bit. Things didn't feel particularly enjoyable to go out of my way to get. Something just didn't click for the reward factor of gathering up these things.

That, and the pacing of getting items, upgrading buildings, and helping Spirits just felt... off. I felt like once I accomplished something with building or finished a couple of quests with a Spirit, I was already sending them away to go find another one. It might have been my fault because I didn't take my time with the game, but if you go too slow, then you're just fishing, farming, and foraging. Not super enjoyable when you want story. 

However, there was LOTS of story to be had. I just wish it was paced out just slightly better. 

Do I recommend you try the game? Absolutely. The times I cried from feeling the pain from the characters outweighed much of the frustration in the game moving too fast or feeling too ""grindy"". I kught have completed the game in just shy of 40 hours, but 100% would surely be a good 50 hours.",1700835842,1700835842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really don't want to spoil anything about this game since it's so good, but I'd say its outlook on death is very mature and every arc conclusion felt like the perfect ending. It's just the perfect blend of soothing mini games and story driven quests. This game has so much fun stuff to do and is just overall very well made. The art is lovely and the environments are well drawn, beautiful and atmospheric, the original soundtrack is really great, the sound mixing is done very well, the character animation is fun and expressive, the side and main characters are very well developed and fully realized (You will most likely have a favorite character), the story is mature and poignant, this is just such a atmospheric game that's so wholesome. I can tell those who made this game poured a lot of love into this game as they've talked about it and how it helped the people who made it work through their grief. This game is currently helping me through my grief in a way that's difficult to explain. It hurts to see someone go, but you should try to focus on their legacy rather than their absence. Grief hurts, because grief is the fear of oblivion. But, the wave needs to return to the ocean. The creator's love for this game is apparent in every aspect of it, it is a very well crafted game that has so much style and personality on top of an amazing story.

Thunder Lotus has created something very special in this game. What a delicate and special way to introduce loss into a ""feel good"" game. The game elements are super solid, minimal crafting, base management, etc. Totally separated from the story, this game would  stand alone all on its own merit. its very well conveyed, its theme is consistent, and it can be beaten with sufficient commitment. 

Where i think we really get to *experience* something is the spirits. Each one is very different from one another, adequately suited to there spirit forms, and has a well rounded but still ambiguous back story. We learn just enough to connect, but not necessarily love each spirit. I feel like every player will have strong feelings in a different configuration from one another. Its not death that connects us all though, its loss. Loss and moving on, past the moment that these spirits leave us. Despite the fact that we are all dead in this sea, on this ship, still growing and learning with one another, sending them on their way is still an obstacle of growth. Ill admit, some, i was more than happy to speed through. But others, i wanted to pamper, learn all i could about them, and witness their epiphanies in the time between. 

I cannot stress this enough, buy this game. Do yourself a favor experience these feelings and these moments.  Whether you have been fortunate enough to never lose someone in your life, or agony is all too familiar to you, this game very eloquently skirts the edges of an extraordinarily difficult part of living.

I feel like the DLC expanded it too much.

Also I don't want to spoil, but you can feel very well, at what point in the story the DLC begins..

I bought Spiritfarer probably well over a year ago, played to about 14% according to my save file and never touched it again. I remember enjoying the experience, but like with T.V. shows, 8 times out of 10 I end up dropping them.

After playing through *almost* all of Lies of P, and getting stuck on an end-game boss, I needed a calming game (I ended up returning and decimating that boss thankfully. I will beat that game lol). I love Stardew to death but I have also played it to death. So I turned back to Spiritfarer, and wow, why did I ever stop? I am almost to 30% according to my new save file, and I don't want it to end, with every spirit that passes through the Everdoor, every building built, and crop harvested.

The plot is driven in a way that feels organic and connects with each of the characters. So much so that you really care about the characters and when they leave it feels like loosing a friend.

The soundtrack is fire and really cannot recommend even just listening to the soundtrack without the game. The music certainly hits different after playing through though.

After starting another couple of times and playing through differently prioritising different things gives you a really different experience. Even the timing of deciding which NPCs will work well on the boat together is interesting.

managing the boat, exploring islands, and the fishing minigame was so fun. the music is really good too.

however, the story was told very vague-ly so i couldn't understand most of the characters unless i read the wiki :"">
minigames can also get really repetitive and the animations for certain actions should become shorter i.e. watering the crops takes really long!

You'd expect a game dealing with the reality of death in such a matter-of-fact way to be morose, sad, perhaps blanketed in blues and blacks. Instead Stella flies around with a gorgeous ship on a gorgeous ocean, fishing, weaving and cooking in an idyllic oceanfaring lifestyle, always with a smile on her face. Character moments in a BioWare fashion are few and far between, but the writing is so incredibly strong that they stick in your head regardless. These moments are bolstered by a game that encourages frequent, if shallow, interaction with these characters. Wake up in the morning, hug your passengers, give them their favorite food, maybe improve their house and have a short conversation. By the time you take them to the Everdoor, you've grown attached to these characters even with what is ultimately not much dialogue with them. And let me tell you reader, once it was time to say goodbye I cried at leaving pretty much every single one. Not because they're the most fleshed out characters in the world, but because the game was so good at bringing it's main point across. The ending was such an overwhelming experience that I had to lie down and decompress for a few hours. It is at times, an incredibly rough game to get through if you're anything like me, despite it's cheerful appearance.

For me, Spiritfarer is an incredibly powerful game. I can think of very few ways that touched me in such a raw emotional way as Spiritfarer. I could sit here and talk about some of it's flaws - it's a bit bloated, the sidequests seem largely pointless, and maybe the experience is a tad overlong - but honestly it doesn't matter. Because for me, someone who struggles with the very concept the game is built on, Spiritfarer opened me up and rearranged my interior in a way I don't think anything else has. When I said I cried at every character's goodbye, I wasn't kidding, and that stands all the more in stark contrast to my usual unaffected mentality with most media. That alone means this game is doing something miraculous, and it means the flaws basically don't exist to me.

For what it's worth, Spiritfarer makes this incredibly clear right up front. Your job is to help people. I expected to help people. It just so happens most people just want you to do their chores. Sometimes they want you to go to places that require upgrading your ship. To do that, you need to collect rare resources (obtainable only through mining or sawing them yourself, and, on rarer occasion, provided in little chunks by some of your passengers). Then you have to sail back to Alfred to hear another joke and install your upgrades. You go to the location you originally wanted to go, and now, you have a new location to head to, and suddenly none of the resources necessary to make it happen. So you get back to the grind. I need X; the only X I see on my map is half a world away. Well, I guess I better cook to pass the time. It becomes very clear very quickly that Spiritfarer is mostly going to be watching the ""Are we there yet?"" bar fill up on the way to your next destination, watching the same landmarks pass by as you go in search of ever-precious beef and peach seeds.

If the game wasn't so rewarding, I would probably describe it as busy work. The reward? It's the dialogue, this storytelling. Despite my slowly ramping frustration with the management elements of this game, the writing never let me go. Each character carries such a presence through their appearance and their particular mannerisms that even if some names get lost in the process of ferrying souls, the memories and stories still remain. And the way activities tie directly into the characters is so wonderful! Even as the activities themselves became boring, I could still feel the impression of those around me stuck to my ship. Death lingers; life lingers. It's impressively powerful, even when all these wonderful words are condensed into little more than occasional hums and single sentences.

It's a real triumph underneath all those bright jellies and lightning storms, real, beautiful art. Even if dying is sad, death can be beautiful. And Spiritfarer is beautiful. I just wish that it wasn't covered in so much sawdust and ectoplasm, that the game let itself be as beautifully brief as its dialogue.",1687118985,1698744146,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, now its my turn. I just finish the game and must say, wow. 
I had it on my wishlist for a long time and after i finaly bought it, i was not disappointed. 
It is a beautiful and wonderfull game. But of course also, a very sad game.
I know what i buy and what my job in the game was but still, it hit me realy hard.
Some of the spirits touch me more as others, but i think this was normal.
The characters of the spirits were realy colourfull. From the old people that get weaker at the end, over the troublemakers and more special characters, to the friends and family from Stella. I think the one who was hard to say goodbye were the child Stanley. The first time i saw him i just tought ""Oh no , you realy dont make me bring a child to the gate of the afterlife."" But that was it. It was hard the moment, were the boy ask to go to the gate and his last words hit realy hard.

But that is the part of the game, were it shows the face of the real life. Death has no age limit, even it is hard to think about it.

In the end, the money were wourth it, it was a wonderfull game.

I only have one negative point. The missions with the dragon. It was realy, realy annoying. If you dont hit the place on the tail of the dragon, were you can land, exactly, you fall in the water. This was a part of the game i dont realy like. Even if you miss the spot a little, it dont count and you need to start new. This was realy annoying with the time limit. So, if someone from Thunder Lotus read this, maybe you can fix it. 

But appart from that, like i say, a wonderfull game. What i like most from it. It was a different game. Whitout a big difficulty, no realy battles and bosses and so on. It was, different. Something i think we need from time to time. Just a little game were you can relax, build your ship and take care of the spirits. I would love to see more like that. Maybe a Spiritfarer 2? With a new character, new spirits and maybe a train instead of a boat^^. Just as a idea. 

Thanks to the Thunder Lotus Team for making the game.

28.11.2023

I must say, after a year now, where I play it again with my friend, I must say that somet hings change. The grind is really annoying. Why I must have so many different buildings and ressources? That you take care of the Souls, okay. But like that? And in the end, only to upgrade a hous, where some of the Souls dont really interact with. And yeah, the Souls. Some of them are good written, others not. Some of the story behind the souls you only learn from the wiki. And Stellas backstory comes way to late.
And one of the biggest critic points is, the trailer lies. You see how the characters inteact in the trailer and in the game, nothing. The characters walk around, stand here and there, and thats it. Some make music or work, but most of them do nothing. Where is the interaction between the characters? Where? Was it so hard to really let them talk with eachother? Some of them dont really interact with Stella. I mean the moment she saw her uncle. I would let her hug him for a long time. But you can only hug characters if they want it. Even if there is a emotional scene where a hug would fit. Dont work, you just hug the character before, now you must wait. 

The game is beautiful and the music is a materpiece. There are many good things but also, some critic points. If there will be a Spiritfarer 2 one day, pleaase Developers, no grinding and if you make it, not so much. And let the charactersr interact with eacother like in the trailer.",1647127579,1698526050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I initially picked up near its release, then stopped playing for a while, and then went back and finished it. I liked the idea of a game where you play as the boatman ferrying souls through the gate and helping them with any unfinished business. It deals with grief, loss, and remembrance. It's an intriguing proposition.

I don't really know how I feel about it. It's a recommendation because its art and music and atmosphere and writing are all great. But as for the game itself, I don't know, I don't think it's that good.

Okay, let me qualify that. It's not that it's not good. It's more that it's not for me. I like sad games, difficult games, complicated games. I've cried through a few endings in my time. But in, say, Celeste, the emotional payoff is gated by tight and satisfying platforming. In Undertale, it's bullet hell and puzzles. Here, it's... farming.

I'm not a fan of grindy stuff. I don't like when my games are routine. Routine is for my daily life, not my virtual escapism. I know all games are ultimately repetitive, but I prefer those that at least make an honest effort at hiding this repetition.

But the thing is, the grind here is also part of the experience. It's one of those ""story supported by mechanics"" type deal. Your daily tasks represent Stella's journey through the underworld. After all, taking care of those around you is often a routine, and it's often not very fun. That is the whole point.

So I can't really knock off points off of it. Yeah, I thought the gameplay was painful, but so is Stella's story. You can't really extricate one from the other. And at the end of each of those quests, you do get a very emotional scene with an interesting character. But I wish I could just skip through most of it. But then, wouldn't that cheapen the experience?

I guess it's good. Not my game of the year, but good. Yeah, okay, let's make that a recommendation.",1698157833,1698157833,True,7,0,0.568288862705230713,0,True,False,False

There's definitely a lot more to this than I expected - I was looking forward to maybe ten hours, and I've easily doubled that. You could spend a long time in this world.

The story itself is gorgeous. As someone dealing with grief and learning to heal, it speaks to me especially. You get attached to these characters, and letting them go is heartbreaking and wonderful all at once. I can't tell you how powerful some of the content here is, you need to experience it for yourself.

Would I play this multiple times? Probably not, but only because it seems like a story you really close the book on.

The atmosphere and role characterization are amazing which is why this game receive so many positive reviews.  You need to carefully read the dialog of each character so that you can know him/her better, and that's how the game shape their character. 
Thus, this game is not for everyone, for example if you skip every dialog and think feel for NPC is stupid then don't buy it. As for the gameplay, basically ""collecting resources -> upgrading -> finishing task -> collecting more stuff"". I'm not saying this kind of game is boring, but you do can find one that is better in gameplay with same price or even lower. So you can see some negative review says this game is boring.
Treasure the time while a character is still with you, because you don't know when will they ask you ""take me to Everdoor"", which means they are about to leave. As previously said, each character are alive. You'll probably moved each time you ""say goodbye"" to a character.

Spiritfarer is a game that wants to make you feel, while mostly using mechanics that makes you numb. It doesn't always work. There are beautiful backgrounds, deep characters, and touching scenes that will keep you going, but the moment to moment of the game is A LOT of mini games. Most of them are ok-ish, some are terrible (the ones with precision platforming, you'll know when you get there), but none are actually something that you would choose to do willingly. You'll find the bulk of the time passing by as you do some meaningless task so you can get 25/25 of whatever item you need to open up the next mini game that will propel the plot further another inch.

But then, steam tells me I clocked 90 hours into this game, so it must be doing something right. I wish the game mechanics were more engaging, but it does have that Stardew Valley feel of just ""being"" in the game world and passing the time. And when the plot hits, it hits hard. 

Pros -
- Beautiful hand-drawn art with incredible animation
- Excellent soundtrack 
- Great, memorable characters
- Emotional plot-beats that stick with you.

Cons -
- Too many mini games.
- Precision platforming is out of place and not fun.
- Some of the quests get tedious, especially towards the end.

[i]Spiritfarer[/i] is a management sim and sandbox action game developed and published by Thunder Lotus Games.

[b]Story[/b]
You play as Stella, who together with her pet cat Daffodil take over a role from mythological Charon of spiritfarer, a ferrymaster who sails the seas to find spirits, grant them their wishes and ultimately send them to afterlife through a gateway- Everdoor.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Spiritfarer is about spirits and ferring with exploration, management and few platformic bits added to the mix.
Discover areas and lost souls looking for your help, meet their needs and constantly improve your vessel along the way with different resources found from exploration or crafting.

Your ship will not only serve as a way to travel, but it will be a home to all spirits you find along the way, and Stella herself. While she and Daffodil nap in captain's cabin, any other characters will be temporary placed in guest house, though sooner or later a question of building a little cozy space for them will come.
Besides personal houses you will be able to make production buildings with all types of purposes. From places focused on utilizing different materials you collected to showing off your green thumb with gardens or orchards, all important to improving your vessel and to keep up with spirits needs.
Additionally you have a little fishing spot in the back, so while you travel to a location you can relax with little fishing minigame and catch some old shoes or glass bottles! Sea creatures every once in a while too.

Everything you collect, from sealife and resources to products can be sold for glims, games currency used to buy items from vendors or to fund crafting buildings.

As you progress throughout the game, your ship will need to expand and improve too. Upgrade crafting table to unlock new buildings, add accessories to reach new areas and simply make your vessel bigger so you can have extra space needed for whatever lies ahead.

All upgrades and buildings are useless if you have noone to use them for. So sail forth to find different spirits scattered across the game and bring them to your cozy ship so you can take care of them. Each spirit has a mood meter, which changes based on multiple instances. Main one, hunger. Everyone needs to have a meal every once in a while, and each spirit has their likes, favourites and dislikes. You will spend quiet a while in the kitchen, learning and experimenting with all ingredients you have to discover new recipes. Having their own house, improving it, completing their quests or just a specific company from other characters can also make them happy. Oh and don't forget to give them a nice hug! It's good to keep everyone satisfied as spirits with great mood will offer help with tasks on a ship or some sort of support in other way. On the other hand, keeping low morale will have unpleasant effects. Once you are done with character quests, there will be time to say goodbye.

Beside mentioned spirit requests serving as main quests and a tab to keep a look on what resources are needes for another ship upgrade, game offers ""shenanigans"" which are different type of quests from other characters you encounter during your travels.

Speaking of travelling, it's a key part of Spiritfarer. Each location you discover offers something, and game is seperated into differently themed regions. You will find mist covered forests with tress to cut down and berries to numb on, colorful villages with merchants or deep, deep mines with valuable ores. Each location has a little list near it so you can know what to find in and clears out a bit of fog on the map.
Additionally few places offer different minigames related to spirits.
Because map is quite massive and ship not a rocket type, there are bus stations spread across it used as a way to fast travel.

Finally, Stella does a bit of acrobatics in the game to help you travel. Double jumping, gliding, bouncing, though you will have to unlock them in shrines.
Some areas will be not accessible at the start due to your lack of specific move so there will be some backtracking one way or another.

If something is confusing or might feel like tad much, don't worry! Game offers great tutorial that slowly introduces you to all mechanics it contains.

[b]Playtime, replayability and other modes[/b]
Oh you know how it is with those management games. Hard to point out how much time one will spend on it. My full 100% playthrough took me 35 hours but it was not my first, I assume average playtime should take 30-40 hours, even few hours extra if you want to do everything.
With lenghty playtime and all emotional pieces not having same impact second time around, you don't have to give game another go unless you have not played it after updates with new spirits rolled out, didn't finish it first time around or if you want to play it with someone special in coop. I would say it's more of a ""return every once in a while to fish and enjoy peace"" game after you beat it.
There is option of online coop through Remote Play where second player steps into the paws of our fluffy companion Daffodil!

[b]Pros and cons[/b]
Spiritfarer is a fantastic title.
From gameplay perspective, it offers great management mechanics mixed with sandbox and few action platformic bits.
By any means it doesn't do anything new nor fresh. Craft materials, utilize them to build and expand your ship, focus on spirits and keeping them satisfied. You know, the usual. But it's nonetheless enjoyable, especially if you seek something slower paced.
It does have a lot of backtracking which might not tickle everyone in a good way, and certain tasks as time goes by can become repetitive once you mine ore or cook a meal for hundreth time. But it also offers fun platformic thanks to design of locations and abilities, fantastic artstyle with detailed animations and wonderful orchestral score accompanying you all the time.

And to level it up, you add whole emotional part regarding spirits, to create this mix of...colorful, wholesome, feels good game that at the same time covers topics of death, of people left behind and possible light of hope to achieve bittersweet balance. As you encounter new charismatic characters, discover their backstories and ultimately have to send them away in really emotional moments, before returning to cat petting, fishing, hugging whoever is left or trading with greedy raccoon. And in a weird way, even if not all characters have same impact, this difference between their personalities and your favourism is what makes it more..humane. That not everyone will affect you and won't be there for you forever, some people will come and go faster, will not be up your alley and you will have to deal with their flaws, yet all might teach you something and spark hope. It hits you even more if you know the feeling of losing your closed ones, of people who might have played an important part in your life and how those final moments felt, so game can be even more reletable.

As I've said before, gameplay at certain moments can become a bit repetitive if you play the game too often. Backtracking can be tiresome. Sometimes platformic sections are frustrating. It's best to take it in short sessions and when you have that feel for slow paced, emotional title. But when you do, there are very few, or maybe even no better games to scratch that itch than Spiritfarer. I adore this game.

[b]Final words and conclusion[/b]
There is a playable demo on Steam if you want to check out gameplay side of the game before purchasing it! 

Spiritfarer offers perfect balance between cozy, wholesome management gameplay and emotional narrative covering death, abandonment and hope. Cannot recommend it enough.

The character, known as animal spirits are what make this game so emotional and grew up on me. All their backstory, personality and sense of humors are well-designed including their own unique quests. The grinding and story pushing are very addicting and fun to do.

But that being said, I still find some of the issues as the gameplay: 

1) While the grind is fun and very addicting, it is also annoying and tedious later on. Especially you have to manage all of the resources and knowing your plans what to do, where to go in order to catch up the story (this isn't including grind to 100%). 

2) The event is also annoying, too because it will force you to go to that character to play or not play. Of course all of the events are important for story and grinding grim to buy more resources and upgrade your boat. But having to run down to that character every time is very tedious. Sometimes I don't want to do the event becaus but I have to go that character to disable the event. I wish there was a way to auto-disable the event while going to the next location without getting asked to play the event.

3) The control is very buggy for me. Movement in this game are very basic even with special movement, but sometimes the input started to get stuck and can lock yourself from running around to go inside and interact with NPC or animal for resource. A good example is zipping; with zipping, sometimes pressing W to zipline didn't work properly or the hitbox of zip line is very precise?

While I find the grind is starting to get boring later on, you can't pass out this story. The character, artwork, backgrounds and OST are what makes me addicted to play more.

I began this game thinking it's a cosy short peaceful game and might be a good change of pace. While it was cosy and peaceful, it was not at all short, and I thank the devs that it was not.
Each and every spirit was so unique and was designed so well to hit right in the feels in a myriad of ways. While I can never forget the passing of Gwen and how clingy it made me feel. I swore never to take another spirit to the Everdoor (except the annoying ones of course). But when spirits like Summer and Beverly expressed hurt, I had to rush them to the door.
Leave no stone unturned in the care of the spirits. The game feels gratifying only then.
Elena was a fantastic curveball. While she was annoying af, still she posed a challenge. I was terrified of even trying to hug her. She hugs you once... and that hug felt the best in the entire game!
As the game went on I planned on spending time with the spirits. Getting to know them to reveal facets of their personalities, what they liked, disliked, and especially their favourite food. The narrative strategy was mindblowing imo. Anecdotes in bits and pieces. Loved it!
Atul... man... Atul... his disappearance was a punch in the gut. Ah it was the saddest of all. You could've at least said goodbye, Uncle Atul :'((((
Everything about the game felt perfect. 
Gwen's warmth
Summer's aura
Atul's banging
Alice's cakes
Astrid's friendship
Giovanni's pompous charm
Gustav's beak-cut Sushi
Bruce's inflated denial
Mickey's serenity
Beverly's forgetfulness 
Buck's RPG energy!
Stanley's buoyancy
Elena's one&only embrace
Daria's cathartic release
Jackie's warm self-loathing
and finally...
Lily's familial presence... everpresent at night for an embrace.

And the artstyle and the music... oof! Suits so well to the atmosphere. Stella's movement becomes so fluid after having all the shrine perks. It feels more like a metroidvania. Genre-wise it may be a management game, but the experience felt all-encompassing. 

Enjoyed it... thoroughly! Would definitely recommend.

P.S. Thank you for all the tear-jerking chills at the Everdoor, devs! :')

I finally got to the point where the game would allow me to reach the end scene and, despite having three more 'spirits' and thus three more stories to yet complete, I took the sweet, sweet release of death, instead.

Well, not literally. The game isn't THAT bad.  It's just it isn't that good, and worse, it isn't that fun. The ponderous story is pretty good and pretty deep, but it is strung together with some of the worst skinner-box clicker-like gaming that I've ever had to put up with. 

So, the story. The story is about death. Yeah, you knew that already. But it's more about the end of life. The game can be heart-rending. It reflects far too well the experience of caring for aging and dying parents. It digs deep into philosophical questions about if a leopard can truly change its spots, given the opportunity of a deathbed confession. Subtle it is not.

The game lets you skip through dialog. Thankfully.  There's a silly nod to fast-travel, sort of.  But that's the end of what's skippable, and there is the core of my angst with this game. It is soooo sluggish and non-responsive. It requires you to be constantly doing the silly make-work of watering your plants, for instance.  But the hot spots are slow to appear, and if you try to rush it, you're likely to water the wrong place.  And when you do, the game will punish you with a lengthy animation of your character watering the already-soggy ground.  You cannot interrupt this.  

There are a number of skill challenges that essentially come down to knowing how long to hold down a button before releasing it.  If you hold it down too long, the game punishes you by locking out your controls for what feels like an eternity.

You need to shear and feed a pair of sheep? Oh, that's gonna cost you.  The animation that is amusing the first time, is infuriating the hundredth time when you're literally limited in the number of hours in the day.

The game attempts to balance itself out in its later hours. Your passengers become somewhat less demanding, travels starts getting faster, and a lot of the manufacturing and economy tasks begin to fade from importance. But it's just not enough. 

The straw that broke me was when another pair of just-plain-unpleasant passengers showed up on my boat and started making demands. Uggggh.  Just kill me now.

And the game let me. Kill me. It let me just die.

And for that, and in the end, I'm grateful to the game.",1695953053,1695953053,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The concept seemed right up my alley, the art direction is lovely, and (to a point) I enjoy a resource management game done right. But playing it, there were several areas that really hampered my overall enjoyment of the game.

I really wanted to like these characters, but the only opportunities you have to get to know them is when you're doing things for them. You can't chat with them outside of quests, and the 'talk' option is really only there so you can get items or so they can tell you they're hungry. [i]Very[/i] occasionally you use it to advance other quests. The pacing of the questlines and the overall story is also bizarre. Some characters quests come one after another, rapid-fire and then they're gone. Others end up taking forever (or simply get put on pause for an extended period because the item or ingredient is in a location that can't be accessed until a different character's questline has been completed). The layout of the map frustrated me as well, though I fully admit this is likely due to personal preference rather than being an actual fault. I also feel like content added in later updates wasn't implemented into the rest of the game very well.

I wanted to play the whole game through before leaving a review, in case my experience got better over time. But unfortunately, I'm left at the end of this feeling like I could have spent the time I sunk into this game doing something else.",1695947725,1695947725,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The strongest point of the game is in its story. However, don't confuse its strongest point with the main game loop. This main game loop is platforming & grinding where you've spend like 90% of the time doing them (compare to the story which surfaced occasionally like only 10% of the time). And that's the issue here: platforming is suck and grinding is boring.

The platforming: To summary, it is not tight. While I don't expect it to be that tight (like those specifically platforming games, e.g. Mario, Metroid, Celeste, Ori, etc), but I do expect it to feel good to some extent. Which this game fails to implement these details (no recoil animation when landing, no jump buffering, use the same button for double jump and gliding, and many many more). While these imperfection could have been ignored and/or forgave for such story-based games, this game does feature intensive platforming sections (dragon's mining, comet/lightning collecting, bat's tower-climbing). Those are unenjoyable times which I wish the game should not have them iff the game have these wonky platforming mechanic.

The grinding: Normally, every game that feature grinding in them can (and even sometimes, should) be boring! But there are many technique to subdue these unfun aspect of the game. Take Animal Crossing for example, that game force players to wait for days IRL for the resources to regenerated; or Terraria that let players have other source of fun by grinding w/ friends. This game does it plainly, which, in itself is not wrong. But the requirement of resources is so humongous it get boring real quick. That's half of the story which, again... might be forgivable(?) However, the animation for collecting resources is so freakingly badly designed. Cutting [i]A[/i] tree would take [i]minutes[/i] when the main character is too far from the companion character (so the cat will be slowly floating into your position, and the control-takeaway after finish cutting tree is so damn long). Watering a desired vegetable plot is so damn easy to be mistake (result in watering its neighbor plot, which has been watered just a minute ago, instead). Miss-mining for ore took a very very very long penalty recoil time. Oh boi... the list goes on and on to the point that I think the developer just want to torture us players by designing a game that's NOT RESPECT OUR TIME AT ALL!!!

Appreciate it as a heartwarming story. But think twice if you gonna play the game by yourself.",1695300460,1695300460,False,12,3,0.624544382095336914,0,True,False,False

My main issues reside in the tedium of the game.
The characters have small bouts of dialogue, but I was so busy running back and forth between shenanigans and taking care of each of them (i.e. making sure they were fed, hugged, and upgraded, which entailed a lot of farming for resources) to remember their stories. I barely remember anything about all of them because of how irksome and repetitive the game gets. 
Most of the time is spent farming for resources or silly side quests over actually getting to know the characters, and that's where my main issue resides.
I think I had a worse time with the game *because* I 100%'d it and ran the shenanigans, when I could have spent more time with the characters.

My other issues lie with how the game drags itself out by the end. It takes time to wait between requests, so you just end up leaving the game running in the background. I got the privilege of faring all of the spirits they have added to the end, but by that point I was just longing for the game to finally be over and forcing myself to the finish line.
I actually really like Jackie and Daria. A lot. But it took so long to complete their stories, because I had to wait a full day or two between the next request, and I ended up doing nothing substantial during that time.

All in all, I think the game intended to be tedious sometimes, but I think it just gets way out of hand to the point where it was at least for me, dreadful. It became so boring doing the same tasks over and over again for 50 hours.

However, at some point, I completely forgot that it was for her and figured it was some side-scrolling adventure game and started to play it myself (39M). At first, I stared at the screen and then my wife and said ""uhmmm... I think this game is for you."" But decided to play it for a while.

Immediately when the game got going I said ""Oh wow, the music is beautiful."" Then ""Oh wow, the animation/graphics are beautiful."" And suddenly I was immersed in this extremely beautiful game - with a great story (that at one point hits you like ""Well holy ****""

I enjoyed almost everything about this game. It made me laugh, it made me tear up at points, it made me think, it was as best as I can tell, a mostly perfect game. 

If I could name a few downsides - they would be:
1) The game doesn't seem to know its audience. If this game was meant for casual gamers - I don't know how they'd manage half of the tasks requiring skillful 2D platformer abilities (you know, like being able to beat Super Mario Bros 1 on Nintendo, with running and jumping, something my wife has never figured out and perhaps few stardew valley aficionados would be good at). Throughout my game play I asked ""Who is this game made for?"" I still have no idea. I loved it, but have no idea, because while you can do farming and other 'lax' sort of things, I felt the game required some skill level that casual gamers may not have had (and I don't mean it to be derogatory towards those folks, I just know my wife's controller skills, and they're too limited for this game).

2) I remember being very confused by the story and had to look up who the characters were and how they knew the main character (your character). I'd look it up and say ""How was I supposed to figure this out?"" It didn't detract from the game, but something I still wonder.

3) Perhaps lacking replayability? When I 'finished' the game, I knew there was more to do, but I felt like it wasn't really worth continuing. I'm not sure I'd play the game again, but I don't know because I love the art style and music so much, I could see myself picking it up again

These 'negatives' are pretty minor to me. I got 50 hours played on this game and that's well worth it. 100% excellent game and I list it as one of my top games I've ever played. I moved on to Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and was actually depressed, feeling like it lacked a lot of the beauty, creativity, and contemplativeness that Spiritfarer contained. This is just one of those amazing games that you stumble across and has an impact on you. For these reasons - I recommend it to anyone I can.",1694706699,1694706699,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A very big part of what makes Spiritfarer so great is, in my opinion, the depth of the characters, including protagonist Stella but extending to - well, each and every creature you'll meet along the way. All spirits have complex personalities, good traits and bad ones, secrets, regrets, lifetimes of memories, and each of them would make for a great spin-off. The mechanics is probably not as intuitive as it is for many other games, but learning how to navigate this excellently built world is very rewarding and I promise you'll grow doing so. Some platformer elements were challenging, using a controller helped a lot. In case you struggle a bit with the controls in the beginning, I can only encourage you to give it another go, it will get a lot easier. I'm saying it because I gave up after 20 mins or so initially (couldn't figure out how to move stuff around the boat, which is very basic but I somehow overlooked it...) and I am so, so glad I tried again after a few weeks.
Dealing with loss, grief and the sheer intensity of being with someone at the very end of their life is certainly not easy and the game depicts the beauty of it without concealing the sadness, rather channelling it. Overall it is strangely uplifting and encouraging. I imagine it can truly help people while they go through their own grief. I played it after Stardew Valley and didn't expect it to be on eye level with my favourite game. Now that I've finished this one too, I hope to be able put all the lessons I've learned about letting go to practice.

As you get older, dealing with loss and death becomes a natural part of life. Having lost familiy and unfortunately also a two childhood friends, you become aware that having the opportunity to say goodbye can not be taken for granted. The opportunity to give someone a final hug, tell them you love them, that you'll think about them and that they will be missed, what I would give to have that moment..

Spiritfarer took me on a journey where these characters gave me the feeling that reminds of so many of those people. My grandma who would fall all the time, couldn't really take care of herself anymore but refused any help we offered. Walking out of her home and forgetting where she was supposed to go before her feet hit the curb in front of her house. Spiritfarer gave me that exact feeling, wanting to take care of someone, having difficulties to accept their time has come and then.. letting go. 

Each of the final boatrides in this game was overwhelming, always with a smile and most of the time with a tears in my eyes. How beautiful is it, that a game can make you feel this way? That every character feels genuine, that your own path is made by those who came before you and were part of some of the chapter of your life? 

Spiritfarer isn't just a game, it's a life experience and I urge you to see where it takes you.",1694630981,1694630981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a few things I like and dislike about this game. 

Likes:
- The story is beautiful. 
- The art is gorgeous. 
- The collectables are fun
- There is a lot of tiny goals so a huge sense of satisfaction

Dislikes:
- The story can use some refining. I liked a lot of it but found myself not connecting with some of it too. While I don't mind the concept of ""difficult to love"" spirit/people, I think some of them were just not for me. The way they spoke and the huge chunks of dialogue was just too much skipping at times. I have ADHD so you give me all that and it is a boring dialect .. ya, I am not going to read it. I hate to skip but there are 2 characters that forced me to skip
- The story got a bit weak at the end. It felt as if you can end the game anytime after a certain point which makes it weird when you have all these quests and spirits. Nothing will stop you .. not even an internal dialogue. I didn't like that
- While you need to collect/make stuff, sometimes you will get them for free but they don't count for the collectables. That was a bit odd [especially for recipes] .. You can figure it in game but it took longer time than needed [imo]
- No meditation feature [time skipping]. This is not necessary for the majority of the game but at the end and if you are a completionist like me - aiming for 100% quests/sub quests; that was torture. I found myself in need of a few days passing to get certain item or spawn certain errand. Not cool. 

Overall, I do see me going back to play this game again; especially the main quest/certain sub quests. It is still a lovely story. I am not sure, however, if I would be able to complete it again considering some of the characters' writing at the end. ya. this one character I am thinking of now is ruining it for me! lol.",1694622412,1694622412,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. The tone of the game. Overall this is a heartwarming game as mentioned in the game's description. I personally enjoy more melancholic and sad stories and this is most definitely not all that sad or melancholy from what I played. 
2. Everyone basically already knows each other. They reference past events like ""Remember that time we were at that place doing the thing?"" I like forming my own opinion about characters and whether or not I like them or befriend them. I also like forming new memories that I can then think back on, but having characters like this means they know things I don't, so there's a fundamental disconnect between me and the protagonist.
3. Characters. Similar to number 2, I feel like all the people in this game have preformed friendships, attachments, and so on, especially with the main character. For a game about connecting with others, I failed to really enjoy this. 

Overall though I did like the gameplay. The music was also really good. That being said, there is no automation so daily tasks become repetitive very quickly, and they only increase in the amount you feel like you need to do.

I don't know if I'd recommend this or not. A game that fails to connect with someone doesn't mean it's a bad game necessarily, just that I didn't enjoy it. Others clearly do though as 95% of all reviews are positive for it, so I'm in the minority. If you want to play, go for it.

Playing this game with someone was definitely a better experience, since I am not a big fan of games that make you do daily chores. I always preferred crafting over mining in Minecraft and Spiritfarer is no different.

The concept of the game is awesome. You have your own ship and you sail to different islands on a map, completing quests. Sorts like the 2D version of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. However upgrading the ship is a core mechanic that makes you progress in Spiritfarer. You collect resources and then craft / build new buildings for your crew or upgrade ship to access new areas in the ocean. While you are doing that, you spend a lot of time talking and caring for your spirits onboard. Apparently the game is heavily inspired by the Ghibli's Spirited Away and I see the connection.

Spirits on your ship are quite demanding. Requesting you to build expensive upgrades, cook specific dishes and taking them to specific places. Through completing their requests they will tell you insights about their lives. Spirits are vibrant and memorable. You spend quite some time with each of them before saying goodbye. However piecing together all the fragmented bits of information that the spirits tell you about themselves, proved to be rather difficult for me. It is like reading a book where the story makes sense only at the very end. So the patience is required when playing this game.Especially considering hefty 30 hours of playtime, required to complete the game,

But I would lie if I said that the game is boring. You easily end up playing for several hours straight, telling yourself to complete only one more task before closing the game. However mid to late game does slows down significantly as you already discover most or all the map and you just cruise up and down gathering resources. And at this point game does become repetitive. Depending how much you are entertained by the mini games onboard your ship, this last part will drag. I liked crafting mini games - sawing wood, crushing materials, smelting metals... but gathering materials in different events wasn't doing it for me. Such events usually feature materials falling from the sky that you just need to catch. My co player was luckily greatly entertained by the cooking mechanic, although figuring out new combinations that produce new dishes, was almost impossible in the late game , as you didn't have proper way of tracking your cooking experiments.

But regardless of repetition, playing this game felt good. The art direction is superb with diverse themes and color palettes of different areas and islands. Soundtrack is memorable and NPCs add liveliness to the places you visit with well written dialogue that entertains you.

Luckly I do not have much experience with death - a core theme of this game. But it defenitely got me thinking about the concept of dealing with the loss and ultimately accepting it. I will definitely remember this game when such event ultimately comes in someone's life.",1693897331,1693897331,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It can be a chore trying to figure out what dishes everyone likes but if you manage your tasks and just have a nice cruise around it is really relaxing. *SPOILERS>* One thing that can never leave my mind is sending off characters. It gets me every single time I know the game is sad but they let you learn all about one person, their food, their hometown, their family and then all of a sudden you are leaving them too. Taking them to the spirit door became something I avoided for a little bit just to spend more time with them. But it is needed to progress the main plot line of the game so I just go with it. *SPOILERS OVER* But the beautiful thing about this game is how they manage to get you to head to different islands for story with little to no direction. Everyone kinda thinks the same about which island to head to next, but enough about the story. The art of the characters was one thing, but most of the islands look amazing, and just wish I took the game a little slower and enjoyed it a little more.

[spoiler]Its an amazing game. I have never seen or heard of a game before which is made about that topic and is good. To be honest I have never heard about a game with that topic, but still.
But what is it about? It's about letting go and learning that death is not the end of everything. It's about getting to know individuals and their special behaviours and their quirks and their views on life.
Like the name of the game says, you are a spiritfarer and you accompany the spirits you found and saved. You help them finish things they couldn't on their own, and you help them to make their peace.
It's a very emotional game and every of the spirits is unique in its way.

I have mixed feelings on parts of the game, but would overall still say it was an enjoyable experience for me. That being said, there were some things that sort of bogged the game down.

Aesthetically, the game is very nice. The graphics are beautiful and the animations and music are all pretty good as well. A lot of my issues come from the gameplay and parts of the story. Initially, the gameplay loop is fine and fun, and the story was personally engaging enough for me to want to keep playing. But Spiritfarer seems to be quite front-loaded. I found most of the characters that I found to be enjoyable to interact with were ones you find at the beginning. Towards the middle and end of the game, a lot of the characters come off as rude or just generally not as likable as the earlier characters, though some of them do ""redeem"" themselves as you go through their story. This wouldn't be too much of an issue on its own, but I also found the gameplay started dragging around the last 4th of the game. You are constantly looking for/creating resources, so to me personally it became much more about getting stuff to complete the requests rather than actually taking my time to get closer to the characters. The time you start spending to gather all the resources start to increase as you have more and more different resources that you will need, and this is not really alleviated that much as there is nothing to automate these processes. The only thing you will get is maybe faster or double the resources depending on the type. This also led to a problem where some characters came and went incredibly quickly because I had unknowingly finished some of their requests beforehand via buildings or upgrades and the like. This on top of some of the characters being generally unlikable led to me not really connecting with some characters at all, which kinda sucked the enjoyment out of the game at points. 

Overall, I still enjoyed the game, but the combination of the gameplay loop becoming pretty grindy and the later characters being generally lackluster made the last 3rd or 4th of the game pretty miserable at times. There are some more minor complaints I have, like some animations being quite long, so when you start having to see that same animation multiple times it starts to eat up a lot of time and lose its charm.

It's easy to learn, fun to explore, and I wanted to return to the world everyday until I beat it. There is freedom yet a trajectory that is both enjoyable and easy to follow to accomplish goals. There is enough customization, yet not so much its overwhelming. Challenging enough to keep you entertained, yet relaxing enough to call it a laid back game. You get attached to the little characters you're taking care of on your boat, and it's almost always hard to say goodbye. The characters are well rounded in that they are both touching and prickly, each with their strengths and weakness like any human being, most of them still lovable anyway yet everyone will walk away with a different experience and different favorites - like life itself. Such a touching narrative that highlights a difficult part of life. Not many video games successfully hit so many notes, especially in a subject so sensitive such as confronting with and coping with death. 

The game play is similar to a lot of laid back games in that there's cooking (crafting), exploring, fishing, and challenges involving the dexterity of your character.

The storyline is so unexpected but at the same time very realistic. It's a great game for people to learn about death and at the same time, it's very healing for the people who experienced death.

I have always enjoyed resources management game but i have never paid much attention to the story line. This game did it so well that it makes it hard for me to ignore the storyline (actually that's the whole point of playing the game). It's so immersive, how it slowly unfold your relationship with the others is just awesome. I

*spoiler*
The story telling is just insane. It feels like a very good movie. 
1. I like it the way it started with your best friend and saying things like how your family has helped her escape. The first spirit being your best friend definitely helps so much in the immersive experience.
2. I like it the way when you are used to the game play, and you thought everyone is leaving in sequence but suddenly Giovanni has so limited task but leaving the ship so quickly and it shook me. But it's kinda just like real life, people who came latest in your life could be the earliest to depart.
3. I like it the way in the beginning you thought the spirits are just random people, but they are actually someone you knew in your life, and very close too.
4. I like it the way to avoid dragging out the game for some people, you actually had the options to end the game early. And that part definitely shook me again since i didn't expect to learn of my own death by having reminiscence with my own sister.
5. I like it the way you could see the star for the spirits at night when you are cruising on the sea, that's nice little detail.
6. I like it the way every spirit has their own thing to guide you through, and when you are playing the mini game after they have left, it kinda reminds you of their presence, and you sorta missing them for it.

There are some small glitch once in a while which i am totally fine to ignore. It didnt cause you having to replay a whole section so it's fine, just have to restart and all.

Você assume o papel de Stella, que com seu navio, conduz espíritos, que são apresentados na forma de animais, em sua transição para a morada final, o céu, o além, ou como você queira chamar. A mecânica do jogo é centrada na administração de recursos e em quests pra satisfazer as últimas vontades desses espíritos que estão prestes a partir.

Como acabo de mencionar, um dos pilares que sustentam o jogo são seus personagens, os espíritos, afinal, é eles que você tem que abrigar, alimentar, e até mesmo abraçar ‒ o que aliás foi uma das mecânicas mais legais e únicas que achei nesse jogo ‒ para tornar esses momentos finais tão acolhedores quanto seja possível. Os personagens são em sua maioria simpáticos e tem interessantes histórias de vida que fazem você se importar com eles. São eles que trazem os momentos emotivos do jogo que fazem até mesmo você refletir sobre determinadas coisas.

O segundo pilar que sustenta o jogo é a sua mecânica. Você basicamente obtém recursos para construir casas para os personagens, para expandir o tamanho do seu navio e poder construir estruturas especializadas como cozinha, moinho, serraria, forja, curral, galinheiro, etc, para obter outros recursos necessários para alimentar seus personagens e completar quests.

O problema é que ambos os pilares do jogo tem alguns problemas estruturais. O jogo começa com um ritmo bom, os primeiros espíritos são simpáticos e tudo flui bem. Mas à medida que o jogo avança, você precisa lidar personagens mais chatos e tediosos, as quests e a busca por certos materiais mais raros se tornam maçantes, com muita repetitividade. Algumas áreas do mapa só são acessíveis quando você faz certos upgrades no seu navio, e chega um certo ponto que você empaca, pois a última evolução do navio, para ultrapassar áreas de nevoeiro, depende de um material que não existe em lugar nenhum. Tive que olhar na internet pra descobrir que[spoiler]você precisava PESCAR um personagem aleatório, que depois de um tempo teria um besouro de estimação na casa dele que dispara um evento que lhe dá o tal material.[/spoiler]
Forçou horrores a barra.

Pelo que li, alguns personagens e quests foram adicionados através de atualizações depois do lançamento do jogo. Até o final do jogo e a história de background da protagonista foram alterados por meio de updates, o que demonstra que as coisas foram meio que surgindo ao invés de terem sido planejadas, e isso transparece na diferença de qualidade da história dos personagens e de suas quests da primeira metade do jogo em relação à segunda. E pra um jogo que você pode jogar por 40 horas ou mais, é uma bela bola fora. Parece que acrescentaram mais conteúdo em um jogo que poderia ter sido muito bom com 20h de duração, para artificialmente estender essa duração mas com conteúdo pior.

Visualmente o jogo é lindo, com gráficos bem desenhados, cenários dos mais variados, incluindo ciclos de dia e noite, belos nasceres e pores do sol, e até eclipses, assim como mudanças climáticas. Não faltou esmero no visual do jogo, e essa parte é impecável. A trilha sonora também é muito bacana e complementa de forma muito competente a experiência.

Fiquei no limiar da dúvida se recomendaria ou não esse jogo, mesmo eu tendo comprado ele durante uma sale. Mas aí eu lembrei do querido tio Atul e resolvi recomendar. Mas com asterisco. É um jogo que requer bastante paciência, e que apesar de ter seus bons momentos, também tem uma mecânica um tanto arrastada, algumas quests sem sentido, alguns personagens que não agregam muito, e até um final fraco, o tornando uma experiência que pode frustrar muitos jogadores. Mas muitas outras pessoas relevam essas coisas. Este não é o primeiro, nem o vigésimo, e não certamente não será o último, que traz uma premissa muito interessante mas implementada através de uma mecânica que é falha e sinceramente quase bota tudo a perder ([i]The Witness[/i], estou olhando pra você).

The game screen flashes from time to time when harvesting trees to catching lightning bolts. The game is also overly bright in general between the backgrounds, the sun sets, and even the text boxes were getting to me. 

I did check to see if there were any options for disabling the flashing screens or to enable a ""dark mode,"" but I wasn't able to find anything, so I decided to request a refund. I generally play from my couch in the living room at night time, and found myself looking away from the screen anytime I anticipated it would flash, which is not enjoyable.

Many of the gameplay and presentation elements are used effectively to present this central theme. To start with, most of the characters feel nuanced and complex, and the game is able to share a ton of information through relatively little. Everything from the way characters walk around the boat to their favorite foods to the way that they hug the main character stella say things about who they are as people. What probably helps in this regard is that I believe all of the characters are based on real family members of the development team.
With the realism of the characters, the game is set up for you to care about them, and that makes the gameplay all the more cathartic and bittersweet when these characters do meet their end. Your role isn't as savior here, its mainly towards facilitating and guiding these lost spirits through experiences for them to find some sense of closure, while trying to minimize their physical suffering as much as possible during the process through simple things like a nice meal, a comfortable place to sleep, and regular social and emotional interaction.
Gameplay wise there are a ton of similarities to other life sims, but this game is not really meant for optimization. Cooking a spirit a laborous expensive meal fills their bellies just as much as a simple to make cup of coffee. Whats more important is learning what a characters favorite food is and what that says about their character. Similarly, one could hoard resources, but the gameplay loop doesn't demand or reward you for doing so and much like in real life, hoarding resources doesn't do you much good in the afterlife. I think that gamers who get the dopamine rush of optimization might not find as much satisfaction from that aspect here. Rather, this game asks for you to take its roleplaying to heart and invest in these characters, not through resource grinding/optimization but through emotional connection",1692603271,1692603271,True,7,0,0.577194094657897949,0,True,False,False

I bought Spiritfarer ages ago, and could not get past the tutorial because of how much hand-holding was happening; I was trying to figure things out myself but instead had to follow exactly what the game told me to. It got old pretty quickly so I gave up about one hour in. Then recently I decided to give it another go as so many people were recommending it, and got really into the story. I've cried tons of times playing this, and this is why I'd recommend the game. The concept and story are really good (even though you're basically playing Fetch Quest - The Game). 

There are however quite a lot of flaws that made the experience very frustrating for me: 

1) The game doesn't know whether it wants to be open world or linear. There were many times where I'd unwittingly explored past where the story had progressed to, but I was required to backtrack and do every single step in the way the game wanted. This was very annoying because I really wanted to figure things out on my own, not be guided so much. Either you want me to explore, or you lock me into linear gameplay. You can't do both. 

1b) As a byproduct, I ended up exploring too much and unlocking very important plot points out of order. This really ruined the experience for me, as after uncovering a major point I didn't even feel like finishing the game properly. I just did the final quest and decided to call it a day. After 35 hours of gameplay, this is what bothered me the most. I didn't even get to explore the game in its entirety, and now I don't care enough to go back and fill in the gaps. It's a shame because I think 100% in this game would be quite rewarding. 

2) There is way too much hand-holding. I don't like to be flat-out told how to do things or where to go - for example sometimes you'd get quests where characters would talk in riddles, making me think ""okay so I've got to figure out what they meant, nice"" just for me to open the Quest tab and see that the game had already indicated a location for me, taking away the fun part. I don't get why. The themes are very mature, so I don't think this is geared towards children - so why so much guiding? Just let me immerse in the story and use my brain.

3) Quest reminders. Characters will give you a quest that might take HOURS to fulfill (totally fine with this, it's what makes fetch quests fun for me), and then constantly remind you that you haven't fulfilled it yet. Thanks, I know. I'm waiting to get there, and you're just making me hate you by constantly remarking on how long I'm taking. I have a Quest tab for a reason. Stop pestering me. I legit stopped talking to several characters, didn't even feed them for a long time, because I was tired of being reminded. S t o p. 

4) Too much of the lore is not explained in the game itself. I took a look at the Wiki and turns out each character (including the protagonist) had tons of background which is never properly explained in the game - what's the point? I don't want to have to buy the Artbook to get lore. Either you leave the player to make their own assumptions (which is what I did, just read the dialogue and made my own ideas about characters and their stories) or you find a way to add the essential lore to the game itself. Some of the things I found out through the Wiki were pretty essential and would have really enriched the game; why do I have to read about them on the Wiki/Artbook? 

I think I'm just gonna leave it at this, the review is long enough as it is... a shame, really. I constantly went from deeply connecting to the characters and story to hating every second of it and just forcing myself to get to the next character so I could get more of the story.

Spoiler Free Summary: You play as Stella, the new Spiritfarer (basically the ferryman for the River Styx). Their job is to guide souls on their final journey before they escort them to the Everdoor, the gateway to the afterlife. With their cat Daffodil at their side, you will join Stella as they pick up old friends and new in order to help them during their final days in this plane of existence.

My thoughts?

It's legitimately one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are stunning, and the animations are super smooth. The music is very beautiful, and really adds to the overall atmosphere of every scene. 

As of the time of writing this review, I have not beaten the game. But so far, the story is very well written. The characters really draw you in and I found myself pretty invested in a lot of their backstories. I may have cried a little when I had to take some of them on their final ride to the Everdoor.

I'm big into cozy games, and this one is VERY cozy. No combat, just gathering, crafting, story advancement.

Fair warning though, this game, obviously, centers around death and dying. Some of the characters memories are not the most pleasant and touch on some sensitive topics. Based on what I've seen so far, it's nothing super extreme or horrible, but everyone is sensitive to different things.",1691900528,1691900528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like wholesome life sim type games, then you certainly should, since this is about as good as that type of game gets in my opinion - but it goes *so* much further than that in terms of character development and storytelling. This is a really well deserved 'overwhelmingly positive' rating.

The writing itself does it's best to not get in your way - this isn't reams of excessive lore dumping, it's just a handful of lines of dialogue from the denizens of the ship every now and then, but they've really maximised everything from those really limited interactions. Each chat is so full of heart and soul, all the characters are written with so much empathy, even the negative characters have upsides and there really needs to be more of this kind of characterization in games. This isn't ""shades of grey"" or ""black and white"" just... everyone has their things, life is complicated, people aren't perfect, but everyone is trying, and everyone has a little good in them regardless of the circumstances. It's honestly beautiful.

It doesn't sugar coat the bad stuff, and it doesn't drown the good bits in sickly sweet ""wholesome"" vibes, it's just real and empathetic, and I totally adored this games world view.

From a gameplay perspective, I don't know what else to play since I don't play a whole lot of life sims, but I really thought the core loop was great fun. You sail around the world collecting resources, doing jobs on the ship, making dinner for people and uncovering more of the map. There's a lot to see and do in the world and they really made the most of the 2d perspective - the game feels much bigger than it truly is, and I really like when games can pull that off. 

I didn't find it too grindy, which is something I think life sims suffer from occasionally, but towards the end as I had less guests on the ship, I did start to feel the grind just a tad, but not enough to dramatically affect my enjoyment.

You have a ship that you build up, farm food, craft, take care of your passengers, sail about getting more of all of these things. The way it's presented is pretty fancy (and pretty), but it's a very traditional and simple game loop.

I've had to take multiple breaks, I've thrown up, I've been left jittering and nauseous with intense headaches for 20-60 min at a time. I love this game so much, so I've REALLY been trying to just suck it up, but at some point, it becomes a danger to my health. Memorizing when to look away from the screen helps, but I can't predict every time the screen is going to flash for seemingly no reason other than.. I dunno, to look cool? It doesn't look cool to me. It looks like losing my lunch and being bedridden with a massive headache.

When confronted about this, a developer stated that it was ""epileptic cleared"", that ""we will not be updating the game any further"", and ""try being in a well lit room, or not drinking alcohol"". Frankly one of the most insane responses I've ever seen to asking for an accessibility option, which is all the stranger after seeing how they were willing to change offensive dialogue for a disabled character. It's honestly baffling reading their only response, seeing how many people were affected by it and just wanted to play the game. If it was epileptic cleared, then whoever cleared it needs to be scrutinized for their stupidity. 

TLDR; Fun game, love it a lot, would love to play it without becoming extremely pained, sick, or bedridden. Photosensitive people deserve to play your game, too. Frankly, I don't think I'll ever be giving money to Thunder Lotus again seeing how they've responded to their clear accessibility issue.",1691266267,1691266267,False,26,1,0.712908327579498291,2,True,False,False

I think the key is that it is structured as a bunch of MMO style quests from the guests on your boat. So there's some direction to your sim management.

Spiritfarer is composed of tons of little mini games and a plenitude of collectibles. Did you get all the recipes? All the jewels? All the fish?

It is also a chill game with no way to die or fail. The worst you can do is burn some resources on something pointless, forcing you to go collect more of them again.

[b]Spiritfarer[/b], another beautifully animated game form Thunder Lotus, opting for less gameplay in favor of a more slice of life (slice of death?) approach.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
You are Stella, the new ferryman taking spirits to their final rest, and the atmosphere is not dark and drab as one might imagine, but leaning more on the bittersweet, a lot of happy moments followed by introspective ones, your objective being helping spirits make peace with their past before having them move onto the afterlife.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Simple and varied, mainly a platformer, navigating the small islands you’ll visit, and the other half comprised of minigames, either by cutting wood, making fabric or helping plants grow and many more, all tied up by a string of gathering/fetch quests that keeps the story and progress chugging forward.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The main narrative, is composed by many shorter stories, namely the ones of the passengers aboard your ship, some are good, some less so, but unfortunately, in my opinion, none truly shine to make this an unforgettable experience.

The game can generally be described a platformer, and you travel across the map in search of various key items and crafting materials to upgrade your vessel and progress the stories of each of the characters. In that way, it's actually very fun to explore and prioritize your own goals. Each character has an interesting and emotional story to tell, and their mannerisms are well designed.

Where it starts to fall short for me is the various minigames and maintenance tasks that you must keep up with in order to continue making progress. Many of the material gathering animations take up a lot of time, and aren't skippable, so I couldn't get to the things that compelled me to keep playing unless I watered all of my plants/mined all the stone to get the materials I needed.

+ Lovely, passionately drawn 2D art style
+ Varied and inspired character and world design
+ Endearing, expansive character dialogue
+ Unique combination of open-world exploration and animal-crossing style town management
+ Frequent, hard-hitting, emotional story beats
+ Wide variety of gameplay challenges, in the form of platforming, crafting minigames, resource collection events, resource management, structure placement, and recipe discovery

* No way to ""game over""; the closest you get to a fail state is suboptimal completion of the crafting minigames and resource collection events

- Towards the endgame, resource collection and crafting can begin to become repetitive as the player starts to get familiar with the processes and is aiming to wrap up the final few tasks they have lined up
- As the ship becomes 'emptier', the game slows down and starts to lose momentum towards the end. Perhaps this is somewhat intentional design by the developers, but I still think it slightly hinders the experience.

Spiritfarer, for those who will enjoy it, is something close to a perfect game. The experience is almost like reliving a storybook from your childhood, but as you yourself playing the main character. As you travel the sea, visiting new islands, you meet more and more varied and interesting characters, all with unique visual designs, personalities, dialogue, and gameplay implications. 

The game offers a staggeringly large collection of different gameplay challenges, far more than you'd expect from what appears to be at face value a largely story-focused experience. From jumping around collecting fireflies, to catching lightning in a bottle, to tending to crops, to placing buildings on your ship so they fit optimally, to jumping between cliff faces on a gusty island, making use of upwards drafts to ride higher, the list is nearly endless. As a result, there's never a dull moment playing spiritfarer; there's always something to do, and it's almost always something different.

The most impactful part of the game, however, is the story. You play as the replacement to the ferryman of the dead, leading lost souls to their final resting place. Every character you meet, no matter who they are, always eventually has to be taken to their final destination under the bridge, where they permanently depart from your ship. Most games shy away from removing characters as the story progresses. Spiritfarer does exactly the opposite. 

Each character's arc, from initial meeting, to development, to their final journey, is treated with grace, respect, and dignity. You know you won't spend forever with each new character you meet, and the game knows that too. But instead of reveling in the character's departure, and milking it for emotional impact, the game's plot and story structure focuses on the breadth of the positive time you *do* spend with each one. The final moment where you ferry each passenger to their final resting place is not a sad occasion; it's a memorial to all the amazing things you did with them while you two traveled together. It's one of the few games that's managed to make me shed a tear.

Spiritfarer is a game about recognizing the fleeting nature of life, but at the same time, recognizing its powerful beauty it has in the time it does exist. It chooses not to focus on the end, but instead on the journey that carries us there.",1690686641,1690686641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spiritfarer is a non-competitive, fun, and relaxed game. You don't have to care who's in 1st place or any of that. However, if you're searching for a game that can relax you from a day of stress or something that you don't necessarily have to play 24/7. With Spiritfarer you can get off the game and then not play it for a week and then still get on track. There's some puzzles that may be confusing and you may have to look it up, but overall it is very easy to understand the story and know what to do. 

The artstyle is also something extremely amazing, it has a similar artstyle to Eastward (another game you should check out). It is also a long game that is worth your money. I bought this game during the summer sale and I have spent 20 hours on it. However, I am only 15% done with the whole game. There is so much customization, you can change your character's colors and your ship design. 

I have a boyfriend which he doesn't even have to pay for the game, I invite him to a remote one where we hit local co-op and it is so much fun. Especially since you only have to buy it for one person and can do remote play.

I also do not do reviews much and this is one of the only games that I have posted a review on, this game is so amazing. I'm very excited to see the new spirits and can't wait.

It also teaches about how we should learn to let go and move on.

You take on the role of the newly appointed spiritfarer, taking on lost spirits in the afterlife, and catering to their every need until they are ready to move on: giving them lodging and food, keeping them happy, and fulfilling any other requests they may have. Throughout that process, you learn about each spirit's life stories.

[h2]The good[/h2]

The game's main highlight are the spirits you take care of, who are all well written, and diverse in their background, motivations, and even in morality. (To not spoil anything,) some are much easier to please than others. Some will be in a much more dire need of help. Some are brimming with positivity, while others will literally drag people down, and some will even treat you like a complete tool. The game urges you to treat them all with kindness in their final days. (Although there's no severe punishment for neglecting them outside of their necessary requests.) 

I've found myself feeling attached to almost everyone I've gotten close to over the game, and some of them particularly shined through. Though I am far from emotional, I can assure you that letting your friends go is going to be a very hard thing to do, and you'll be doing that over a dozen times.

The artstyle is also a highlight. The environments, with its clean (almost mural-like?) art style is pleasing to look at, and the animations are fluid.

You can also hug everyone, and pet the cat.

[h2]The bad[/h2]

The core gameplay loop is harvesting resources found around the game's many islands, and processing them to fulfill the requests of your spirits on board.

This can easily feel very grindy, especially if you're trying to have all your facilities constantly running, there will be a lot of handiwork in between all the brief moments you're actually getting closer to the spirits, which either involve long timers, or minimally engaging minigames.

You're also likely to came across requests that require materials from regions or events you only unlock later, this puts a halt to a relationship with someone, and can also sometimes confuse you, in cases where you miss a spirit, or otherwise think you can ignore the one that unlocks that material.

An advice I can give you while playing is to focus purely on the requests that you have, do everything that you can do. You don't need too much of anything. Just harvest whatever you come across, and don't stress over constantly having everything running. The gameplay is not the core of the game.

The spirits' requests will also become predictable after some time, they all follow a general pattern.

Expect your casual playthrough (releasing all spirits) to take up to 30-40 hours, with many periods of minimal activity. By the end of it, I was getting tired, and just wanted to be over with it.

Overall, spiritfarer is a very touching game, but your experience will mainly depend on how emotional you are. If you usually take grief well, and/or you're focusing too much on the gameplay, like I was, Spiritfarer is not going to have the impact on you that it actually has.",1689985020,1689985020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw others refer to this game as ""bittersweet"", which is the best word to describe it with, in my opinion. There were more then a few moments which gave me literal goosebumps.
For those who are not familiar: the story is all about heavy topics like death, loss, regrets and acceptance. The characters are so well written that quite a few of them made me think of real people that are or have been a part of my own life.

Audibly the game is beautifully serene and visually it is nicely drawn like an anime.

The gameplay is pretty well balanced, except for the last couple of hours during which it slows down too much for my taste. It starts of great and ramps up in a perfect tempo. I didn't feel overwhelmed and also never felt bored during the startup-fase of the game. When the gameplay loop reaches full speed it felt just right for me as well. There always was a lot for me to do in a way I never felt rushed.
Unfortunately the loop did get stale towards the endgame, which for me was like the last 6-8 hours of the game. I wanted to complete all optional content, during which I sometimes had to wait for the game to catch up with me. This is because the amount of things to do quickly dwindles when the main story reaches its end.

All in all I think Spiritfarer is an almost perfect experience and I'm very glad I didn't miss out on it.

[h1] Cons [/h1]
[b] - Repetitive : [/b] Even if the interactions are unique, if you do it a hundred times, it does get repetitive and can get on your nerves, especially since it loves shoving you the resource acquisition animations. [b] JUST BE DONE WITH THE RESOURCE GATHERING, STELLA! [/b]

[b] - Achievements : [/b] [spoiler] Due to the lack of manual save, if you missed it, you have to restart the game again, rewatch and send three spirits to their way, have another go at resource gathering, to reach the halfway of the story, all for that single damn achievement. 0/10. [/spoiler]

[b] - Buggy at times : [/b] I have experience minor bugs and glitches here and there. It's not really game-breaking, but it takes away from the flow sometimes. I'm having a moment here!

Overall, if you want to soften your [i] cold, rocky heart [/i] because of all of the bad news in the world, then go grab a cup of hot chocolate [i] (or milk, or whatever you prefer) [/i] and play this game.",1689677170,1689677205,True,9,0,0.635423600673675537,0,True,False,False

The narrative it presents has much more depth than it may seem, the characters are all loveable in their own way, and the ""management sim"" gameplay is fun, with a progression system that feels rewarding as you upgrade more and more things on your boat. 

Not without a couple faults, the coop mode is a bit lacklustre, with only player one being able to actually progress the game and player two being stuck with more of a ""janitor"" role. 
There were also times where certain early characters quests seemed to just be on pause for a while, since you needed a far away upgrade/resource but were not told that you couldn't complete it at the moment, leading to some circling of islands trying to find where the heck you missed something.

These minor details though were massively overshadowed by just how good this game is. It will have you crying happy and sad tears, and you will fall in love with the world and the characters within.

It is a beautifully crafted story that leads you through the sorrow and sadness of losing people you love. Some though long journeys where they lose themselves slowly, some where they're there one moment  and gone the next. The joy of a life well lived, and the tragedy of a life far, far too short. People who were good to their very core, and some who were not, but who loved deeply (to a fault perhaps). There is such a wide range of emotions to be felt in this game, but it is also very cathartic. The characters are all flawed people, but ones who love regardless.
It's not all sobbing your heart out, there is an actually resource management game here, but you do need to be emotionally prepared to face some heartbreaking goodbyes to progress. 
There's a beautiful metaphor here, for how you get to decide when you're ready to go through the next stage of grief, no one can make you go any faster than you're ready for. But you also can't move on without loss, and without facing the heartbreak that comes with it.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1689083342,1689091816,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game makes you feel such a wide range of emotions, I've been able to relax, disconnect from my irl stress and feel bonded with the spirits that pass through the boat, each one has such an unique personality and it feels difficult to let go once they're ready to be taken to the everdoor. I think it's specially impressive how I've been able to reflect some of my own life experinces with other people through the dialogue in-game, going as fas as to make me cry when a character might hit a little too close to come. I find it very comforting in a way, as it will also keep you moving and reward you for exploring on your own.
The ost, character design and animations are beautiful, it might be better to take your time when playing, it is quite long after all (I'm not half way through with over 20 hours of play time). I 100% recommend the game.

But to me it felt as if the game was trying to force me to care for the spirits because my character 'knew them' already, instead of allowing me to get to know them organically. The choice to make at least the first three spirits people who had shared backstory with my character just didn't work for me, and the gameplay wasn't interesting enough to draw me back in after that.

Wow, this game was an experience. I was not expecting this game to have the emotional gutpunch that it does. Sure, it's a cozy management game about dying, but there are ongoing, periodic revelations that everything might not actually be what it seems. There was a fair amount of dark topics and cursing to make this seemingly light-hearted game get pretty, pretty heavy at times. 

Mechanics-wise, it's very easy to play. Platforming ramps up in slight difficulty towards the end, but nothing actually hard. Everything feels fair and balanced. The world events are all great, the simple farming mechanics are all great, and usually 1-2 button presses. That's not where the game shines though, really, it's all about the story. And what an amazing story it is.

Art style, pffft. Hand-drawn in video games is always a winner in my book if they put any actually effort into it. And they did. It's a beautiful game.

Cute, expressive art

Cons:
Pacing is rather awkward, so you do feel a bit weird when you build someone a house they ask for and they immediately leave, or start telling you how much they believe in you after knowing you for 10 days. 

The characters are also rather boring, I suspect you'll only like them for the people in your own life they might remind you of to than the quality of the character themselves. 

Two of the characters hit the same motifs, which makes for very weird reading.

Character development is managed badly- a lot of characters behave inconsistently, or express sentiments or feelings which aren't really earned over the course of their stay on the ship.

Lots of random infodumps about past lives from characters that barely know you.

This game has amazing artistic visuals, a great soundtrack, a bittersweet story line, and you can pet the cat! The gameplay can be a bit repetitive, but I'm someone who actually enjoys tedious grinding for materials so this game is perfect for me. The characters tackle some serious issues that make them feel human and easy to connect with. They were also all very unique in their character designs and dialogue; I loved all the little individual theme songs. 

All that being said, I probably wouldn't replay this game unless it's been a few years, but I still think it's worth the price. It took me about 40 hours to do everything there is to do in the game and I enjoyed every minute of it.",1688513820,1688513820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think if you feel the need to always have extra materials on hand you will find the game frustrating. The platforming on the boat is complicated due to the buildings' structures, which makes some mini games difficult to do well. At the same time, it's not a technical challenge of any kind.

Huge respect to the developers and masterminds, it shows that they put a lot of effort and personal experiences into the game.

Buy this game if:

✅ You're into metroidvania alike games, HEAVILY FOCUSED ON FARMING resources;
✅ You can withstand a long,hefty text-based storytelling;
✅ topics such as: mental issues, family and other adult oriented subjects are up your alley;
✅ you're ready to invest at least 20 hours into the main game;

Don't buy if:

❌ the above points don't apply to you;
❌ repeated and unoptimized grinding aren't bearable to you (there's indeed a high chance that they won't);
❌ you were looking just for a swift and aesthetically pleasing and light hearted game;
❌ you've had or you're gonna grieve for the loss of someone you love and/or you were close to;


Verdict: 6,5 (a really stretched one) [b]WITH STRONG CAVEATS, please see below[/b]

Time required to finish the main game: 20/ 25 hrs (advice: keep a guide with you,even when not going for game achievements)
Time required to complete it at 100%: 33-35 hours (strongly advising to play with a collectible/missable items' guide)

[b]1- what is this game? what's the core gameplay?[/b]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995812784

This is...a beautifully looking game, no doubt; [u]Charon (the former spiritfarer / psychopomp ) now needs a well deserved retirement. Now's your turn to take these ""lost"" souls into the Void/Everdoor/Last Step.
What will you do for at least 20 hours is to drive an upgradable ship between seas, storms and islands in order to gather souls, hoarding resources and completing (too) many errands for your guests and acquaintances, while trying to keep
them happy and well fed.[/u]

[b]2- Grind. Grind and more grind...however this is not Stardew Valley. Many quality of life changes could have been implemented easily:[/b]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995812936

Hoarding resources and travelling back and forth between locations is the core gameplay...and needs to be done...countless, countless times; sadly some aspects of travelling,hoarding and forging aren't opmimized, few important examples:

a) you can't delegate any minor task to anyone, all must be carried by your hands directly, even after fully upgrading your working stations;

b) there isn't a quick menù to keep track of your items' collection progress, while there's a handy one for building and upgrading structures;

c) the mission tracker doesn't have an option to quickly prompt you to a specifical location on the map, meaning that you'll have to manually search and pick it most of the time;

d) you can't quick travel once you enter your ship, either you take a bus which will take your ship into a nearby fast travel station or you'll have to enter the driver's cabin and reopen a menù;

You get my drift here...there's A WHOLE LOT OF CLICKING AND MENUS, even into the dialogues, which sometimes are way too long winded.
Luckly some characters really do shine in terms of animation and personality, if you've got yourself invested into the story, there's a high chance you won't forget this game.

Spiritfarer is a mostly-relaxing game where the player assumes the role of Stella taking the reins from Charon and becoming the boatwoman that guides spirits to the Everdoor, the gateway to their eternal rest. Several of the spirits are loved ones from Stella's life and it soon becomes obvious there is more afoot than first revealed.

The controls are easy and simple to master, as is sailing about the map of the ... not-quite-afterlife. Various islands dot the map, where the player can find and meet the waiting spirits, who will join Stella on the boat. The passenger spirits take the form of anthropomorphic animals, as do many of the spirits of importance, such as Albert the shipbuilder, who appears as a wise-cracking shark. In fact, the game has a sense of humor; you can watch a talking deer spirit in high heels berate a price-gouging raccoon by calling him a trash panda and a striped weasel. Other spirits appear as ghostly forms, adding either background flavor or an odd request here and there.

Each passenger spirit has specific needs and wants, and a task or three to fulfill before asking Stella to carry them to the Everdoor. Each likes to have their own house aboard the ship, and certain foods. Each has a happiness meter while on board, ranging from angry to ecstatic. Mood is affected by feeding them regularly, building and upgrading their houses, or even offering a comforting hug from time to time. There are no consequences for some spirits going angry, though others will wreck buildings on the ships, set livestock loose, or otherwise become uncooperative, so it is important to keep them at least at a middling happiness level. Their personalities range from sweet and adorable to abrasive and unlikable, and I am sure everyone will find some their favorites (I loved Atul and Alice) and least favorites (yes, Bruce and Mickey, that means you). It became very hard to let some of them go through the Everdoor and as time goes on, the player realizes that's not quite what has happened ... but no spoilers. By the time the story ends, it is quite a melancholy tale.

Fortunately, to keep her passengers happy, Stella can harvest resources on the islands, go fishing for food and items, sort through shipwrecked debris for treasure, and build structures on the ships. The player will have to manage several resource types and glims (currency) to upgrade the ship for room and speed, and to build more advanced buildings. Crops can be grown, sheep corralled and sheared, zircon chunks smashed to make silica dust, and many other possibilities. There are special events for special resources scattered about the map, and new areas which are initially gated off. Both resources and areas can be unlocked as the correct spirits join the ship. As Stella travels, the player will also be able to unlock new abilities, such as double-jumping and emitting a burst of light, which will help acquire resources or reach areas previously unavailable. There is a roaming merchant who always seems to be close (to sell treasures and barter for money and rare resources through tasks) and a network of fast-travel portals run by an excitable seal, that prevent long stretches of sailing across the map or back to port to unload.

Unfortunately, the progress through into new areas is very regimented as the player needs to pick up exactly the right spirits to progress from area A to area B, and again from area B to area C, and so on. It's not an afwul approach but it is somewhat limiting and less ""open-world"" in design. Many building upgrades will become available long before the player has the right spirits to unlock the special events for critical resources, and will sit around in your ""Available Upgrades"" for a while. If you find yourself stonewalled with progress over one resource, keep looking for the spirits you've missed. Also, I have to say in mid and late-game, managing all of the tasks on the ship--growing crops, cooking food, feeding animals, converting logs and ore to boards and ingots, scraping shellfish from your hull, etc, can become very tedious. You'll also hit a point late game where money means nothing, which robs some of your main secondary actions (doing tasks for the merchant and salvaging treasures) kind of moot.

Graphics are a minimalist, cartoon-style that works well for the gameplay. Sound and music are excellent. The game itself feels very clean and error-free. I had no glitches or crashes, and scene transitions loaded with quick efficiency.

Steam Achievements are all attainable by an average-skilled player, if they want to dedicate the time to do it. I believe (i could be mistaken) that it requires at least one full and one partial playthrough (for one pivotal decision) to get one-hundred percent.

Spiritfarer is going to be one of those games that is going to be what the player makes of it. I imagine someone could zip through the main storyline in less than twenty hours, or spend more than twice that collecting everything, seeing everything, and engaging the spirits in banter and camaraderie. Either way, it's definitely worth a look.

Pros
- Relaxed, unhurried gameplay
- Melancholy, nostalgic story

Cons
- Very regimented progression
- Task management can become a burden

I feel like it is death by a thousand cuts, nothing too egregious by itself but all of the small problems add up, turning my fond feelings into disdain, for both the game and the characters. The writing, while good at points, doesn't stick the landing for many of the characters and does not redeem the game play. A lack of quality of life improvements adds to the slog, the slow animations made me hesitate doing all the tasks between fishing, logging, mining, and even exploring.

If you feel like the writing of the character dialogues and the fond farewells will be enough to get you through the end, then like many other people you may truly love this game, as it is very unique in what it sets out to achieve. The differing opinions come from whether you think they reached those intended goals. I wish I loved this game as much as the others, but by the end I was begging for myself to be taken to the Everdoor .

This plays as a much more relaxed and broader-focused [url=store.steampowered.com/app/493200/RiME/] RiME [/url] type of experience, both are equally as sad though this one is far less tragic and leans more towards wholesome in its own way. I don't want to go into too much detail here and risk spoilers, but if you've lost anyone close to you then you'll likely connect with the story and possibly one or more of the passengers you meet along the way.

I replayed this recently after the free expansion and all of the final patches had been released. The new character additions added a few more layers to the adventure with some of the experiences diving a lot deeper into their issues and letting you help them directly, similar to the Sea Serpent in a way. The expansion also added a few new features, additions to the boat, and new music that's themed to each person.

As for technical bits, audio and visuals are top tier, and the soundtrack does an outstanding job of adding to it all. Oh man the music that plays when meeting Hades, I wish I could go back and experience that scene again for the first time. The hand-drawn everything in this really goes a long way and I'm glad they stuck to it, it's basically animated in Shadowbox style because of the excellent layering and visuals. The game did have bugs at the time of release and the devs were quick to fix them as they got reported, nothing for me was game-breaking. I'm extremely glad that they added an option to turn off the Seal's music, oh man, that track was clearly made on an offbeat day.

My gripes with the game in its current state shouldn't deter anyone from playing this, these are very minor issues. The game has finished development which is good unless you encounter a bug, the problem now is that the Devs will respond to bug requests but are seemingly unmotivated to fix them anymore. I dislike that many of the upgrades you get for the ship come way too late in the game, nearly by the time you've finished farming/crafting materials and it all just becomes excess. It also bothers me that the ship is powered by your Everlight, but it can't move at night because... reasons? You can eventually do this via a late-game character that joins you, but honestly why was this ever a thing. Additionally why can't the navigation room be moved, let alone accessed at night if I just want to view the map?

Note: I highly recommend reading each character's artbook entries in the fan wiki as you help them along, it will uncover more of their story and involvement with you while not really spoiling anything.",1607141593,1687147685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visuals, the characters, the stories, the gameplay, the music, they are put together with all the care in the world. The only slight downside for me was that the gameplay got a bit pointless after a while, but other than that I can recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone. If you would like to get on a very emotional journey with a simplistic management system and a risk free, cozy gameplay loop, then definitely try this game.
[list][/list]
I want to get the only thing that bugged me out of the way first:[list][/list]
- Gameplay: I played this game with my wife in coop and at the start it was wonderful. Managing the ship, getting resources, making food for the residents, trying to prepare all the resources needed for the upgrades, it all worked really well. The minigames are fun and keeping all these tasks in mind is engaging. At the beginning gaining money is still a challenge, so we had to plan what we wanted to do next, what things we need more and we wanted to/could sell. Then we started the cloth and fish business and it pretty much broke the gameplay. At around halfway through we had pretty much infinite money, had all the resources ever and apart from the interactions with the characters, the gameplay became completely pointless. Don't get me wrong, the movement system is butter smooth, the basic gameplay loop is very fun but if you are worried about the money like we were, you might end up making your gameplay unnecessary. I don't know how common this might be among the players though. Also, important to mention that there is no failure in this game. You cannot loose. This might be off putting to some people and that’s completely understandable, there were occasions where we were hoping for some consequences. But eventually this game is not about that. It is about the stories, the characters and the feelings it evokes. So let’s get to that part.
[list][/list]
The good stuff:[list][/list]
- Music/Graphics: Regarding the music, all the songs fit perfectly with the scenes and locations, it adds a lot to the atmosphere. On the graphics side...well...I mean just look at those screenshots. Everything is hand drawn and the whole game is absolutely beautiful. Every single pixel in this game is gorgeous, the animations, the locations, the characters, the effects, everything.[list][/list]
- Characters: The basic idea is that there are plenty of passengers on your boat and you get to know them more and more. There are a few characters who will be more active and some who will just have a quick and simple story. Their personalities , however, are the absolute best things for me in this game. As you get to know them more, you will learn their background, their interactions with Stella (the protagonist) and it is all executed perfectly. BUT, I think in order to enjoy this game, a recommendation is to be open to other people's personalities, getting to know their point of view of the world, being open to what they are about to say and enjoying deep, personal conversations, stories and tragedies on some occasions. I am really into this kind of stuff and we had so many late night conversations with my wife just about the characters, trying to figure them out more and more. If this sounded interesting to you, I think you can safely buy this game. The main part that really got us with the characters though is how real they felt. In the artbook the developers talk about real life inspirations for characters and they added a bit more backstory to the creation of the characters, but we could already feel playing the game that these characters really do feel like people. For me this is so incredibly rare that I don't think I ever experienced this in any other game on this level. I know there are plenty of games with interesting and compelling characters but I never felt them being so human like in this game.[list][/list]
- Story: The reason I didn't talk about Stella in the previous point is because she is the story pretty much. It is her journey and I really want to avoid all spoilers, so all I want to say is that the story is absolutely wonderful. If you are willing to play through a very emotional game, then there is a good chance that you are going to cry at the end. The whole “story” is simple, but fits perfectly with the smaller adventures of the characters. There is no real story here to be honest, it really is just people talking about their lives.
[list][/list]
These are the reasons why this is by far one of my favourite games of all time. I am sooooo glad that they added coop with the cat (who is the CUTEST THING EVER and Daffodil is one of the cutest cat names I've heard), because experiencing this game together with my wife made it so much better. This was a very memorable game for both of us, one that we refer to regularly whenever we can.[list][/list]
The only thing I am sad about is that I could only experience this game once as I think there isn't replay value in it at all. Still, that one playthrough was one of the best I ever had and I'll always be grateful to the developers for that. In the end, do I recommend it?

Thankyou for letting me turn off the music for the bus stop, as much as I adore the little seal buddy he gets VERY annoying if I'm parked and watering my veges at night 
Spiritfarer is just a really wholesome game, Stella is peak character design and being able to hug the spirits was the reason I added the game to cart. I lost a very close friend in Jan 22, a few months after I bought this game and I couldn't touch it for almost a year bc I knew it would hurt just so so much when I had to let another spirit go. 
I recently started a new save file and playing Spiritfarer has been surprisingly healing. there are many similarities between myself and Stella, and letting go of the spirit that most reminded me of my friend was a really beautiful though heartbreaking experience. I don't know if she had this game as I havent visited her profile in a long time, but I know she would have loved it as much as I do. 
To the game Devs, thankyou for creating a game that so perfectly encapsulates the feelings of love and loss, and the hope that one day my spirit will be carried gently and quietly to see my loved ones again",1687111633,1687111633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't want to go too in-depth about the story as it ruins a lot of the more though-provoking aspects of this game. You are essentially given the title of Charon, the ferrymen to the afterlife. You are tasked with helping those you find to crossover to the other-side. You learn their stories along the way as well as their likes and dislikes before taking them to the afterlife after they feel content, or unable to cope, with their current state of being.

The majority of this game is indeed resource farming. There's a lot of it. Luckily it's a lot of different things that don't feel unnecessary but I understand the feeling of it getting boring towards the end of the game.

If you have any shred of empathy or have had to deal with the death of a loved one; at least one story in this game will hit you right in the feels. It's hard to play this game, see the stories of others, ferry them to the other-side, and not end up crying. But it's cathartic in a way. The way it weaves topical discussions of existential crisis in what is essentially a glorified resource management platformer is second to none.

From organizing the buildings on your boat, to crafting things for your passengers. This game is so emotional as each passenger is a spirit you take care of. Each spirit is FULL OF CHARACTER, that its so charming! some characters have their flaws or rather all of them but they have their bright side as well. Some characters made me angry others made me feel comforted. 
Each spirit gives you tasks to do while traveling all around this purgatory world, and whats so cool is that the environments never get old. The tasks you do could vary from just having to confront other characters to resolve conflicts, exploring, crafting, or more unique request, such as just bringing them to a place they want, in order to explore past memories. 

But on top of all of this, the best part is that you can HUG EACH SPIRIT YOU TAKE CARE OF. 
IT SO ADORABLE. Some spirits are hesitant to show affection but appreciate and return the love, others just wrap their arms around you. 

The music (wonderfully made by MaxLL) was done so well that the melody is so memorable, from characters themes, different cities and environments, various activities like fishing, farming, weather (sunny, rain, snow), and finally the end. The song that plays when you help a spirit move on from the after life. It's the main lesson from the entire journey. This is a game about death after all. 

SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT

After finishing all the tasks, giving your hugs, and food to your spirit friends, they ask to be brought to a place called the ever door a place where they move on to the afterlife. And the word Bittersweet would be an understatement. Because its inevitable, you can't progress the game without letting some spirits move on, but it hurts just as much as when someone passes away. But that is like life, it happens and its going to be rough, but life moves on. 

You row them to the everdoor, they say their last words giving off their wisdom, or a reflection on everything. and finally they glow bright, float up and disappear. The music really does a great job at a punch in a gut because of how memorable it is. The moment you hear it, you accept that when you bring them to the everdoor, thats it. 

But some spirits don't get to have a satisfying ending. For example you meet this one spirit Frog named Atul, his ending wasn't at the ever door, you just wake up one day after a great night of having a feast with everyone, and he's gone. up in the sky as a constellation. Or Stanley a mushroom spirit who is 8 years old, near his end, his innocence is lost, realizing the world isn't sunshine and rainbows 24/7, what hurts the most is that he expresses fear, he didn't want to go. He was too young, yet death came after him anyways. Or an old grandma Hedgehog who experiences dementia and doesn't even recognize you, the one who's been taking care of her since you found her. 
And then the grand finale, you. 
The music is different. its similar but at the same time its a song made specifically for you, in the end of your journey. the character Stella, (Who you play as) doesn't say anything. She just accepts her fate and hugs her cat Daffodil, and its the same ending, they glow bright, disappear and become a constellation in the sky. 
Finishing the game after 57 hours, it was worth it, to know what its like to face the unknown, learning to let go and move on, appreciating the time you spent with these wonderful characters, and so much more. I'm not gonna lie, I cried a LOT during this game, but I want the developers to know they did an OUTSTANDING job at creating such a cozy game, with so much life into it. so thank you so much for helping not only me but so many other people to think about, what will we leave behind?

Please buy this game and see what the journey is like for yourself. Because if you like taking care for others, this game rewards you for doing so, but never forget, everyone has a different ending.",1640329500,1686543034,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I honestly don't know why I did this to myself, as someone who struggles a lot with letting loved ones go especially my friends that I adore so much, this game brought me to experience different journeys and endings of the characters.

Atul was one of my favorite spirits, he's like your typical cool uncle who'd let you play outside when it rains, and defend you when you get in trouble. I did everything I could to make him stay happy with giving him hugs and food he loved, but it broke my heart when he suddenly left the ship without telling me. He was just gone and then there was a new spirit flower in his room.

I also didn't love some of the spirits' personalities. I had 2 or 3 spirits that I wanted to bring to cross the Everdoor so soon when they arrived. And the way that the elders spirits started to slowly forget everything when it neared their time to go also saddened me.

My favorite spirit was Stanley. He was a weird kid, loved to play around, hated veggies and fruits, and he was lonely because everyone was mean to him. His pet bug was the only friend he had, which he told us to take care of after he's gone. He was like your adorable little brother that you'd protect at all costs, even from his own family that is mean to him. I released all spirits in time except him (and Bucky whom is apparently not releasable). I just had to hold some time before I finally went to the Everdoor to release Stanley. Also the part when he cried before he went down the ship was adorable. 

Overall, Spiritfarer is a sad and heartwarming game about death and farewell that you could play for hours after a hard day at work. It is relaxing, the art and music are gorgeous, the story is not heavy but it shows you the slice-of-life of the characters, and the mechanism is great for a platform game. You could do a lot of things, but there might be a little control difficulty when you need to finish some mini games because you have to jump between platforms quickly. It's not very grindy too compared to the games I usually play. Personally I found it to be not difficult! :]

PROS: Dialogue is well written (mostly) with an engaging storyline.  Novel concept ferrying spirits to their ""final rest"" after you help them resolve some issues.  Spirits all have their own personalities, which can be both entertaining and occasional annoying. Some fun with working out which meals they don't mind, hate, and absolutely love.  You may get attached to some of the spirits.  There's some fun of growing crops and otherwise creating materials you need as you progress, and experimenting with various recipes.  Developing your relationship with the spirits is rewarding, and I personal found also really painful that the Bridge (someone on the boat is cutting onions, I am NOT crying).

CONS: The mini-games in the beginning are a basic grind.  Later on, they can be PAINFUL.  Be prepared for lots of button mashing if you manage to not get certain things (especially jumps) lined up, as you have to go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth until you hit the sweet spot to make it work.  There's also button mashing to get essential crafting items, as part of the mini-games, which can be extremely tedious.  The save system is somewhat automatic, so you may want to write down what you were going to do next.  The mini-games can be painful.  Trying to get some kind of pretty/cohesive look to your boat with the buildings is nigh impossible, as they just don't really fit together; like a bad game of tetris.  Painful mini-games.  Because you're waiting to sail from location to location - which is great for you to be able to do tasks on the boat - it's a bit of a ""time suck"" game, in that you only plan to play for an hour, and find that 3 hours have gone past.  Did I mention that a lot of the mini-games SUCK?  Because they do. So, so, so bad.

Despite my long litany of cons (OMG I hate the mini-games), overall, this game is great.  I just wish that progress in the game wasn't so intrinsically linked to your success in button mashing mini-games",1686132445,1686132445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Great animations & perfect artwork
- Lots of mini-game variety
- Interesting/emotional plot and characters
- The developers truly cared to make this game something special
- The sheep shearing animation made me smile every single time

Cons:
- Character upgrades are almost non-existent to speed up repetitive tasks. You will be farming/mining/chopping/fishing/etc. slowly for 99% of the entire game so be prepared for that.
- By the time you get most useful skill/building upgrades the game is almost over.
- Heavy grinding on mini-games gets very repetitive. Prepare to replay the same mini-games a million times.
- By late game, the repetition was exhausting and I decided to end it by pushing the ending even though I still had 2 spirits left to finish (Buck & Jackie). After 35 hours of the same tasks, I was done with it
- I hated the ship layout. Almost none of the buildings fit together neatly so you have a giant mess of random platforms levels.
- The ship become cluttered with empty buildings after the spirits leave the ship. The only reason to keep buildings after Spirits leave is to trigger their minigames but this creates a cluttered mess near endgame.

Overall, it's a really great game if you don't mind repetitive tasks. I was able to tolerate it for awhile because the game is artistic, meaningful, and has interesting characters.  It explores emotional boundaries and handling the grief from losing loved ones.  It will have you feeling and reflecting on your own life and those around you.

Overall I did feel somewhat depressed while playing this game because it does make you confront & revisit your own feelings of loss on a regular basis. If you've lost close loved ones in your own life this game might make you really sad reflecting on that. This is not a ""feel good"" type of game... it's more of a ""reflect on your own life and accept loss"" kind of game. This is also not a kids game, it has lots of language/themes not appropriate for smaller children.",1686078029,1686078029,True,77,0,0.887263655662536621,0,True,False,False

Let's get down to prons and cons!

+ PROS
∎ Outstanding soundtrack. Catchy, memorable and very emotional.
∎ Beautiful rich story. You embark on an adventure to help lost spirits of your friends pass on to the afterlife. You learn about their life, how they parted with this world and why they still keep clinging onto it. I don't think any other game has done it better. As you progress in the story, you learn more about the main character and her purpose as well. 
∎ The game is an artistic masterpiece in terms of 2D animation. Characters feel so natural and each island you travel to has its' own unique atmosphere and likeable characters. 
∎ Gameplay can be addictive (gamers who are used to farming and grinding will enjoy it a lot). Housing management lets you stack up the houses or place them horizontally. There are lots of possibilities to choose from, and the more spirits you meet, the bigger your boat becomes!
∎ Lots of side quests, so you will always find something to do.
∎ The game can be completed within 50 hours, and that's upon going for all the achievements. It's totally worth the full price for the story you get. If you can get it on sale, even better!

- CONS
∎ If you stop paying attention to what the spirits share with you, or you're bad at reading between the lines, the game can become a bit confusing at times. 
∎ Gameplay does get very repetitive after a while as it forces you to farm for the materials in order to upgrade spirits' houses/shops to tick off quest objectives they give you. If you're not into grinding and you tend to get bored easily, skip this game.",1685915560,1685915560,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In terms of story, without ruining your own experience and revealing too much, you're basically looking for spirits and helping them cross over. But there's more to it than you initially think.

You're also managing your boat and upgrading it, building rooms and decorating them for your spirits, exploring islands, tending to your garden, fishing, collecting items, trading, completing challenges, going for errands, etc. There are busy periods in the game, but they've also created the space for you to just enjoy the beautiful artwork, the animation and the music whenever you needed to. I've also tried to delay sending some spirits to the Everdoor coz I just couldn't deal LOL! That's how emotionally invested I was with some of them.

I think if you're someone who wants to get through a game quickly and looking for an adrenaline rush, this isn't for you. I can't tell you how many times I would just go fishing or watch the stars or listen to the musical masterpieces created for the game or cook dishes - all sorts of things instead of having Stella sleep through the night. I also made sure to hug the spirits on my boat tons of times, check how they're feeling and feed them every chance I got. 

There are moments that got repetitive or I got a bit tired of running errands or didn't want to help a spirit coz they weren't particularly interesting or nice. But the beauty of this game + the intention and story behind its creation trump everything else. 

I played Spiritfarer back in 2021 and until now, I haven't found a game that can compete with it. It remains to be my favourite game and I even bought a shirt with Stella and Daffodil on it! Of course, secretly waiting for someone to recognise them so we can talk endlessly about the game :D",1685846801,1685846801,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Well, if you are still looking for one, look no further than Spiritfarer. 

A beautiful and relaxing game with equally beautiful and relaxing art and music, this game makes the hours fly by in the blink of an eye. While you are not rushing around anywhere, you are definitely not being idle the entire time either. Being the Spiritfarer, you are always sailing the seas, docking only when you need to visit an island or to overcome some challenges. You are also never alone as there will be passengers onboard your ship - all of whom you are responsible for caring. You could grow crops and trees on your ship, raise animals, cook meals, smelt metals and glass, or even cut logs for crafting. 

Your day - and night - is never quiet and boring.

But while all these feel like you'd have a hectic day, no one said you needed to rush through them all at once. You are the Spiritfarer, the captain of your ship, so pace yourself at however you feel comfortable and enjoy the events that unfold around you. 

Just don't forget to keep a box of tissues within your reach as the game is very - and I mean **very** - emotional at times.",1685805315,1685805315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked the exploration of new islands and to find new people. In the beginning I felt I had time to enjoy the beautiful environment and fish or do whatever. 

As I got a bit deeper into the game, I started to have more chores and spent more time than I wanted trying to keep people happy, making sure the ship buildings would work well and getting resources to build more stuff.

There is a good loop there a lot of people like. If you play the game casually for a short time here and there, I think it is a nice way to be entertained.

The animation is pretty good, everything is beautifully drawn.

I’d wish the game had spoken dialogs, not only written text. Usually, the camera stays very far to give you a better overview of everything and one of the opportunities you get to see the art quality and animations closer are the dialogs.

That is, do not play this game if you are prone to being overwhelmed by emotion at the sight of losing someone that you've grown close to. This game is all about saying ""Goodbye"". If you are not good at that, play this game. If you are good at it, play it anyway. The developers have put a LOT of hard work into making a charming and sweet game full of little stories that all work together to paint a larger picture that culminates in a satisfying, bittersweet ending. 

I read somewhere that the development team used important people in their own lives as inspiration for each of the characters that you help, though I haven't seen this confirmed or denied anywhere. Even still, each individual has their own story that tells you about who they were in life which aids you as you work to help them move on. 

Speaking of, helping as spirit move on is part of the main progression of the game, and you will not be able to beat it without doing this, but it is also the hardest part of playing. Knowing that you will never interact with that character again, but still remembering all the lessons they taught you about being strong, being empathetic, listening, understanding, and withholding judgement. I have a friend who, to this day, refuses to bring anymore spirits to the gate because she doesn't want to let them go. Maybe that will be you; maybe you'll bring your first spirit to the gate, have a heartwarming exchange, see them move on and only think about it fondly, you might even cry a bit. But in the back of your mind you'll know that you will never get to talk to them again, you'll miss their unique personality, you'll walk past their house every day wishing you could have one more moment. You might be overcome with regret and put the game down. 

Eventually it will pop back up in your mind and you'll remember that you never finished it. Maybe you'll push through and make it to the end of the story, maybe you won't. What matters is what you make of the time you have with each character. Above all though, my favorite thing about this game how well the lessons you learn can be applied to real life and real relationships.

The initial several hours was actually fun, with lots of exploring, figuring new mechanics out, and unlocking more spirits to take onboard. However in the latter half of my playthrough, the gameplay loop got tedious, slow and incredibly frustrating when you get stuck. You will likely spend hours just lost as to where to go next, and coming up against walls where you know what you need to do, but stuck in a catch 22 situation where one goal requires another goal to be completed, which cannot be completed because you need to complete the first goal. You only get into those situations because you may have missed something hidden somewhere, and you need to go online to look up guides. At the end, I couldn't wait to finish the game so i can uninstall, and never touch it again. 

One of the big aspects that this game is meant to excel at is the story, but after the first few characters I just stopped caring. There were a couple other ones later on that took my interest, but most character backstories weren't super interesting. One of the issues about this was that the dialogue went on and on, and I ended up just spamming X and skim reading the dialogue, a lot of which seem to just be filler dialogue that doesn't really go into their story. 

In terms of gameplay, it was average. It's just a basic platformer, and you unlock special abilities that let you reach hard to reach places. It gets super messy though when you're navigating your boat, it can be very clunky. 

I honestly wouldn't recommend to any of my friends, for a story-based game, I'd rather recommend To The Moon.

But this game *way* over stays its welcome. At 30% completion I was already starting to feel the grind. There's a lot of busywork, carting back and forth between the islands running meaningless and disconnected errands. Normally I don't mind that sort of thing, but everything in the game is so darn slow it gets pretty tedious after a while. Every action you take on the boat has these delightful animations, but after the twentieth time shearing your sheep you might wish for a way to fast forward and get it over with. In order to view the map and plot a course you have to go into the cabin, but you're not allowed to even view your map at night. Even the fast travel is a headache. You have to plot a course to the closest ""bus"" stop, hop off your boat to talk to the guy, watch a prolonged animation, hop back on your boat, and run back to the cabin to select your destination. Hopefully night doesn't come around during this process, otherwise you'll have to watch another animation while you go to sleep until dawn or putter around on the boat until you can start moving again.

A lot of the writing in the game actually comes off as surprisingly cynical. Most of the characters are whiny and entitled, acting like they're doing you a favor by being on your boat. None of the people show much in the way of character growth, acting out the same harmful patterns even in the afterlife. They might show the slightest glimpse of reflection as you paddle them to the spirit door, and that's about it. I gather there's some message about unconditional love and acceptance, but it gets a little tiresome after a while trying to serve a bunch of ungrateful people. It starts to make Stella seem a little ignorant and vacuous, hugging and accommodating people who are actively antagonizing her and others on the boat. I was generally pretty happy to offload them when they were ready to go.

Other gripes:

* The farming and resource management piece doesn't have much depth and doesn't leave much room for creativity. It mostly just clutters up your boat, making it hard to navigate during challenges and often a pain to find the room or person you're looking for. It makes me wonder if it wouldn't have been a better game by leaving out that piece entirely.
* Accessibility: I'm a relatively well abled person, but I found the text hard to read even on a large TV screen.
* 2 player: I tried playing it with my son, and the 2 player experience was mostly just frustrating. The way the game zooms out when players move away from each other, the way the screen goes dark when one player is in a room, and the way you can't even see yourself when you get too far apart. It's even harder to read text on the screen, and can be really hard to even figure out where your character is at.",1685304398,1685304398,False,8,0,0.559388577938079834,0,True,False,False

The character writing is fantastic and could only come from people experienced with death. For some people, I imagine this game's subject matter will greatly enrich their perspective and help them emotionally access this topic in a way movies or books can't. You'll be encountering a range of perspectives on loss and death presented in a completely unpretentious way. After personally talking to a few people who were dying, I can say these characters are written in a mature way that rings true to me.
The characters might lash out at you in fear, or ask you to participate in their self deception, for example. The game trusts that you have the emotional maturity to navigate that uncomfortable dynamic.Dying people don't necessarily contain wisdom in their final moments, but if you keep an open mind you might still learn from them.
Mechanically, Spiritfarer is NOT interesting enough to entertain for it's duration. Don't go in expecting a platformer or interesting logistics or something like that. The busywork you're tasked with is probably best thought of as calm periods where you're reflecting on the big emotional moments in the game. If you're not someone patient enough to ""tolerate"" that busywork, I recommend you don't play this game.
I imagine most people will get the most enjoyment out of the first 20 hours, and their interest will drop off as their attention to the mechanics starts to wane.

  And after 47 hours of gameplay and passing all the available quests, not just the main story, I can say that the gameplay is not the strongest side of this project, as it is monotonous and aimed not so much at the exciting problem solving, but more on the atmosphere and the relationships between the characters. But even despite the different characters, which are revealed through their extensive monologues, the essence comes down to the execution of their quests and extraction of the necessary resources. Perhaps I am not the target audience of this project, but after spending a few days in the game, I can say that the game can get boring, even in terms of passing the main story. At some point I want to finish the game as soon as possible and not go back to fulfill the whims of the spirits and the resumption of resources through a huge number of mini-games, simply because there is no exciting alternative game in this project, unfortunately.   Despite the minuses of gameplay, I want to say THANK YOU to the visual artists and designers of this project for the work done and detailed world.

I love the art and the animation, it's really gorgeous. Daffodil's animations are worth gold. Love the one where he inflates.

I guess I didn't really feel much for these characters on both my first (approximately four months after Spiritfarer was released) and current play? I do find them interesting and I like helping them out, but I wasn't the one to cry when a spirit had to depart.

I was super charmed from the get-go by the animation and the music. The premise was good and I liked the gameplay loop that was being presented. The main tonal theme of ""moving on"" I found especially engaging.

As a game experience, it really falls flat after 3-4 hours. There is so much dialogue and it's honestly not very high quality. Often a cutscene will start and characters will talk to each other about something that has nothing to do with the world or the story, but just to very obviously flesh out their character, which is fine except that for many of the spirits on the boat these single cutscenes are the ONLY times they have character moments until the end of their story. The spirits never interact or have conflict with each other, which I think is a result of the non-linear style of the game resulting in different players having different spirits on board at the same time in the story. As a result - the ship actually begins to feel quite empty. Accidental dialogue lines repeat infinitely. Dialogue for receiving a meal, a hug, a gift, is identical per spirit every time. The happiness stat doesn't actually make them happy. Spiritfarer desperately needed more time spent on writing for these characters, and a stronger creative editor to cut down on the huge number of unnecessary conversations.

As a technical achievement, I don't think the game was tested quite enough, which is kind of surprising for a game that has been re-released as a ""GOTY Edition"" kind of deal - you really expect major bugs and design oversights to have been fixed with a re-released title. I found two different softlocks in my first 4 hours of play, the most glaring being jumping off the front of the ship into the water when we hit an iceberg and came to a stop. The iceberg indicator had an arrow pointing off to the right of the screen so I'd thought that there would be a minigame there like many of the other events that function similarly. My character fell in the water behind the iceberg and was completely stuck, not able to move or even open the pause menu. I understand a screen for reporting bugs in a massive 3D world like Subnautica. Here - just put an invisible wall if the player isn't meant to jump there.

I would have agreed with the majority (overwhelmingly positive) reviews of this game had it ended after 10-15 hours, because, to be honest, when on a sale (~10 euros) it would definitely have been enough value for your money.

But, since I am writing this, the game isn't over after 15 hours, and the full price is ~30 euros. This game becomes painfully boring after repetitive dialogues with NPC's, tasks such as watering your plants, cutting trees, cooking food.

Overview:
Spiritfarer is a beautiful and serene game about accepting death by empathising with the characters going through and really humanising a lot of the characters especially the more antagonistic characters. There are many times where I cried at there stories. It does this in a very bright and cosy management game where you build for your spirits as well as feed them in a very relaxing way. The game however kinda petties out in the end in terms of game play as the loop starts shrinking with less and less demands and the repetitious of the loop starts to hurt the flow of the game.

Where do I begin..
+ it is a chill game for when you're just tired after a day's work and just want to lay back on your chair, get on your controller and play something relaxing
+ nice art style, although not really my taste
+ interesting space management mechanic

But here comes the boring part...
- The characters are all boring. The main character does not speak, not even a chat bubble.
- The spirits are boring, not one of them are engaging nor are their storylines interesting. I know a lot of people bond with the spirits and really connect with them. Not me though, they feel very bland, their backstory boring, and them being in animal form also does not help. I don't understand whats so sad about saying farewell to them as they just feel like dispensable npc living on my ship.
- music is so so
- the building and crafting and upgrading and resource collecting mechanic are too simple and thus boring
- the world is not interesting",1684164787,1684164787,False,3,0,0.473180830478668213,0,True,False,False

Unlike other reviewers, I found its narrative to be too uneven and lacking in interactivity to be deeply moving. The visuals and the music are fantastic, but while the gameplay features many thoughtful touches, there was also a little too much friction and incoherence for it to completely gel for me.

Silent protagonist Stella begins the game dumped rather unceremoniously in Charon’s shoes as a guide of souls to the afterlife. It seems you’re already in a kind of purgatory, and the recently-departed must attend to their unfinished business before passing through the “Everdoor” to what lies beyond. So you set about pottering about the game world on your boat, amassing resources to please these pushy spirits, platforming around the 2D levels which form Spiritfarer’s islands, gathering the usual planks, ores and foods, and reading the spirits’ rather inconsistent dialogue. Spiritfarer describes itself as “cosy,” which I think refers to its whimsical atmosphere and the absence of a fail state. Resources are only expended upon progressing the storyline, not consumed in your voyaging. This renders the management side of the game a little grindy, though it is relaxing, if you’re in the mood for that.

While Spiritfarer grants you some freedom to explore new areas and search off the beaten track for hidden chests, the main thrust of the campaign is surprisingly linear. Regions of the world are gated behind ship upgrades which in turn require you to complete storylines, while abilities necessary to advance are likewise locked behind recruiting a small number of available spirits. Soft-locking progression seems a surprising direction to take in a game that would seem so well-suited to freeform problem-solving. The campaign gives you an abundance of recipes to cook, ingots to smelt and sauerkraut to pickle, but little of it impacts substantially on the core gameplay, and new resources tend to be used a couple of times at a particular stage of the campaign, then forgotten.

All of this platforming and resource-management is in service to the requests of the game’s spirits, with a couple of imaginative ones but mostly along the lines of “bring me this resource” and “travel to this location.” Progression allows Stella to learn more of their stories before finally bidding farewell at the Everdoor. Spiritfarer’s tone is a distinctly indie muddle of solemn, snarky and meandering; the game’s avoidance of anything scary or excessively dark feels a little at odds with the theme of death. 

The cast is well-written, with a diverse selection of characters, though rarely straying too far from one-note sweet old ladies, incorrigible rogues, kindly uncles and the like. Questlines can occasionally be opaque, or even bugged. I had difficulty triggering dialogue for Gwen and Alice, though got there with perseverance and the wiki, and was crushed to have Atul’s final quest misfire completely, due to a previous character’s departure. The writing isn’t great at responding to player actions; nor do spirits interact with one another, and too often attempts to enquire about backstories are met with another request for food or a minor gift. Interactions overall can feel creaking and flat compared with masters of dynamic, reactive ensemble dramas like Hades and even the classic Baldur’s Gate. Beyond the core cast there’s a sprawling mass of anonymous and identical spirits with lots of whimsical dialogue, some of which I found overlong and, frankly, tiresome. Stella herself is depicted as a child, which given some the relationships that are hinted at by older characters, seems strange. Her story becomes more clear as the game wears on, but she remains an anonymous cipher for too long. Individual dialogues and story beats certainly still deliver an emotional payload, but both the world and the characters’ place within it felt to me rather indistinct. Characterising Stella, making the script more responsive to player actions and the game state, or adding more meaningful dialogue options, might all have helped Spiritfarer feel less weightless.

The visuals, however, are stunning, a gorgeous example of the indie tradition of reinventing classic cel animation for gaming. Capturing something of the golden age of American animation, Spiritfarer’s visuals could easily go toe-to-toe with the likes of The Banner Saga and Klei, which have turned out wonderful reimaginations of classic 2D art styles for contemporary gaming. The sound, and especially the music, are also fantastic. Lush strings, mellow piano-plinks and jazzy brass all give each area of the world a distinct feel. This is definitely a soundtrack I’ll enjoy returning to outside the game. Developer Thunder Lotus’s musicians and visual artists deserve major props for producing such a charismatic and well-realised vision of the afterlife-as-half-remembered-childhood-animation.

Overall, Spiritfarer offers an unusual blend of management-sim, 2D platformer and interactive fiction that didn’t quite come together for me, wrapped up in a sumptuous audio-visual feast, and with a generous single-player campaign. Despite the nitpicking, Spiritfarer is well worth your time, and evidently the work of a talented and passionate team. Its ambition perhaps exceeds the final level of polish and artistic coherence. If you’re after well-executed interactive fiction with a melancholy vibe, I recently loved both the more modest Mutazione and Eliza, while Cultist Simulator offers an incredibly deep – and strange – masterclass in writing and world-building for video games. For a stellar single-player adventures with fantastic ensemble casts, don’t miss hack-and-slash roguelike Hades, or the Spiritfarer-adjacent Potionomics, which pairs a much deeper and more satisfying management challenge with a vibrant aesthetic and similarly sublime art.",1684152160,1684152160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will come to fall in love with the spirits you carry on your boat, and you will not want to watch them leave. But the process of them leaving is so beautiful you will do so anyway. The lives they lived and the memories they recant will live on through you, the player. The flowers that they represent, individual to each spirit, are carried on their final bed.

Without giving away too much, you really get to know some of these characters and start to feel for them - especially as you learn why some of them are on your boat, how they got there, and why they have the requests they do. 
It's a great blend of adventure, cozy, rpg, and open world gaming. A bit of resource management thrown in there, too.
Sometimes it feels a bit grindy to get all of the resources you need for certain upgrades, or to remember to socialize in all three ways with each person on your boat, but I suppose that's part of the challenge.
Overall, I'd definitely recommend the game, but please be warned that there are sensitive topics that are covered in this game (suicide, abuse, terminal illness, etc.). Just keep that in mind and maybe just do a little bit of further research if you're worried anything may be triggering.

I know it's uncool to trama-dump online, so I won't be too specific, but my brother (who I share a house with) has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer...

Back to the review: This game fit a lot of little niches I like in smaller games. Resource/time management, base building, exploration, and a subtle story that requires some brains/paying attention to fully grasp exactly what's going on. The best part of these elements is the gameplay loop is as YOU make it! Getting bored listening to NPCs blab at you? Go explore! Not sure where to go? Go back to NPCs to tie up loose ends. You are never forced to do anything until you want to. Which is good because this also happens to be one of those management games where you don't have enough time in the day to do everything, and that would normally drive me nuts!!!

Best part of this game: This game deals with sensitive themes, yet (thankfully) isn't heavy-handed with it. Also, most games that deal with death have an annoying tendency of having one dimensional characters where they focus on nothing but positivity. Here characters flaws are put on center stage, making them much more relatable. Not once did an interaction feel forced, and eye-roll worthy. It's a truly rewarding experience that will have you coming away from it with an appreciation for even the smallest things.

Worst part of this game: There are a lot of mechanics to learn, even into the late game. The way they are tutorialized makes sense at first, but can easily become one of those situations where, because you didn't do things in a certain order, you now have to teach yourself a newly introduced mechanic. What the game doesn't tell you is if you're having a hard time grasping what a certain thing does, there are full explanations in the options menu.

If the games' tags don't interest you, then skip this one. Otherwise, this game is worth every penny! Especially if you are dealing with hard times, or just miss someone really badly...",1683715460,1683715460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spiritfarer is a game about letting go of those who are truly close to you,and caring for those in death. You play as Stella, a silent-ish protagonist who takes the role of the spiritfarer, one who assists those who have died by fulfilling wishes and making sure those who have died and have not moved on completely to the afterlife.
Now for why i am so scared.
Stella's story when it comes to lily absolutely killed my heart. From beginning to end she was always incredibly outgoing and passionate to help those in need. In the beginning lily always said that she outshone and outpaced her,and all of that. 
She was great with socializing,and all of that. Eventually moving to japan for a while, and writing a heartfelt letter back to her family. But during the trip,the family never told her about the sickness of her father. When she had came home, lily described her as ""not even recognizing her own father anymore"" and all of that. But she stayed with him until the end. This also lead to her nursing job,caring for those in their last few moments,hours,days,weeks,or months even. Meeting jackie,  who she enjoyed around but also daria,who she dearly enjoyed, having even snuck art supplies in for her,
She works there for a good while,and stuff. 
Then the main thing that happened. 
Stella is diagnosed with a unknown disease that leads her to becomin g frail,getting off work for a few months with bad news, calling lily, with her claiming that she was schizo rambling about the trees and the air. Lily had to call the center for her work, as to why she took work time off. Two-ish weeks after finding out, she calls lily. with a shaky, heavy voice going on about the trees and the air continuously. Talking about how it felt like death over there with lily saying she didnt know where ""over there"" was. with a silence, eventually broken with the statement of her coming home in ""a few days"". With how lily struggled with her father's death via alcoholism and all of that,she was scared a good bit by this too. 
Leading to more. the scene before stella's final voyage. With both her mother [i think rose,i really hope atleast some dev sees this] and lily by her side,with her laying in the hospital bed and lily talking about how much she loves her and that theres no need for loneliness anymore, or even that she never was alone. Something about it just kills my heart.  the realization that the family left is grasping for whatever hope they have and all of that, or just saying their final goodbyes. Ive never lost someone close to me,but this game really has me thinking alot about it. i guess i lose a lot of friends and i see that some people as of recent have been losing a lot of people close to them. It has me wondering as to who i will have by my bed, if i ever succumbed to an illness. it has me wondering if ill even have someone by that bed. and i fear the feeling of dread it gives me.
And thats why this game is so efficient. it is a game about learning how to say goodbye, even if your not ready to say goodbye. Stella being taken early despite being mid-30s, especially by illness and with some of her closest friends, and her having faced down the hell that was hades [a dark part of stella's subconcious,iirc] and all of that, she had to eventually come to terms with her own fate. that she was not going to recover,but she was going to have to follow charon into the everdoor. what could have been hundreds of nights bringing comfort and safety to lost souls who could have been stuck in the afterlife/spirit world were maybe hours for her in real life. Maybe it was a dream or something,maybe it actually happened.

I love all of it. and i cant properly put all of it into words right now because of the fear of something i dont know how to describe right now. its beautiful.",1683699997,1683699997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played the little cat (who's animations, especially the glide) are absolutely adorable and well-thought out. While the second player can't do everything the main player can do (only one person interacts with the actual progress and story) you can help fully with all the exploring, tasks, mini platform games and puzzles. I actually really prefer that you both drive the story together and it forces you to interact and progress together. I should mention as well, this game is not hard mechanically- but it never feels boring or lacks a challenge in terms of what you need to prioritise or the content it introduces as you progress. Anyone could pick up this game and enjoy the play through - and I think that's fantastic game design. 

The game itself is beautifully made. Everything fits perfectly together, the music, character stories, overall execution of themes is done so well. I read reviews before purchasing talking about making peace with the grief they've experienced in their life, and as someone who lost their Mum at 25 it shows such a peaceful side to death, especially learning that the characters you meet and get to know eventually make their peace with it themselves. The entire game is very moving and emotional, I would be very surprised if it doesn't move you in some shape or form. 

I can't think of a single game that does with Spiritfarer does. My biggest sadness is that this game will eventually end as it's set such a high standard for future games that I play. I couldn't recommend this more, whether you play through alone or grab a friend or loved one to play it through with. I don't know who wouldn't appreciate the little details included in this game (was so excited to see some of the characters mention other games or DnD references for example!)

I went in with no heads up or any type of expectations because i heard of the game that it was a fun and easy game.

I am the type of person that always jumps from game to game and console to console, so i never really invested a lot in a game, i used to back in the younger days. Now that i'm a working part of the cog in the world, you really just don't have much time at all to invest yourself in a game.

But, lo and behold, if you have a steam deck, this one is perfect, if you don't, i would advise to buy it on other handheld console such as the Nintendo Switch, it is such a fun jump in jump out game and with a simple idea in mind, you, are a spirifarer. 

The way they build the world around you is so beautiful, it could be a bit grindy in earlier stages if you are not into that. But, if you hold on long enough you would realize such a beautiful world and characters that has been engraved into this game.

Like i said, i did not have any expectation going into this game, but for an old game, it is a very relaxing and easy game to digest in this busy world.

Actual review: This game is good. Like really good, surpassed my expectations. I normally don't like side scrollers or games where you manage towns, but this was on sale... Great decision. It is incredibly well made, and fulfilling quests and building little houses for everyone is so fun. I genuinely like the characters and how their casual dialogue builds their story and personality. 

This game is great for playing when you want to play something more calm or casual. The story is heartwarming and bittersweet. I can tell the Game was made with a lot of heart and empathy.

 The game saves quite frequently so if you have to stop at anytime, you can keep all of your progress if you have to suddenly leave. My one tiny issue is that sometimes faster animations freeze a little (but I have an older Mac so that's probably why), and sometimes jumping up on to platforms doesn't work unless you are jumping directly in the middle of it.

* Superb ambiance, helped by the beautifully hand-drawn scenarios and animated characters. It feel like you’re playing an animated movie.

* A story that respects its audience. It is mature enough for aged players to read between the lines, but tactfully presented for younger ones as well.

* A wide variety of characters, each unique and with their own stories to share.

* Great soundtrack with a good variety of musical styles by Max LL.

* Simple, uncomplicated controls.
[/td]
[td]
* Early game is very slow. There is A LOT of waiting and it’s not until much, much further into the story you gain the ability to overcome certain limitations.

* It can get very grindy, very quickly at certain points in the game.

[h1]💭 First Impressions:[/h1]
Spiritfarer is a game that at first glance can be mistakenly compared to Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games, but in 2D. These similarities are merely superficial at best.

Something that has to be said before anything else: [i]this game oozes charm[/i]. The graphics are beautiful, every character has very fluid animations that are a joy to watch, for instance: Stella’s unamused face never fails to, ironically enough, amuse me. And when you combine everything with the alluring soundtrack, it makes for a soothing gameplay experience that doesn’t tire the player.

There is no combat or any sort of battle mechanics in this game. Spiritfarer is advertised as a relaxing experience and it is one through and through, aided by the fact there’s hardly any need to rush, and no way to get a “game over''.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807423312

[h1]🎮 Controls:[/h1]
There are no complex commands or inputs in this game, everything is kept simple and the controls are very responsive, which helps in the platforming sections you have to do.

It might be also worth noting you can easily play this game (literally) with one hand using the keyboard.

The cat, Daffodil, that tags along with Stella can be controlled by a second player. Co-op is normally only local/splitscreen, but there is the Steam Remote Play option too.

[h1]🧭 Traveling and learning:[/h1]
One of the earliest things you’ll learn is how to sail across the immense sea presented before you. While your ship is en route to its destination you are free to do whatever you want: work on the resources on your ship, tend to the necessities of the ones on it, or nothing at all.

At night you won’t be able to sail or interact with the ones residing in it, you can keep working, or you can go to sleep until the next morning to quickly resume your journey.

During your travels you’ll also find new abilities for Stella. All of them will unlock more possibilities and maybe even allow you to visit areas you couldn’t previously reach in a way not unlike Metroidvanias.

[h1]🎒 Gathering…[/h1]
As mentioned previously, it’s easy to think this game is a 2D Farming Sim. While it does give you the option to grow your plants and vegetables and tend to animals, those are not your main options to earn glims (your currency) in your ship.

Speaking of which, your ship is essentially a floating town where you can build houses and other types of workshops to refine raw resources you’ll gather in the wild.

You can get resources by traveling across the seemingly endless sea and finding desert or populated islands or through mini-events unique to each “tenant” residing in your ship-town.

Logging, mining, fishing… All of those actions require more than just pressing and holding a button and even when it does it demands some attention to when you must release the action button or to the rhythm you must follow. Every action taken to get something feels meaningful, but it isn’t enough of a chore that will leave you mentally tired if you have to gather a lot of one or two specific resources.

The best thing? There’s no pesky stamina limitation here, you are free to get everything to your heart’s content.

[h1]💎 ... and Refining:[/h1]
Most items, collected or bought, have to be refined in one of the many structures you must build. 

For some buildings the process is automatic, requiring you only to tune a machine and wait for it, but for many others it demands your personal attention. All these activities, again, are unique ranging from mindless button mashing to carefully timed actions and for tougher, higher graded materials said activities will be more difficult.

Mercifully, the penalty for messing up certain refining activities isn’t losing the resource entirely, but just getting less of the refined item.

Again, you can work as much as you want, restricted only by your resources (and patience), or lack thereof.

[h1]💮 Keeping the spirits up:[/h1]
You’ll meet many spirits that need your help and guidance with their troubles. Some of these spirits are more friendly than the others. Some are open and receptive, while others are more closed off and untrusting.

When these spirits accept your invitation, or invite themselves in, they all have their unique looks, living preferences, food tastes and how well they get along with other spirits all affect their mood.

The spirits’ mood is very important-- you were tasked with making their afterlife as comforting as possible after all. Thankfully you have access to their information, to what is causing their mood to change, for better or for worse, and while some are obvious, others might need you to be more attentive to them.

Food is another vital element in order to keep their moods in high-spirits (pun fully intended), and while some of the spirits have a healthy appetite, others are very finicky and picky about what they’ll accept and remembering their preferences is very important.

The more you do for the spirits, the more of their tales you’ll hear and know. And all of them, without exceptions, are more than meets the eye.

[h1]🌟 The spirits' mini-events:[/h1]
Each spirit aboard will teach Stella something and most of them will unlock some type of mini-event for you to help gather glims and/or a resource unique to said mini-event.

Many of these mini-events consist of you running and gathering things before they vanish but all of them have their unique flair, just like the spirits that teach you how to deal with them. The layout of your ship might influence (a lot) how well you’ll do in them and so will the abilities Stella can learn during her journey.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2805834510

[h1]📉 Some low points:[/h1]
There are a few things to note about the gameplay.

The biggest one is having all the waiting you’ll have to do, especially at early game where you won’t have a whole lot to do and especially with how slow your ship will sail. This can be exacerbated if you need to travel back and forth to gather different resources for an upgrade, to meet someone, or even to progress in the story.

Sometimes the game also gets pretty grindy, demanding you to get a lot of rare/difficult to find items in order to keep progressing.

Being forced to go back to the Shipyard, and there only one in the whole map, to upgrade your ship, even with the fast travel, can be a pretty big inconvenience since the materials you need to get for upgrades can be VERY far from it.

[h1]💬 Conclusion:[/h1]
I’ve refrained from mentioning the story since it's so easily spoiled and I feel it's best left as something for people to experience for themselves.

As for the game: it has a good variety in its gameplay, fluid animations, great music, a cast of memorable characters-- everything was all carefully tailored to be a game that deservedly earned its praise and merits.",1683338587,1683338723,True,3,0,0.536784708499908447,0,True,False,False

So instead let’s just address the elephant in room I think, the content. Yeah, I admit, there definitely are some heavy topics in the game, but I don’t know, it actually didn’t feel that way for me, even though I’m normally a cringe-worthy overemotional person. No, instead, the game deals with all those issues in a very subtle way, all those stories are kind of cryptic and need to be deciphered, and you often just get a glimpse of the truth when you bring them to the Everdoor. It’s all a kind of great puzzle that slowly unravels over time. Add to this the light-hearted storytelling, the funny music, the weird characters and the engaging gameplay. So for me it wasn’t depressing at all (some characters aren’t even too sympathetic), instead it was a kind of philosophic journey sometimes, about what you leave behind, about life, feeling incomplete, about your goals or purpose, about joy, about friendship and family. You get the drift. Alright, I have to admit, in between it can get a bit melancholic, but in a good way in my opinion, and always with an optimistic undertone. Even the end was a great kind of emotional wrap-up for me (and yeah, I also didn’t actually like sending the passengers on their way, but it still felt inevitable, necessary and somehow at peace).

Enough said, outstanding game, with awesome value and a long playing time (I actually even spent over 80 hours in-game, but I really checked out everything, even replayed some bits).

Malignant bugs: direction keys and skip keys fail, UI disappears, animation disappears, and the screen remains stationary.
After building the building, exit the building page and simply get stuck. Pressing any key is useless, you can only exit and re-enter the game.
The kitchen displays that the dishes have been prepared, and the collected animations show that the dishes are invisible. The animation ends in the old state.
After hitting the iron plate, there is no water or iron plate. Unless you press the blank to exit and give up the finished iron plate, it will continue to be consumed.
And then there's the cat. It doesn't matter where it gets stuck on a regular basis, but when chopping a tree, waving and waving for a while, the cat doesn't know where it gets stuck, which makes it really stupid to not be able to cut the tree. If the production team can't follow the system well, don't do this kind of action. It's necessary to use the settings of two characters, and if there are bugs, it's really frustrating
·Other parts that are not bugs but I find very disgusting:
Jumping edge detection is very confusing, especially when jumping from the water to the railing on the ship.
When descending the stairs, jumping down is not a quick descent, but a jump on the stairs. But the later buildings are full of stairs, and pulsar mining... I can understand how disgusting it is.
The animation of fishing for harvesting and watering vegetables can either be shaken forward or backward, or the animation is too long. Fishing can at least interrupt the animation. After harvesting the vegetables, the vegetable plot animation with nothing can only be watered for several seconds, and the watering animation cannot be interrupted. If the vegetable plot is wrongly watered, it can only wait for the long animation to finish.
The different order in which recipes and walrus dishes are collected is quite outrageous. I can understand that dishes that have not been cooked are not unlocked in the collection, but how can I make up for the missing items due to the different order?
Half way through some tasks, they say who to talk to and don't mention where they are, but rely on their own memory to find the past.
Regarding the content of the game: about lions and cats... I don't have a spoiler. After watching them, I just want to say let go of the helping plot and mock the fate of others.

I need you to understand: it was fully worth the $30 price tag. it is now 6 dollars. if this isnt in your steam library yet, and you have the $6 to spare, you should get it. thats what, two and a half cans of monster energy? at full price, you could buy this game for yourself and gift a copy to a friend, and it would still be cheaper (and infinitely better, IMO) than the hot slag being pushed out by corporations like EA.

If you can play this game straight faced, without feeling things, I genuinely think you should consider therapy.

I would have many more than 6 hours on record but after a certain point i needed to take time to collect myself. Its like the characters were written by people with life experiences, people that struggled through the emotions and concepts that are featured in the game, like fear and death. To me, it felt like someone was developing the game as a way to process their own emotions. It comes across as unbelievably genuine. 

My one and only complaint is that this game made me confront the concept of death after my father passed away, but before I had fully sat down and processed it. It made me think about the things I wish I could go back and say. It made me realize that maybe i should have these conversations with the family I have left, before the chance slips away again.

The writing is clever and the visuals are gorgeous, and from what I saw in a lot of positive reviews it's a good healing experience for dealing with loss. But each time I played, I found myself stopped after a few hours because gathering resources is tedious and frustrating.

The entire process feels like it's just wasting time: the basic tasks have repetitive animations that repeat each time, the more complex ones require very precise timing or else you get fewer resources and thus have to repeat tasks [i]more[/i], and some of them have outright fail conditions and your punishment is sitting there and waiting for your character to recover.

If this were the pacing for the whole game, it would make sense, but the developers also decided to break things up with platforming. You [i]have[/i] to do some very precise jumps and maneuvers for resource gathering [i]and[/i] plot reasons, or else the game will not move forward. This wouldn't be so bad if platforming didn't feel so slippery and the character consistently followed input directions. It feels like they couldn't decide what they wanted, so they mashed the two genres together and it just doesn't work.

Even if it didn't have those issues, I don't recommend this game because of an announcement they made in February (this was after I had initially purchased it, otherwise I wouldn't have even tried to play). The devs decided to raise the price in several places to address people buying outside their region to get the game as cheap as possible. I don't know if there's an ideal solution but raising the price by over 400% in Turkey and Argentina—especially taking into account that they bring up the earthquake in Turkey in the [i]same post this price-raise was announced[/i]—is straight up greedy.

People in other reviews warn you that you will cry. They are correct. You may even ugly-cry, possibly repeatedly. But it will be a good kind, a cathartic kind, an almost startlingly real kind. A kind that most video games can only hope they might ever evoke, if they even deign to try. Even now I mist up a bit in recollection, which is impressive, for a story told about imaginary anthropomorphic spirits of people I've never actually had in my physical life.

I encourage you to visit the game's website and/or check out the artbook, which is something I don't think I've said about any game before. There are layers and threads to the game which quite subtly underlie the game (but deftly, in a way that you don't feel an inexplicable hunch that you're missing them), yet when revealed for what they truly were (as both of the above may do for you in ways the game might not), can be seen in every corner of its grand tapestry. I cannot emphasize enough how much this short, simple, mostly-not-difficult game is a sleeper masterclass in storytelling.

Others have complained about the platformer elements of the game, and these complaints are valid: the combination of camera dynamics, control schema, ability functionality, and level designs can make some parts of the game's platforming frustratingly particular. I'm not sure if this was in some way meant to be metaphorical, however, knowing what I do now about the game's deeper themes. Still, I could've enjoyed the playing of the game more without those issues--but I hope these reservations do not deter a single soul from experiencing this unique gem, because they are naught more than scuff marks.

A certain amount of ""grinding"" may also be necessary for completion, depending on how you go about playing the game. However, you cannot mess up the game beyond repair (this was likely intentional), so at worst, you might have to take more time than would otherwise be necessary, secondary to choices you make--but it is always still salvageable. The game will never blockade you permanently from anything crucial; at the very worst, you might miss out on a few vignettes.

While you can also tarry as long as you'd like, doing this and that (again, also likely an intentional design choice, in retrospect), the ""necessary"" content of the game is also fairly short; my fairly thorough playthrough still clocked under 30 hours. Whether you could or would experience replay value is entirely up to you; some stories, after all, are worth experiencing more than once. You would be hard-pressed to find an unequivocally more artful story, told as a game, than this one.

With that in mind, I believe the value for the cost is certainly there--but even if you feel you should get the game on sale, do not miss out on experiencing it, one way or another. It is rare that I can say this about any game, but I absolutely can about Spiritfarer: I firmly believe it will enrich the lives of many, if not most, who play it.",1682916412,1682916412,True,33,0,0.745327949523925781,0,True,True,False

TLDR: beautiful, fun, keeps your attention. sometimes hard to tell what to do

PROS ~
- Beautiful art (character designs, landscapes, animations, etc etc etc)
- Immersive gameplay
- Addicting (although I do get distracted easily, so maybe on me lol!)
- Story is not linear, so you can choose to ignore it and do your own thing if you want, but the story IS amazing and I would highly recommend playing for that alone.
- Extremely well-fleshed out characters, extensive research and effort has been put into them!
- Really fun for BOTW-style ""see thing on map and go find it, then get distracted and go somewhere else, and end up making a list of things to check out"" moments, kept me entertained % of the time!

CONS ~
- SLIIIIIIIGHTLY repetitive at times, especially between character arcs, but the fishing mechanic and stops along the way such as events really minimize this, I just thought it was worth noting!
- Sometimes hard to tell what you are supposed to be doing, but could be a pro if you like to figure things out
- Will 100% make you cry like a baby after every character's arc is complete (no spoilers!)

It was one hell of an enjoyable experience playing this, it has a bit of everything, platforming, harvesting, resource managing, building, cooking and crafting, all of them actually well done, so many micro systems in one place I thought it cannot work that well, but I was wrong. It knows when to hit the breaks on those systems and does not push them too much, like harvesting, is not to the complexity of something like Stardew Valley; you get seeds, build a garden, plant them and occasionally water them, and that is it. Also a small advice, keep the damn sheep in pens!

Of course I had to guide all the characters to the door, enjoyed all of their story and personality, heck even Bruce and Mickey. I do wish however we got more expanded story into some of the side characters, like Charon and Hades. 

Gameplay, well it revolves around platforming. You navigate to islands, unlock powerups to reach previous inaccessible areas on then, do some back and forward, kind of a metroidvenia style. But platforming is not the focus of the game, is passing through the story and getting involved in the characters, even so, the platforming would put some games that do focus on it to shame, its fluid and precise, also you get plenty powerups to make it so much fun to move around. 

It is accompanied by great audio with some nice OSTs, so what ca I say, it does a great job immersing you in the world. 
It does have some minute flaws however, like why the heck the devs used orange font on orange background in the boat’s navigation map, you have any idea how tricky is to sometimes see the coordinates…
Overall I fully recommend this even at full price which I do not often say.

Kısaca oyunu bu şekilde tanımlayabiliriz. Topladığınız ruhların görevlerini yapmak için çeşitli malzemeler topluyor, geminize istekleri üzerine kendi evini veya başka yapılar yapıyor ve bu şekilde oyunda ilerliyorsunuz. 

[h1] Oynanış [/h1]
Tek bir çizgi üzerinde ilerlememesi güzel olmuş. İstediğiniz göreve istediğiniz önceliği verebiliyorsunuz. Ağaç kesme, maden kazımı gibi özelliklerin yanında eventimsi malzeme toplamaları da var. Tüm bunların yanında özel yetenekler de açabiliyoruz. Bunlar da sonra çeşitli adalarda daha da ilerlememizi sağlıyor. Evet, anlayacağınız kimi zaman ilgili adada işimiz bitse bile spesifik yetenekleri açtıktan sonra geri döneceğimiz anlamına geliyor. Bu durumu çok aşırıya kaçırmadıkları için yerinde buldum. Her adada geçerli olan bir durum değil.

[b]Dış Görünüşü Özelleştirme[/b]
Dış görünüşünüzü kendinize göre ayarlayabiliyorsunuz fakat seçenekler çok da fazla değil. İlerleyen zamanlarda farklı çeşitler de açabiliyor olsanız da başlarda çoğunu kullanabiliyor olsak daha güzel olabilirdi. Bunun yanında açabildiğimiz her kostüm ve bahsi geçen kostümü nasıl açabileceğimize dair birkaç detay bulunsa daha güzel olurdu diye düşünüyorum. 

[h1]Geliştirilebilecek Kısımlar [/h1]
Şimdi de gelelim rahatsız olduğum kısımlara. Yapılacak şeyler çok iyi belirtilmediği için kimi zaman ya internete bakıp çözmeniz gerekiyor ki özellikle yemek yapma gibi mekanikler bu konuda biraz yormuştu beni. Buna ek olarak bazı madenlerin pişmesi gereksiz uzun sürüyordu.

[b]Müzikler[/b]
Genel olarak müzik mantığı beni çok çekemedi. Her bir adanın kendine özel müziği var ve geminize lounge inşa ettikten sonra oradan [strike]istediğiniz[/strike] ziyaret ettiğiniz adaların müziğini seçebiliyorsunuz fakat bu neredeyse hiçbir zaman uğraşmak istediğim bir şey olmamıştı. Bunun yanında tarlanızda gitar çalarak ilgili cropların büyüme hızını arttırabiliyorsunuz. Bundaki problem de sadece bir tane parça çalıyor olması. Oyunu bitirmemin üzerinden haftalar, hatta aylar geçmiş olmasına rağmen hala aklımda. Keşke olmasa.

[b]Yolcuları Takip Etme Zorluğu[/b]
Oyunun ortalarına doğru gemimdeki ruh sayısı bir noktada o kadar artmıştı ki durumlarını takip edemiyordum. Düzgün bakabildiğim tek yer ise Everdoor'du. Her ruhun kendine özel görevleri oluyor ve bunları bitirdiğinizde Everdoor ile uğurluyordunuz kendisini. Geri kalan ruhlar da tekneye inen merdivenin yakınlarında toplanıyordu. Bir tek bu şekilde herkes ile konuşup durumlarını takip ediyordum ki gerçekten de keyif aldığım bir durumdu bu. Buna adanan bir panel veya ruhları daha iyi görmemi sağlayacak bir özellik oyuna eklenebilirdi.

[h1]Sonuç[/h1]
Genel olarak keyif aldığım bir oyundu fakat sonlara doğru sıkmaya başlamıştım. O da en azından bütün ruhları sonrasına uğurlayayım hevesiydi. Oyun, size bütün ruhları göndermeden oyunu bitirme şansı tanıyor ki keşke o şansım olduğu ilk an bitirseydim diyorum şimdiki kendime. Tabii amacınız başarımları tamamlamaksa kolay gelsin. Oyunun koleksiyon kısmına adanmış spesifik bir ada var ve belli ki bayağı bir uğraş istiyor. Benim de ilgimi çekiyor fakat ekstra bir 10 saat daha uğraşmak istemiyorum.

7/10

Spiritfarer is a beautifully thought out game with a stunning art style, amazing music, and the gameplay as well as the base concept of the game are extremely solid as well. When Charon retires, for reasons that are never made clear, you act as the new ferryperson to carry the souls of the dead to their... final destination? to be reborn? I'll be perfectly honest, I made it about solidly halfway through this game and maybe more questions are answered as you continue to complete the game, but I grew so frustrated with the writing and the plot that I ended up not continuing. I played it through about halfway again with a friend of mine, so I can confirm the co-op option works well, but this friend ended up having the same frustrations as me and we just never finished. We saw several spirits off to their final destinations, and frequently at the end we would look at each other and go, ""Were we supposed to feel something?"" It was never clear who these people were, what their motivations were, why they were there - there were even misspellings and grammar inconsistencies, which took me in particular out of the game. I think there is a balance that needs to be struck when handling a plot like this (I spoiled myself by looking up a summary and theories as to what the game was about once I determined I probably wasn't finishing the game) and I think the game just unfortunately does not strike that balance between questions and answers.

Music. Animation. Overall Art style etc... They are all great and perfectly fits the mood of the game.

Every single actions is slow. The overall gameplay is repetitive and boring.

First things first, Spiritfarer is absolutely gorgeous. The character designs and environments were a visual treat and the music truly elevated the atmosphere of the game. However, despite all the good things about it, it falls short in two areas that affected my enjoyment of the game.

Firstly, in my 20+ hours of playtime, I have barely scrapped the surface of Stella's story, and from what I am seeing, we only get to see more of it towards the end of the game. Now, I have no issue with the rest of the cast and I recognise that Spiritfarer's approach to storytelling is focused around peeling the layers off their individual stories. However, the characters do not stay long enough for me to get fully emotionally invested in them. On the other hand, Stella is with you throughout the game and it is a missed opportunity not to reward the player with more insight on her as you progress.

Secondly, the game starts becoming a chore 20 hours in. Things start to get repetitive. Run to this island to find an NPC, go to this other island to collect a material. For a group of characters so integral to the themes of the game, it felt more like I was doing side quests for them. The method to advance their stories does not do justice to the messages they wished to convey. [spoiler] For example, Atul sending you on fetch requests asking for various food items and only once you deliver them, you get exposition on what that meant to him. Summer's storyline however, was outstanding - I really loved how her mini game was a representation of her struggles and more characters could have benefited from this approach. [/spoiler] 

Overall, I would give Spiritfarer a neutral review if I could because there were still standout moments that left an impact on me. It is just a bit of a shame that it was not the case throughout.",1680829688,1680829876,False,8,0,0.552641153335571289,0,True,False,False

Gameplay - I played over 26 hours so far and during the whole process I kept thinking ""I LOVE THIS GAME!""

I absolutely loved the first hours, but the bad outweighted the good in the end and it ended up leaving a bad taste. 
This review does contain spoilers so be warned.

Good:
[list]
[*]Graphics and music are gorgeous
[*]First half of the game was sweet
[*]Platforming felt flowy and nice
[/list]
Bad: (explained below, contains spoilers so marked as such)[list]
[*]Frustrating characters in late-game
[*]Chores get repetitive after a while
[/list]

[hr][/hr]
[spoiler][u]Characters in late-game:[/u]
Not sure if it's just the way they were written or a personal bias on my part, but while the first chatacters felt well rounded and seemed to have a closer relationship with Stella, as the game goes on there are some that feel like nothing/generic, up to the point of being frustrating. Stanley and Buck are the only two I found salvable from the latter half of the game. 

Having progression tied to ""releasing"" spirits is nice at first (trying to drive the point that letting go is important) but in the end it just makes it hard to bond with the spirits. This, together with the previous point about the kind of characters you find late game, makes it hard to care at all about them. First departures were sentimental, but after a while any interaction with the characters feels like just another chore. I feel like, other than Buck and Stanley (precious mushroom child), the interacions get more generic as time goes on, save of those that are entirely just rudeness directed at your character (I get that it comes from your backstory but being rude cannot be your whole personality), which I honestly do not care for. 
Additionally, the NPCs/background spirits feel kind of empty. And, finally, there is almost no payoff for any of the tasks; either you —rarely— get a throwayay line that gives you a glimpse into the character or you release them. I understand that the objective of the game is to ""let them go"", but by the end I was unable to feel attachment to the chatacters, just going through their tasks to get them off the boat. Did not get to meet tha bat person because by that time, after Bruce+Mickey, Elena, and Jackie, I had already given up (don't @ me, I do not care). I am sure the bat person is lovely if you are patient enough to get there but by this point I had no more energy.

[u]Chores and travel[/u] 
As a note, I feel that this game should be considered more a collectathon than a management game, regardless of what tags say. I believe this is another factor to my frustration with the game. The missions and chores ended up feeling... well, like a chore. The travel and crafting/resource collection system, while fine at first, ends up just becoming annoying, just a non-stop clicking minigame + fetch quest for no pay-off. I feel like if the upgrade system was different (variation of the minigames/some automation, not just difference in output) it could be better, but it's hard to keep the player's attention when having to just repeat a task over and over again (just spam the button! Fun). The game is gorgeous and the design of the different areas is nice, but towards the end the map feels a bit same-y, and the simple dialogues make you give up (yes, I gave dating advice to a character, but other than that and the tour guide they all feel like nothing. Even after trying to talk to every spirit you run into they just feel, excuse the pun, soul-less) [/spoiler]

In short: this beautiful game immediately caught my attention, as the themes are really interesting and the exploration of grief as the basis for a game sounded really promising.
I appreciate what the game was going for, but I feel like it fell short and ended up being frustrating. I continued playing hoping it would have some of the spark from the first half, but I am afraid that is not going to happen. I was reticent to give it a negative review because I loved the first hours of it, but at this point the tedium has set in and I do not believe I will go back to complete the achievements. Overall I am sorry to give it a 5/10.",1679872488,1679873448,False,16,0,0.669488847255706787,0,True,False,False

Spiritfarer is a religion-neutral story with it's own unique concepts of how the living move on, offering it's own beautiful ritual to say good-bye.

I went in almost entirely blind and have not looked anything up, even as I write this review. I have not finished Spiritfarer, though I believe I have explored most of what it has to offer and do not intend on continuing. I bought it a month ago during the winter sale, played it obsessively for a weekend or two, telling myself it'd get better, but it never did. when I went on the reviews here to check, what few negative reviews I saw echoed (most of) my sentiments and even some of the positive ones stated that the game actually got worse the longer it went on. there were some surprising omissions coming from my pov, though, so I will highlight what I think other reviews are missing while quickly echoing some of their sentiments to keep things balanced.[h1]The Good[/h1]This game has a lot going for it on surface level. It also has some good going for it after that. All of that follows here:[list] [*][b]The game is very pretty.[/b] Nighttime especially looks amazing, as does the Eclipse area. The Everdoor is similarly striking. [*][b]Animations are smooth, as is performance.[/b] I haven't had any frame drops, bugs, anything. Very well-made. [*][b]The music that plays when you're saying goodbye to a passenger is actually very good.[/b] It made my hair stand on end and was a highlight throughout the whole thing.[/list][h1]The Bad[/h1]Minor irritants that drag the experience down quite a bit. Not death blows, but bleeding cuts.[list] [*][b]Shops are near-useless for most things.[/b] They're not good for selling- most of what you'll need to sell can only be sold at the Travelling Salesman. They're not good for buying- most of what you might need from them is scattered around the world in plentiful Crates and chests. You'll also want to save most of your Glims for ship upgrades or facilities since they're the focus of passenger requests and help with traversal, both of which are essential to the core gameplay and storyline. (Worth noting that some ingredients are shop-exclusive. This is never mentioned in-game, and yet remains essential to Atul's main quests. These are the only times going to a shop is worth it.) [*][b]NPC dialogue is mostly repetitive drivel, and very very long. The meta commentary is also not appreciated.[/b] I once remember being somewhere in the Japanese-inspired area in the southwest, talking to an NPC sitting on a cliff. He said something along the lines of ""wow, this mountain looks really good, almost like it was drawn or something"". I'm not certain that's the exact phrasing, but regardless- there are many instances of this throughout the game. These instances are also [i]very drawn out.[/i] That dialogue I just gave to you in a sentence was, if I remember correctly, drawn out for one or two confirmations. Multiple NPCs I've talked to have had me click through five to SEVEN bubbles of speech that say very very little, frequently only being there to portray the character's insecurities or uncertainties. That's all very well and good, but it should not be a frequent occurrence, and especially not amongst [b]optional, non-important characters[/b] whom you probably just engaged with out of a moment's curiosity. [*][b]The music is mostly bland at best and annoying at worst.[/b] I have only heard maybe six tracks in this entire game. Most themes are just variations on the main ship theme, most of which remain identical save for the weather changing small aspects. This is a running trend, and the entire OST seems susceptible to constant repetition. The music is also wholly unremarkable- I can't remember any of it, save for the swelling portion of the Everdoor's theme, and many common themes are very repetitive and irritating. I like the passengers' music but I've heard the flute and theremin and violin so many times that it's just grating.[/list][h1]The Ugly[/h1]This section will be a little angrier, apologies. It's aimed towards large flaws in the gameplay that drastically hurt my experience, and especially ones that I haven't seen in other negative reviews. [b]If you want more elaboration on why I am rating this game poorly, read other negative reviews. I don't want to echo their sentiments 1-to-1, or at all save for briefly, but they're all incredibly true.[/b] Let me just start with a quickfire recap of what I agree with that other reviews have expanded on far more:[olist] [*][b]The game is seemingly underbaked, with great care put into some areas and very little into others.[/b] The collection system show this off well. It's baffling how there's 100+ recipes and nearly 60+ fish, yet every other collection struggles to break 10 pieces. [*][b]The game is bloated. Very bloated.[/b] I was getting tired around six or seven hours in. The aforementioned collection system, while cute in concept, is over with quickly and gives mediocre rewards. Character customization is limited to recolors of your outfit and your cat. The cooking is convoluted for literally no reason. Etc. [*][b]The gameplay is [i]extremely[/i] tedious and stressful.[/b] I am not exaggerating when I say this game has made me more tired in three hours than my college work has in eight. You are constantly bouncing from place to place, watering plants (individually) or shearing sheep (individually, from different pens) or attending to complaining passengers. Minigames for resources must be done every single time you want even one piece of a resource and it leaves you no time to unwind. The Windmill and Foundry minigames should be classified as torture. It makes the gameplay [b]dreadful[/b] and is probably the main reason I cannot like Spiritfarer. [*][b]Character writing is haphazard and bad.[/b] One character's arc, relating to dementia, involved the character being perfectly lucid for 70% of her time onboard before rapidly deteriorating within the span of half a quest and then dying without calling you by name. This is one of the better-paced characters. Multiple others will espouse large parts of their backstory at the end of a fetch quest while saying nothing but canned dialogue for the rest of their time on board (90% of the time you spend with them). It makes getting attached to anyone an impossibility- even moreso when they're constantly complaining about hunger and asking you for food or reminding you of their quests that you can't complete yet. ([b][i]ATUL.[/i][/b])[/olist]As for my #1 personal complaint...[h1]This game's pacing is [i]terrible.[/i][/h1]I have repeatedly received requests for things that are much further in the game than I am. Requests for things I can only achieve via ziplining while I hardly have the double-jump. Requests for shop items hidden in towns that're locked behind rocks or ice that require expensive ship upgrades. [i]Constant[/i] pestering for things I don't even know about. I have also gone through almost all of my ship upgrades in the top two rows, but my bottom row (meant for traversal) is stuck on [b]the third upgrade[/b] because [i]I cannot find what I need in easily-accessible areas.[/i] Some characters I meet will stick around with me for several hours, while others are gone in the blink of an eye. I knew Gwen for two hours before sending her off, while I've had Atul annoying me for nearly eighteen now. This is excluding me putting off Gwen's death to do busywork. It baffles me how nobody else has mentioned this yet. Am I just playing the game wrong?I wanted to love Spiritfarer. I put in 20 hours to try and do as much. I don't even think it's a bad game. But it's hardly even good, when it had the potential to be excellent.",1674952444,1679671074,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

They have a lot to say about death and grief, about love and its ability to endure, and how having a friend on the other side can make all the difference. And then it becomes a grind. You're bouncing from island to island, often without instruction on what to do next, playing the same minigames over and over again with no way to fast travel or cut down on the chaff, of which there is a lot.Spiritfarer is comprised of a lot of minigames, actually. Every time you need to craft something, you play another one, often without a lot of instruction (or any at all) on how to make the best of it. Want to craft 50 linen cloth? Be prepared to create each individual cloth. Want to create quartz powder? You'll have to crush it yourself by repeatedly pressing ""E"" upward of a dozen times.And while the first spirits I met pulled at my heartstrings, the later ones were all insufferable. I just wanted them off my boat. Some of them (quite a few, actually) have almost the exact same stories, with very little to differentiate them from one another. Others are just awful, and while perhaps this is a statement on caregiver burnout and desensitization, I'm not sure it works in a game, at least not one like this.This game does have a lot of good qualities about it, but overall, I have a lot of mixed feelings about it, especially given the hype.",1679666960,1679666960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

…and I’ve got a feeling it would definitely do it again if I were to replay it. It’s a bittersweet experience that pulls no punches in tugging at your heartstrings… and I absolutely loved it. I’ve been postponing this review for a while now, so I could look at the game more objectively, yet my opinion has not changed: It’s an absolute gem.

Everything about this game - the story, the sound design (which I will get to in a second), the art style, etc. – feels like a perfect composition to me. It evokes a feeling akin to childlike wonder, mixed with a sense of adventure, which perfectly fits the narrative of the game, as the story and the meaning behind this masterpiece are not so obvious from the start. I won’t go into the story much here though, because I believe it works its magic best when experienced blindly.

The art style is nothing short of beautiful. The design of the characters reflects their rich, varied personalities perfectly, the animations are cute and cartoonish yet very fluid and natural, the environments are absolutely stunning, and the visuals during some events, such as the meteor shower, are awe-inspiring.

The sound design, which I mentioned before, flows exceptionally well with the things happening on screen. It gives all the in-game events an extra push, greatly accentuating them. Yet the sound design is in perfect synergy with something else…

…with the soundtrack. The original soundtrack here is just something else. Composed by Maxime Lacoste-Lebuis, it elevates the already fantastic game to another level. From soft, fragile, reflection-inducing piano (At Night), through almost ethereal pieces (Guardians & Memories), all the way to massive, intense string-driven crescendos (The Swarm of Hades), they all fit this wonderful experience perfectly. I’m sure the game would not be the same without it.

If you’ve got a couple of evenings to spare, I would highly recommend checking it out. One disclaimer though. As wonderful as the game is, I found that there’s one point to be wary of. Spiritfarer is still a management game at its core, so it’s not entirely story-driven. This means that you’ll need to actually play quite a bit to progress the story, which I know has put some people off.

To finish off this review, I’ll just say that I will not forget this experience any time soon, if at all. I don’t think any game has made me feel what this game has. It’s truly an adventure to remember for a while. Many thanks to the Thunder Lotus team for such a masterpiece.

It will surely help you learn how to say goodbye.",1679415348,1679415587,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- I cried so hard about Atul, not to mention a week before finishing his quests, my uncle also died from liver failure, it seemed bad but I really thought he's gonna better so his death felt so sudden. I honestly panicked and searched in google to make sure it's not a bug and cried for 2 hours.. I didn't get to give him his last favorite food and a hug :( Not to mention his spirit flower is my favorite type of flower IRL :')

- and Stanley, I kinda finished his quests pretty quick but I took some time to bring him to the Everdoor bc I wasn't ready to let go of the baby. He gave the best hugs. and I love mushrooms. He's the bestest baby boy ever.

- Jackie is the last spirit that I took care of, and at first I hated him especially just before he got on board, but once he did, I couldn't judge his actions. I really wanted to help him understand no matter how mean he was, I still love him and happy he's on board. I'm happy doing his quests, I thought he's gonna feel a little better but then he said he couldn't change and asked to go to the Everdoor.. I think in this moment I knew what that meant for his death IRL but I decided not to think about it and finish the game as soon as I brought him to the Everdoor. Then days later I decided to read his wikifandom and cried. It hurts bc I can relate with his feelings and I understand that people love him even if he was awful (at first) but still, that doesn't change a thing for me and it feels kinda scary. But I love him so much. Thank you for making his character.


My top 3 least favorite spirits:
(I don't actually hate them, I'm just making excuses bc I wanna talk abt them lol)

- Elena PLEASE I'm bad at timed games that require smooth hand movement, my lame brain cannot. I honestly almost sent Stella to the Everdoor and just end the game. But, Elena was also right bc before I gave up, I was so angry I finished her quests. Tough love works but I don't exactly love how it works. So then she approved me and I did what she hated most before I brought her to the Everdoor...... I completely decorated her room MUAHAHAHAH. Although, I am glad I got to hug her.

- Bruce and Mickey were annoying at first (just Bruce actually), I really didn't enjoy helping them since they made others feel bullied and honestly this drive me to help them faster. I wasn't expecting anything when I brought them to the Everdoor but I was surprised when Bruce told me the truth. I felt sorry for judging him just bc of how they act. I think at that point I changed, like Bruce really opened my mind about how I see other people whether they're mean or not. And if it wasn't for them, I would definitely hate Jackie.

- Daria but just bc of the games too.. I almost gave up but I could hear Elena whispering ""skill issue"" and power through it.",1679121969,1679123775,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Great game - you should definitely do it!!
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional review: I was very surprised by this game. When I saw the trailer, I thought it looked wonderful and unique. When I first tried it, I thought it was casual and boring, so I stopped. A few months later I tried again... and could not stop until I finish it, yet you know what? all of my first impressions were actually true!
Spirit Farer is indeed a wonderful game: have you seen how beautiful it looks? Everything in this game is gorgeous. The illustrations are sumptuous, the animation is smooth and colorful... All of this new graphic school in video games with Hades or Battle Chef Brigade is really pleasant to see.
The game is also unique: I never was into Undertale, although I recognize its impact on the world of game design. A game where you don't necessarily kill everything, where dialogues are different, where themes are mature and deep yet not gross or typical. That was unique when it came out, for sure. Now, Undertale for me was lackluster and just the spark for a whole new approach to game design, and made possible games like Spiritfarer. A game about death, about dying, about others dying but also yourself, dying. Made with lots of tact and tenderness for mankind. The game can be very touching from time to time, and ends up being very worked in its details, in its depth of narration and its meaning.
Finally, for the down side, my negative impressions were also true: the game IS completely casual. Sometimes it reminded me of tablet/smartphone games, there is NO difficulty in its gameplay, a child could play it, yet its design (menus, actions etc) are still for grown ups while being a bit clumsy/casual. Not a BAD thing, but not a great/attractive thing for a gamer like me.
And I said it was boring, sadly I stand by it: the game is packed of dialogues, unfortunately they are sometimes quite wordy and uninspired/uninteresting. Also, the gameplay itself is often very dry or bland (some actions require you to push a button... many times... why?). And despite the fact that the tone of the game is remarkably mature and sensitive, what you actually do in the game is very repetitive and that can be a deterrent for many gamers.

Now, if you just would like a formula: imagine the exploration of islands on an ocean like in Windwaker or Sea of Thieves - the mature approach and metaphysical theme of an Outer Wilds or Undertale - the relaxing and ecological gameplay of a Stardew Valley, with its Relationship features - the casualness of a Metroidvania-lite or for children. All of this is Spiritfarer. And I made sure to obtain all the achievements to show my respect to the devs (I rarely do that).

Overall is it a great game? yes, albeit a small one (maybe a 85% in my ranking system). Is it a masterpiece? Not at all, a 100 games at least are better than that. Will it be in my Top 100 of all times? I am not sure yet... So is it just an average game? I really don't think so, it is too unique and original for that. Spiritfarer is a game where death is approached in such a unique way, where your eyes sparkle from the unique, beautiful artwork, where your ears tingle from the delicate music (the Everdoor theme!), where your heart feels a bit heavy each time you recognize in its narration some things from your own life and experience... We all face death eventually, many, different times. Spiritfarer talks about that, so it might not be an amazing video game, but it is for sure a splendid work of art.",1679037056,1679038774,True,1,0,0.494166076183319092,0,True,False,False

Just finished this game for the second time. The first time I played it, I was very stressed in life and it came at the perfect time to give me some relaxation. The incredible music is impossible to ignore, (MOST of) the characters are very endearing, and the gameplay is addictive as hell, to say the least. I love that it's also quite humorous, so even a game about death doesn't always have to be super heavy. Overall, I simply adored the game and was absolutely going around recommending it to my friends.

However, the second time, I played this game while grieving. It hit so different. I realized how every little detail in this game, every word each of the spirits say, has such deep, significant, individual meaning. I became more familiar with the fact that we all have our own struggles in life and sometimes things don't end happily for everyone, and that is okay in the end. I found some true peace in my loss through this game. I cannot express how unique Spiritfarer really is, and how much it means to me.

It instantly soared to my number one favourite game ever. No game has ever touched me the way Spiritfarer did. Every single screenshot could be framed and hanged on the wall. Every single dialogue is interesting, deep and meaningful. Every activity has a purpose and meaning. Together with the enchanting music, it is a perfect masterpiece of game design, artwork and storytelling. It is about death, inevitable part of life, about humanity, friendship, hard times in life and perserverance, about finding the meaning in life, about both individuality and community and what is worth living AND dying for. I have cried many times during the gameplay, even when I played for the second time. I have been amazed by the captivating stories and symphatised with the deep characters. I have tried to read between the lines of character dialogues and guess what could have happened to them ""in reality"". And even thought it might seem Spiritfarer is basically a tear-jerking visual novel, nothing could actually be farther away from reality!! The platform jumping parts, especially if you're a completionist and want to find all collectibles are really challenging and fun, the controls are super responsive and very fun. Building your ship is also fun by itself, and even though some activities might be a little bit tedious, like constant plant watering, woodcutting or working in the smithy, it has never annoyed me enough to lower my esteem about this game.

the concept is neat, the animations and cartoonish scenery very relaxing and adorable.
however the (many) reviews i read didn't talk about what became the main feature of the game:
the grind, SO MUCH GRIND!
grind for fish, grind for wood, grind to make planks out of wood, grind for meals, grind for fruit, farming, take the plants, water the plants, plant the seeds, grind for junk, the whole game is about grinding rather than base building, i mean, yes, technically there's a base, but it's just there, there's very little management.

It's a very lighthearted and casual game: there are no failure conditions, it's filled with relaxing minigames, and the OST brings about a deep sense of serenity and wonder. It's the type of game you can just kick your feet up and play on a rainy day (not unlike something like Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing), which was very refreshing after having played multiple souls-likes in a row. The gameplay got a little repetitive and tedious towards the end as I was aiming for 100%. All I had left to do was [spoiler] a mid-to-late-game quest that was meant to be done over the course of 12 in-game days while you’re tying up other loose ends—whoops! [/spoiler] I will admit that idling the game on my second monitor while I did other things did break the immersion a fair bit, but it was worth it for the big ‘100%’ on my save file and it didn’t affect my overall opinion on the game at all.

All that aside, what the game lacks in mechanical difficulty, it certainly makes up for in *emotional* difficulty.

I'd heard about this game being hard-hitting since it came out, but I only got around to playing it this year. I was expecting to be moved, but I was in no way expecting to be as emotionally broken coming out of a play session as I was after bringing my first spirit to the Everdoor. Spritfarer not only makes you think about your mortality but in a way, it helps you come to terms with it. Stella's job is to help the spirits of her loved ones come to terms with their deaths so that they may move on, but she also helps [spoiler] herself and [/spoiler] the player do the same. I picked up Spiritfarer during a time where I was paranoid and convinced that my time was running out. On paper it sounds like a recipe for disaster, but I believe it only amplified the emotional impact of the story and my connection with each of the spirits—especially Summer, whose story resonated with me deeply. It touched on some of my deepest fears in such a realistic and heart-wrenching way, especially seeing as I saw many of my loved ones in the characters I've had to say goodbye to. Getting to know everyone and growing to appreciate their company always sets you up for a painful goodbye; It made me think about how much you really take your loved ones for granted. Atul, Alice and Beverly hit especially close to home. The latter two’s arcs being so similar and happening so close together that it struck me with an overwhelming sense of despair and hopelessness that there was nothing I could do to help. It’s the most gripping emotion I’ve felt playing a video game in years and I loved it.

The soundtrack adds so much to the story's impact—especially the minigame songs. The comet shower song in particular made me connect with Giovanni in a way I never expected. From the start, he was just kind of... there. I never paid much attention to him and was more invested in making Astrid happy, [spoiler] which is why I told her about his night excursions without a second thought. [/spoiler] The first time Giovanni came out during a meteor shower, I immediately felt my opinion of him shift. There's so much wonder and awe in the song, it reveals a side of him that I didn't know was there. I don't know how to explain it. I haven't activated a comet shower since he left, because I feel like it'd be wrong to see the stars fall without him there to marvel at them by my side.


It's incredibly rare that I give out 5-star ratings, even for games that I adore. That rating is reserved only for masterpieces, and games that mean too much to me to rate them anything else—games that shaped me as a person. Spiritfarer is both. 10/10.

Tl;dr: a soft chill open world go-at-your-own-pace friend-making game with gorgeous art, a phenomenal soundtrack, and dynamic, complex characters. 

The OST is what initially drew me in; I don't think there's a single track that I *don't* like. It's nice to just turn on and chill to, when you need a little peace in your life. The art is also adorable, and fits the vibe perfectly. Character design is so cool, the way each character is portrayed with their own unique visual personalities and silhouettes. 

My one nitpicky gripe is, with awful ADHD brain, it's easy to forget where to go and what to do, even with the quest tab open and available. But, the pacing of the game and the ability to go anywhere pretty much whenever you want makes this a little easier to navigate around. (That and taking notes the Old Fashioned Way lol)

The biggest letdown is how quickly all of the character's storylines are presented.

For instance, part of my responsibility is to listen and support my crew in finding happiness rather than regret so that they may rest in piece. Unfortunately, it's not in this game. The majority of the crews I've sent packing were unhappy and I felt terrible about it. I believed their story shouldn't have ended there.

I enjoyed Spiritfarer's vibrant atmosphere, profound connections to the real world, and satisfying gameplay & story enough to forget a few small pain points along the way.

What I LOVED about this game:
+ Gave me a chance to think deeply about life and death without being pushy
+ Made me care about the characters a lot
+ The soundtrack and artwork are both gorgeous and contribute significantly to the game's atmosphere
+ Progressing through the game is done largely at your own pace, without being hand-hold-y or feeling rushed (it took me about 40 hours to reach the ending, and I was at over 80% completion by then)

What I felt ""meh"" about:
> While the platforming elements were solid at times, at other times they seemed unnecessary or even nuisance
> I really enjoyed giving the NPCs foods/drinks that they loved, but it was sometimes difficult to figure out what those actually were without looking it up

What I didn't like:
- A handful of slightly annoying gameplay elements, including gathering certain resources and having interactions locked out at certain times due to plot sequences
- On maybe 3 different occasions, a NPC or I got stuck in a glitch, and I had to save and re-load the game",1678281904,1678281904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really have little to no words as to how this game made me feel throughout my playthrough. 
Not a single video game has made me cry. Not a single one.
This one made me cry like... 14 times? Maybe even up to 20 times? Idk.
I don't know why it had such a choke-hold on my emotions, but man. It did. 
Each of the characters that you meet in this game just feel so real. Each one is so relatable and real, and throughout the course of the game you get to know them and their stories so well - it feels like you're friends with them, and you've genuinely known them for years. It makes it all the more harder to progress the game. 

It is kind of poetic - thinking about it, I'm probably not ready to write this review. I can't quite get my thoughts together. I can't put into words how I feel about this game.
And, funnily enough, I don't think I was ready for this game. It took me by surprise. Maybe that's why I was so emotional playing through the game. But... I think I feel better, now. I think it made me feel better. It made me feel more at peace with things that were earlier a worry. 

Maybe, one day, when I'm ready, I'll come back to this game. And I'll write another review. For now, this review will stay as it is.

It really did help - I spent a lot of time shedding tears, both for the in-game characters as well as from my own grief.

I thought about the game in its ultimate context - confronting and making peace with the prospect of death. My four year-old asked next to me about almost every spirit brought to the Everdoor, and he was able to relate to it in the context of his dog dying. It helped to convey the permanence of it all, as well as to ask questions about each of the spirits as they related to his dog. Powerful.

Having to micro manage a ship full of spirits and animals while you spend 10 minutes crossing the ocean to talk to one person is cool in the moment, but it gets old. This game imo struggles to decide if it wants to tell a story or be a cool puzzle platformer.

I wish I could see my map outside of the map room, and have quest markers, or at the very least see my quests and map at the same time, mark points of interest, and have the boat autodrive to destinations while I'm ""sleep"".

The worst part about this story is I have no idea what happened to the main character or why. I finished the game without doing every quest because the story had been told in bits and pieces over countless play sessions with no recall or summary.

This isn't really a game that you can ""get good"" at, you simply have to let yourself be drawn in by the story and characters. 

Spiritfarer gently guides you through the various different stories of the spirits that you, as Stella, accompanied by her cat Daffodil, must eventually ferry to the afterlife. The graphics and music are beautiful and one can really tell that the developers have let a lot of love, thought and whimsy flow into this game. Some of the stories seem so incredibly personal, yet so relatable and moving.

To me, the beauty of this game lies in its handling of time as flux. There is no pressure to ""speed-run"" though quests, stories or minigames. You're ready when you're ready, right up to the very last moment. 
I love precisely those elements that other reviewers have criticized - the slow animations, the back and forth, the conversations, simply the non-linearity of it all. None of that was tedious for me in my playthrough - quite the opposite, in fact. I frequently looked forward to taking time off from my busy schedule to just...enjoy the precious moments Spiritfarer had to offer.

I won't say too much about the story (stories?) or characters, except that saying goodbye to spirits wasn't always easy and I spent many of my 54 ingame hours on the verge of tears...and sometimes even beyond. Grief, loss and forgiveness aren't the easiest themes to tackle but I think this game did an excellent job.",1677679717,1677679717,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You get to become somewhat intimate with a small cast of characters as you play through the simulator-lite gameplay loop. Though I once or twice found myself getting a bit lost as to how best to proceed, I think the lulls between plot points or passenger departures were necessary. Clever usage of gameplay mechanics leads to some impressively heartbreaking moments.

Speaking of heartbreak, I have wept so much at this game; I really did feel like I got to know the cast of the ship just as their moment to pass on arrived. And when they are ready to move on, the compositions of Max LL composed just floored me. I wish I could properly articulate the simultaneous melancholy and relief I feel anytime 'Last Voyage' plays during the game. My heart aches thinking about saying goodbye to my first passenger.

The familiarity with and love for the subject matter, of death and letting go, is apparent in almost every element of Spiritfarer. And while not every player will have the same emotional experience with the game, it is an incredibly touching experience that had touched upon some incredibly relatable moments. It invites you to feel however you want, but I for one shed many tears playing Spiritfarer. And I loved it.

Contrary to what the game might like to tell you, the real story of Spiritfarer is: ""you are an errand girl"". That sums up every character arc in the game. You find the character, sometimes pass a trial for them to deign to board your ship, then you satisfy their every demand, which they have a considerable amount of: feed me, build me a house, furnish my house, fulfill my life's calling for me, etc.. The earlier characters are at least friendly and thankful while you help them, but two of the later ones will just mock how much of a sucker you are while bossing you around (and I don't care that they probably have redemption arcs, I just want to kick them off my ship, preferrably in the middle of the ocean). Then after you've completed their story you send them on their way to the underworld. Which honestly is a pretty emotional affair, I have to admit I was sad for some time after the first character left (the next few were significantly less impactful), but that's not really due to the writing or the story; the art is pulling ALL the punches here.

You play as Stella which is the new Spiritfarer. Your goal is it to bring every spirit to the Everdoor so they can have their peace. While playing you meet very loveble Spirits in which you find your friends. You escort them through their last days and get to know them better every day. You can build their homes on your ship, diffrent buildings for you and them and you have to finish their quests to progress in game.

Spiritfarer is exceptional in how it intertwines its narrative premise into the gameplay and manages to both delight me in the whimsy of its world, and make me cry in its exploration of some pretty heavy stuff.

For an indie game, it's a pretty long one. Took me over 40h to completely finish the game. However, this game is not about completion, achieving or wining... It's a complete experience of love and loss. The game gives you some real feelings of life (which I'm not sure if it's good) especially when you lose someone you love suddenly and unexpectedly or seeing them slowly dying in front of your eyes. However, it was not all a sad experience, there were times you smile and have fun. Struggle and achieve. But you always know there's an end and it's coming...

I loved the whole experience and I recommend everyone to play this game once in their life. But be ready to ""read much"". If you don't like reading conversations or texts, don't even try. You won't like it at all.

And finally, I have to touch a huge missing part of the whole story without giving any spoilers. WHO THE HELL IS GONNA BE THE NEXT CHARON??? What the hell Stella?

Thanks!

I have some minor nitpicks. The platforming controls are a little frustrating sometimes, and the pacing drags in certain areas (I realize this depends on the order you do the tasks in and is hard to standardize for that reason.)
But overall, this is going in my top 10 all-time favorite games, maybe even top 5. The gameplay loop of exploration and houseboat management is very well crafted. It reminds me a little of Raft, but more satisfying. 
And the characters and writing are fantastic. This game deals with some pretty heavy themes and it takes a skilled writer to deal with them properly, and they did it. Man, some of those moments are gut-wrenching.

Its universe, characters and story are really touching. And its ost, graphics and animations are awesome. I also like a lot the platformer aspect, which is well made and satisfying. 

However, even if at first the game is really pleasing to play, it quickly becomes tedious. The progress is very slow : long and repetitive mini games to collect and transform resources (fun the first time, but after that they become chores), beautiful but very long animations each time you do something like watering your crops, which is unnecessary, and too much back and forth in boat. Because of that, the game sadly lacks dynamism and isn't that pleasing to play after a while...

Moreover, the length of the game enforces it even more. I think it could have been a good game if it was shorter, but the slow gameplay during that much time kills it completely, and we are bored of it way before the end. 
This is even more sad because the story and the character are still touching, and we can't enjoy it well in the end. There's also a lot of content, but that we unlock after so many hours that it doesn't benefit the experience. 

I'm sure certain people will have a lot of fun anyway, but I will clearly not be able to finish the game.


(Ps : I guess the game wants us to appreciate each character, however Giovanni is just straight up a ""Don Juan like"" cheater that I can only despise, while I'm supposed to make him happy in the game :/)",1677245526,1677251447,False,2,1,0.530668556690216064,0,True,False,False

Pros: The story is lovely, and it is quite a casual game which was what I was looking for. The graphics are beautiful, and the music soothing. The experience makes you feel just nice. I did not encounter any major bugs, it seemed polished. Each of the characters brought something different, and made me feel like they had their own lives and their own stories and somehow I wished to know more about them. 

Cons: The game went on for a lot longer than I expected - this perhaps is a good thing for some of you - the problem is the gameplay itself did not really evolve. The farming aspects were tedious when you have to repeat them over and over, all the little minigames for resource refining become just...boring and repetitive. There is no way to automate processes. Minor upgrades to the farming system are found in end game when farming is pretty much obsolete.  

There are also some odd resource roadblocks that perhaps were not that intuitive. I was stuck on a quest for the longest time because I did not realise I had to go back and talk to a specific NPC to debrief to progress the quest. Some essential passengers were found on islands I had forgotten from ages ago...

And lastly, I hate platformers unfortunately. Especially the ones where you could be one jump from the end, but then you can mis-time the jump or the platform disappears/moves randomly and you just fall back to the beginning. Platformers like that are in my opinion such an archaeic form of gameplay - they did well back in the 90s because they fit on a 1.3mb floppy disc and people did not mind repeating levels over and over again. I do not play games for platformers. I hate them. So the sheer number of platforming required almost made me quit the game. If you enjoy platformers then this might not be a problem for you. 

Honestly I didn't really want to give it a 'no' recommendation overall, but if I had to think about how cranky I got out of frustration from some of the quests I do think I have to give it an overall no for ME; but it may well be a good game for you if you don't mind the above things. Part of the problem may also have been that I played the game over the course of about a week or two (a few hours a day) when perhaps it is supposed to be more casual than that?

The graphics and sound are great and the game has a nice, relaxing atmosphere. Unfortunately, what I went into hoping for a nice, short game quickly turned into a tedious grind. Everything in this game with regard to the resource management seems to be designed to be as tedious as possible. Want to make olive oil? Better smash the x button like 50 times. Want to make thread? Gotta play a timing mini-game for EVERY SINGLE ONE. Want to grind flour? Gotta put it in the mill and ADJUST THE WIND DIRECTION every time you move to a new location. Also, the time it takes to cook something is INSANELY variable. Some dishes cook in literally 2 seconds and others take like 10 minutes and it's ridiculous.

Also, many quests and areas are essentially gated-off because they require a particular item you can only get in a certain area or from a certain character. I was stuck for ages because the one item I needed was given by a resident who I had to GROW from a seed after sending off a certain number or residents and I only found out by checking the wiki.

Basically, this game would be great if it didn't seem designed to waste your time. There was NO NEED to make the resource management aspect of this game as tedious and grindy as it is.

Most of the time it's just annoying but some of the later passengers have fairly challenging platforming missions that are part of their story progression which for me will take an aggravating amount of time to get past.  By the time I get to the actual story parts I don't care nearly as much.  I wish they had a way to tone those portions down.

If you're good at platformers disregard that complaint and know that the characters are interesting, the story is pretty good and if you like simple base building it's pretty fun to build out your ship.

They blame people who use VPNs to appear as if they live in these countries to get cheaper prices, but by increasing the price like this they're punishing the customers from these regions, who will now have to pay 5 times the original price.

All these developers who recently raised the prices had the choice to group together and contact Valve and request them to strengthen the system to avoid this loophole, but no, they chose the easy way and they betrayed their loyal customers and fans of the game.

You can try to complain and write your disapproval, of course, but the decision on the price was already made. However, remember that as a customer you have a choice, and you can always VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET.

In addition, this is just another example of something pretty evident that still a lot of people fail to see: if you see developers and game studios posting announcements about their alleged sympathy for affected regions in the world, it's always wise to assume it's a mere marketing strategy until proven otherwise, and beyond any doubt, so don't fall for that.

Recommended if you like grinding mini-games or if you really connect with what you see in the demo.   I had to really push myself to finish grinding to see the end of the game's main and free update stories.

What starts as a fun game exploring the world with friends while using charming crafting mini-games turns into a grocery checklist as I constantly collected more resources so I could unlock the next area to grind more resources in, but I couldn't get to all of the resources so I had to come back later with more shrine upgrades to grind the rest of the resources so I could keep progressing.  I wouldn't mind doing it a few times, but half the islands have stuff that asked me revisit them at least three times to collect everything.  And the crafting.  It was fun at first, but then it got very, very old several hundred crafted items later.  The saw and the smithy in particular made me groan every time I saw another thing which needed 60 more planks or 5 more metal/glass sheets.

There are also a couple, really poorly introduced systems which brought my progress to a screeching halt until I looked them up online or randomly stumbled across them. (Stanley had his door locked for most of the time I had him.  How am I supposed to know it's suddenly unlocked so I can get ectoplasm if there aren't any prompts?)

The story writing is pretty good, but it does get dark.  Very dark.  Lily's story near the end does a good job of tying most of the pieces together for those who want closure.  I only really felt a connection with a few of the characters, so it wasn't hard to say goodbye to most of them.  I was relieved when they had to go, because it meant less grinding for food that detracted from enjoying the story.  I did miss the hugs though.  Those were definitely the best part of having passengers. 

Ultimately, this game won me over with the hugs, the artwork, cute sounds and its creativity.  The hugs were easily the most rewarding part of this game, so much so that I was willing to put up with having my toes stepped on and my shins bashed by the revisiting and crafting systems.",1676274600,1676274600,True,0,0,0.483005374670028687,0,True,False,False

The art is awesome, concept is neat and kinda depressing, and the gradual construction of your ship with lost spirits is really well done. For that, it's definitely a recommend. However, I think the balancing especially in the second half with resource management and completing certain quests is completely out of sync with the rest of the game. I didn't even finish the last character's quest line because it was simply far too tedious of a fetch quest. It goes from gathering a couple things to work towards the next upgrade to instead fishing for very specific things in very specific areas, only to unlock the ability to travel to all corners of the map yet again to recruit people for something.

Without that emotional component, the game is not really anything special anymore. Collecting and making stuff is more a chore than interesting, maybe made worse by the very long animations that can't be skipped for every little thing one does. Often a animation stops but one can't move for another 2 seconds. (In a similar vein: NPCs' speaking would really be more enjoyable if I could set the speed by which the text appears and/or show all text at once instead of slowly putting one letter down after another.)

But maybe the much more important factor for not enjoying ""bonding"" with the NPCs: while the first few NPC have their quirks and occasional interpersonal drama, it felt like something that is actually worth listening to and getting invested is worthwhile. Then joins that NPC that is basically a manipulative cheater including the obvious lying and overly dramatic apologies. Yes, please, so enjoyable to fetch various presents for that person so they can manipulate their ""love interest"" into forgiving them. At least that character was relatively quickly gone. But then an even more abstruse character appears: a violent criminal that boasts about how he did all kinds of cruel and violent stuff to impress some crime boss. He treats the player character with contempt. Offering the wrong kind of food results in outright threats. Why would I enjoy serving such a NPC instead of booting them off my ship? That character even has a major negative gameplay effect, as every other NPC receives a mood debuff because they feel bullied by that NPC.

There is no obvious way to remove those NPCs from what I can tell - it seems each NPC is mandatory to progress.

Overall, since I got the game for 6€ during a sale, I don't really regret buying it.

I played this game co-op with my girlfriend. Now, I've heard from her and others that the single-player experience is much better, but I was stuck with so many soft-locking or game-breaking bugs near the end that frustrated me to the point that I almost gave up right before finishing. Co-op is anything except a polished experience.

Onto the gameplay itself:
While I enjoy the core gameplay loop of gathering, upgrading, and building in the likes of things like Raft, I found this frankly arduous. The playforming was a nice addition, but even so something felt very... wrong... to me about the platforming physics. Why I mean by this is that momentum is seemingly arbitrarily maintained whenever jumping, and entirely dependent off of the surface from which exiting. 
I frankly could not stand the required micro-managing for Every. Single. Thing when it came to resources. The crops were the least egregious. I do not mind individually watering and harvesting, but the animations take far too long when trying to produce the items you need in lategame. Much of the game as a whole felt specifically constructed to waste as much time as it could on anything but the story or characters which, as I mentioned, were the main shining point. Every single resource had some sort of minigame attached. There is no way to automate them. If you wish to have a particular resource, especially if it needs some manufacturing, prepare for a heap of (from my perspective) time-wasting and pointless minigames. While you can increase the production from these minigames by double, eventually, it does not solve the problem at hand of being designed to waste time. 

Overall, I enjoyed this game. However, I cannot recommend it to anyone. This is the first occasion where I've felt the need to post a negative review on something that I enjoyed, mostly because I don't think it will hurt the overall review score that much. Keep this in mind before purchase, but if it does not sound like that big of a burden- please go for it! It's cute.",1676088782,1676088782,False,3,0,0.504547417163848877,0,True,False,False

EDIT:
    I reviewed this game but I had something I wanted to add. I'm 82% through the game, and I wanted to address something. This game has a lot of heavy themes that might be triggering for some people. There are discussions/implications of suicide; mentions of war, cancer, and dementia. There's also discussions of injury and death (since that's what the game is about). If strong feelings of loss or grief might trigger you or cause you to spiral, please think carefully about playing this game. I don't consider these things to be bad - I think they add to the weight of the game. I have enjoyed how unflinching the game has been with its characters, and I understand experiencing all this will be healing for many of its players. But I don't want anyone to be caught off guard.
     All that said, the art and animation are astounding The music continues to sweep me off my feet every time I play, and the world-building is a delight. Both in spite of AND because of its heavy themes, this game has quickly become one of my favorites.

1. I didn't think much of the game because I just wanted some management genre to play during my free time so I can de-stress but after reading about the game, I love how it has unique a unique plot about death and acceptance.
2. The characters will teach you a lot about life. The spirits which hit me the hardest was when Atul just disappeared without me having the chance to bid him goodbye, and Jackie's character. I saw myself in Jackie and his quests would just make me cry every single time. Also, the game had me in tears every time I send a character to the everdoor (their last stop).
3. I love how it was made to match the player's pace. I don't know if you get me but unlike other games where if you fail to accomplish a quest, it would have a repercussion on your stats in the game. But with Spiritfarer, the game lets you take your time as you take on each task.

*NOTE: I am still playing this game as of writing this review*

Visually awesome This is hands down one of the most aesthetically relaxing games I've had the pleasure of playing.
The art and the animation are beautifully done in my opinion which I find really charming. Good hand drawn animation is hard to do, but this animators nailed it here with everything from the expressions to the smallest gestures. Nailed it.

The gameplay is pretty fun and simple. 
It's just a lot of mini games that reward you for just about anything. There's little to no penalty. I like that. It's very stress-free in that regard. When you are not playing the mini games, you travel and platform around looking for materials; new abilities; and conversing with NPC's. It's pretty bare bones, but I am okay with that because it's got fun dialogue and good story elements. I think the pacing of the game is done well. If I ever felt stuck I would just explore and I would usually find what I needed to advance the story. I suggest this game if you are looking to just relax and if you're okay with getting a little emotional (or a lot of emotional).

The story is thought provoking.
Spoiler not spoiler, you deal with death the entire game. Something that can be difficult to understand is how the characters you meet passed away. Maybe it's just me (probably me), but some of the conflicts the characters go through are a little hard to understand as their conflicts are sometimes left a mystery that you'll have to piece together. Part of me also thinks that the ending isn't what was meant to be highlighted, but how the characters were feeling in there last moments alive. Food for thought while you play.

I had fun. I think more of these games should exist to give pause to games we might need breaks from so we can reset. It's also kind of nice when a game gives you not just an experience, but also leaves you with something to think about.",1675714239,1675714239,True,1,0,0.51776653528213501,0,True,False,False

The whole game is just a load of busywork, expressed through boring little minigames you've seen a thousand times before. You can fish. Which boils down to pressing the action key to cast your line, then waiting until something bites, before holding down the action key to reel it in. Once a certain character comes aboard, it gets a little bit more complicated: now you can catch bigger things, which means your line can snap. So now you have to release the action button when your line is about to break, letting it cool down for a brief instant, and hold it again to continue reeling in. Yawn-a-licious! But hey, there's also farming. Which involves standing in front of your plot, and using your action key to plant something (it lets you select what), using the same action key to water it (which must be done daily, for every individual plot), and again to harvest after a couple of days. Don't like that? Well, there's the music minigame. Hit the specified controller keys at the correct moment to play a melody. Cutting down trees: move the stick left and right to move the saw. Cooking: toss something in the oven and wait for the timer to run out, then take it out of the oven. Mining: hold the action key to ""charge up"" your swing, then let go before you inexplicably drop your pickaxe. And so on, and so forth.

On top of that, you need to keep your passengers happy. Some have certain demands, which you need to fulfill. They also each have their personal preferences regarding food. Satisfying their demands and dietary preferences increases their happiness, which apparently (although I'm probably not at that stage yet) makes them help out on the boat with all the menial tasks. The problem is, in order to see their mood, you need to interact with them and select the ""mood"" option. They don't have different animations depending on their mental state, nor do they have handy icons floating overhead so you can quickly see which passengers require attention. Unless it's for scripted events. And they don't do anything by themselves; you have to cook for them, you have to provide them with whatever makes them happy, they're just along for the ride but don't expect them to carry their own weight or anything.

All of this results in a load of busywork, and you're frantically running from left to right to react to all the different timers running out or gathering resources. This leaves you very little time to actually interact with your passengers in a meaningful way. Which, to me, seemed the whole point of this game prior to purchase, going by the marketing materials. But then, if you're looking for meaningful interactions, you're not gonna find it in this game anyway, as the characters don't really have much to say. Nor do you, for that matter. There is no dialogue in this game, just monologue where the characters apparently reveal their story. And their preferences, and the ""tutorials"", and whatever else the game wants you to know about. You can't steer the conversations, you can't react to what they tell you, you're just there to listen.

I truly don't understand all the raving reviews, or the ""overwhelmingly positive"" rating this game gets. This is Farmville levels of gaming ""fun"". I can't believe none of the people who gave this a glowing review have ever played an actual game before, so what am I missing?

On the cautiously positive side: the drawing and animation style is beautiful and charming, I'll give them that. Although, like all the rest, it's also very repetitive. I mean, how many times can that deer be genuinely surprised that you hug her before she simply hugs you back without getting startled every... single... time??? Would it have killed them to create, I don't know, *two* hug animations for that character? But still, it's beautifully drawn, and the game oozes visual charm. Too bad it doesn't have the gameplay to back it up.",1675707868,1675707979,False,4,1,0.505077362060546875,0,True,False,False

It's very difficult for me to find a game that I won't get tired of, so this was a hidden gem amongst all the games I looked through. You always had something to do and if you were stuck, you had the quest tab to help.

Another thing I love is the open world aspect of the game. You can move around the map quite freely (granted, you need some upgrades for specific areas to advance in the game, which require you to follow the storyline)

The art and animation is also on point, love the goofy frames. If you pay attention, you can see some clever details added.

So I've played ~40 hours of this game and have all 39 achievements, bear with me guys.

It was an awesome journey. I'm not ""story/characters""-games-liking kinda guy, but this one was good.

It shows you struggles, pain, joy, importance of communicating with the ones you love.

Did I cry? Yes, twice, near the end of the game.

Pros of this game:
1. Beautiful artwork. It's so beautiful I bought an artbook. The everdoor, Stella,characters, island designs, even Hades - it took devs a lot of time to design. Well done.
2. Beautiful music. I didn't buy the soundtrack DLC tho (I don't listen to music via Steam)
3. Beautiful main protagonist. In the artbook developers said that they went through lots of iterations with Stella and Daffodil, and I can see why. If I ever to see Stella cosplay, I will know it immediately.
4. Awesome characters. Each one so unique I can still name them all by names and their favorite dishes, and do remember some of their stories.
5. Theme. Coping with dying is very hard for many people, and it will for sure help someone who faced losses in their lives.
6. Gameplay. Managing ship was very cool idea and it was very well implemented. After I finished the game with all achievements I loaded an autosave with few spirits (Gustav and Atul namely because they help other spirits be happy) left so I can prepare for new characters coming this year (they should be free btw but I will buy them if they don't). So I will still spend time in-game to farm some more items, even tho the game is complete.

The game is not without it's flaws tho:
0. It takes a LOT of time to get you going. First 10-15 hours I was thinking ""I lack everything and I need everything"".
1. The amount of things you should do in this game can be overwhelming. Travel, manage boat, fish, talk to spirits, hug spirits, find recipes, cook for spirits/quests, craft materials, grow plants/seeds, water plants/seeds, gather fruits from trees, mine ores, gather berries, milk cows, shear sheep, buy/sell materials, wander islands, play dozen of mini-games (for materials). I am sure I forgot something! You are going to enjoy this game when you are either casual gamer and take your time, or when you will be able to hold everything in your head.
2. Imagine you have an unskippable character animation, during which you don't control anything (no menu, no character movement, not even opening inventory). Now imagine this animation takes 5 seconds to complete. Not that harsh right? Now imagine that you will see hundreds of these animations during your playthrough. Here is the list of things that will take your time when they probably shouldn't:

Sleeping. The game has day-night cycle and when you go to sleep everything fades out, after few seconds everything fades in, Stella stretches, and you are good to go.
Failing at mining. To mine an ore, you need to hold a button. If you hold too much - Stella will fail to hit ore, and an animation will play for 2 seconds when Stella can try again.
Spirits. All spirits in game have their favorite food, food they are fine with, and food they hate. If you accidentally give them food they hate - they will play the same dialog, over and over again, explaining that they don't like it. It contains multiple sentences, so it will take you multiple presses to get through (sometimes up to 4). I missed sometimes and you just go ""argh"" and click through the dialog.

3. Farming. The amount of farming is not comparable to Diablo III for example, but you will farm a LOT. Honestly, without Steam guides I probably won't hit 100% achievements (or it'd probably took me twice as much time). After 10 hours of farming I almost gave up, but then switched priorities and started working on quests (which, believe or not, also wanted me to farm something)

4. There are small bugs (that don't influence gameplay, like animation glitch), there are some visual bugs (if you start mining ore from one of the sisters backs before she is fully out of water - Stella's animation jumps), and there is one bug that drove me crazy - during a mini-game with Golden dragon game didn't show me the next part of the screen (and I can't time my jumps). Otherwise, no crashes, wasn't stuck anywhere, no items missing.

Overall, I'd go with this game again, honestly.

Waiting for the new content and already looking at Jotun/Sundered (other two games by the studio).

The characters themselves are colorful, memorable, and distinct.  Each has their own personality, their own struggles, and their own likes and dislikes.

The story was very emotionally compelling while also maintaining a cute sense of humour.

I really liked the art style, too. The game definitely achieved the ""cozy"" look and feel that was advertised. The music was lovely and added to this effect. 

I can tell that the developers and artists really cared about this game, and it shows in every aspect.

I enjoyed this game so much that I even watched their Escapist documentary about it on YouTube. 

Overall, I found it to be a very pleasant, emotional, and satisfying experience that left me considering death in my own life in the past, present, and future.

An emotional cozy/management game about taking spirits to the afterlife by comforting them and making sure they are ready to move on. This involves gathering materials,upgrading your ship AND yourself by adding more abilities and doing puzzles.
Cons-
It takes too long to finish(30+ hours)

Love the building aspect of Spiritfarer, the layering you can do with all the buildings is marvelous, you can make it however neat, busy, or far apart you'd like.

Spiritfarer, for being a game played solo, is very slow pace, with you having to constantly backtrack, go out for materials, and manually refine them. There are a lot of quests and talking, so if you're more into fast-paced games, this won't be your cup of tea.

Each spirit is quite distinct and memorable, and sending them through the Everdoor is a different experience for each. They represent a lot of the different ways people confront death. For the most part, I found them compelling characters, even the ones who aren't nice to be around. I actually appreciate that they're not all likable people. You come to understand why they are the way they are. There will probably be one or two you won't be sorry to say goodbye to, but their stories will probably stick with you. There was only one character I found too saccharine and overwritten, but I'm probably in the minority.

Gameplay is cozy and relaxing in the sense that you can't really fail at doing tasks. It's a slow-paced game, but in a good way. It takes time to get from one place to another, so you have time to do tasks around the boat, talk to the spirits, fish, and so on. You tend to get access to resources approximately when you need them. The resources are generally not super scarce, and each island shows you exactly what's there so you never have to remember. 

My one big criticism is that, especially toward mid-game, it falls into the trap that a lot of games do--you have to have this thing to build that thing, then that thing to make another thing, and you need that thing to upgrade your boat, which you need to help a spirit or get where you need to go. Or you need to get a certain number of obols or spirit flowers to get certain upgrades, which you can't because acquiring those things is dependent upon other things. There are certain time or event gates as well that can prevent you from accomplishing anything until those things happen.  Again, this is a slow game, which isn't a bad thing, but you sometimes end up being in a holding pattern, unsure what to do or waiting on something to happen. It could have been balanced a little better so there doesn't need to be a lull.

That doesn't detract from any of the positives, though, particularly in the storytelling. I've done so much emotional damage to myself playing this game, and it's truly been wonderful.",1675300877,1675300877,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If I were to give it a genre it would be a mix of crafting/2D platformer/virtual pet. You collect crafting materials and complete quests for the spirits you ferry. Then, once you've completed their quests, you take them to their final destination. Afterwards, you are reminded that they won't be with you for the rest of the game.
This game has you find crafting material, refine those crafting materials, and explore to find more crafting materials. The spirits that you ferry have foods that they like and dislike that you can find as your explore the game world. Each spirit gives you quests to fulfill, things that they want to experience.

I love how the lives of each individual character play into the world and the events. It was heartwarming and emotional to meet each spirit and really get to know them and understand the ties that connect them to Stella; from their favourite foods and hobbies to their fears and perceived failures in life and how she helps them navigate their final days and discover the meaning in it all. As the game progresses you see clearly how Stella impacted them, both in life and as she guides them to the Everdoor. Stella is such a kind and compassionate person, truly leading by example in what it means to love unconditionally and accept people for who they are, without judgement. I think Spiritfarer is the kind of game that gives you a lot to think about and reflect on, with a story that is deep and full of meaning, while simultaneously providing the elements of a cozy management game that are so appealing. I have nothing but good things to say about this game, take the leap and join Stella and Daffodil on your own journey. 


**ACHIEVEMENT HUNTING**
For those of you who want to 100% Spiritfarer: There is a point when you must make a choice with Astrid’s storyline, to tell her the truth or keep a secret. There is an achievement for both, and I chose truth in the first playthrough earning me the Loose Lips achievement. If you want both, you can start a second save and play until you get to this point again, and then choose to keep it a secret, thus earning the Tight Lips achievement. 

Alternatively, I have seen posts saying you can save before making the decision, choose one option and when the achievement pops, quit, and redo the selection to make the opposite choice and earn both in the same playthrough. I did not remember to try this, which resulted in a second save file speed running until I achieved Tight Lips.",1675198061,1675198061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, this game... isn't the best *game* out there. Its actual gameplay loop, while simplistic, is very grindy once things get going. I feel this can make or break your experience, depending on how patient you are with slow-burn games.

I also feel that its asking price is a little high for what it is. Not for what it represents, not for the work and love that clearly went into it, but for what it is. Would I still pay full price for it? Absolutely. But it's even more worth the purchase if you get it on sale.

Spiritfarer is a game that everyone needs at a certain point in their lives. It's a game I purchased a year ago, at least, and only picked it up and played recently, in the days following the one year mark after my best friend died. It is a story of grief, acceptance, and making peace with the life you've lived, even if it wasn't the one you wanted. It's about letting go, even if it hurts. And it does hurt. Letting go is the hardest thing to do, because we are clingy creatures by nature. Spiritfarer illustrates this and so much more in such a beautiful way.

This game will make you feel things. It will make you cry. And if you've experienced loss, it just might even help you, even if it's just a little. It definitely helped me.

And my god did it make me cry.

You play as Stella, a young girl tasked with escorting recently deceased spirits to their final goodbye, making them feel comfortable and finishing up any remaining tasks they have. The gameplay involves fetch quests, crafting, base building, and cooking/fishing minigames. 

The real appeal of Spiritfarer is in it's character interactions and themes. Every spirit you encounter is memorable and distinct, from the lovable and huggable Atul, to the pretentious and opulent Gustav.  You will grow to appreciate and care for these characters, and saying goodbye to them at the end of it all is akin to the final goodbye to an old friend.

Spiritfarer is an emotional and touching game on an intimate level that few ever truly reach. Its easy going and laid-back yet still addicting and encouraging to play. The music is somber, the artstyle is adorable, and the story is the epitome of ""bittersweet"". Plus you get a cute cat companion!

What stands out to me was the excellent writing of the characters, they felt real and personable. There is something comforting about seeing characters in the game that may remind you of a grandparent or friend who passed away. 
There is an overarching story, but the focus is How Stella's gets the individual spirits to open up to her.
 If you are here for game play, then there is tons to do. Lots of collecting, side quests and crafting. Each spirits brings their own mini game that you can play for resources. You can fish, mine and cook, basically you will never run out of things to do at any given time.
No cons for me, I personally did not come across and bugs or crashes.

I'd describe it as a side-scrolling stardew valley-esque game about dying.

You have your boat - which you can build structures on.  The boat can (and must) be upgraded - some upgrades make it bigger, some make it faster, some unlock new areas of the map.

You get spirits, which need to be fed, hugged, and pampered, and all have side-quests that need to be accomplished to move them along to their final rest.  The spirits are finite, and each have their own personalities/needs.  This is the stuff that moves the plot along.

Then there are the islands.  You can move the boat around the map and visit islands and explore (that's how you find the spirits).  Your character also gets a few upgrades throughout the plot, which allows for further exploration - such as the ability to double-jump or zipline.

Crafting is easy mode in this game - for the most part, resources double when processed (after some upgrades).  One linen fiber becomes 2-3 linen thread spool.  One linen thread spool becomes 2-3 linen sheets.  That's a refreshing grind reduction.

If I were to have one complaint about this game, it's that you can't get rid of livestock.  I made the mistake of collecting all the sheep (because I saw the achievement and went ""meh why not"").  Then I had to feed them.  Every.  Day.  Don't be like me.  You only need one.",1674835074,1674835074,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game. Finished it two times (before updates and after updates) and I will probably come back to it in a while.
The histories of all the characters Stella takes on the boat are captivating but written lightheartedly and compassionately. Spiritfarer despite being about death manages to be cozy and fun to play.  With every couple of hours, you get a new mechanic to discover and use, adding depth and a kinda metroidvania style.

-------------------------
I had a fun time with this game until the end game content.

First off its art direction was spot on beautiful. Very creative characters and art direction. I also really liked the music. The game play was simple and addictive with a hotel management element of building on your ship and making your guests happy.

Story was good especially after looking at lore afterwards on this game, the sad thing about this is that I just did not feel emotionally attached to many characters in this game and I have my reasons why.

So here comes the bad. First off the game itself became way too tedious to complete anything and a lot was expected from the player. I have a completionist attitude and I told myself, I could fully 100% complete this game. In the end it required a lot of attentive grinding and doing things in the perfect order to fully complete this game and honestly for a story driven game like this it did not work for me.

Instead of me just enjoying the story of the game I was stressing out trying to accomplish every quest in every nook and cranny and I was also trying to make this horrible dog spirit (cant even remember her name, HAPPY) to just find out that you had to have had another spirit on the boat to even accomplish that.

I also had an issue with the pacing where it felt kind of empty where you would just be wandering forever to just find out there is a spirit you can now get to on an island that you happen to pass by. I don't mind exploring but after the hours I put into it, I soon found it kind of tedious.

All in all I can understand its my own fault for not doing the order of spirits correctly, my ineptitude to find the next island to go to, and my own fault for not getting into the story. But being honest on my opinion in the end I was stressed and irritated when it should have been heart touching and meaningful. I think with better guidance and pacing with this game, it probably could have been a masterpiece.

I still recommend this game if you like story and hotel management vibes. (I disappointed myself with Expecting more heavy story drive like ""To the Moon"" and ""Finding Paradise"")",1674439154,1674439154,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spiritfarer is, at it´s core and heart, a humane game and experience, which peacefully deals with the matters of death and regret. Whatsmore, Spiritfarer tries heartfully to show the beauty of death, trapping you in a story full of love, friendship and mystery. 
The game takes you through an emotional and adventurous journey, finding spirits, helping them, building your boat, collecting resources, exploring this rich world with Stella. Additionally, what also fascinated me were the smallest details in animations, either when Stella collected the plants or when she grabbed the food from the oven for example, to all the hugs we give to each spirit. 
The main topics and the richness of details is not the only thing which deserve to get attention, but also the emotional and compelling songs of MAX LL. The OST makes you always emotional and at peace, and Max should always be proud of himself for making an incredible album. 
In the end, I heartfully appreciate to all the people who made this game, its not just a game, but its a human work of art, bringining out all kinds of emotions. Not only that, but Spiritfarer also manages to create a beautiful human experience through the story puzzle of Stella, which brings you to a shock once you find out the truth about her and the game. 
Finally, this game deserves every piece of love it offers. It is a game about death, loss and grief, but it´s also about love, friendships and forgiveness. Please, give all the love to this game and the people who made it, it deserves it!",1674425712,1674425712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After handling a bunch of requests for many characters, I was already sick of watching Stella’s animations for getting food out of the oven and watering plants, tired of the moments I had nothing to do besides fishing while on my way to places. Honestly, I was not having the best time and was ready to call it a day.
Then in my usual routine, I gave Alice, the grandma of the group, a nice apple pie. For some reason, her earnest reaction as she ate it gave a little smile satisfaction.
Next thing I knew, it was 3 am.

Spiritfarer is half a simple but prolonged management game which respectfully uses emotional attachment to create a layer of engagement seldom seen.

It honestly does get very tedious to get progress, as beautiful the animation is and enjoyable most of the cast is to interact with, there is no guarantee you’ll enjoy all of it.
And for a game clearly aimed at young audiences, it certainly could use some more helpful guidance to avoid any occasional confusion.
But I cracked a genuine smile at a hedgehog eating her dinner in glee after grinding the fruit, preparing it and serving.

If that doesn't tell you the strength in effectively building a bond with the characters and communicating its themes with maturity and subtlety, I don't know what to tell you.

I love cozy games and this takes the cake for expressive, interactive, and longevity out of a lot of games that I've played. I wanted to play the game because I heard it was emotional and that the souls/characters that you bond with will pull your heartstrings and those are all so true. Even Giovanni (who is a jerk) I felt empathy for the first time towards him when I was sending him off at the end. It's also nice that they add new characters to pick up every couple of months, so the journey doesn't end after 8 arcs.

The one thing that I wasn't expecting because none of the reviews or things that I read explained how much of a GRIND GAME this is. You have to mine, harvest, and collect so many items which is what you're doing 85% of the time. Of course, you're getting those items to progress the plot and to send the souls off, but it's a lot! I do appreciate that the plot builds on top of each other and you aren't doing things randomly, but yeah so much grinding. It's also a bit of strategy to plan which stops you have to make and where they are in relation to the map and what items you need or what tasks can be completed along the way.

Overall this is a fantastic game and the storytelling, plot, and graphics are PHENOMENAL. If you like cozy games you will LOVE this! If you're tired of grind games like Animal Crossing and Stardew then you might want to hold off starting this. I've played for almost 40 hours and I'm not even 45% completed with the game.

As for game play - 
If you are upset about getting quests that you can't do - That is because you aren't ready for that quest. It isn't a broken game, you are meant to travel around and do things. You will eventually unlock the areas you are trying to get to. So the game is not broken - it is pushing you to do the other tasks you have, and explore. Talk to people. All of the people. 

If you are upset about running around - That is what the game is. Travel around, collect items, complete tasks, help people. You are going to circle the map dozens of times. Travel becomes faster as you progress. It is, by it's very nature, a fetch quest game. You are told as such when it starts. If you don't like those kinds of games, this isn't for you.

I now must go clean it again because this game is so damn masterfully written that it has pulled out my heartstrings and now owns a small chunk of my soul. I would write a longer review about how fun the inventory management aspect is or how it was actually enjoyable to 100% not only all of the collections but the game as well, or I could even praise the graphics being so beautiful and just everything about this game being phenomenal but no words I could say can emphasize just how much I enjoyed this game.

Spiritfarer came to me when I needed it most. I was just about to get married, and my mother-in-law-to-be was on the tail end of her battle with stage 4 cancer. I myself had severe death anxiety at the time, too. If you’ve played this, you’ll know which character was the hardest for us. 

This game rides a delicate balance of being a phenomenally cozy game, while also touching on the ever touchy subject of grief in the most comforting way possible. When it’s time for a character to go, you try with all your might to avoid it, but there’s a certain point where you know in your heart that it needs to be done. 

The more this game sits with me, the more in love with it I become. I find comfort in the thought that Spiritfarer will be there waiting for me when I need it most. 

I anxiously await for when my wife is ready to play again, but I’m giving her all the time she needs. 

10/10.

Story: about how different people face death? Clutching for control in their last moments, or gracefully letting go while still in full possession of their wits... It was riveting, at times touching, and at others sobering.

Music: every zone and character has their own theme. Each of these themes support their character's story quite well. My personal favourite is Astrid's and Dahlia's. A lot of effort went into the sound design and it can be clearly felt. My only complaint is the troll option to turn off the music at the bus stops... (spoiler it doesn't work the way you would imagine.)

Art: a 2D sidescroller, but oh so gorgeous. I'm not sure how thematic the art for each zone was considering they're linked to real life places like Japan, but independent of references, the art was very easy on the eyes. Hated the hat, though, but oh well.

Gameplay: certain parts of the progression were awkward. I knew I was missing components for upgrades to progress, but could not find the components. Eventually I went online and figured that I had forgotten to talk to one of my boat inhabitants... When most of the quest cues are given by a big exclamation mark, the lack of cues on some of them is unexpected and a huge hindrance. If we ignore that, then the game progression is pretty decently paced. It starts out a little slow, but you need to figure your way around anyway. Eventually you find that there is not a moment during which you run out of things to do, but you can also choose not to do anything and still somewhat progress. That's a nice balance which hugely contributes to the relaxed atmosphere. While most mechanics are well designed, the one thing that annoys me is not being able to quickly select a large amount of one item. You have to press the key 50 times for 50 linen.

Overall: thoroughly enjoyed the game. Breathtaking art and music, an emotional story that helps you better understand yourself and the people around you, and decent mechanics.",1673637369,1673637369,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unless you are extremely against some of these, I believe Spiritfarer is a good game, for you! A game that you can take your time to connect with it's own residents, improving your character, while getting curious about your surroundings. After you pass your initial confusion, the game will slowly pull you in by making you do some semi-repetitive tasks (ok some are pretty repetitive) that will make you learn more and more about the characters, connect to them, make them happy, sometimes sad, but for you, it will definitely be sad. I have been pretty stoic these days, and while some of the initial ones that made me feel slightly sad, I did not feel like it was going to be that bad. Closer to the ending though... It was like someone was squeezing my heart.

Now putting the story element aside (which should be the determining factor of why you should get this) I will nit-pick at smaller things. 

I have a tendency to farm and and nit-pick when I am playing casual games sometimes. Spriritfarer was one of those. There were sometimes that felt like things were:

1: A little too repetitive. In some cases, I felt like they did not get accurately level with where you were supposed to be. 
2: A bit lost. Whenever I was sure at the correct time and place to upgrade something, I wasn't I had to go back and trace what I had to do. Sometimes these felt a bit tedious. 

Last problem is achievements. There are 2 achievements in the game that I personally did not like:
1: An achievement which makes you choose an option. Each option has it's own achievement and you have to play the game OVER from the start to be able to actually get both.
2: An achievement for making the residents happy. While there are some residents that are hard to deal with, you can't do anything about the residents that you already were done with. You'd also have to start over to get to that particular resident and make them happy. This is particularly annoying if your resident is a late game character (which mine was)

And no manual saving. You can copy your current states save files somewhere else and load them. But you can't do it in game. Frustrating.

BUT, I will say that this game is still worth it. These are extreme nitpicks. The game flow, the characters, stories feel good and has a good flow regardless, the art and atmosphere, music is great. The characters that were added in the update is AMAZING. It is very lovely. 

Good luck! With your feelings I mean.",1673454596,1673454596,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Can't believe I actually thought maaaaaaybe I wouldn't be into this game. I've put off purchasing this for SO LONG. 

I've been absolutely hooked since the opening scene. From the deep and meaningful dialogue, to the dad jokes. The calming ambient music to the downright goofy seal's theme song. I've even been talking to every single character in the game just to read the dialogue even though it isn't necessary for the main story - there's just so much life and humor in everything, it's worth the time. 

All that being said, a large chunk of time is spent on the actual boat taking care of the spirits, growing crops, cooking up meals, building and upgrading all the spirits' homes, and collecting sheep now I guess? It's a very satisfying and rewarding game loop, and I thoroughly enjoy building, upgrading, and arranging everything I've built in the most satisfying way I am able for efficiency and just getting around easier.

Spiritfarer is a really wholesome game about caring for your spiritual animal friends, helping them with their final requests before they pass on to the afterlife. It’s a bit like Animal Crossing Terraria, both games I enjoy and also Stardew Valley (which I’m yet to play). You follow a cute little story, you build your own boat and you get to place your building and houses wherever you like with an upgrade system. Exploring a map filled with many different places to visit and new characters to meet along the way!

As someone who likes wholesome games and a cute cartoon style, this game is perfect for me! I was nervous about controls, it looked like there was a lot to learn, but surprisingly, the controls were really easy to pick up!

I bought this game to help me cope with the process of grieving, I didn’t know a couple of months after buying it I would lose my pet rabbit. I was absolutely heartbroken, I grew up with him through my teenage years and to lose him; I felt so lost and lonely. I knew what I had to do, I picked up this game and started to play; games are distracting for me so it took my mind off while I was caring for my spiritual friends, and when it was time to say goodbye to my first character, I sobbed on stream! Playing the game has been an absolute comfort for me! I have yet to finish the game as well, I can’t wait to see what else is in store.

Of course, grief affects everyone in different ways, for me, I even get sad over fictional characters passing (I’m very attached to fiction XD) so every time a character departs, I’m shedding a tear or bawling my tears into a pillow, but I’m grateful the game makes me feel, it’s nice and also comforting to let it out!

This game may not be for everyone, but if you’re someone like me who thinks too much about losing someone, this game might be nice to play when you’re feeling down or just need some comfort in your life!

Thank you for reading! Happy sailing! ⭐

The game was also very glitchy and it had a game breaking bug that didnt allow me to progress without restarting the game. The art style and music is amazing though and is very beautiful and is very inspired by one of my favourite movies Spirited away.

Maybe I'll come back and change my review but from what I gathered from other reviews, the beginning was the best part anyways. On sale I could recommend this game, but not at full price.

I struggled for a long time deciding whether I would recommend this game. There is a lot of good to be found here. The OST is amazing. The art is great and there's some beautiful animation. I like the characters  and while there is definitely some resource grind, I haven't found it a huge problem. But there are huge glaring weaknesses that weigh this game down and even worse, the weaknesses are in what should be this game's strongest points.

In the game, you play as Stella, a young girl who takes over the role of Spiritfarer from Charon. Your job is to find lost spirits and fulfil their last requests before taking them to the Everdoor to move on. The game is billed as a management game, but the premise suggests this should really be a character-based game. However, after completing two of the characters' stories, I understand why it isn't advertised that way. As I said before, I like the characters, but their stories are without doubt the weakest part of Spiritfarer.

Part of my issue with this game may be the expectations I had. When Charon told me I would be fulfilling last requests, I expected I would be helping spirits with unfinished business, helping them reach peace with themselves before passing on. Instead my experience has been the opposite. The troubled spirit gets on the boat, gives you some quests and vague information about their backstory, then goes through the Everdoor just as troubled if not even more troubled than before. It's sad. It's unfulfilling and I get that's how life is sometimes, but it sucks - especially since I liked those characters - and saps your motivation to continue. I've actually [i]stopped[/i] progressing the quest of my favourite character because I feel like he isn't going to get a fulfilling ending either.

A large part of why these character stories feel so incomplete is the storytelling. [b]MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD[/b]. This probably won't come as a surprise, but Stella personally knows some of the spirits she encounters. This [i]should[/i] give their stories more emotional nuance. It actually wrecks them in a way. You see, Stella and the spirit know each other already and they speak as such [b]without any understanding that the PLAYER does not.[/b]  Key parts of their stories are referred to only in vague references or are left unexplained. It is so easy to misinterpret what's going on, especially since there is no option to review old dialogue. For example, I could not tell whether [spoiler]Gwen[/spoiler] was a friend of Stella who referred to her parents as 'Mum' and 'Dad', or whether she was literally Stella's sister. In fact, I came out with the wrong conclusion and only learnt otherwise from information I found outside of the game. Likewise, there is literally no hint in the game that the dragon Summer refers to is [spoiler]the cancer she is dying from.[/spoiler] You feel stupid or like you made a wrong decision somewhere when you reach the end of these vague stories and you don't know basic facts like what is the character so bothered by or who they are to Stella.

I started this game primed to like it. I [i]wanted[/i] to like it. I really, really did. Maybe I'll still finish this game to see where it goes, but my enthusiasm for it is gone.",1673123247,1673123247,False,3,0,0.506783127784729004,2,True,False,False

***Even though I'm going to ultimately give this game a thumbs down, I think if the general idea is appealing to you, it's probably worth a play & to support the developer.  I think if they keep improving, their next game should be wonderful.***

It's difficult for me to write an honest review of this because the game is so charming and pleasant... but it ultimately doesn't make up for the shortcomings.  It's also hard to start because there are so many ideas slapped on to the game.  Is it a base management sim?  Is it a story-driven RPG?  Is it an oldschool adventure game?  Is it a tight platformer with Metroidvania flair?

The answer is yes to all of those and unfortunately, because it is juggling so many balls, it winds up doing nothing well.  I could (and am itching to) pick each of those apart, but ultimately I don't think it would have mattered how many ideas were tacked on IF the core gameplay loop was enjoyable and the game accomplished what it sets out to do.

The basic loop for this game is to pick up a lost soul, upgrade your ship to accommodate their needs, do fetch quests to complete their quest line, then carry them to the gate to send them to the afterlife.  Doing so will usually unlock the ability to process newer materials, build new base buildings, and upgrade your ship.  That allows you to explore more areas to find more passengers to repeat the loop.

It plays fine.  But it is boring.  There aren't a lot of DECISIONS that result in novel gameplay.  The progress through the game is linear.  ""Complete"" 3 passengers to unlock a boat upgrade to find new materials and new passengers to ""complete"" 5 passengers to repeat.  There's not a real impact on who you pick up, how you treat them, what you do/don't build, how/where you place it... it's busy work.  There's no critical choice and there's not threat of failure.  There are simply no stakes.

I understand that a lot of big, loved, successful ""base management"" games follow this same general outline... but it is a mindless, boring loop that the genre desperately needs novel innovation to feel engaging.  I THINK that the answer this game has for the issue is ""stack 100 systems on top of it"" (like mentioned earlier) and that the story & feels would make up for it.

The IDEA of the story is great.  You inherit the grim reaper's job--herding lost souls from purgatory to the beyond.  Having you help each soul confront their death and helping you confront death along with them.  The setting is pretty interesting as well... drawing on Greek mythology and taking place in a mysterious unnamed in-between world (Acheron?).  In execution, though, everything is so nebulous that nothing connects with you.

Aside from the handful of spirits you ferry to the other side, every NPC in the game is just an identical robed entity, indistinguishable from any other.  Even though you are intended to interact with these carbon copy NPCs, they wind up having little to no personality, are completely forgettable, and leave you with the feeling you get similar to being alone in a crowded room.

I genuinely lost steam trying to sum this up, but the named NPCs you find just nail you with walls of dialogue that have vague references to people and places you have no connection to.  They give you one of two types of quests, either craft something for them, or fetch something for them.  There's not much more to it and eventually you take them to the ""everdoor"" and send them on their way.

It's supposed to choke you up and make you feel a connection to the characters but with how obtuse and vague everything is, you really don't connect with much.

Unfortunately for all the praise this game has received, almost every aspect of the game you can compliment winds up falling flat over time or is under-utilized culminating in a hollow ending that leaves you with nothing.",1673066791,1673066791,False,2,0,0.450973689556121826,0,True,False,False

I got this game just a few days ago but since them have been binging it like hell. 
The animation and art is so adorable, the writing is amazing and geniuenly has me in tears at times. It also offers a great sense of exploration and with taking care of your rescources you always have something to do and new things to discover.

My only critique points would be small things to tweak and enhance the experience. I haven't finished the game, so if any of my arguments are fixed in later gameplay, just ignore them.

- Playing the guitar and hearing other characters making music as well is great. I just wished that there were more songs available (the plant-grow melody gets repetitive and annoying very quickly) and that you would be able to join into other characters playing with your songs actually syncronizing.

- Sometimes character dialogues and certain events play out even after you already progressed beyond it's triggers. Eg. characters wishing for a house improvement that you have already implemented. Generally the game seems to have an underlying idea of how you should progress, which I wasn't able to meet in my play through. I feel like having a code check for what has happend and what hasn't or locking blueprints until they are requested could be a fix to this.

- Not sure if this is a glitch or not but mushrooms take a longer time than any other item to be picked up after dropping, which means I often run past them and have to go back to pick them up. 

- I kind of wish there was a way to ""enjoy the view"" and relax when travelling on the boat. Like the camera panning out a bit when standing at the tip or being able to sit down there. 

- The animation of preparing for wood chopping feels just a little bit too long.


All that being said, I still greatly recommend this game. Here's some nice details that stood out to me:
+ Some of the animations are insanly good and feel super satisfying, especially the protags run cycle and the casting of the fishing line.
+ You can hug your cat and any character on your boat. Hell yea.
+ The Tanuki Shopkeeper doing a happy bounce when you buy stuff from them.
+ The bus seal's music hits just the spot between hilarious and fun and obnixous. It even offers an option to make him shut up, though I didn't have the heart to do it </3 
+ Sliding and jumping around on sloped roofs is SO MUCH fun!!

Unique gameplay, great story. Relaxing, pleasant, and melancholy.

9.5/10

This game is not for everyone, but if you've watched the trailers and you're here reading reviews I suspect you'll love it.

Good:
+ Amazing visuals and audio. It's a cartoon-styled game so don't expect 4k gaming, but you'll get some artful scenery and beautiful moments. The music for each area and character are quite fitting.

+ The overarching story reveals itself as the game progresses and you meet more characters. Each character fits into the overall narrative nicely. The characters are also unique in different ways. They behave slightly differently with regards to the game mechanics, especially towards the end.

+ There are small details that make the game more memorable. These details include subtle background cues, changes in scenery, funny dialogs, and much more.

+ The travel system in the game is pretty well designed, making the world feel vast but not tedious. The game nudges you in a sensible direction and the progression flows well.

+ The resource management is balanced and not too grindy. The game gives you ways to get certain resources more quickly if you need to.

+ The collection aspect of the game, particularly the cooking, can be pretty fun.

Neutral Suggestions:
- More customization for ship building would be amazing, such as color scheme and a handful of alternate building layouts to choose from. One or two of the oddly shaped buildings irked me. The position that the ladder generates on the building can be less than ideal too. The layout and ladder position is mostly cosmetic but can actually affect gameplay when you're trying to jump around your ship during an event.

- Animations for certain actions like failing mining would be better if it were skippable.",1672921436,1672921695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]**Spoiler free**[/i]

[u]Quick Review:[/u] Beautiful. Sweet. Special. A must play. I might summarize it as a tonic for the soul. Even though the pacing can be a bit dragged out at times, I still say that the theme and artistic quality outshines any shortcomings. I cannot recommend Spiritfarer enough.

Once in a while you play a game that is more than just a game. Spiritfarer is that life experience. It has a profound and powerful message to tell. I have never played a game like it. Easily the best game I played in 2022. It’s a shining example of a game transcending it’s medium to speak to you as a human being.


[u]Gameplay:[/u] Spiritfarer is a much more robust game than I anticipated. Due to the art style and topic of focus, I thought it would be a short but poignant story. I was maybe expecting a few hours of gameplay. Turns out I was very wrong.

It’s much more of a cozy management game than I anticipated. It’s also got an open world element with exploration, base customization, upgrades, side quests, and mini games. I completed the main story in about 30 hours, but put in about 44 hours to see all the content. You get all the DLC in the Farewell Edition.

The gameplay revolves around taking care of spirits on your boat as you help them tie up their loose ends in their life. You’ll have to monitor their mood, feed them food they enjoy, improve their houses, and complete their requests. This will lead you around an open map as you uncover new islands to explore and find resources. You’ll need resources to construct new buildings and improvements.

The management side of things comes from keeping all of your workstations producing the required items. It could be cooking food, fishing, growing plants, smelting, etc. A lot of these workstations use mini games to produce anything, turning these into activities rather than just a collecting spree. If you complete the mini games perfectly, you get more efficient resources. But if you can’t get the timing right, don’t worry -- You still get a base amount of resources. I think this is a very accessible and friendly gameplay solution to keep the spirit of this game wholesome.

While the depth of content was a welcome surprise, I do think it comes at a slight cost. Due to the open nature of the gameplay, the focus of the story loses a bit of steam. It also doesn’t help that, often, the story progression is halted by a missing resource you don’t know where to find. My advise is to look up where to find missing items on the forums. Usually, I stay away from that so as not to spoil anything, but I think it’s worth it in this case to keep the experience moving forward.


[u]User Interface:[/u] The User Interface was a standard and useful experience that blended with the art style well. Menus stuck to the Everlight color scheme, and interactive objects light up with a helpful silhouette. Key bindings are all configurable. When I first stared the game, there were some visual bugs with the UI; for some reason the game thought I had an Xbox controller plugged in. It eventually sorted itself out.


[u]Atmosphere:[/u] Masterful! The theme, art, music, sound, animation, all of it! Inspiring quality!

The colorful 2D art style is very charming. But what really sells the quality is the animation. The game looks more like a 2D animated cartoon or anime rather than a video game. There is real care for the frames of movement that are a joy to behold. The posing is also very strong. Every character has a unique design and personality, and they are all punctuated by strong poses. Beautiful work!

The sound design is pretty good too. Even though the game is a 2D experience, the sounds seem to really support the game as an expressive world. From seagulls chirping, to the boat cutting through water, to plucking vegetables, everything feels appropriately expressive. Strong sound design!

The music is on another level! I already bought the soundtrack. I cannot convey enough how much the music adds to the beauty of this game. The moving and atmospheric pieces really add to the theme. But the quirkier pieces also add an individuality, not only to each character, but to the game as a whole. Fantastic music!

Theme: The theme is about palliative care, and if my review has not made it clear already, it is handled with a quality and sensitivity that is inspiring.

Inevitably, the spirits you care for will eventually be ready to pass on. And this can be sad, because each spirit feels like a true individual.

The first time someone in my care passed away, I felt the loss. It really felt like this spirit had left. I felt like someone I knew was gone. If you’ve ever experienced loss in your life, you may be reminded of that time. I thought of my grandmother who passed away, and experienced a little bit of that loss anew. And I’m grateful for that reminder because it’s a healthy sadness. It’s a sadness that comes from love. This game handles this topic beautifully, and I think could even be used to help process this rarely discussed topic.

And perhaps that’s this game’s greatest strength of all: its theme about letting go of those you love, and giving you a space to explore those feelings with such care. At least in America, death and loss are not things we really process as a community. It’s almost a taboo subject no one wants to hear about. This game is an invitation to think about it a little, and to gain a little more comfort in dealing with those issues.

I can only speak as someone who has experienced loss, but I imagine having gone through some deepens the experience the game offers.

This is the kind of game you’ll take with you after you’ve finished it because it leaves an impact. I’ll remember it as that reserved space that so eloquently nurtures that pang in your heart as you let someone go, and the meaningful privilege of helping them pass on from this life.


[u]Conclusion:[/u] Beautiful. Sweet. Masterful. And deeply Human. A must play. The best game I played in 2022. It’s a privilege to recommend Spiritfarer.

What an emotional masterpiece. This game will make you reflect on death as you take care of the spirits living aboard your boat by talking to them, feeding them, hugging them and fulfilling their last requests before they move towards the afterlife.
The soundtrack is calming and cozy, the graphics are simple but pretty. As a 2D game, it is played as a platformer. You will get to explore a fairly large map, build and upgrade buildings that allow you to plant, smith, cook, mill and more.
Do yourself a favor and get this game, fall in love with the passengers, and cry.

Oh where do I begin with this game... I loved this game so much I could not put it down, there's so many things to love.

I found Spiritfarer to be such a wonderful and unique experience encompassing various genres. It's a story-driven platformer with resource management qualities akin to Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. The game also harbors exploration of the sea filling up a large map that brought back memories of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild.

The game has gorgeous art, an amazing soundtrack and has captivating story that truly draws you in.

In this game you play as Stella a girl who has taken the mantle of Spiritfarer for Charon, the ferryman for Hades known for his popular depictions in Greek Mythology. 

Given the story, you are explore and to collect the spirits of the dead, learning their life stories and helping them pass on.

In your journey you'll find yourself crafting, fishing, gardening, and cooking as you upgrade your ship and travel across the various islands in the afterlife. You will also helping those you come across in various ways to come to terms with themselves in this purgatorial world.

It's funny how the game has such a way of getting you attached to various buildings and stations. Stations that allow you to progress, feed others and upgrade your ship. 

As stories are told from various spirits of past, you'll obtain the schematics to these buildings in relation to former memories. For that moment of a young woman in the war who was a forger will provide you with a foundry and with your association with it... It will not just be any foundry for it will be HER foundry. 

It's bittersweet that the spirits that provide you with the duty to create these stations will eventually pass on. The buildings remain and your memories of them will remain along with their quarters, the ship becoming more full but leaving fond memories of these individuals but also leaving an empty shell of their presence.

What I love about Spiritfarer is it's positive outlook on death. Most games will have you avoid death, it's a negative thing. It's often seen as a mark of failure or a reminder of you are not quite ready for the challenges ahead. 

On the other hand, Spiiritfarer uses death as an objective, its the defining goal in what you'll be striving for. It's a game with a romanticized view of death in which I found to be quite unique and not something we really see in media today. And it truly communicates the positive aspects of death. 

It does so in it's world, it's characters and it's wonderfully crafted story that will leave you breath-taken. 

Spiritfarer is in essence a chance to give the concept of death a warm embrace, to accept it as necessary and essential to the overall process of existence.

Is it something I'm going to recommend to others? Probably not.

There's just too many issues with the game and how it functions. For starters, I've had to look up guides frequently because while there are prompts in the game, the game can sometimes assume you're further along than you actually are and not be helpful (like I was getting instructions to go places I physically could not go, since I did not have a rockbreaker yet). I'd also like the game to add an option to turn on coordinates for every thing and place you're told to go to in the ship's navigation map (this would just make getting around easier). 

I also recently got stuck in a situation where I had to quit the game and restart it because I did not have an ability (the bounce ability) that the game expected me to have yet, but I also was allowed to access this location (I'd appreciate if things were clearer, like maybe have the thing you've done for one of the mines - I forget what it's called but it has a character stop the player and check for abilities under the guise of 'employing you' - done for everywhere that you need an ability to navigate the place, or have onscreen text tell the player that they need an ability before navigating as a reminder).

I absolutely enjoy the game as an alternative to me playing Stardew Valley all the time, but doing certain things in the game can also feel annoying at times (like I am genuinely not invested in any of the characters despite playing this game for over 10 hours, I honestly don't care about the side quests, and the mechanic for feeding your guests is annoying - like I dislike how the majority of them are extremely picky eaters and refuse to eat the same thing twice because I constantly will forget what I last fed them).",1672584547,1672584547,False,3,0,0.527651309967041016,0,True,False,False

However, the game just has waay too much bloat for my taste. 2/3rds of resources (or even more), in my opinion, have no right to exist, and their existence makes the game like 50% boring and 50% fun bc you have to spend so much time gathering them. Other things that should not exist in my opinon, is the fast travel (the map is not THAT big to have a right to include fast travel) and turtle farms (which feel like lazy resource hacks). Mini events also souldnt have glim rewards. 

All in all, the game should seriously tune down res gathering and processing and increase exploration to make the gameplay compact and consistently fun. Because I too often found myself bored on board.",1672430973,1672430973,False,5,0,0.575438618659973145,0,True,False,False

Reality: a slice of life game which is peaceful, soothing, and laid-back.

The narrative of this game can be basically summarized as 'normal' and nothing more: normal people doing normal events resulting in normal consequences and eventually dies in a normal way. The start is very slow and it doesn't really speed up later on. Is it a good game? I honestly don't know. However, it is indeed a breath of fresh air when almost all popular games emphasis on epic journey.

Gameplay-wise, every system is pretty solid and has some depth to it. There is this minor bug which make your character stuck while doing certain tasks and it can get really annoying overtime.

The co-op experience is great except that the cat cannot talk with npc--makes sense but kinda detrimental to the engagement of the cat player. 

For 10 bucks, it is a decent chill game to play with the partner of your choice.

Make sure you like management style games however, as there's a LOT of resource/inventory/economy stuff going on to make everything work!
The open world format was awesome, with some light Metroidvania mechanics guarding progression into mid- and late-game areas.  I really enjoyed the dynamism and sense of adventure / unpredictability the open world format provided.
The characters, dialogue were top-notch. I truly got attached to some of the characters. The sound design is excellent; I have to shout out the ambient music which is absolutely FLAWLESS and added perfectly to the ambiance.

But it goes so much deeper, the empathy and skill in which it deals with the tricky subjects around end of life grabbed me and caused me to actually care about the lives of the characters I met. And then you have to let them go, while memories of them are left behind. 
And as the end draws near... I wouldn't describe myself as emotional, but there was a point when I was gripped with an ""I don't want to go, I have things I still want to do"" moment. And in the final scene I had tears in my eyes.

Truly an experience! The perfect game to unwind after a long day and has a soundtrack similar to breath of the wild. Its visually stunning with a unique art style. Its extremely relaxing, but even when you are waiting to get to the next island, there is always something to do. This leaves little to no downtime in between islands.

As an adult that type of thing didn't happen nowhere near as much. With that said, Spiritfarer has been THE MOST IMPACTFUL GAME OF MY LIFE. 

   Almost everyone has had some sort of death in their family at some point. I'm no different. My father passed away very suddenly and unexpectedly over a decade prior to me playing this game. I never fully processed that event or came to terms with it. Upon finishing this game, I actually feel I have now processed that event; and furthermore I feel at peace with it. 

   This game is not without flaws. It's characters are full of flaws in many ways. I've read reviews where people complain about how a few characters are unlikeable. I feel that's the point. None of us are perfect, and I think this game thoughtfully reflected that. 

   I enjoyed the gameplay, the story, the characters, and the total experience like I never have in a video game before. At times I cried, other times I was upset or angry. It drew emotions out of me that needed release, as I'm typically a person who does not get upset. 

   When I finished the story (no spoilers) at first I felt surprised and angry, but after a few moments of reflection, I actually agreed with how things happened. I thought it was a mirror of life, and how it sometimes ends. 

   As of this writing, Spiritfarer is my favorite game of all time, and one of the best overall experiences I have ever had. 

   When my time comes, I hope that someone is there to bring me to the Everdoor.",1672119306,1672119306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Writing this review truly tears me apart. Spirit farer is without a doubt, a incredible, high quality game. It is notorious the amount of time and passion the team from Thunder Lotus put into this game. The various and particular animations to every characters; the well though out character design; the sauve, calm and beutifully structured sound track; and, of course, the heart warming story it is trying to tell.
If you're interested in Spiritfarer because of it's story and presentation, you're bound to have a great time. But if you're looking after a game that is always trying to one up on its game mechanics, this game is not it. My biggest, if not only, problem with spiritfarer is the repetetive activities you do durout the day. Your daily activities boils down to mini games, that most of the time requires [b] no skill whatsoever [/b]. While playing through the game, i would 99% of the time find myself doing simple enought tasks that ask you to press a button over and over again. You are always in constant movement, mini games here and there, collect (or farm) a certain item to do this and that, or travell to a specific place to advance the plot. My expirence with Spiritfarer was not the smoothest. [b] Regardless the presence of some small bumps in the road, your dound to a great ride.

Enough reasons have already been given here to suggest that this is a game with good ideas. However, here are two negative points that prevent an absolutely clear recommendation:

1. Reaching milestones - for example, to be able to advance to a new area - is sometimes very tedious. 

2. A similar problem occurs in the last third of the game. You wait forever for a letter to arrive. The rat's pager  just doesn't want to ring, i.e. the progress of the story stalls. As a result, one sails back and forth forever, hoping that anything will happen - well... you have to sail some time.

According to the global achievements, Over 60% of players stop playing after the first chapter, and only 15% finish the game regardless of a not challenging game. The game play is very repeatable and empty(or boring).

The story is more like mystery than heartwarming. As you meet the spirits you uncover the truth why you and spirits are there. It's not like you gonna make them happy to release them, sometimes what you gonna do leads a sad ending, and some stories contain loneliness and depression, so I wouldn't recommend this game if you want only relaxing vibes.

The game progress is pretty linear, like in some area you have to meet the certain number of spirits or meet the specific spirit to go to the next area, until you find them you have to back and forth in the area. The each movement by the ship should take around 5 minutes, and while doing that, you can contact spirits or farm materials. However most materials are used for the game progress so once you farm enough materials, there will be no job for you until the destination reached. You'll face that situation so many times especially in the later game. My play time is 30 hours in total, but I did nothing at least in 5 hours.

Unfriendly UI. There is bunch of cities in the map but you can't search the name of the city instead you have to click the city icon to show the name if it's correct. Sometimes the mission page isn't updated even after you find the next location from the conversion, so you have to visit every location or google if you forget.

If you still interested in this game, I recommend you playing the demo. You can farm materials or build houses while travel, but try to do nothing instead, then imagine you're going to do a hundred times more in the full version of the game. If you still felt relaxing then you wouldn't regret this game.",1671886181,1671886388,False,4,1,0.482866048812866211,0,True,False,False

While playing the game I was in an abusive relationship and, subsequently, recovering from an abusive relationship. During this difficult time Spiritfarer allowed me to escape to a world where I was able to love and help people, even though I knew they were storybook characters made of code. The game's rich thematic topics and intricate cast occupied my mind constantly, giving me a new perspective on the problems I was facing in reality and stimulating reflection on what I could do to solve them (and, what I could not). 

Even more importantly, Spiritfarer helped me find myself again at a time when forces in my life were causing me to lose hope I ever would. I realized that I'm a Stella, and that like Stella I had to be the person I wanted to be, and find or create the love around me, regardless of bleak circumstances or what others would have me be. Like Stella, I can't fix everyone's problems, but I can guide them on their journey and give them the help they need. And I can remember them. 

That out of the way, Spiritfarer is the kind of beautiful tapestry I've come to expect from the lesser known muses of the gaming world. It has gorgeous hand-drawn art and animations, an orchestral OST with many cinematic motifs, and a lovingly-crafted story full of fresh ideas and sophisticated commentary. Often gameplay is the most difficult thing to maintain balance with when focusing on a narrative, but Spiritfarer has just enough bells and whistles to tinker with to feel like a game rather than a book- most of the time. There is a slight lack of polish in some areas, as a few major bugs slipped through through and required workarounds during my playthrough. A few visual glitches caused minor animation issues, and certain interfaces like the construction screen felt clunky to configure at times. None of these weighed enough to seriously upset me.

Spiritfarer is story-rich game about guiding spirits [spoiler](and eventually yourself)[/spoiler] to the afterlife. In order to do this, you complete small tasks for them throughout different islands until their time is done. 

Emotionally? I am destroyed. Every spirit has a personality that I grew fond of. Seeing each of their departures made me realize how little time people have. It's a reality everyone has to face, and this game does it wonderfully. Some spirits may rub you the wrong way, but it still stings a bit when you have to let them go. While the ending is a bit simple, the emotional aspect to it really hit me hard (I was in tears).

For the gameplay, the tasks are quite simple. You gather resources in order to expand and upgrade your boat in order to fit/build more facilities and discover new regions. It gets a bit tedious at times, but collecting items is what I personally enjoy. The game also offers rewards for discovering all there is (recipes, fish, material, and gems) in the form of outfits that you can personalize your character and other small rewards. 

The artwork is also stunning. I can tell the team behind this game really put their hearts into it. <3 

Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story-filled game. There's not much action (aside from the small minigames that are played to earn resources), but there is a lot to discover. I believe I got this game when it was on-sale and got hours of content :) I put about 40 hours into finishing the game 100% (with a bit more in order to finish off the achievements), and my time was well-spent.

I can't only fish, replant and cook so many times as I jump from island, to island, to island, to island... 
The game guides you for a few things but then you need to get a specific item and get no hints. I explored 5+ areas before I resorted to going to the wiki to find it.

To send Alice to the everdoor, you'll probably have to:

Talk to her in the beach outfit
Talk to her in the default outfit
Talk to her in the beach outfit and red hat

Other than that bug, the game seems fine, though it is a bit heavy on the management for my taste. You will have to keep juggling with the materials (producing and processing), foods, and spirit's hunger all the time. If you could automate some of the processes, I would enjoy the game way more than I do now.

Also, towards the end stuff feels a bit rushed, as there isn't much to do other than waiting for the last 4-8 hours. Many of the later spirits have very short stories and disappear soon after being introduced.

It's definitely something that will hang in my mind for years to come, as the subject matter had a strong impact on me. Those who have experienced the death of someone dear to them may have a similar response.

In general, the characters are very charming, with fleshed-out motivations and philosophies. An aspect that I really liked was that there was a lot of moral and ethical variety in these characters - this emphasises that we are all equal in death, and that a 'bad' person's choices don't just exist in a vacuum. 

[spoiler]A negative is that the endgame content got quite tedious. After most of the characters were taken to the Everdoor, the ship felt empty and resource management became tedious as you worked towards accomplishing those last missions to 100% the game, obtain Achievements or get that last passenger to the point where they were ready to leave.

It's not bad, and a LOT easier on a controller. You don't feel penalized for trying stuff over and over again other than wasted time.

But what keeps me coming back are three things: the story, the graphics, and the music. 

The characters are all lively and engaging (even if I'd like to punch one of them sometimes), the story moves me to tears every time you take someone to the Everdoor. It's a beautiful analogy for loss and letting go, which is something I'm finding I very much needed.

The graphics are lovingly rendered, colorful, and vibrant. Everything has a consistent style and theme, and the natural elements are quite compelling. My only complaint is the flashing that occurs sometimes, such as when opening a crate, which is quite uncomfortable for me, even at low contrast. It'd be nice to be able to turn off flashing effects for sensitive eyes. As it is, I can't recommend this game to friends with epilepsy.

The music is incredible, with really distinctive themes for each character and location that add to the experience in every way. My only complaint is Alex, the seal, who has an incredibly annoying theme and calls you a bully if you ask him to turn it off. It would be fine if you could just turn off the honking, because the rest of the theme is fun!

All in all, if you're debating about this game, go for it! It's got its share of high energy and chill experiences, but you can pick and choose what pace you take (for the most part).

This is a positive, my ADHD brain frickin' LOVES having tasks and lists to check off once I've completed them. You can complete the tasks whenever you want, there's no time limit, and you could honestly just spend the whole day traveling around accomplishing none of the quests and still be at ease. The mechanics aren't overly difficult, but not boring or lackluster. 
The game wants you to take things slow, but it won't drag. Stacking up on resources usually winds up in quests zooming right by if you end up already having all the materials you need lmao. 
It has a goal it's clearly driving you to, but there are plenty of instances where your actions have consequences. Not massive ones, but the choice to follow orders directly or even lie to characters is a choice that can slightly shift perspectives and give depth.

From an emotional perspective, you're just gonna be staring at the wall processing after playing this game. It's beautifully real, not pulling any punches and fully bearing and admitting the tragedies and joys that can be found in life, and the horrible ways in which it can end. How you sometimes don't always get that happy ending you were waiting for. Sometimes, you're at peace when you go. But, most of the time, there will still be hang-ups, or regrets, or something bittersweet that will linger. 
Even the ones who are ready to go will have something hovering over their heads, an acceptance not because they'd done everything they needed to do, but because there was nothing else they feasibly could change anymore. Sometimes, they don't even get that, and they just give up. 

You're not guiding perfect people, or making them become good. Some will reach their end and not be any better. Some might be worse than when they started. This doesn't mean you failed, because any change, regardless how small or in what way, was still change. You were still there for them. 

That's the part that I love most about this game. The characters themselves just feel real. It was the more flawed ones, the less excusable actions, that I liked the most, just because they gave such interesting insights, some varied change. 

This is a game about life, grief, and moving on. I cannot recommend it more than to those who have ever experienced any kind of loss. It's a tragically honest telling about how life will never be perfect, but it won't always be bad, either. 

Spiritfarer tells you this: you will die with something holding you back. A regret for something you should've done, for something you never did, or something lost you will never regain, material or mental, or a hope for something that would never happen, never to change how you wanted it to. Even by living life to its fullest, these things will happen, and there's nothing you can do about it. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try, or should live in fear, it only means that it's something you must learn to accept. It's hard, but it's the truth, and even death won't save you from it. 

That's alright, though. That's what it means to be a person, to make mistakes that some may never be able to fix. You'll still have lived, no matter how small you think your life was, and that's the most extraordinary part. 

You lived.

I could say a lot about it, but I'll concentrate my review into a list of bullet points for easier reading.
-------------------
[h1]What will you leave behind?[/h1]

[b]+ STORY and CHARACTERS:[/b] Easily the biggest praise I can give this game. Don't let the ""artsy"" vibe fool you. The game touches upon some really serious topics like [spoiler]suicide, abuse, dealing with disability and terminal illness[/spoiler]. Spiritfarer is one of the most genuine, honest and relatable games I could ever recommend to anyone. Even though the world feels magical and unrealistic, the characters themselves are very believable in how they speak, how they express themselves, what kind of problems they have, how they react to those problems and ultimately... how they die. Spiritfarer in essence is a game about dealing with the inevitable. I don't think I can recall another game that absolutely trampled me emotionally as much as Spiritfarer. You will find characters that you can relate to, you will find characters that you adore and also hate, some of them will be very real to you, some of them will come off as bizarre and you'll struggle to understand them. What Spiritfarer tries to teach us is that... life is ultimately a game we cannot ""win"". We all have to say goodbye at some point. It's a destiny none of us can escape. Spiritfarer simply presents some of the many real life stories ([i]that are most likely happening to others right now in the real world as I write this[/i]), often violent, sad and unfair, and then leaves us alone with the aftermath. Whatever we do with that knowledge moving forward is on us.

[b]+ARTSTYLE:[/b] The game features beautiful hand-drawn graphics. The animations are absolutely phenomenal. I played two previous games by Thunder Lotus, Jotun and Sundered and the quality of the art got even better than in those two games. Although that's where my first criticism comes into play, more on that in another paragraph.

[b]+MUSIC:[/b] Another homerun composed by Max LL. Every track is really memorable, emotional, technically impeccable. Some of the tracks are so good that I'm listening to them outside of the game and some of them (along with the corresponding scenes) left a very intense scar in my psyche to the point that I feel my throat tightening up because they remind me of a certain NPC or an event.
-------------------
Now for the criticisms:
[b]-SLOW PACE:[/b] Hold on, don't get the wrong idea. The gameplay of Spiritfarer is like... 95% great if you enjoy relaxing sim games. I enjoyed it almost all the way through. It consists of several minigames that you will repeat throughout the majority of the entire playthrough, discovering new locations, upgrading your boat which is kinda like a big hotel, a farm and a workshop, all in one. Spiritfarer is a game that likes to proceed with things slowly. Personally, I really enjoy when a game gives me time to process my thoughts and emotions. But I did start to feel a bit bored with the routine after... idk... 50 hours of gameplay? The last 10 hours of my playthrough felt a bit dry simply because I was running out of content but I still had some things to do, the quests just pop up after a few in-game days sometimes so it left me with almost nothing to do. It's not a big issue but it was noticeable enough to be worth mentioning. If you're impatient, you might struggle with this one.

[b]-SELF INDULGENCE (?):[/b] I mentioned artstyle and the animations being great. They really are. However, they really take their time whenever you do an action, like taking food out of the oven, pulling out crops etc. It didn't bother me that much, but again, I can see some people being annoyed by that. When you do the same action multiple times and you always have to wait until Stella (The main protagnist) prepares herself to cut down a tree etc. it can become a bit tiring. Look Thunder Lotus, we know your animators are skilled, we get it. XD
-------------------
I think that's mostly what I wanted to write. If something else comes to mind, I will add it. All things considered, Spiritfarer is absolutely the best game made by Thunder Lotus so far and it's an experience you open up to when you need a fresh perspective on life and the world. It's very similar to Celeste in that sense. Thank you Thunder Lotus. ❤",1671053131,1671053131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is not very challenging, most of the game can be played at your leisure. This allows the personalities of the spirits on your boat to seep through as you discover their stories. I liked the characters and often found myself making sure they were well fed and happy.

I really enjoyed the platforming parts after unlocking some of the mobility abilities and navigating the maps was fun.  The resource collecting/crafting was fun at first but the animations and minigames got boring after doing them a couple of times.

I don't have enough words to describe how I felt during the Spiritfarer's campaign, it's a mixture of feelings where most of them are good, but some of them bring to you that bitter taste of missing something, or someone you love. It taught me that life should be appreciated, and poeple are just here on Earth to remind you that even the best things, are not forever.

The Charon, the last farewell to anyone who had crossed life, and faced death at some point, that's you, that's Stella (and Daffodil, of course), you'll cross a number of different characters throughout your journey, some you may like, some you'll love a little bit too much, and some, you're gonna dislike, but just for a moment until you get to meet them. Stories so rich and vivid, that you easily will fall in love with every single personality you cross, even if it envolves crime (sometimes).

I couldn't recommend this game more, made me smile, made me cry, taught me something I know today better than I knew before I laid eyes on this masterpiece, some of you even may need a piece of advice, this game offers this. Play it, really.

--just a tip, playing with someone special will make this 100x better, kisses

--Love Alice, love Stanley.

Most materials had their own mini game with the amount of material being the prize depending on how well you performed. Some of the games were ridiculously slow to complete. Some were just annoying.

Also the game felt stretched a bit thin for the amount of main/optional content in the game. The last few hours of the game I felt like I was ready for the game to be over.  [spoiler] But maybe that was intentional, considering the story. [/spoiler]

A side warning; do not progress quickly in the game. Enjoy it or the ending will really break the ""feel"" of the game.

The idea is that you are taking the souls of friends and family to the Everdoor after helping them complete their unfinished business. 

The characters in early game are lovely, however you never really do get the chance to complete the unfinished business, as soon as you start getting into the depths of what is haunting them they ask to go to the Everdoor. This happens throughout the whole game, the business never really does get finished and just as you're starting to get somewhere it's over. They all want to bail just as things get hard, it's very frustrating. 

The later game characters are less likeable than the early game characters, they are rude, bully others onboard, have no real depth of story until you're already on the boat to the Everdoor, or otherwise kind of suck. 

None of the characters feel as though they were fully fleshed out, it feels as though they went with quantity over quality and the characters are worse for it. 

As the story progresses and you gather materials and currency you can upgrade the boat and travel to different areas of the map. In the beginning again this was wonderful, however by the time I unlocked the last parts of the map I was stuck with the unlikeable characters and it felt as though the game was dragging on. 

I originally enjoyed the slow paced game play, but found myself in late game with nothing much to do and no characters that were worth hanging around for. 

The game gets so close but misses the mark. I really wish they had given the characters all a more fleshed out story (actually allowing them to finish their business, not bail as soon as it gets hard), allowed you to unlock areas of the map sooner so that you're not left with nobody on the boat and finally unlocking last parts of the map, and made it so that even in late game there is story worth sticking around for. [spoiler] Stella had already asked to go to the Everdoor before I had even gotten the last crew member or finished all of the islands, the last crew member being a nurse who is cruel to a psychiatric patient and who gets mad at you when you feed people good quality food. [/spoiler]

I loved the early game but the late game spoiled it for me. I never finished it and don't have any interest to, I got so close to the end of the game but it felt like such a chore I don't have any desire to go back into it.

In a world that's whimsical at times and sad at others, you meet many strangers, trade with merchants, and occasionally make some friends along the way.

I start playing and to be honest a thing instantly puts me off, you must play as a brown queer, there's no way around and OK, I tough there must have been some plot ramification for it as for any game that doesn't let you chose the gender or style of your character...you know, industry stadndard.....

So I just embark in my journey in this overwhelming positively reviewed game and wow, first few hours are very nice, the world is beautiful the game mechanics seem solid and looks like I'm in for a treat.

But then, I keep playing and just a few more hours in and the game becomes incredibly repetitive. The task are boring and fundamentally you spend most of your time fishing and watering plants.... wow amazing but, meh, I'm here for the deep ramifications of the plot and the amazing story everyone talks about in the comments so lets ignore that in the and as any gamer i wasted time in worst games...

Problem is, you keep playing and there's no real big underlying plot, just a few interesting analysis of how certain stereotypical characters live in a way before facing all their regrets only when is too late and they are at the end of their lifes. You have the ultra hippi with father issues, the posh girl with father issues, the guy that focus on himself and now miss his family, the old lady that misses her husband and her kids, the lady with a swindler husband that loves gossip but she has a good heart and a few other classic stereotypes.

Still, this doesn't mean necessarily that the character are uninteresting but... the game does just that, paint the classic picture of your average stereotypical personalities and make them face their regrets together with you, Stella, at the death door. And atleast you'd expect something big happening when you finally ferry them to the other world but.... no, you listen to them blabbing a little more about their regreats, hug them, and off you go get a reeward so now you can improve your ship and move forward.

And so you go on and on on this loop, cutting trees, smelting iron doing some work at the loom cutting wood and fishing, over and over and over while you wait your boat to reach destination. Here you'll have some meaningless talks with the locals before finding the ""not so hidden"" quest or whatever the current quest target is and after you exhaus some more banal talk off you go again and again and again.

Lets leave aside that the game has an underling political agenda which (and I say it as an European) is obviously an American left wing one, but lets forget that as, in the end is the developer world so whatever.... But even on these themes the game is very banal and almost a caricature of itself failing in delivering a meaningful reason for why this is happening and just some banal common places.

So, after a few hours of this loop when I was succumbing to the boredom I started to wonder.... how come this game is reviewed so positively?

Well its very simple, remember the part of the queer character? thats why, this game has been made to become a beacon of LGBT gaming, if you google a bit you'll see how famous it is on LGBT blogs and subreddit driving the reviews to the moon. And this is it, the game isn t that good, yes the developers did a great work on the look and sound of it, totally agree, but the rest? Is mediocre at best and its so obnoxious that in a game about inclusivity and acceptance, they fail right at the start by imposing you who you will be, no matter that it has LITERALLY 0 relevance for the plot,its just a choice to attract a certain niche, just a marketing tool.

I have really nothing against LGBT nor brown people but this game is just using these niches to gain followers and relevance in the gaming world, this game as a game is boring with incredibly old and badly tough mechanics (water 3 fields of grains than tell me this game is fun) complete lack of QOL and very basic storytelling which in theory focuses on you building a relationship with friends that then you have to let go.... but the truth is that letting them go is the best part so they stop annoy you with daily chores of food and hugs in exchange to just a few line of background.

Once the incredibly well made visual and soundtrack becomes old (approx 5 h in) you ll be left with a boring game that fails in delivering anything meaningful, the game is supposed to last something like 20h/30h, hours that you'll spend doing menial tasks for barely characterized character and while wondering: 

Why the hell I'm a human queer in an animal world?

[b]TL;DR: nice looking, boring to play. [/b]

Before buying this game I decided to play the demo. I didn't quite understand how I feel about the game[play] since the demo was short but it looked nice so I decided to give Spiritfater a try.

When after playing a couple of hours I got a strong desire to refund the game I started to think that maybe there's something wrong with me — after all it has 95% positive reviews.

I'm not going to say that it's a bad game, especially considering how long I played it, but I played enough to get bored and negative reviews prove that I would get even more bored later. Repetitive gameplay/activities with lots of same long animations you get tired of, long travels on boat from point A to point C, sometimes going to some point B to get resources for crafting (from other reviews I got that going to ""B"" points will be even more of a problem later when you'll have to grind a lot). Feed each passenger (bruh, go eat yourself), hug them but like once a day (huge dislike for that 😤) and don't forget to talk to them if you don't want to miss pieces of story. And remember to water crops on your farm. Live, die, repeat.

Also, I didn't see much story in this game. Maybe because I didn't play long enough, maybe because the game doesn't really have the story. 

Some people call this game meditative. Well, if meditative is a synonym for ""boring"", then it was definitely meditative for me. 

The game has nice music and appealing visuals, but that's not enough for me, even with a huge discount.

I'm going to say that I'm really enjoying it once I got past the apparent soft-lock. 

What follows is an explanation of what I think the soft lock is and why it's happening to new players. 

This game has three major problems that culminate in the soft lock: a lack of direction, no tutorial on one critical interface, and a double jump that is WAY too tight. 

This is intended to be an open world game, which is awesome. But any kind of serious progression is locked behind getting a small handful of spirits to join your crew. The open world aspect just obfuscates this fact and leaves you sailing endlessly, lost and confused with your crew of one lone frog after you release the first three other low hanging ~~fruit~~spirits. At least he's easy to keep happy. 

Now, there are two other spirits at this point that are stupidly easy to find (and one of them is a twofer after you finish her first quest), and apparently there was a third you could fish out of the water at three spirits, but that got patched out to requiring four spirits to be released before you could get him. 

So of the two spirits a new player can actually pursue at this point:

The first requires you to fetch a quest item from the obligatory ""you collected stuff, have a prize"" character. Great. So you pull up a menu that lets you see your collection, how many items you have, and what the prize is. And you'll likely see that you are one or more short of getting the full collection and you will conclude that you have to go find the last item. (It's an end game item too.) At this point most players will move on to the other spirit and mark this one down as ""come back later.""

I spent at least five hours on this idea because the menu for the collections is badly designed. Collections have multiple reward levels for reaching milestones. This isn't readily obvious to a new player who has never seen a menu arranged remotely like this in the game. The progression bar is at the bottom, and the first collection that pops up only has a milestone for one item, and a milestone for a complete set. A lot of users are going to miss that and fail to make a connect that there are multiple rewards. 

Then there's the fact that the game doesn't automatically give you the rewards. It makes you ask for each and every one of them. There's no reason to do this. There's no Inventory cap. There's no reason I do not want my rewards instantly. The flow should be: Open menu, dialogue pop-up ""oh. You have 10 X. Here's your picture, get out of my hair."" Or there should be-at the very least-a big, flashing animation of the key command that will get me my stuff. It's an excessively busy menu, and the command for the primary function is just buried in a mass of  ""that part of the menu doesn't look important"" busyness. I found more than one person on the internet who got confused by this menu and concluded that they couldn't get to the character.

The second character falls prey to the problem with the double jump: it's visually too short. To obtain this spirit you have to go talk to a second character at the top of the map. They're only reachable by double jumping onto some cargo containers. But if you're like most platform players you're generally moving while jumping. You jump at a diagonal. And the double jump adds a truly pathetic amount of air to your diagonal jump. It doesn't even come close to reaching the top of those cargo containers.

So, again, a lot of players will conclude that there must be another way up. And, indeed, at the far and of the area is a bounce platform. Clearly, that's the way up and I need to go find the bounce skill. All the player needs to do is double jump vertically from a standing start, with moderately good timing, so that Stella can do the climb up animation. 

I'm sure the devs are extremely proud of that climb up animation because most double jumps wind up employing it. A climb up animation means that you barely made the jump with no room to spare. It shouldn't be constantly encountered on the ship! If I were Stella I'd start building things shorter! If double jump was long enough that from a diagonal jump the player could comfortably land on top of the cargo container, this would have been a non-issue. Does it really matter that Stella's double jump goes ten pixels higher? So a small handful of really crazy players will get a packet of seeds or a blueprint they can't use early on. It would save tremendously on broken controllers. This was bad level design, guys. 

And the third character, that would have saved a clueless player's bacon is just no longer accessible because reasons?

All of this leads to a horrible confluence of new players feeling soft locked because they don't have the experience to know how and why they're mistaken. 

I'm really enjoying the game. These are actually minor quibbles on their own that I managed to get past because I was stubborn enough to dig for answers. A lot of players aren't going to be inclined to do so.

""Whoever keeps cutting the onions around here needs to stop.""

The game has a lot of busywork to it, and I feel like it could have done with a -bit- less of it, but the visuals, music, and story more than make up for it.

I feel like I'm only a third of the way through the game (if that), and it's already struck emotional chords with me several times. This game is fantastic, and well worth playing.

[b]Update (Finished the game.)[/b]

Spiritfarer has been far one of the best emotional experiences I've had when it comes to games. There are very few games that can get me to care about the characters I'm interacting with. This, however, was an exception.

It took me ~32 hours to play from start to finish, doing the main story (and the free updates that were given). There are points where I feel things were very poorly paced, and things were a bit tedious, but I'd say I enjoyed the overall experience.

[b]TL:DR[/b]

I doubt you need my review on an overwhelmingly positive game, but I'm going to type one anyway.
Pros
-Story, its so amazingly well written and told through the game play. You really grow to love the characters, if you are an emotional person like me, you'll get teary eyed. I struggle with death and while no, this game is not the cure for that, it makes you realize the process to life. There's something so soul filling about treasuring moments with these characters.
-Music, omg i would be lying if i didn't say this sound track has made it onto a lot of my playlists. Its just really good, found it on spotify, like if the trailers arent convincing you, go look up the sound track.
-Gameplay, smooth and clean animations
-Designs, everything from the world to the boat to the characters is so good, the look and feel of the game is whimsical without being overly silly, nothing feels lacking and all fits into this world.
-split screen, im putting it here because why not. The fact this game even lets you bring a friend along is hilarious to me, and yes i have done it, its fun but totally not necessary. Your player two, who plays as the cat which is cute AF, is there to help with the gathering and chores of the game. flipping wholesome i gotta say. 

Cons (theres not much here)
-i feel like this might fall under gameplay, but it says ""stress free"" on some trailers, you cant have resource management and not have stress... between gathering, cooking, growing, taking care of the spirits, upgrading you boat, and ect, you can get overwhelmed. There is no real ""failure"" in the game. If you don't stay on top of these things, you'll just burn a dish here and there, or take a little longer on some quests, which can be fine depending on the type of player you are. I don't think this is something the devs can ever change or ""fix"", because limiting players to much can lead to an awful experience for the players. You as a player just have to pace yourself, and not think of every burnt dish as a ""failure"". 

Overall this game is a 10/10 for me, but i feel like you have to be the type of player that enjoys these types of games. 
recommending this to someone whos only played FPS's or heavy action forward games, would be like recommending a slice of life show to someone who only watching Marvel super hero movies.... its just not for everyone, and thats ok. we live in a fantastic world, were being different and liking different things is ok.

This game is not afraid to touch on various heavy topics such as battling cancer, su*cide, etc.

Each passenger has their own heartbreaking story, and even more heartbreaking last goodbye. 
The plot twist at the end is partially revealed pretty early on, if you have a really keen eye, you'll understand it right away. It's still very sad nonetheless. 
I'm about to finish the game by bringing the *last*.... person to the Everdoor, and I'm really going to miss this universe and its characters.
The game is really not as grindy as some of the most popular negative reviews suggest. It's the proper amount of grinding, in my opinion. I managed to 100% the requests and get all achievements in 50 hours.

I simply wanted a comfy management game with a heartfelt story and characters. After playing for 23 hours I am at the point of pulling my hair out with how frustrating this game is.

The management aspect is mediocre at best, due to the game arbitrarily selecting the wrong plot for you to interact with or the UI being clunky and changing suddenly for a few stations for no good reason. The game also has a problem with very frustrating animations for harvesting resources. It boils down to either animations that take way longer than they need to or unnecessary timing events to get a perfect hit even though it gives you little benefit and is basically frame-perfect to pull off.

The platforming is absolutely terrible with all of your jumping abilities being on the same button, which sounds great, until you realize they conflict with each other and make certain sections far too annoying for their own good. The zipline ability is also very picky on when it decides to work which results in you falling long distances and having to start an area over again.

The characters are a problem in that I do not get to learn much about some of them before they go. Some spend a long time with you and you get lots of little conversations while others show up and then leave within a very short time and before you get to know anything about them. Even then, some characters get good worthy send-offs while others just sort of decide to leave. One character doesn't even get a send-off and it happens so jarringly I thought my game bugged out.

The writing feels bizarre and haphazard. Every character you meet feels out of place and none of it meshes well. And I do not feel like the concept of death is being handled with any real severity.

The music is pleasant and relaxing to listen to. The art style is also very well done and the animations for all the characters are fun and colorful. I have no criticisms in this regard.

I do not want to dislike this game and maybe it just isn't for me. But I have played for 23 hours according to steam and I have not felt the slightest spark of enthusiasm for it past the initial thirty minutes.",1669692247,1669692247,False,5,0,0.542991220951080322,0,True,False,False

Your hitbox is narrower than it looks like. When you move forward you extend your leg out. After you have stopped moving for a second or two you bring your leg back in. This stance is shows how skinny your hitbox actually is. My leg phased through platforms multiple times and it pissed me off because I didn't realize this.
But even so, I shouldn't have to consider this when I'm moving around.
On the other hand, the player character has remarkably fluid animation. I found myself moving her around just to see her move. Making her duck rhythmically to Francis' Theme is great! 

Jumping up onto a platform is harder than it should be sometimes. Your entire sprite may be above the platform but that doesn't mean that you will land on it. Sometimes you have to hold the up button to actually stay on the platform (or you could double jump where available). Thankfully, if you are higher above the platform, you don't have this problem. It is super annoying when you have to redo a jump that you clearly should have landed.

Also, some platforms have railings which block you from jumping up onto them in that spot. You have to go to the part of the platform without the railing. I'm not sure if this is fixable but you would have to make the the railings somehow look more like something to pay attention to rather than background information.

One cool thing you can do in the game is hold down and jump to fall through any platform on your way down. Unfortunately, holding down and jump on a ladder causes you to spaz out because you keep grabbing on to the ladder. You have to let go of the down button. Also, the camera has trouble keeping up with you when you fall far. However, the game lets you move around just fine when you're off camera. Another cool thing about this is that you can't jump through your dingy. This lets enables you to hold down and jump for as long as you need and longer.

If you build a building directly above another building then the lower building will have a ladder to its roof. Sometimes ladders get in your way. Moving around fast on your boat comes in handy when you are doing challenges. Having the option to put ladders where you want would have been great. I remember one building that was so small that you could just jump on top of it but there was also a ladder on top of it. Climbing a ladder is slower that jumping so I would never use that ladder unless it coincidentally connected to another ladder. Also, the game makes you put this building on the deck of the ship (so that ladder is mandatory).

Also, the shapes of the buildings on your ship don't line up well. You will have gaps and you can't get rid of old houses (but you can move them). Gaps can make ladders extend downward.

Starting on a zipline is inconsistent. You start by holding the up button but the game may not recognize that you're trying to start. I've held the up button before and went right through 2 lines and ended up climbing a ladder instead. It is the only inconsistent part of the controls. The previous bad parts of the controls are just unintuitive at times. I could theoretically get used to unintuitive controls but inconsistent controls are another issue.

Fast travel requires you to first go to random spots in the ocean. These spots are represented by bus stations. The bus stations should be on the islands not in the middle of nowhere.

Imagine this, you're in an island town but you want to go across the map to another town.
So you get in your boat so that you travel to an bus station out of town in the ocean - not on any island - in the ocean.
When you get to the station there will be a dude waiting towards the middle of your ship. 
You have to talk to the dude there tell him where you want to go.
He will pull a map up for you so that you can select another station (in the ocean) to go to.
When you're at your destination station you have to go to the back of the ship to pull up the map again so that you can set your real destination.

Also, any sloped roof on the buildings you build will not connect to any other adjacent sloped roof. Let's say you line two sloped roofs up slanting down. Then you go slide on the higher roof expecting to continue sliding onto the second roof. Well, after you finish sliding off the first slope you will fall through an invisible gap between the two roofs. Also, peaked roofs have this invisible gap but you are unlikely to jump in such a small area on top of the roof.",1669602527,1669602527,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Fishing is actually kind of fun and decent way to pass the time while sailing to another island, but the others just get extremely tedious towards the end.

I hit a barrier fairly early on and I can see this happening with a lot of players - some of the resource grinding that is required to progress through the various quests the game offers can be a bit overwhelming at first and I found it easy to become confused by where to find resources. It took a couple of times looking up guides but I persevered and after I while, once I got the structure of the game and how progression is handled, this aspect got a lot easier and eventually started being something I actually appreciated a lot about the game.

After the first few hours, I started to really immerse myself into the underlying narrative of the stories, as well as the strength of the overall gameplay loop the game presents and it became clear to me why Spiritfarer is a game that is so highly praised. As I went on, the variety of the characters and the issues they face hit with me more, and I only grew to love the game more as I reached my last few spirits.

To avoid spoilers, I'll say that I've just harvested some peace lillies.
Holy Christ, I have never taken such a deep emotional hit from all my years of video games. The thing that I've just gone through elicited a solid 5 minute ugly cry, and I don't think I'm even done yet. 

Every moment of this game reflects the genuine care that went into its appearance. How it moves, how it feels, how it sounds... This game is not challenging, it's story is not terribly deep, its world not extensively fleshed out... And yet it is a sublime work of art. It is such a tremendous experience. The simple mechanics and the lack of any sort of threat or danger draw you in and you lower your guard, figuring ""ah, it's a kids game"", with only the occasional cuss-word glimmering through the facade here and there to remind you that no, this is YOUR game.

It's obvious that the game's plot is all about death, but how the characters are portraited and their stories can mess you up (in the meaning that this can get too personal for you). 
But leaving that aside the game is beautiful and has a wonderful key message. Every character is very unique - has their favourite dish, house, story, mannerism and how they react to you or help you. You will have a character that you love or hate and you will cry when they leave because it's too easy to become quickly attached to them. But that's what's the game is about.
Besides playing the role of the Charon you will grow vegetables, fruits, trees, mine various ores and smelt them, build houses and other things. You can also fish and upgrade the ship and all of the buildings. After some time it can get repetitive but there is a variety of all things and also, there are collections - if you will discover an exact amount of certain things you will be awarded for it (fishes, dishes, crystals, ores etc). But also it's fun in the terms of dishes to discover what will you cook if you combine certain things ;))
In the terms of the graphics, I can't fault anything. You can see how much work was put into the creation of this game and I appreciate all the time the developers and other creators of this game put into making it. 
The gameplay is really easy and you should have no problems with playing it. Besides playing as the protagonist Stella (or as Daffodil too if you play in the multiplayer) you will get to navigate the ship and it's really easy. It's very useful that the game itself reminds you or gives you tips if it detects that you forget how to use some functions. And the thing that I discovered in the long run - if you won't be able to get some materials for some time the game will change them for something that you have already or something that will be easier to get. Also, the map that you will uncover throughout the game is really big and every location is very unique and fun to explore. It's worthy to mention that after the game came out the creators still updated it with a new content - characters and locations.
One thing that is a small peeve for me is if you want to get all achievements you have to spoiler the game for yourself a bit and get to know how to get them because if you don't get them from the beginning you will have to play through the whole game again to get them all.
Also, it moved me that most of the characters are based on the family or friends of the creators. It's a beautiful thing that these people will always remain in this game and we get to know their history.
 I feel that I should write more, but my mind is empty. All in all, you should give this game a chance because it's definitely worth the money for the characters and the story. It's relaxing and calming, sometimes the characters can lift up your mood c;
Personally I already finished the game (I only have a few tasks to finish it all), but I can truthfully say I fell in love with this game and I wish I could forget my first run and play through it again just to discover everything one more time.

The first thing that struck me was the absolutely gorgeous soundtrack.. at every turn, beautiful, haunting melodies are waiting for you. The game itself is so far from what I normally play - but I have heard so many rave reviews that I just had to try it. The art style is almost whimsical, Daffodil the cat is adorable, and the game itself plays pretty brightly and sort of Disney-like. 

   Then my first spirit passenger, Gwen, told me it was time for her to go, that she was ready. A sudden sense of dread filled me, but as the Spiritfarer, it was my job to see her off. So, I took her to the Everdoor, and as I rowed her to the door, she said a lot of things that were shockingly deep and very real to me, this character who as a living human, was very broken and had a lot of regrets in a life that was obviously cut short by a sudden illness before she had time to make things right. With a final hug, she ascended and her constellation was traced in the stars. ""That's really neat"" I thought, figuring that was it, time to go back to the ship. Nope.

   What came next was a trip through Stella's memories, her happiest times in life, and at each stop I played the guitar to reveal the next memory and it was just so haunting and beautiful and overwhelming - I just can't even put into words what an experience this game is. It's an experience disguised as a slightly whimsical game, but when you experience these moments in the game, it all hits home really hard.

   This is some of the most brilliant game design I have ever seen, and I am honestly dreading sending off my next passenger. It evoked for me a lot of all too familiar emotions of saying goodbye to someone you love forever.

The story is incredible, after I'll admit what is an overlong introduction. It also glosses over a fairly obvious point but... no spoilers.

What follows would be a pretty standard exploration/collection/build/expand game, except at almost every turn, the story takes on new dimensions too. You gain and lose companions along the way, and it's sometimes shocking that a companion chooses to leave when they do. On at least two occasions I had tears in my eyes because of the way things ended: further testament to the quality of the writing.

And it's the writing that really makes this game. It's a simplistically pretty game; the mechanics are well done; progression works too... but it's the story that keeps things moving.

The visuals are absolutely stunning, the animations are charming and the design of the world and the characters are beautiful. And the first few hours of the game are definitely enjoyable. BUT that sadly changes quite quickly as there is more and more added to the game as it continues. 

Like others have said before me, after a certain time the game devolves into a boring grind of staying atop all the tasks on the boat that is basically your homebase. Be it from watering plants, cooking meals for your spirit passengers, looming, feeding and caring for animals, smelting, cutting wood, readjusting the windmill, smithing etc. Things you have to do in an endless daily loop until you manage to progress further in the story and the worldmap. - And then more busywork gets added to it. 

I stuck with it for quite a while as my ingame hours can attest, because as everybody else, I've read the raving reviews about the deep story, the great characters and the emotional ride this game supposedly delivers. But eventually, I just gave up trying to find it. Because I found the game severly lacking in those areas, especially compared with all the constant busywork I had to do. For me, all that running around, staying on top of things, just wasn't worth it for the very few snippets of short dialogue bursts that give a glimpse into the lives and personalities of those characters that accompany on the boat. 
The first spirit passenger you meet, Gwen, is a very good example of this. She is supposedly a good friend of the main character, Stella and serves as an introduction to most of the game mechanics. And she also usually is the first spirit that wishes to depart. And I honestly was so confused about her abrupt departure that I googled whether I had missed some story-elements of hers accidentally. But... I didn't. Ultimately, you just don't get a lot of interactions or backstory to any of the characters. I'm not saying there is no backstory, because there is, but it just felt severly lacking for me. And this continues with all the other characters as well. There is a supposed familiarity between Stella and all her passengers, but I could never really feel it. Apart from a couple of lines of dialogue after certain quests that you do for them - which are just fetch-quests, basically - and a longer dialogue as you ferry them to their departure from the world, they don't do much. Just walk around the boat, tell you they are hungry, repeating the same lines over and over at you. 

And personally, I just feel this is not enough. It would be enough in a different game. A game where you would be ferrying around random characters, and you are never meant to really connect with them. A game that very clearly focuses more on the management aspect instead of the story aspect. But in this case this was just a baffling choice. I really expected a lot more, especially after the game had received such glowing reviews especially in this aspect. 
But I just can't confirm these reviews. The characters and the story ultimately are extremely shallow and feel half-baked or like a first draft. They could have done so much more here. More dialogue, more interactions, not only between the passengers and Stella but also between the passengers themselves. And instead they could have cut back on sooo many of those management-aspects that just bog the game down to a boring grind. 

And Stella herself is just not an interesting or compelling protagonist in my opinion. The choice to make her completely silent and almost robot-like in her lack of reactions, emotions and general behaviour just feels strange. Either you have a protagonist that serves as a stand-in for the player or you have a fully realized protagonist with their own personality and view of the world. You can't have it both ways. But how am I expected to feel pain, grief, anger, frustration etc. if the person I'm playing constantly smiles through every situation with the occasional frown or concern as the only things to break up the monotony? How should I miss a character that suddenly disappears, if Stella doesn't and just goes straight back to managing the ship with almost no acknowledgement of such a traumatic event? 

When even the departures of the passengers become one more task to tick off your list than maybe you've done something wrong in your game-design. 


Like I said, I really, really wanted to enjoy Spiritfarer, but ultimately it just really left me disappointed. If you expect rich, deep characters and relationships that really make you feel for those characters, as well as a well-written story, then I'm afraid you won't find it here. If you want a management game with lots of busywork and things to do set in a world with beautiful visuals, cute characters and lovely music, then Spiritfarer is a good fit for you.

especially those that talk your ears off.. 
yes you have a big map with many islands, yes you have a lot of spirits to take care of but traveling to the same islands 20 times really throttles my excitement.
some of the things that really lack QoL for me are: not being able to travel at night was solved by simply not being able to view the stupid map... for real? like I just wanna plan my trip for the next day but how about no?
Some of the spirits react super slow to their event, which led me to think I had bugs or something and finally, it took me some hours and google to find out where to get one of the last spirits from.. unfortunately you need this one for a lot of upgrades and buildings.. I havent seen any hints, not even in the community hub. So if you wonder where to get ektoplasma and cant find it on the map or anywhere, welcome in the club. Spoilers for that:
[spoiler] you need stanley, which is a mushroom that will grow in your garden, get his seed by fishing, no special location needed. This only happens after 4 spirits have left your ship [/spoiler]

Some good lines and character choices. The themes are definitely resonant but I'm not sure they're as humane or insightful as they want to be. Nonetheless it was touching, gave me some things to think about.

Gameplay is hit or miss. If it wasn't for the story elements I wouldn't have played. Lots of crafting/cooking, lots of boating to different islands to complete tasks, lots of talking to your passengers to find out if they're hungry yet, lots of planting and watering. I like a lot of base building / survival crafting games but this was a bit bland for me.

I found some of the design decisions to be frustrating  -- why can't I tell when people are hungry or ready for a hug just by looking at them? Why are the recipes and the cooking options in different menus? Why are the crop management animations so long?

Some elements seemed unfinished. For instance, there's no animation when you [spoiler]feed a cow or sheep[/spoiler], and it's not clear whether you NEED to [spoiler]feed the ones on your boat, or how often[/spoiler]. The upgrades on some buildings seem like an afterthought. Some don't come with any obvious visual improvements either.

All right, 100% achievement it and basically i'm torturing myself for like 34.2 hours because i'm type that cant let something go if i cherish someone so much (but not about letting go someone's death, strangely)

[h2] First of all, what you will hate from this game? (you might related and unrelated) [/h2]
1. Long animation for many things you will do most of time can be torture for certain people
2. Some mini-game can be tedious for some people as well
3. There is no way to ""fast forward"" the time, hence make you wait for quest longer 
[Smol Idea:[spoiler] Just make you can meditate on Summer's house after her last errand is good too, or playing guitar outside the Field/garden[/spoiler]
4. There is no such things like ""Hell Grind"" but still, there is grind, especially if you going to 100% achievement which needs you to cook every recipes ([spoiler]btw, I hate farming XP bottle[/spoiler])
5. Dad joke (ok, im joking, Albert, dont mad at me)

[h3]Then what's good with this game?[/h3]
1. Story, it may not give much impact in the beginning, but you will feel it later on
2. Animation is executed well, exaggeration is amazing, motion is fluid (Also if you timed well when you go outside and move+dash, you can dash Stella backward like she was blown by something)
3. Simplistic artstyle
4. Simple control with only one hand, feel free to use your other hand with other else, like take tissue or eating chips [spoiler] or hand holding [/spoiler]
5. If you want emotional damage without many talk, sure this can

[h4]Should you play this?[/h4]
Yes definitely..... unless you are kind of very impatient, because long animations can drain your sanity

Good story and interesting, although uneven (and you need to be quite patient with some of them) characters, weakened by a grindy and, especially towards the end, boring, repetitive, and quite shallow gameplay. As stated by others, the first hours are the hook and probably the best part of the game. It can become somewhat of a chore towards the end, which is something you do NOT want in a game like this, with such a strong theme. 

The game clearly needs some QOL improvements (a better recipes book, a better way to track your quests and the materials you need, skippable text, one-click way to sell stacks of items, search function for ingredients or places, etc) and I'm not sure it's possible to combine this type of grindy gameplay with the emotional story the game wanted to tell. For me, they clashed together. I do like the crafting part, and building, and cooking but there's actually no reason to make most of that stuff except because you have to if you want to continue the main story. By that I mean that you character doesn't need to sleep or eat, there are no actual threats, and I suspect there's actually no way to lose the game. So what, at first, I thought were survival-like elements are, to some extend, just mandatory repetitive minigames.

Still, it's a good game, and I understand why it has been so well-received by many, but the flaws are there and should be pointed out.",1669244951,1669244951,False,5,0,0.58837437629699707,0,True,False,False

I'm writing this review as I'm almost at the end of this journey, but I'm not really certain if I want it to end yet. I know I can just go back to my last save or just replay it all over again, which I probably would get around to eventually just to reminisce and that's the fun in that, that I'm still able to go back into those moments, because in reality you can't do that anymore and I'm at a point where I'm too stubborn to let it go for now.

It has been a memorable journey that has touched on something I wasn't so sure I was okay with yet and I'm not sure I'll ever be and that's fine. I've realized that no matter how you prepare yourself, you will never be ready for when or how they say goodbye to you, and some you aren't even able to say goodbye to properly, or even at all and that's just how it is, [spoiler](Uncle Atul WHY?!)[/spoiler] and that's not okay but also is at the same time because life just happens and is happening to you and to them.

Each of their words have stuck with me and will continue to, they each had different views of life and different feelings at the end of it, some I agree with, some I really don't more than I thought I would, yet know for a fact how real those scenarios are. So a bit of everyone's experience has been mine to share in the real world. It's been bittersweet, but I've loved every bit of it and I can never recommend this game enough. I just wish I could've picked it up sooner, but I couldn't pick this up as I knew what it was about, but now that I have I can genuinely say that, that person would have enjoyed playing this game with me if he were still here and he would have loved every bit of it because he tried to love that Dragon like Summer did despite the pain and fear and I'm proud of him for that.",1669161900,1669232000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really like this game. It teaches you to possible deal with grief and it helped me personally a bit to a certain point. Well I had to pause the game [spoiler] when I had to take Gwen to the Everdoor. [/spoiler] I actually did not continue the game yet but I'll continue to play in the future.

[list]
[*] Sure on some points the game is kinda grindy. You have to ship to different islands to get different materials for different things. Fast travel is an good option, so it kinda compensates the grindy stuff.
[*] The art style is wonderful, really nice to look at
[*] it's story time
[*] Sometimes characters can be annoying but they're also so lovely
[*] prepare to cry.....or feel sad....a lot

One thing I don't like is that time doesn't pause during a conversation. There's no such thing as cutscenes in this game, so whenever I'm engaged in a really long conversation, I have to skip it a bit faster than I'd have liked to save time. 
For example, when I'm on my way to feed a hungry character, I might unknowingly trigger a longer than expected conversation with another character. I totally can't pay attention to what they are saying, because I'm anxious that the unfed characters' hunger would just keep growing or there's some other impending events that require my attention. As a result, I never had the time to actually listen to the characters, I'm always distracted.
Another problem is, after the ship gets too big, it's really difficult to find the characters. I wish there's a window for character details that I can check anywhere and anytime. Chasing after them just to feed them can be exhausting sometimes... I wish there's a dining room or something where they can gather at a certain time every day. (or maybe there's already similar features that I'm just unaware of)

As with a lot of games (Minecraft and Stardew Valley as an example) there is fishing, the one thing I dislike, but on a scale of difficultly its certainly one of the easier fishing challenges, I normally give up on fishing quickly, but in between locations, I still give it ago.

I estimate that there are at least a good 1-2 dozen hours or so left ahead for me, but more importantly I think I will learn some meaningful lessons through this experience which, in my opinion, is worth more than the cost of the game.

Some mechanics are explained fully, some not at all.  The game will drop you on an island where your goal is clear but the path isn't and there are no indications if you have missed something you were supposed to find before you got there, if you are supposed to leave and return, or you are just missing something on the island itself.  Getting ready to start a new run for this very reason.

The game is supposed to be relaxing but at the start your charges are demanding to know why you haven't done what they asked all the time.  Every time you turn around another passenger wants something new, or wants to pour their heart out to you, or wants to know why you haven't finished their house. .  At one point my uncle asked me 'what about my house?'  'did you forget about the kitchen upgrade'  and then has the nerve to get all worked up because i haven't been spending any time fishing.

The characters are BY FAR the best part of the game. They are colorful, huggable, and engaging. However, the storyline of this game is locked behind a few tedious issues!

The gameplay is honestly pretty terrible. I would classify this game as a collectathon where you run around and collect items that you then use to upgrade your ship and the houses for your spirits. However, where this game fails is the engagement of that process. The entire game is several variations of 'run around and press or hold x'. There is a *miniscule* amount of platforming that is not an enjoyable experience for me. Overall it becomes a tedious, annoying, and boring experience. There are some timing minigames (more press and hold x) that can be fun, but its incredibly repetitive.

The funny thing is I love the game Kingdom which is another variation of 'run around and press or hold x', but for some reason, that game is MUCH more engaging for me.

This game is a SLOW BURN, which is NOT a bad thing, but when the slow burn feels tedious... its less enjoyable overall.

For having so many items in the game, the inventory management is pretty terrible. There is no organization for your inventory besides the built in subsections of STUFF. So many games have even a basic form of inventory management, but for all the collecting you do in this game (feels like Minecraft or Terraria sometimes) this doesn't feel great.

The ship management side of the game is pretty awesome, but having come other base management games like Terraria, Minecraft, XCom, or even Kingdom, it doesn't hit the right spot for me. There's customization for sure, but not freedom or creativity. You can only rearrange the different pieces of your little floating village.

Again, the spirits are the best part of the game for sure. Sometimes they can be really annoying though! You can only hug them every so often, and they only need food like 0.8 times a day. For someone like me, I like to put a lot of effort into my relationships, so when the spirits go ""Sorry I'm not feeling a hug rn,"" or ""You already fed me,"" it kinda hurts IRL!

The positive reviews this game has makes me more willing to express negative opinions about this. The majority of your time spent playing this game will be collecting and crafting resources. This involves uninteresting, repetitive, and slow minigames. You complete platforming ""challenges"" and explore to increase the amount of resources available. This is what the game considers gameplay; almost every interaction will center around obtaining some resource and/or interacting with someone.

Most conversations about this game will focus on the characters and story. Unfortunately, your interaction with spirits (the main side characters) are limited to the following: give them food, prompt them to talk, they give you something, hug them. Spirits and your interaction with them lack depth; you are unable to talk to them or have conversations with them, Stella (player character) doesn't have dialogue. It seems like the reason people find a spirit impactful was because they filled in the void with someone they knew.

To concisely experience everything, complete the first 5 spirits. Those are the most interesting and the gameplay isn't too repetitive yet.",1668838773,1668838773,False,16,0,0.586602210998535156,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere from the get go reels you in and makes you curious about exploring the world within. The art style and animations, especially for Stella (MC) are so so cute and whimsical, yet behind the superb animation lies a story of death and the memories shared along the way.

The gameplay is simple enough and a quick pick up and the story moves along at a decent pace.
The one thing I absolutely dislike is the repetitive tasks you must accomplish just to progress the story of each character and the ship. I cannot recommend this game for anyone who dislikes tedious and constant back and forth task fetching which, unfortunately in this game, is tied to the quests of the characters you must help to progress the main story. Some characters help you with tasks but their level of help is next to none other than the occasional free resource. I wish you could assign characters tasks so that you could get a move on with the exploration of the map and many islands that, in their own right, are worlds of their own.

I tried rushing through as much of the questline as possible but there's a time where you just snag on waiting for resources, stockpiling glims for upgrades, going back and forth between islands for resources, chests, upgrades, shops. I'm only 20 hours in and I cannot keep my eyes glued to this game just to play minigame after minigame for one little upgrade or building to the ship. It takes too damn long! 

I don't discredit the level of effort that went into this game. It really shows character in a lot of nuanced ways.

Initially I wanted to write a separate review for this but Steam wouldn't let me so I just added onto my old review. I replayed the entire game for a second time almost two years later but I want to primarily focus on the new content here.

I really want to applaud the team how organic the new content updates fits in with the original game. Usually with content updates they don't add anything substantial or meaningful to the story but with this one it's quite to the contrary and the new charcters and story elements elevated the experience for me even more.

It's also interesting bc I already praised the studio for their multidimensional characters in my first review but I feel like the new characters (especially Jackie) feel even more mature in the sense of how believable their characters and motivations are.

Same goes for the nameless spirits on the Overbrook hospital island. I do wonder in what way the pandemic influenced the writing but there are some really strong statements about the state of the healthcare industry and the inherent value of care work in here. And the new updates added a lot of context around Stella's life and personality as well. All in all I really like the new addtions and the QOL changes too (thank god for navigating in the dark). And it was all for free which is really amazing to me. 

Also I didn't mention it in my first review but I think the score is really good and it really makes a big difference in the experience I think. I'm impressed with the composer's (Max LL) versatility with style, genre, instrumentation etc. I'm surprised he isn't more well-known by now. My personal favorites include the music of the Furogawa region, Giovanni's and Astrid's themes, Last Voyage and, strangely enough, the Overbrook theme ([spoiler]I like the duality of it that matches the story[/spoiler]). And the final track over the credits always gets me.

There is much more I'd like to say but I think that's enough for the purpose of a review. I don't want to get into my personal experience with the game too much (though I must say I got teary-eyed when I sent off [spoiler]Giovanni[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Elena[/spoiler] two characters I didn't appreciate much in my first playthrough- two years can make quite the difference huh). Thank you, Thunderlotus Games, for making such an amazing game!


Original review:

So Spiritfarer...huh. What can I say? As you can tell from my time spent inside the game I liked this game. A lot. So much in fact I looked for every little last bit of content: upgrades, hidden chests, side quests, collections, achievements, I've got them all. When I finally finished the game, I cried. For the entire duration of the credits.

I just love this game. Of course it's got its flaws: some minor bugs, the game can be pretty darn grindy and if you have to perform the same tasks over and over, even tiring.  Everything else though is just- it's just so wonderful. It reminds me a lot of Ghibli films, as if you were playing a Ghibli character. The artstyle is absolutely beautiful (which was the reason I initially bought the game). The world building is much more elaborate than I expected which makes the game all the more enjoyable. Make sure you talk to all of the NPCs because a lot of them have something interesting/funny/thoughtful to say and I think a lot of people will miss that.

What I also noticed was that the developers didn't shy away from difficult topics and multi-layered personalities. How the characters were shaped by their life stories. They've got their flaws and burdens and grievances. Those things are what make them feel like real people.

All in all this game was everything it needed to be and so much more. I was very happy to hear Thunderlotus is working on additional content for the game, so keep an eye out for that. Anyone who's reading this I hope you have as much of a great time with this game as I had.",1613133956,1668798657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[hr][/hr]
I really didn't know what to expect when I started playing Spiritfarer.  Sure the reviews are good and the art-style is nicely done, but wow, was I in for a surprise!

You start out as this young girl named Stella, along with her little sidekick cat Daffodil, being tasked with this strange thing called the SpiritFarer.  I'll be honest, it was sort of overwhelming at first, not knowing exactly what a Spiritfarer is and all.  To find these (animal) characters scattered across the seas and to bring them on-board your ship so that you can send them into their afterlife.  It all sounds pretty straight-forward.  However, it is far from it.  Most require objectives that need to be met first before proceeding through the Everdoor.  It's all a mystery on what's going to happen next.

As you're progressing through the game, you'll find out that many of these characters have certain likes and dislikes.  They're affected by other characters around them, by their living situations, and by their food consumption.  Many factors make a difference in how each character acts while on-board your ship.  Some may play music if they are so inclined and satisfied enough.  Others may bring you fish, wood, or treasures they find along the way.  Half the battle is finding out what each individual likes and doesn't like.  It's not a requirement (at least I don't think it is), however if they are satisfied, it helps with your journies and makes for a pleasant experience.

There are many things that I can say as to the reasons why Spiritfarer is such a great game.  From the artwork, to the music, even the base building is quite enjoyable.  However if I was to choose one out of them all it would be Stanley.  I'm not going to ruin it by telling you all how you meet Stanley, but just know that I was caught completely off-guard by his first appearance.  It made me laugh and I'm sure you will too.  But, meeting Stanley for the first time aside, I really enjoyed his enthusiasm and personality.  Stanley made the game quite interesting.

That being said, all of the characters have different personalities and there is bound to be one which you enjoy or can relate to on one level or another.  Be forewarned however, even though this looks like it could be a childs game, it is not.  It is more really made for us adults that are still a child at heart.  Some vulgar language is used and some provocative scenarios are talked about.  I actually think that they could of made the game just as good with leaving those bits out all together.  Not that I mind, but to be family friendly for all to enjoy would have been a fairly easy task for them considering that there is not much of this language or scenes that take place.  I can see why it is kept as well however, considering that the various personalities do and act quite differently, and I'm sure they were wanting to touch on several IRL scenarios which could happen in order to relate.  All in all, it's not a complaint, however just something to mention so that others are made aware of it.

[h1][b]Breakdown[/b][/h1]
[quote]
[h3]Content:  10/10[/h3]
There is enough content to keep one busy for quite some time.  I played for a little over 70 hours, however I had to run a second one partially through in order to get the last achievement.  (Sealed Lips and Loose Lips) You can only choose one.  There may be a way to revert the save file in order to get it with one play-through, but it only takes a couple hours to get to if you know what to do.
[h3]Animations:  10/10[/h3]
It's aspiring to see animations as good as they pulled off here.  From the water reflections to the character movements, all of it was something to behold.  I particularly enjoyed watching Stella and Daffodil's animations.  The few cut-scenes were right on par.
[h3]Graphics/Artwork/Illustrations:  10/10[/h3]
The art-style is simplistic.  There were no corners cut to deliver an above average product.
[h3]Gameplay:  9/10[/h3]
The gameplay is fun, interesting, and overall a pleasant experience.  There is one caveat to this however. 
 Sometimes you have to send characters through the Everdoor in order to progress further into the game.  This, even though being the basis of the game, should not be a hindrance to progression.  I believe some more thought in this area could have benefited the overall player experience.
[h3]Controls:  10/10[/h3]
I used a PS4 controller most of the time and the game recognizes quick swap, so you can swap between k/m or other controllers quite easily without having to restart.  All of the controls are pretty straight forward.
[h3]Reliability:  10/10[/h3]
No complaints here.  The game ran smooth and never crashed or did anything odd.
[h3]User Interface:  9/10[/h3]
Even though the UI is very intuitive for the most part, there are a couple of things that definitely would have helped throughout the experience.  One is the boat ""improving/editing"".  Takes a while to move the in-game cursor to the specific buildings.  Another is a tracker to track your quests and where you need to go.  Also possibly highlighting NPCs who have quests for you.  None of these are game breaking, but with a little more effort and thought into them, it would have really helped the overall experience.
[h3]Music And Sounds:  10/10[/h3]
The music and sounds are one of the best things about Spiritfarer.  The character sounds, the town sounds, even the different event sounds were all just amazing.  If there is one area where Spiritfarer stands above all the rest, it is in their music and sounds.  Also, the song that is played when you complete the game is absolutely fantastic! (I've got to find that song)
[h3]Originality/Story:  10/10[/h3]
No doubt that the story in Spiritfarer is by far one of the most unique storylines that you'll ever come across.  The fact that each character has their own story is a story all in itself.  I believe they tried really hard in order to connect with each person on an individual basis, which is, in my opinion, very difficult to pull off in the short amount of time that someone spends in your game.  Excellent job on this.  Kudos.
[h3]Community Vibe:  10/10[/h3]
The community absolutely loves Spiritfarer!  Go check out some of the reviews and the community posts for yourself.  I'm sure many are looking to see Spiritfarer 2!  (you better be making a 2 lol)

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]

All in all, Spiritfarer is a very well thought out game that is intended for the child in all of our hearts.  [b]There are many things that I can say about Spiritfarer, the gameplay is unique, the storyline is unlike any other, etc, etc, but to simplify it into just one word, Spiritfarer is simply ""beautiful""![/b]  The storytelling, the artwork, the sounds, everything about it is ""beautiful""!  I had an excellent time playing and I look forward to a Spiritfarer 2 someday.  (you better make a 2, lol)  Maybe some guy named Asher and his dog Gio?  haha.

As I posted in the review that I made for our group [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamesyouabsolutelymusthave]Games You Absolutely Must Have[/url] ""If this GYAMH doesn't touch your emotions in some way, check your pulse!""  Because it's true.  There are so many different avenues and personalities within Spiritfarer, that if you can't relate to not even one of them, maybe you need to go outside and touch some grass.  Idk, just a suggestion.

What this game shines in is the setting, characters and the emotional impact this game has. It's a game about death, acceptance of it, inevitability of it and all the various faces of it. It's a very cathartic experience and sometimes it might hit too close to home to be comfortable. And yet, I actually love this game.

The visuals are lovely as well.

On the 'bad' side of things: honestly, some of the characters don't leave the same impact. I won't go into spoilers but while I understand not every character has to be likeable, that fact did dampen my spirits after letting go of the characters I had a great affection for.

It's also quite a chore to play at times. This really isn't a game I played for gameplay, as it can get very grueling/sloggish.

i do not understand the absolute praise the game got.
the game does start strong , the artstyle and animation and music are an absolute joy.
While there is a certain charm and some great moments, most of it is tedious as all hell:
you travel around via boat, and even with the speed upgrades, the boat is sloooow. There is a fast travel system but it only connects key areas, if you want to travel for resources, enjoy it taking forever.
also the map only shows the name of locations once you hover over them with your mouse. have fun moving your mouse around constantly until you find the place you are supposed to go to. why not have the name appear above the location?
some animations take too long.
there is lots of non skippable text that you need to suffer through and in most cases it's the same thing over and over again: enjoy feeding a lion and have him say ""i was hungry like a lion! ahaha like a lion, i'm hilarious"" 100 times or until your sanity allows.
cooking is a big part of the game. you have a recipe book but it does not act as a shortcut, you need to read the ingredients, then go back to the cooking menu and pick the items, again, why?
The more compelling characters are all at the start of the game, they are more grounded and relatable. you might even get a knot in your throat when you have to say goodbye to them, but after that it's a who's who of jerks and weirdos, a bull that's a bully, a snobbish dog, a green (parrot? dimorphodon?) that exists only as a d&d nerd and some hyena i could not be bothered with i decided to opt out at that point and just reach endgame.
does run smooth as butter on the steam deck and will allow some 5 hours of gameplay.
so, while not without charm, and a sometimes, somewhat emotional core, it just drags and is overindulgent",1667843811,1667843811,False,30,3,0.656516849994659424,0,True,False,False

This game essentially tells a series of short stories, and your enjoyment is going to stem from how much you engage with each of the stories. I myself was about to give the game an 8/10, like literally as I was writing this review. Then, I went online, Googled some stuff about two of the spirits, cried for like 5-10 minutes, and decided the game is a 10/10. So your mileage may vary with this game.

Let's start with the positives. In Spiritfarer, you play as Stella, whose job is to guide spirits into the afterlife. As part of this job, you're going to meet various spirits with different personalities, needs, wants, etc… You have to make sure the spirits are fed, their desires are met, and try to make them happy however you can. One way to do this is to literally ""hug"" the spirits. This is such a small thing, but holy shit does it do wonders to make you attached to the characters. I can't think of another game I've played in YEARS where you can simply hug people. 

Typically, each spirit is going to have an ""issue"". Another game tried to tell a story about a character with an ""issue"": Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. A big criticism I had for Hellblade is that it was difficult to get attached to the main character, Senua, because there was pretty much nothing to her except for her ""issue"".  Was Senua a good person? Did she have hopes and dreams? What was Senua's personality like? I don't know the answers to any of these questions, so it was very difficult to get attached to her. Spiritfarer does not make this mistake. The ""issues"" that the spirits have are not the only thing about them. They have distinct personalities, you learn what they're afraid of, what their dreams are, etc… This makes it very easy to get attached to the characters. 

In addition to learning about the spirits, you also have to say goodbye to them by leading them to a place called the ""Everdoor"" (essentially the afterlife). Whenever you do this, there will be a scene that plays with the Spirit's last words. Even if I didn't really care for the spirit, I teared up/cried for every single one of these farewell scenes. The developers really know how to make relatively small things be tear-jerking moments (e.g. hugging, saying goodbye, etc..). Especially the last farewell scene where the credits roll and a song starts playing. T_T T_T T_T

As I mentioned earlier, by playing Spiritfarer you're going to be experiencing a series of short stories, the stories being the lives of the Spirits you encounter. How much you get out of the game depends on how invested you get into each story. Personally, I got invested in 6/14 of the stories, and I REALLY got invested in 2 of the stories, which is why I feel the game is a 10/10.

Having said the above, therein lies a weakness of sorts. Since your enjoyment depends on how much you get invested in the characters, if someone doesn't get invested in any story, they might not enjoy the game at all. It's totally based on a person's life experiences. I feel the game could've benefited from a central lesson being told that connected each short story together. I was hoping for an overarching lesson about life or death or something. Some of my all-time favorite games are Nier Automata, Bioshock Infinite, and Bioshock 1 since they all try to show a lesson that can be appreciated regardless of your life experiences. A small criticism for Spiritfarer, which is an otherwise phenomenal game. 

SPOILERS BELOW

Reading online, there kind of is a ""main"" story connecting all the short stories. Basically, in the beginning of the game you're given an explanation that it's your job to help spirits deal with any unfinished business so that they can move onto the afterlife. However, YOU'RE the one with unfinished business (i.e. Stella). You were a nurse and there were multiple patients/people you wished you could've done more for. The spirits that you see are the people that you're trying to help. However, nothing changes in the end. How the characters die in real life is how they die in this spirit world. You never get to say goodbye to your uncle Atul. Alice still forgets about you. Stanley, a kid, still dies. Etc… There are multiple lessons here. You can't change the past. Death is inevitable. Accept your death. However, just because these lessons exist with the main character, that doesn't mean the lessons connect with all the other short stories. Stella's story is simply another side story to experience, unconnected with the others. She had lessons related to her unfinished business, while other characters had stories related to their unfinished business. The short story about Stella is one of those stories that didn't impact me that much. 

SPOILERS OVER

In regards to the gameplay, Spiritfarer is basically a farming game with some light platforming/exploration thrown in. You take your boat and travel from destination to destination, uncovering islands which in turn hold various resources, spirits, quests, etc… Your boat can only travel during the day, so you basically want to travel during the day and do various farming activities at night. The game does a good job of encouraging exploration since in order to progress further, you'll need specific resources/abilities, so you always wants to find the next island instead of just staying in one place and farming for resources (since no one island contains all the resources you need). I am not exactly a fan of either farming sims or pure platformers, so the gameplay was just ""Ok"" for me. Nothing special. I will say though that I feel the gameplay could've been paced better, as it didn't really keep up with the story. I basically got the currency I needed to buy everything I wanted by like the 15 to 20 hour mark, but there was still like 10 - 15 hours of the game left! So by the mid-late game, I felt like I was just doing a bunch of fetch quests without the gameplay evolving much.

Overall, I am really happy I got to experience Spiritfarer. I am also really happy I spent time looking at other people's interpretation of the stories as it really helped me appreciate the story a lot more. Spiritfarer falls into the category of ""Play it before you die"" for me as it really left an impact on me. Definitely a game to play if you just feel like crying :P",1667696290,1667696477,True,2,0,0.53436809778213501,0,True,False,False

I went into this game knowing nothing of it at all, and left with a beautiful message about grief. In short, the game is about Stella (our main character) that is tasked to be a spiritfarer of the afterlife who fulfills requests from spirits of all places until they are ready enough to let go of themselves. Right off the bat, soundtrack and visuals are amazing, they really help guide you to feel what this game wants to you feel. 

But what in my opinion makes this game one of the best game I've ever played this year is definitely the characters. The characters all have such a unique story to tell, all related to grief, and how they handle it. Yet, in a way, the story only revolves around grief and nothing more. For every spirit you guide in this game, there's no guarantee of a happy ending, every spirit's journey in this game is not about making up for the things they've wronged, more so about coming in terms with what they have faced. 

All people grieve, and this game did very well to get the point across as you see halfway through the gameplay that not all of the spirits you guide are kindhearted and you'll find some of them to be a pain in the ass. The stories, interactions, and just about everything about the characters in this game are extraordinarily well written and it also helps to know that the characters are based on true stories faced by relatives of the developers. 

Delving into the game you will gradually realize clearer than ever that the game is made with passion. As heavy as the topic is however, the game somehow manages to create this line of state for the story where it perfectly mixes afterlife metaphors and real life ""what really happened"" conversations when delivering the stories to the players. And for me, it fits perfectly well with what the game is trying to get through, story wise. For me, it shows that the game doesn't want you to focus too much on the detailed issues of the characters, rather it wants you to understand how they face it. 

Now going through the bad things, one of the main apparent issue me and I would guess other people face in this game is the explorations. Somehow they don't provide any forms of map when setting anchor to an island, and some of the islands in this game are so hard to roam through, with every NPC looking basically the same, you won't know who to interact with to progress through quest without brute forcing your way into talking to all of them. Although, it's not at all game breaking as majority of the time the main quests will not involve talking to the NPCs. 

The second issue I've faced with this game is, as you might've guessed, the gameplay. As does probably almost all of lengthy indie games, they can't provide variously complex gameplays. You'll find yourself less interested playing the same mini game, repeating basically the same stuff, as time went by. But somehow I only found myself not wanting to be bothered at all by the gameplay only after nearing the end of the story, so again, I think this game did well enough to keep the gameplay interesting compared to other lenghty, story driven, indie games.

Overall, it's definitely a 10.5/10 for me, though I can see well the issues this game has, I'm forced to look away as the stories told in this game are some of the most well written stories I've encountered in a game this year.",1667641170,1667642125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a beautiful experience. The art style is nice, and the story telling by each character is unique to them. The game talks about loved ones passing us in a beautiful way, and if you have ever lost someone, odds are one of the characters will highlight a bit of them. I was reminded of my grandmother in one of the characters.

The game is about letting go. Allowing these loved ones to leave. 

The game play is quite enjoyable as well. Traveling and adventuring, upgrading your ship and building it as you see fit, discovering secrets at different locations. 
Some of the game play can be a bit repetitive, like when you are grinding for a lot of a certain material, or farming. But there are small mini-games that you play in order to accomplish these tasks, that are a bit of fun as well. 

Definitely if you'd imagine a stat tree of this game, a lot of the stat points are going to story, and a lot to the visuals as well.

This game is an experience. 

I remember my light up keyboard, and the beautiful art of this game, lighting up my screen, in my room, in the middle of the pandemic. Giving me something to spend some time on, ponder about some of the beauty of life, and to have a good time.

However I found it difficult to return to the game after a break due to the very brief non-descriptive nature of the quest log.

The gameplay mostly takes place on your boat, which you will upgrade multiple times through the course of the game, and on various island scattered throughout the sea. There are clear progression systems in place which makes exploring fairly linear at first, which is a good thing in my opinion. The game feels really huge at the start, so limiting access to certain areas makes it easier to figure out what your current objective is. You never really run out of things to do while you're on your way to certain islands, as you can cook food, water your crops, shear your sheep etc.
The art style and the music goes really well together, and it allows for some emotional moments in the story.

The game is great, and definitely worth full price. Just try to keep track of the time while playing because it's kinda crazy how addicting it is.

This game is gorgeous at everything. Visual, sound, dialogs - all great. Different characters are well thought through. So the game is made reaaally good. But.

From the first minutes you notice that this game was made with love for details and a piece of soul was invested in it. This is a very good project that tells us about accepting death. I admit that few dare to do something similar, right? But the game tells us about this not in a bad and depressing way, but in a melancholic one. Personally, I would call this game quite therapeutic, because it allows us to think about the meaning of life and accept the inevitable, while not driving you into depression, but only gently guiding you, thereby helping to make this process as harmless as possible and even in some sense positive.

She eagerly joined my boat as a passenger. She helped guide me through my first paces as a Spiritfarer, and I felt like we went on an adventure as even more spirits joined the boat. I built her a house and decorated it, and she in turn would help around the boat by spinning threads and buying supplies for me. She would encourage me to collect bright jellies whenever we wandered into a patch of them, despite her fears of them. I would cook her meals, going out of my way to cook foods that I knew she would enjoy. And as we traveled, she was always there to lend advice, or simply her voice.

She was no longer present for the bright jelly events, nobody was spinning threads at the loom anymore, and i wouldn't see her out in the city shopping for supplies.

the gameplay itself, isn't what I expected. I knew there was boat management, but again, i thought story and character would take priority. The game ends up being just doing repetitive chores. Water the plants, feed the guests, and as you get more facilities, chop wood, loom fabric etc. there isnt really any getting around any of these chores. You do have to do them, and every single in game day. To me it takes away from exploration and makes things VERY repetitive.

Then as the hours passed it gradually lost its magic, and in the last 5 hours it simply felt tedious and tiring, like a very long homework which never ends. 

My main problem was that even though the marketing line said ""cozy management"" it was not cozy at all. It was actually very heavy on that front... 

- In the game you have to build always another and another building which is necessary to process the materials to finish quests (and build even more building). And this would be ok, since it is a management game, but every new building is a new minigame, and some are actually interesting (in the first 100 times you do it), but they become so boring, also later in the game some of them are just mindless clicking and a huge waste of time. 
- The resources are the same, some are simple, like chopping trees, but many of the resources are tied to quite long mini games and the first ones are interesting (at the first couple of times), but the rest is just copies of the previous ones with different design and ""story""
- And both the building and the resources could be ok, if with some building or character upgrade you could get the resource without the minigame. The special resources would still work if you could get them without minigames after you did them once (like why do you have to fight the dragons again and again? After the first fight they could simply give you the resource like that huge turtle). Or the building could be managed by the characters on the ship, or you could give them tasks, but they are doing literally nothing...
- Playing with Stella feels like being an errandgirl, the spirits are constantly pestering you, because they are hungry, they want attention, they want different food, they want you to hurry with their quest. Also because you cannot travel at night and you cannot even check the freaking map during the night (In such games I always plan the following day at night checking the quest/resource locations on the map) you are in constant rush to reach the next island/resource in daylight then run up and down the ship to process the materials at night for the quests. It is stressful. 
- The first couple of characters are loveable and cute, but as they leave the ship and the new spirits come, oh my god, they are annoying as hell (like Giovanni and that A*hole hummingbird...)

Your job is simple, the objective is clear.

When you meet a new character, your boat becomes more alive, you get used to your chores without realizing it feels like usual chores. You navigate through many many places and with each side character you meet, the more you will fall in love with this game.
I cannot stress this enough, it's an amazing game. You will cry. A lot. I am not afraid to admit this. It's one of those masterpieces that even if I would like to play again, the departure of any spirit will still hit you like a truck.

972660,122485872,76561198116551445,0,149,959,0,959,1663458732,"There is an exchange in Moby-Dick where a sailor asks the protagonist why they want to join a whaling ship. ""To see the world"" is essentially the response. The sailor directs him to the vast, featureless expanse of the ocean at the end of the dock and asks the protagonist if they've seen enough of the world yet. This game was very reminiscent of that scene.

Where this game tries to shine is in the interactions between the main character and the spirits that they are ferrying to the afterlife, but for me these interactions were at at best shallow and at worst annoying. Unlike other social games the NPCs do not interact with each other in any meaningful way. There are idle animations of them talking to each other, but you cannot eavesdrop, and outside of quest-specific observations they don't tell you how they feel about the other characters. In fact, other that to tell them they're hungry or to start a mini-game, the spirits don't seem to interact with the protagonist outside of quest-specific interactions. Additionally, the protagonist is apparently mute, so most of these conversations are one sided, with the spirits talking *at* the protagonist rather than *to* them. Coupled these one-sided conversations with the fact that the vast majority of interactions with the spirits are them asking/demanding something of me made me feel like a maligned service industry worker who just wanted these spirits off my ship (Except Atul, Atul's cool). I found myself trying to rush through character's quests because, in addition to getting them off my boat faster, that's the only way you learn about them and maybe humanize them. But even that was unsatisfying, as you never really learn enough about them to make them feel real. As a specific example ***MINOR SPOILER*** there is a character that talks about a ""dragon"" that harried them in their life. Naturally I assumed this meant they'd had a heroin addiction. Later it's clarified that this is a euphemism for some mental issue they and their father had had in life and never conquered, but you never find out what it is a euphemism for. Is it anxiety? Greed? Hubris? Guilt? Addiction to heroin? All are possible interpretations by the end of their story. And they do that sort of thing for every character I played through ****MINOR SPOILER OVER**** They hint at depths for these spirits, but never let you dive into them.

Exploration is, exceptionally flat. Locations are filled with literally faceless NPCs, none of them felt distinct or memorable, and past collecting resources and quest-specific tasks there was no real reason to go to any of them. The artwork for the ship upgrades were beautiful, until I ran out of space and had to start stacking them, at which point they looked like a bunch of blocky shipping containers. I found the artwork for everything was beautiful, and I found a lot of the initial interactions with the few non-faceless NPCs quite enjoyable (particularly Albert) but for a game that takes place on an ocean, almost every aspect felt extremely shallow. The fact that everyone is dead and it NEVER comes up is also extremely jarring and opens up a a whole can of worms (like what about the fish you're eating? Are they already dead? Can they die again? Are they still 'alive' when you eat them because they also need to be passed through the Everdoor to truly move on?) but I don't have time to get into that. 

All in all, it's not a challenging game, it isn't trying to be and it shouldn't have to be, but it needs to have something, and I couldn't find anything that I can say was worth the time.",1663599886,1665658209,False,1,1,0.512820541858673096,0,True,False,False

早早入了Spiritfarer，因为不错的画风、对配乐以及类似的作品题材比较感兴趣，但不得不说断续玩了快9个小时还是不太能get到好玩的地方，可能有我个人原因吧但没法提起玩下去的兴趣，所以想来想去最后还是不给recommended了。

游戏的画面是最早吸引我的地方，旅行的元素同样会让我觉得与大家共同构建家园然后再给人家送走独具一格，就是游戏的玩法属实不太能接受。整个游戏的大概流程就是从接人上船、给人跑腿、把他送走，同样有一个目标系统随时提醒你还有什么没做，我也可以在船上种种菜搞搞养成，给自己升升级，这其实也都没啥，玩法上也中规中矩。

我不太能接受我在有一个这样的养成模式下游戏[u][b]节奏很乱[/b][/u]，比如我去浇水要等动画、我去炼矿的时候甚至要自己跑腿一遍遍地控制熔炉温度。这些动画或者小细节会给我一种明显在放慢游戏节奏的感觉，但是一堆灵魂和objectives还催着我规划今天去哪明天去哪的，把资源安排得紧凑合理，结果就很膈应。

[u][b]游戏的引导[/b][/u]感觉做的很模糊，比如Atul中间想吃pork、或者Summer想要一些宝石、或者破冰扩图，游戏虽然给了很多目标但任务引导上我没感觉出比较合理的逻辑，这导致我卡了好多任务在任务栏里甚至有的不知道怎么做，还花了很多时间在地图里面瞎跑找资源，干很多重复的寻找。

剧情上，除了我个人还挺喜欢Atul的，但像Gwen、Summer以及后面的Astrid、Alice等故事感觉还是比较松散，确实讲了很多，但我依然觉得云里雾里的，更像是一个散文（？）

即便如此，Spiritfarer的画面和[u][b]配乐、音效[/b][/u]确实要吹，比较印象深刻的是在Thunder harvest里面打雷的音效结合Atul的曲子很令人享受。采雷的时候雷声给我一种很干脆利落而不是低沉的感觉，搭配上Atul吹的欢快，会让我觉得自己更多是在没有顾虑的撒欢而不是单纯的采集材料完成任务。

原声里面的Spiritfarer本曲也很喜欢，感兴趣可以去听一下，其实游戏里很多地方的曲子都是主题的变奏（比如你在地里对草弹琴的那个曲子）


[h1]总结[/h1]
精美手绘、顶级配乐，但是迷惑在种田模式里享受生活同时却催我完成任务，也没有找到奇怪的资源在哪里，本体剧情更像是一个艺术品吧。
也许把一些中规中矩的养成元素去掉，老老实实做一个艺术品反而会让我享受很多。",1664899863,1664899971,False,2,0,0.515759289264678955,0,True,False,False

What a player is promised is a game where we help spirits of the deceased get to the afterlife, which assumes the player will learn their stories get attached to said spirits throughout the game, with some management mechanics, such as building houses and cooking for them.

However, as I've been playing, it looked like some of those very spirits we were supposed to empathize with were deliberately created to make you roll your eyes every time they start talking. The amount of cliche daddy issues illustrated in the game is far beyond healthy, [spoiler] making me not feel bad when as I brought them to the Everdoor. [/spoiler] While the game definitely offers a great variety of characters, some of them are utterly ridiculous [spoiler] , such as a ton of unskippable riddle-heavy statements from an apparently schizophrenic bat. In all that circus, even grumpy Bruce and Mickey seem like alright characters. [/spoiler] That being said, despite being marked as emotional and story rich, the most I was able to feel while playing this game is a feeling [b] remotely resembling mild sadness. [/b]

Now for the management part. It feels like the game was constantly made hold the player hostage, by making them wait for [b] everything [/b] to happen. Want to progress in a spirit's quest? Wait a few days for them to do something first (in one particular case it took a spirit 6 in-game days to allow you to progress). Want a specific resource that only appears in 2 locations on the entire map? Well, make sure to sail there first on your turtle of a ship. Oh, also, you can't go anywhere at night, so how about we spend some more time on nothing! You will also be encountering such issues as not having enough space on your ship to have all stations and houses that you need, which of course will drain even more of your time

There is not much to say in regards of animation and soundtrack, these are really good, and I could say this is where the developers put the most efforts, unfortunately

To sum it all up, we have a game that takes about 15-20 hours to complete, and looking back you won't be able to answer what took you so long. The good moments are too few and far between to call it a good game, with huge emphasis on wasting time and making you like unlikeable characters (in all fairness, there were good ones, too). With that said, I can't say it's an awful game, but it's definitely not enough to call it good, and my biggest regret is not playing it, but rather playing it for as long as I have.

THE GOOD

First of all, this game just looks stunning! Everything is so beautifully animated, from locations to character movements. Character design is especially impressive, with each character looking like they came straight from Studio Ghibli movie. It was just a joy to look at the whole time and its what drew my attention to the game in the first place. Sound design and soundtrack compliment the visuals perfectly and together they create this very relaxing and magical atmosphere. 
When it comes to gameplay, Spiritfarer tries to be many things and it actually pulls it off. Game revolves around you sailing your ship around an open world archipelago discovering new locations and finding spirits to join your crew. You must build housing for your new friends and cook them food to keep their spirits up but in order to do so you must build various resource-production buildings and engage in side activities like fishing and all sorts of minigames. So its an exploration/resource management hybrid at first glance but then you come to a new island and you have to engage in some platforming to explore its secrets and later in the game, in order to gain access to new areas, you must upgrade your ship and unlock new abilities making Spiritfarer also a sort of metroidvania. It seems like a lot but each part of the game is done in just the right amount so it all works well together. Controls are very simple and there is no combat at all yet the game is far from boring.
But the heart of Spiritfarer are its story and characters and..my eyes were very wet a few times. Without spoiling anything..no matter how fantastical it looks on the outside, on the inside its an incredibly human story that most of us can relate to. Its about life and death, about family and friendship and ultimately about leting go. Your job is to find these spirits, care for them and then eventually let them go. And its hard to let them go because each of them is expertly written and some of them will probably remind you of someone you know or knew..or loved. Its a beautiful story worthy of praise.

THE BAD

As much as I want to say that Spiritfarer is perfect..its not. It does have some problems or, better said, fluff without which it would have been a tighter experience. Biggest offender are these minigames called events ingame. There is a lot of them but the problem is they are all the same event reskined multiple times. They all revolve around you jumping around your ship collecting various shiny objects that can be turned in less common materials for crafting. These materials imo are just a time sink because there is plenty of other materials that are more than enough. These events are fun and interesting the first few times you play them but my guess is that everyone skips them afterwards. 
The other thing is grinding. While it never got so bad that it made me quit the game, the more I played the more boring crafting and hunting down materials became. I always grow bored really fast with resource management games because they are too grindy or needlesly complex (looking at you Graveyard Keeper!) but it wasnt so bad here. Noticable..but not too bad.
And..backtracking. There is a lot of it. You will be returning to same locations over and over again following quests. Its not bad while you have stuff to do on your ship but once your buildings are upgraded and you're stocked with materials it becomes really annoying. There is a fast travel system though...its not perfect but it did help.

VERDICT

With all that negative stuff said..I do love this game. There is zero replayability here but that is kinda the point. Its a game about letting go and once you seen and done everything its time to let go and move on. 
I think a few less minigames and a bit less crafting would help Spiritfarer a lot. It took me a bit over 40 hours to complete it and I feel if it was 30 hours long it would be perfect. Removing fluff and focusing on story more would make this a perfect game. Still..I enjoyed my time spent in this wonderful world and it did make me quite emotional a few times and games that can do that are rare and I always fondly remember them. And I'm really interested in whatever Thunder Lotus has next in store for us.

The idea of adding minigames in some rooms on the boat is a great idea. My girl friend is able to play any of them without any problem.

There is only one issue in the game for casual gamers. It's about the ropes, which require to press Up on the controller to grab them. In some areas in the game, the player need to run, double jumps, then press Up while holding Left, or Right on the controller between ropes. My girl friend, as a casual gamer, is not able to press on to many buttons combined together. When she try to double jump while pressing Left, or Right, she forget to press Up most of the time to grab the rope, or she press Up while releasing the Left or the Right button too soon and fall all the way down at the bottom of the area. Sometime, she is able to grab the first rope, but she is never able to reach the second one. Every time we reach one of those areas, my girl friend rage quit, then I must complete the area alone, then return to the main menu to play coop again.

In this game, there is no way for one player to wait at the beginning to let the other player to reach the top part of the area, because the camera always try to make both players visible.

It is a genuinely nice experience so far but it's such a slow burn and depending on who you are as a person that can be either a good thing or a bad thing. This game is clearly meant to be an emotional experience as you help characters in the final moments of their lives and lead them towards their end. It's kind of hard to gauge how long you can expect this game to be because I have yet to finish it despite nearly having 25 hours as of writing this but for the longest time the game was telling me I was at 20% around hour 20~22 and then suddenly just jumped 30% after an hour or two of rapid progression because of the way this game is paced. 

There are resources locked behind certain things or upgrades that essentially require you to just play out the game until you can get them and then suddenly gain access to a whole new tier of stuff. This is pretty typical all things considered but it kind of comes off as frustrating in this game since you kinda just twiddle your thumbs once you've done everything in the current tier and are just constantly sailing around while farming resources going from point A to point B, C, D, etc doing your quests. Sometimes you're asked for things you won't get for another hour or two. A great example is Atul who asks for porkchops really early on and despite getting that quest within the first hour of the game I didn't even have access or know where to get them until like 6 hours later. Even then processing resources takes a long time to do. 

My biggest issue with this game by far is the severe lack of quality of life aspects. I feel like the moment I load up my file I immediately remember all the things that sour the experience. Things like being unable to uproot a tree from the orchard so you're forced to dismantle the entire building and then replant the seeds which are relatively expensive/rare and since they produce indefinitely you're not typically going to buy a stock of them since you only need one. Or because of an achievement to collect all the sheep in the game you can't actually get rid of them once they're on your ship despite being worthless the moment you no longer need wool. The constant need to be sailing all over the map that takes so many steps to do anything but at night you lose the ability to sail so you're just dead in the water but if you sleep you miss out on upkeep time but then at the same time doing so means you're just spending minutes that add up to hours just running around watering plants, checking the windmill, cooking food, etc. The night time was clearly intended to force the player to handle these tasks that all pile up but at the same time it would be nice to make some progress towards the next destination while doing so. 

Additionally, boy howdy, the animations of this game are both a blessing and a curse. It's nicely animated and the characters are nice and diverse (specifically the key characters, all the other spirits being the exact same don't really count here) but god do the animations hang on for far too long. People who don't like waiting are bound to be frustrated by how long these animations play out. Caught a fish? Stella will just do one fist pump and hang it there for like 5 seconds before you can fish again, effectively making canceling fishing and starting again miles faster. Watering plants takes 2 or 3 seconds which isn't a lot but it adds up when you've got 3 fields per building and like 4 buildings making that task alone take a minute or so every single time you need to do it which is multiple times a day if you're really keeping up on it. Mining wants you to release the action key as late into the animation as you can but if you go too long the lgiht overloads and stella just sits there shielding her face for like 5 seconds before making a move towards recovering. It's all just agonizingly slow paced and so many things could be sped up to make it less of a pain to deal with. 

It's a beautifully made game but the core gameplay is so slow for no real reason other than to pad your play time and if you don't resonate with the characters then there really isn't much for the experience after that. The game tries to force you to take it slow which can make it very frustrating to play at times when you're just trying to advance the plot. I don't think I'd say its worth 30 usd but maybe if you grab it on a sale it could be something worth giving a try.",1663848763,1664089010,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is decent, I like the house boat idea, but a game like this hangs on whether the story is good, and this is where it fails.

 The characters bar two are miserable to be around, which is a shame because they are the centrepiece of the game, and you are stuck with them for so long. Most of their storylines end with them randomly doing something grossly out of character and then asking you to take them to the afterlife. The writers also clearly have a deeply nihilistic outlook on life which affects the characters attitudes towards their deaths in a way that blunts potential for thought provoking moments (I think only the character Jackie had something interesting to say when commenting on his imminent death), I also was not a fan of the late game twist, even though I saw it coming from a mile away, since it was the narrative equivalent of ""it's all a dream"". Also ran into a few bugs, especially in coop ( random disconnected of the second controller that require the game to be quit, second player freezing in place until the first player does something, NPCs getting lost when their AI demanded they be in two places at once). As much as I got some good play time out of the game, I recommend that you save yourself the frustration and play a different game.

To the developers, you have talent, art and gameplay were a solid base, but you need to put your writers on less challenging material, even religion and philosophy struggle to make good commentary on death, it probably wasn't the best topic to tackle if you weren't prepared for it.

Spiritfarer is unique in theme and story, it tugs at your hearstrings in a way that many games will never even attempt to. Everything in that regard is special, flawed, far from perfect, but it is certainly an experience that you might need, even if you don't think you do..

But the rest of the game is a grind, a sequence of chores and tedious minigames that you have to repeat ad nauseam. You have one upgrade that doubles the output of any of the... 6-7 different crafting stations, and that's it. No automation, no ability to skip doing the same minigame for the 30000th time. Go here, go there, get this, get this back, make this, make that, repeat another million times.

It is your chance to feel like you're participating in a big-budget animated blockbuster with the heart of a Studio Ghibli film. The core of this game includes awe-inspiring animations, a management aspect that keeps you busy without stress, a heartfelt story, and you'll ugly cry at least once. Spiritfarer is a thing of beauty, but it comes with a few caveats.

- As Stella (the Spiritfarer) becomes closer with the spirits under her care, having them say the five things repeatedly makes interactions a chore.
- There were many points where I had zero quests in my log and no clue what I was supposed to do next, which sucked before you gained functions that allowed faster travel.
- The fetch quests started to drag as you headed towards the end of the base game.
- I also found that having the DLC content right there made figuring out where the base game ends difficult.

The whole game seems like a huge fetch quest. Go here, get this, go there, deliver that. I kinda don't mind, if not because of the things I'm going to mention below.

Every time you travel between islands you have to wait because the ship travels in real time. Even when you use fast travel, you still need to slowly sail some distance. You can't even alt+tab out of the game while traveling, because the whole game will pause. This is so frustrating.

You can do some mini games while sailing, like fishing, cooking, sewing, cutting woods, but just like most mini games, it gets boring after a while, and you have to do those mini games frequently to progress through the story.

The ship passengers get hungry and sad often, so you have to cook for them and hug them to keep them happy. You can't even feed them the same items twice in a row, and everybody has different preferences. This is annoying. They are freeloading on my ship and I still have to spoon-fed them all the time!

I force myself to complete one person's whole quest, and the story seems interesting. However, I just can't stand to keep doing the boring repetitive tasks any longer, and the whole waiting while sailing is such a waste of time. I suppose this slow-paced game is just not for me.",1663701399,1663701399,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are so many new things to discover and explore! The world, which is set in the ocean, has stationary towns and islands, but also changes, with new shipwrecks to uncover or more creatures to catch. You can choose to progress forward, or grind for items/money (glims) - or a bit of both! The game is fluid, with a path to an ending, but so many options on how to get there. The movements are intuitive, with most actions coming naturally. The music is so soothing, I actually barely notice it's there. And the sound effects are just ON POINT.

All characters are genuine and feel very real, their stories are all relatable in some way and you can't help but love them all, regardless of how flawed they may be.

The music stands out as being at the very top of any game soundtrack I've heard before, still listening to it at least weekly ever since I've finished playing, alongside Gris, Transistor, Chicory and Mutazione. I would recommend the game for that alone. Makes me absolutely bawl every time and I can't help but being grateful for it.

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
In a world covered by a vast ocean, people come together to build their cities on islands, thus making all types and sizes of boats become something vital and part of the culture of this world. They are so important that even the ferryman of souls, the legendary Charon, has his own boat for when he goes to fetch the souls of those who are close to the day of they departure from this world, but even the legendary ferryman gets tired after eons of doing this service, and now wants to make the passage to rest. ^^

Not before choosing not one, but two successors to his position as a boatman, these two are the young girl Stella and her cat Daffodil, who one fine day wake up on an isolated island in front of the old boatman, who names them the next ones, to assume the title that belonged to Charon. Now in possession of the new title and a somewhat old boat, but nothing a few repairs won't fix, our duo must navigate the islands, learning about their new role and gathering resources, as they search for the souls of those close to their final rest, and so together with the player, help them to resolve any pending issues in this world, before crossing into the afterlife. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Beautiful arts of the characters and scenarios, along with several very well done animations, both for moments in the story and in the various activities that we can do during the adventure.
+ So relaxing soundtrack that perfectly matches the various moments and locations of the game, combined with sound effects that make this world even more vivid.
+ In my opinion, the game is very fun, with several activities to do, charismatic and unique characters to meet, several improvements to the boat that can be customized and a different and interesting story.
+ So much to explore and discover, there's always something new to explore, whether it's an undiscovered fish to catch, what resources a new island might have. Just the cooking part, for example, has a repertoire of over a hundred recipes just combining ingredients.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Many resources have a mini game to collect or refine, some of them even increasing the amount produced when done perfectly. I found these mini games fun, but for those who don't like it, it may not be very satisfying.

[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]
A young girl and her cat, in a pose of great powers and a boat in need of some attention, this is how our protagonists' adventure begins, sailing through the islands in search of people who are not far from their great rest, when these When people are met, they reveal the true form of their spirit and move to the boat, where they travel seeking to resolve any pending issues from the past, be they places, objects or memories, in order to achieve peace and be ready for the next stage. ^^

But it's up to our young boatwoman to decide the route of this trip, after all, even though it's close to leaving for the afterlife, the boat's passengers still need food every day and each of the passengers has their own list of things they like and do not like, thus making it necessary to plant and what is not possible to collect to produce delicacies that please them. Another point is comfort, as passengers like to have their own rooms that resemble their old homes and to produce them, resources are needed. The more things passengers like are done, the happier they are, and the greater their happiness, the more they help on the boat. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
Produced by the Thunder Lotus Games studio, all I can say is that I am shocked by the incredible quality of the arts and animations, all very well made and very beautiful, at various times I was really distracted just watching the arts, or just stopped watching the character animations. Something enhanced by the incredibly relaxing soundtrack, I found it very pleasant to listen to while exploring and discovering more of the story, always positively punctuated by good sound effects from the environment or the various activities that we can do. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Spiritfarer caught my attention the first time I saw it as it seemed to be a different adventure game, and I was really happy when I saw that it was that and much more. With a vast and unique world to explore, lots of things to find, discover and make, a colorful and very interesting cast of characters both those who become passengers and others, a different and very interesting story, complete with an amazing art and soundtrack that I will definitely remember for a long time. All this makes this game that I highly recommend for everyone who likes a good story, with a vast and beautiful world to explore. ^^

The good part: it's an amazing game as far as characters and sheer beauty. I have never had a game make me literally sob out loud, but the characters really touch you and it is so hard to let them go. The artwork, particularly the sunrise and sunset art on the ship, is just stunning. Many of the minigames are fun, and the crafting is amusing, works well, and leads to a funky, surreal-looking village-ship. 

The bad part: for me, I hated the platforming mechanics and the sudden ramp-up in difficulty for some of the later quests. I didn't finish the game because there is literally nothing I will ever enjoy about trying to make the same jump 357 times because it requires intense concentration and precision, only to fail at the next leap and have to start all over. I loved the people and characters but in the end I hated the game play.

Biggest problem of the game is pacing. Some quests are meant to take longer than others, and if you just happen to leave those quests for later, or approach certain areas in an unintended order, as I did, you may encounter long periods of waiting for things to happen.

This game is like 50% crafting, 40% waiting (slow animations, super slow ship, fast travel just sucks, NPCs ask to come tomorrow), 9% primitive and uninspiring exploration, and 1% crying that you're here for. The problem is that the game is wayyyy too long for its own good as everything gets beyond tedious and basically broken in late-game.

Spiritfarer is amazing in the first 1/3 of your progress:
+ Tons of things to do
+ Lots of places to be
+ Everything is exciting
+ You can chill out and really take it in
+ Incredibly likeable characters
+ You love taking care of them
+ You cry like a biтсh when they go

Then flash-forward ANOTHER THIRTY HOURS or so:
- Characters include a pathologic cheater, a violent criminal, and other unlikeable people
- I dump them at the Everdoor in bulk to save me a trip, I don't care anymore
- Every single thing has been crafted in excessive amounts
- You've been to every location at least several times over
- THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO YOU JUST IDLE
- Quests are literally ""wait 2 in-game days to be able to progress, 6 times over""
- There is no time skip and one in-game day takes 30-40 real-time minutes or so
- Every late-game quest is ""go to three distant locations all over the map""
- The ship is very, very slow at max upgrade and fast travel is still crap
- There is nothing left to craft anymore
- ""Run in background"" option does not actually work (game pauses on focus loss anyway)
- Meditation to skip time has been cut from the game
- IT'S SO BORING I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE
- RELEASE ME TO THE EVERDOOR

I just wish was the game was shorter. Like half as long. Or less. It starts nice but to actually finish the game (let alone 100% it) it's so incredibly tedious and boring. At least 20 real-life hours sunk into it feel like a complete waste of time. And another 20 spent on just crafting things - which isn't bad, but I'd do with ~5.

EDIT: any% speedrun of this game is clocked at 5 hours. A speedrun. Of any%. Five hours. Christ. My 100% run took 45 hours - and I've used guides and cheatsheets extensively.",1663162800,1663249045,False,24,1,0.622593224048614502,0,True,False,False

Some of the game can be a bit tedious, having to go back and forth and the keyboard controls are sometimes so tricky that I thought I was doing it wrong and went looking for alternatives, only to hit a dead end and look it up online and realise I was actually doing the right thing in the first place, just badly. (For example, you can climb to Susan and the CEO as soon as you have Double Jump, but I couldn't quite get it to work so I was convinced I was doing something wrong. But you also can't really progress without talking to them, so I spent a lot of time faffing around trying to figure out what I was missing. Maybe if you have more platformer experience this won't be an issue? I don't know how much of this ""issue"" was me/my keyboard.)

Overall, I'm enjoying this game. The artwork and stories are beautiful and interesting. I do find the Everdoor (gate?) super slow but I realise that's kind of the point: to slow down and take a moment to appreciate each spirit as they leave the world. I still want to hash all the keys to make it HURRY UP and get it over with, though, despite enjoying slow games. I just hate sitting there not being able to do anything; you aren't even rowing, you're literally sitting there doing nothing as the scenery passes you by for what seems like hours.

Its not really ideal for children despite the art style given the heavy swearing some characters do or certain subject matters that come up but it is an experience a lot of older audiences will likely enjoy. Especially when you are someone who has experienced loss in your life.

Spiritfarer captured my heart so completely and utterly that it might actually be a cognitohazard.

It's not perfect. I personally found myself getting less attached to the characters in the last third of the game, and generally just hurrying through their quests as quickly as I could - with a few exceptions - but overall the rest of the game vastly outweigh that slight fumble.

- This game's BEST part is characters, all incredibly unique and special to the point where you get so invested it hurts to let go of them (prepare to cry for a few)
- Pretty simple but very strong story that unfolds in a well paced way
- This game manages to make running a boat and catering to passenger's needs RELAXING (there's no penalty for not doing it well enough, do it at your pace)

The ONLY downsides:
- Peaks mid-way through in terms of best characters and gameplay flow
- Too grindy at the end, slows down progression of character's and main story's quests by quite a lot

Other than being a little bit grindy at the end, which hopefully you won't mind if you get invested enough like I did ;) , this game is almost flawless!

I really wanted to like this game because of how beautiful yet heart wrenching it can be, but a lot of it is just a nagging grind w/o QoL features, mechanics that stop/slow you down, and is oddly paced. If anything, the game barely allows you to connect with the characters and Stella's story, the only aspect I was truly drawn to.

People also might argue that the it makes sense for the relationships to be fragmented as it's realistic, but to be honest, it's just not entertaining when you can't connect to the characters with their small amount of dialogue especially since (spoilers) [spoiler] this journey turns out to be Stella's, the mute protagonist who's story we've only been told about rather than experienced (besides the menial tasks as a caregiver, her alleged relationships, and her moving about).

The platforming is mostly pretty simple and shouldn't slow anyone down; I'm below-average at these games, and even so I was able to handle that side of the gameplay without issue except for one embarrassing moment where I forgot an ability the game had introduced early on, only for me to not need it for roughly 9 hours of the game.

It masquerades as a quasi-city builder/crafting game but the size of the boat is so small it just feels pointless. It might have worked better with more gameplay elements or less, but the way it works seems like a chore to get through to see the story.

I've been playing the co-op mode with my gf since I got the game, and it's quickly become one of our favourite activities. One of the best aspects is how the resource-management and base-building mechanics are seamless for a two-person experience - there's no ""little brother"" mode like some co-optional games have (see early Binding of Isaac Rebirth). It's a ton of fun and very intuitive, and the only hitch is that it felt like we often we a step ahead of the game in unlocking new buildings.

It DOES have some problems, some things aren't... telegraphed well.
My complaint boils down to, I missed getting an ability because I didn't have the prerequisites, and when I met the prerequisites, I forgot to go back and grab the ability. Nothing notified me to go back and get the ability - despite this game being full of menus and reminders of where you are.
So I went on, found a place to use the ability and... when you haven't unlocked it, you still do the thing *just a little*. And so I thought it was a me problem, not doing it right (and this is what the internet said too, when I looked it up - it's clear I'm not the first person with this problem). But no, I just never got the ability. Nothing said, ""hey, you're missing the ability to do this correctly."" I moved on, decided to keep going and come back.
I missed a spirit, I missed items I should've had halfway through the game until the very end, I missed other additional abilities. The pacing of the game was WAY OFF as a result - I started getting these after I was prompted to end the game.
I do still love this game. But, it could stand to be improved.
Looking forward to my playthrough with my husband, if he comes up against this, I can guide him.

Frustration with pacing in my playthrough, and attempting to fix what I thought was a ""me"" problem by repetition the point my wrist hurt when it wasn't a ""me"" problem at all, all that aside, this game is great. It's sad though, some of these spirits' circumstances hit you like a ton of bricks. The first spirit I let go, it sucked, but I was okay. The second one left me sobbing.

Started to play this on Steam, and for some reason got tired of it (That's the ^hours). I can say now that it wasn't enough time, and I wasn't in a good mindset at the time.
I then started to play it on my switch a couple of months later (starting in early Feb 2021 I think?). I don't know what exactly changed for me between then and now, but it was enough for me to finish it.
p.s. my switch says that I have played ""20 hours or more"", and I plan to replay this game here on steam once more characters are released and I'll likely try to 100% it.

The game tag ""Emotional"" is no joke.
I laughed, I cried, I kept moving though it.
If you have a computer that is more powerful than a switch, then you shouldn't have frame drops in certain situations due to what i assume is the amount of loaded entities/particles.

My overall review would be similar to Yatzee's Review (from the yt channel The Escapist).
I wholeheartedly recommend this game if you need to process mental stuff. or even if you don't; it may bring up things that you didn't know you need to process.

Edit Sept 4th 2022 (Steam says 45.2hrs): Played through to 100% save file, took me about 40 hours (I played it quite casually). The extra content and characters that were added were of good quality. I again laughed, cried, and  hugged as many as I could.

Spiritfarer is a great game. It is able to do things that other games failed doing so. More than once I can feel the developers exploring themes and with anecdotes exploring real people with real lifes. I feel like I knew people that would fit most characters in this game, and the game gives you the opportunity of seeing sides of said people that you can only imagine or speculate in real life. It may sound weird, but more than once the game fit things I've went through. This may as well be a me thing, but I cannot omit this from my view of this piece.

About gameplay, the game has a huge problem with pacing and grinding, something that it does hit it really badly. The amount of items needed for most things is insane, the upgrades to alleviate this problem comes way too late in the game and you'll find yourself going back to the same places for things that are meaningless. Even though the cooking system is great and there's beautiful art for it, it feels under used. Once you discover one or two dishes that someone may like you rarely is encouraged to explore unless for your own curiosity in seeing said beautiful art. Most of the things you have to do end up feeling like chores, and there's mechanics that makes the most active tasks useless. The animations are beautiful but because you have to grind the same thing a lot of times you'll get sick of some of them, like puling vegetables out of the ground, cutting trees or Smithy, the worst minigame.
Everything else feels good, didn't get any bugs or problems with the game.

The art is impeccable, you will not find a game like this one out there. Spiritfarer is unique in its style, animation and polish, everything fits together really nicely, it's a world you'll find yourself noticing small details, stuff that you get impressed they put in there, that's how much the team cared. From characters, to scenario, to VFX, SFX, UI, writing, everything art/asset related is perfect. I've found myself always being surprised by that.

The game shines in all parts, it pains me to give a harsh critic on gameplay but that is necessary, if that was streamlined or had a mode that cut the necessary cost for most things in half this game would be A LOT better.

I will not spoil anything, I just want to say that if you dealt with loss in any shape or form in your life, this game is something that you may find comfort in. It's very tender, warm and sober. I'll refrain from talking about it given it's the real diamond in this project.

I do recommend Spiritfarer, I would say it is a must buy and play if it was shorter, more streamlined, less grindy, still I think it's one of the best experiences I've ever had with a game. It's weird to say, but I feel the hug mechanic isn't just for the characters, I feel like the intention of the developers behind this was to hug whoever could relate to the themes in here. I'm thankful for this, I'm happy a game like this exist. I'm grateful.

So, TL:DR: If you are the patient, introspective kind of people, or maybe if you're dealing with loss and grief yourself, BUY THIS GAME, it is fantastic. Enough said.

So, as my personal experience with this little gem...

This game really got to me. I got it a while ago, I don't remember when, but I played a little of it, got kinda bored, moved on. It sat on my library for a while, until a couple weeks ago I decided to give it another shot on a whim. And the experience has been unique. I'm still processing what just happened, and it has just dawned on me how different of a person I was when I played it the first time to now. So, story time.

Two years ago, my grandmother passed away, but it was miserable. She got really sick, and I helped my mother take care of her on her last months. She couldn't even talk. Brain tumor. And it came out of nowhere: One day she was fine, the next we had to carry her on a wheelchair to her bed. I'm pretty old (27 right now) but that was my first experience facing death so directly, and it left a pretty big impact on me.

Now, this year my father is sick. He's quite and older gentleman (81) and his kidneys don't work anymore. Since December of last year, I have been helping take care of him. I take him to the hospital, I give him his medication and treatment, I change his diapers. I'm no nurse, but this year I spent so much time inside the hospital that I learned a lot about how people deal with grief. And I had to face some pretty dark moments, all by myself, since I am also pretty unwell and have been for a long time now.

So, me being in this headspace, dealing with my own inner demons and trying desperately not to crumble to pieces, I decided to play this game. And it broke me, multiple times. I saw people I know in the characters, I saw parts of myself too. One character in particular, a pretty unlikable hyena, struck me the most. From his struggles to what he says towards the end, I saw myself. And it hurt real bad. As I said, I'm still processing what I just experienced, and I'm not sure if I'll do a good job at that. But that is one of the most important, hopeful and heartbreaking lessons of this game: How we deal with the pain is entirely up to us. We can't control death, but we can control how we react to it. And that thought can be really uplifting to some, and terrifying to others. I know, because I've been so close to death lately, and I've felt both ways.

A game, or any piece of art really, that can move someone so deeply, and can provoke such intense emotions and thoughts, deserves to be experienced. You deserve to play this game, if only to appreciate the beauty of the animations and the music. And hopefully, after you play it, you'll think a little about yourself and the people around you, and realize that we all are going to die someday. And that's OK.

Gameplay is simple but fulfilling: you know what you have to do to advance to the next mission, and everything is quite straight forward. There are some minigames, like fishing and catching lightnings that give some additional variety, but I find that the main appeal to keep playing comes from the joy of further improving your ship and meeting new characters. To this respect, I think that the other characters and spirits that Stella meets are one of the best I have seen in this type of videogames. They are greatly designed and they have rich and complex stories that interwave with Stella's own story. This depth to the narrative together with the gorgeous aesthetics make Spiritfarer one of the best ""relaxing games"" I have played lately.

You can collect things through cooking recipes, gathering, fishing etc, play minigames to gather materials, create items and buildings, and go to shrines to improve your abilities. As you fulfill the requests you learn more about the animals backstory and why they're saying goodbye. This is what the game revolves around, learning their stories (through bad monologues unfortunately). In the end you learn about your own. A lot stays unexplained though and for some of the characters it makes no sense why they're included in the game, even after spending so much time on them.

This game really takes a couple of hours to get good. In the beginning I thought it was going to suck and I wasted my money, but stick with it. The dialogue unfortunately doesn't improve and stays absolutely horrible and cringy with all the swearing for no reason and very forced cringy 'wisdom' the characters are constantly spouting. Especially at the everdoor. It's so bad and really drawn out too, you can't skip those monologues. There were maybe 3 characters in the game with believable, passable dialogue. I wonder if they had an actual writing team or if a guy by himself who got carried away. 

I also don't understand a lot of the character choices, there weren't many main characters so why were 2 of them so similar (bird & porcupine)? Others were just extremely unlikable and it made no sense why they were in the game. I still don't know how the main character related to the bull & hummingbird. As a whole the characters didn't seem a coherent bunch if you put them together and it made it the whole game feel a lot more sloppy than it could have been. It's a story based game.. Make sure the characters and their monologues are good and the story makes sense..

I also thought it was a real shame they didn't give a realistic interaction after finding out certain things after big, drawn out quests (the lion and the lynx). The end to those felt hollow and rushed combined with the annoying monologues and the long build up. Some characters were well done though. Like the two with progressing dementia. That was believable and actually sad. You felt for them. I wish they kept it going at that level instead of taking you 'out' of the story with the poorly done stuff. The owl was super cliche and cringy as well. Why wasn't he incorporated in the ending (again after the big build up, multiple achievements) in some way instead of that long ass song you couldn't skip? 

BUT it is a fun game to pass the time with if you have nothing else, I'd give it a 6,5/10 and it's worth about 30-40 hrs of gameplay. It is a weird combo of the top notch cutesy visuals and very wholesome elements like the hugs and the cooking etc, with cringy/edgy dialogue to suffer through. And the plot holes and rushed goodbyes after collecting tons of carrots and peaches for nothing for example. What was the point?  

The decor saves the game by being really varied and nice as you travel around (but why is the cow in a completely different art style LOL) and it's a very easy game to get through, you just kind of gather what you need along the way to level up your boat. So there is little grinding for materials or any hard puzzles or quests. The focus is on the story. But I personally didn't like the characters and the underwhelming story that much. The artwork, gameplay and easy navigating on the boat saved it for the most part.",1661433084,1661433084,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The puzzles, crafting, farming, and general adventuring parts are a ton of fun. The minigames are imaginative and don't get dull. The spirits are (mostly) delightful (and my only real complaint with one is his moral character, but he's still well-written). In short, if those are elements you are looking for in a game, I RECOMMEND this game. 
But if the topic of death can be an issue, then you may share my grave dislike of the ending.

SPOILERS AHHHEEEADDD

Edited massively from here on.

This is a game about closure. For the spirits, and for us--Stella. Its about moving on and letting go and how sometimes you really never DO get that closure you need. Everyone is different, has different pasts and worries and troubles, and that leaves different wounds. Wounds that heal, and wounds that don't.

It's not an easy game, emotionally. Death never is, and this game is mature in its handling of it--its not always fair, its never without sadness, and it leaves an empty ache.

My previous complaint was in how--real or not the game was, but in a way, I don't think it matters. Whether this is Stella getting closure on her deathbed or some world Charon made for one like us to help those we knew--and ourselves--move on, is I think besides the point. Everyone in the game finds closure, in some way. Even the Spirtfarer. And while this game hits hard--VERY hard in some cases--it really deals with death on a masterful, heartrending level.

It's an interesting blend between a farming simulator and metroidvania. Game about death that is somehow ridiculously cheerful. A game about building houses and growing trees on a boat filled with furries. Yeah, this is an extremely weird game.

So you take place of Charon to ferry spirits to the afterlife. But before they leave, you need to build them a house on your boat. Catch fish, grow crops and cook to feed them. Talk to them. Hug them. Do weird quests. It takes ages. In the meantime, you explore the world, water you crops, visit cities and ports and mines, water your crops, upgrade you ship, water your crops, gather resources, sheer the sheep and water your crops, learn to construct new buildings so you can process resources into different resources, water your crops... basically the game becomes a chore very very fast.

Eventually you also learn new abilities like double jump or gliding that allows you to explore further, gather new resources, upgrade your ship so it can pass through ice and rocks and whatnot so you can gather more resources... At the end, you're just doing the same thing over and over and over again.

I managed to get rid of 3 spirits and I had enough of the game. The characters you meet are mostly just annoying, self-centered or outright obnoxious. And they always want something. I tried to push on, tried to finish it but after several hours of gameplay, I only got to 35% and I don't see myself continuing further. The game has absolutely nothing new to offer at that point and is outright boring.

On the positive note, the graphics are really nice and cute. Great relaxing music as well. It has some funny moments. And it has this super relaxing feel.

But it isn't really relaxing itself as you have to constantly water plants, cook, feed spirits, catch fish, plant vegetables, smelt ores, make wooden planks and fabric, there's just too much of the same thing over and over again and almost every activity is a minigame that takes way too long. There is no time limit or anything, you can't overcook a food, plants won't die and spirits won't starve to death (they're already dead) but I had this constant feeling of having boring work to do.

So at the end I don't really know what review to give it. It's really not a bad game but it's fun for only a limited amount of time. And it's practically impossible to finish if you value your time.

I would say give it a try but probably wait for a sale because you, like me, may not get the full value out of the story.",1661202198,1661203326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If this game is in the sale, I can recommend giving it a go and supporting smaller developers, but otherwise maybe try reading some of the negative reviews as a lot of them have fair points to give. Perhaps my biggest issue is I went into this game expecting a character driven story, and instead got grindy fetch quests and resource gathering for 25+ hours, so my expectations weren't met.

[b]The positives:[/b]
The art is beautiful, and I absolutely adore a lot of the character designs.

Music is great.

Not created by a large AAA company so hopefully your money will be lining the pockets of people who actually deserve it.

[b]The negatives:[/b]
Long animations that start to get old when repeatedly seeing them - while I understand this game is about taking time to appreciate the environment around you, it leans so heavily into forcing you to do the same tasks over and over that eventually I reached a point where I was desperately hammering the same button just to try and skip frames on animations. The tree cutting is especially egregious, more so when your cat companion has decided to get stuck somewhere so you're stuck waiting for the game to reset its position. 

Tedious mini games - Virtually every single item you need to collect and make has some sort of mini game attached to it, and they got old very quickly for me, not helped by the fact that many of them are the same task (aka jumping around on platforms to stand on or under a thing). Jellyfish event? Jump on platforms and collect jellyfish coming horizontally across the screen for several minutes. Thunderstorm? Jump on platforms and collect lightning coming vertically across the screen for several minutes. Meteor shower? Jump on platforms and collect meteors coming horizontally AND vertically across the screen for several minutes. And so on. If you need something, you HAVE to go through the same motions over and over again, and if you don't enjoy one of them or aren't very good at it, you're shit out of luck, you'll HAVE to do them for any sort of progress.

The entire game revolves around fetch quests - For most your time you'll just be jumping from island to island (or event to event) collecting resources and filling a request on of your passengers has. The trouble being even when it's a passenger request, there's rarely much they want you to actually do beyond just... taking them somewhere or getting them something, and often have you bouncing back and forth between the same two places. There's very little meaning behind most of what you do, and the travel time in early game makes it slow going.

Resource and inventory management is non existent - There were plenty of times where I reached a point in a game where I needed one specific resource to continue (both for room upgrades and boat upgrades) but it wasn't fully made clear WHERE to get said resource. On top of that, the inventory is slow to navigate and has no filters. For instance, you can make up to 105 different recipes, each character only loves one specific dish. If you want to give them their favourite dish, the only thing you can do is scroll through a 100 tiny thumbnails of dishes, hoping you can remember roughly what that item looked like or where it was in the rows, otherwise you just have to go through the list one by one looking for it. If a character likes comfort food, you can't just highlight all comfort food in your inv, you have to scroll over each item and read its tag. There's also no bulk select abilities, so if you want to weave 50 cloth, or sell 100 fruit, you just gotta start button mashing.

I just couldn't get attached to any of the characters and the gameplay makes it even harder to do so - I'll just go ahead and say it.... while I love the designs of the characters, I found most of them obnoxious or just completely uninteresting. The game is so focused on everything being gathering or fetch quests, that it seems to leave character development on the sidelines much of the time. Most characters will only have a few lines of dialogue occasionally, and the rest of the time they're nagging you for food CONSTANTLY when the kitchen is right there, or just drifting around doing nothing. They never have anything to say about any other character on the boat, and don't interact with each other either. Usually you're only required to do a few quests for them, and then out of nowhere they're just like ""well time to die"" and ask to leave. 
You can just do their quests immediately as they come and never get a chance to really know them, and even if you want to get to know them, they have nothing to say. This is made worse imo by the fact your character supposedly knows them all already, so having someone show up going ""hi, i'm your best friend"" is jarring for the player, and seems like the game is relying on you to have attachment solely because they told you to.
I've seen a fair few reviews saying this game made them cry, but I just felt absolutely nothing when seeing off most these characters. Or worse, at times I was bored and desperate to get rid of them, which is weird because I cry at basically every movie and TV show ever. Heck, I even sobbed when Terminator went into the magma. 
Most the characters have absolutely no sort of closure or purpose to their quests/storylines, and quite a few storylines are similar tonally that it feels like you're repeating yourself (both old characters have memory problems and that is their entire arc, for instance, which feels terrible when taking them to their 'end' without their consent.) 
To add insult to injury, the only character I did kinda like and wanted to take to the Everdoor ended up just vanishing and no one seemed to have anything to say about it or gave a shit. 
I was expecting the Everdoor to be more like The Good Place where characters find closure or you help them come to terms with their existence, but instead nothing ever seemed to change or matter, and the problems they have at the start remain at the end. (Maybe that's a commentary the game was trying to make, but as a player it felt unsatisfying, and I've seen it done better in other media).

No replayability - Despite the fact this game has several achievements that you could only get by playing twice (aka an achievement for saying yes to a piece of dialogue, but a different one for saying no), there just doesn't seem to be a reason to replay this game, especially when it's essentially just grinding resources.

Overall I thought this game could have benefited a lot from being about half the length it is, and focusing much more heavily on character interactions (both with player and between each other). If much of the resource grinding and mini games were stripped out, and there was more time to really get to know and understand the characters, I think it would be a much improved game, and I say this as someone who usually isn't a fan of dialogue heavy games. But still I respect the developers for creating something that they wanted, and I guess this game got me thinking, even if for all the wrong reasons.",1661008457,1661008773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Initially, the story seemed straightforward: You are Stella the Spiritfarer that ferries people to the underworld and last resting place, while making them happy along the way. A fun idea for a game, I thought. However, it slowly becomes clear there is a deeper meaning to the story that reveals itself over time.

For example, I couldn't quite understand why the first characters seemed to know Stella already, and connecting all the dots and driving the story forward created some very powerful and emotional moments. I would find myself crying on multiple occasions without understanding why, but the developers have really found a beautiful way to tell their story.

If there is one negative aspect of the game, it's the crafting. It was quite tedious to me, and it ended up taking up a lot more time than I wanted it to. Some gamers might like this aspect, but it stopped being fun to me very quickly and became a chore that honestly takes the overall experience down a notch. It would have been nice if parts of this could be automated.

Halfway through though the mood of the game changes slightly, but continues the downward trajectory.

On the surface, it's a cute little game where you wander the world helping spirits get to the afterlife... But it's so much more than that. There is a beautiful story, poignant story that gradually unfolds as you play. The characters are well-written, and it is so easy to grow attached to the spirits who board your boat.

My first time playing through Spiritfarer (on the switch) was in fall of 2021, and I found it so therapeutic, especially after losing my grandfather in early 2021.

It has great art style and fluid animation/controls. The premise of deciding when to let your friends pass on into the other world is a really cool concept that attaches some player emotion to the final decision.

The problem was for me that I didn't find myself attaching to the characters strongly enough to care about the final send-off. Their stories were unique and sad, but I wasn't gripped in the way I think was intended. There was also some mystery behind the main character, teased after the first spirit sendoff, but that plot-line didn't continue after the next 7-8 hours of play and next 2-3 spirits sent off, so I lost interest.

Without that connection, the game becomes more of your generic farming simulator/resource collection grind. I did not complete the game, I got the 2nd major upgrade for your ship that allows you to explore the next part of the map (rock-breaker). At that point I decided I did not want to continue.

I'm lukewarm on games like Stardew Valley, which probably makes sense for why I didn't connect with this game. I might come back to this game on occasion when the time hits, but it isn't a game I felt investing too heavily in. This isn't a bad game, but it isn't a great game that I'd actively recommend to other people.

When I first bought the game on my Switch, I literally played it for 8 hours straight. I was sick at the time (just 4 days ago) and wanted something to do while I was in bed; this game is everything and I was legitimately surprised by how instantly enamored I was with its gameplay. I am almost 60% through it (with over 50 hours) and it hasn't gotten dull or boring one bit. Along with the respective challenges to which each spirit introduces you- one can't help but be overcome with nostalgia and a sense of sadness once they've left your side and ""it"" pops up while you're traveling. This game is a work of art- literally and figuratively. The artwork is absolutely lovely, and the story lines, along with the quests (and other things), keep your attention. The care and creativity that went into this project is more than apparent; I never want to put it down. I am unable to physically become tired while playing this game because of how engaging it is. 

I've noticed that Thunder Lotus Games uses darker skin protagonists. Being made of black girl magic myself, I love the idea of the protagonist being a woman of color. I feel as if there are many games out there in which we are misrepresented or just outright omitted. The inclusion is totally refreshing.

But let me say that I made the conscious decision to buy the Deluxe Edition on Steam for the sole purpose of supporting this project. Aside from it being a great game, I just truly want to show my love and appreciation for this and fund the next creation. I will definitely be playing Spiritfarer on Steam alongside the progress on my Switch- playing it from the beginning again and knowing what I know now will still be loads of fun; I can even do certain things (not going to spoil anything) to see what incentives can come from certain actions. Anyway, I just want to say:

Graphics are very nice, music creates atmosphere, characters look original, and have cute individual animations of different emotions, exploring the world is fun (except for mines, they look the same and dark and depressing), trying to determine everyone's favourite dish is a blast. However here are the problems I noticed while playing:

- It says it has local coop, but you can't both play on one keyboard, one of you needs a controller. Shame since controls are just 6 buttons, could have easily fit both players on a single keyboard.

- Too dark most of the time: night and evening, down in the mines, meteor showers, thunderclouds, dragons etc. It's more than half of playtime. It looks logical and nice, but it just strains the eyes too much to have to do some chores or try to build/edit houses in this darkness. Would be nice to have a setting for this in graphics section.

- Could use a map. To see where you are you have to go to the engine room and try to choose a new destination - only then you will see your current location. And if it's night you won't, because it says ""too dark to navigate"". Yeah, but I just want to see the map. And if you are on land you can't see where you are at all.

- Would be nice to see which buildings are already fully improved, and which are not.

- Doors and creatures in one spot - and there is only one button to enter/speak. For example sheep who eats vegetables from the garden when you don't feed it, lies near the door and it is extremely hard to catch a moment to interact with the door (to get out) and not the sheep.

- They talk TOO much in one go. 10 dialogs to read - ok. 20 - I'm not having fun anymore. Even more - I skip without reading. It is supposed to be an important part of the game, but I skip every time there is too much dialogs in a row. A shame there is no ""skip the entire conversation"" button. Next thing I'm going to say is even more subjective to me personally, but here it goes: the dialog is not that interesting to be this long. It's mostly pieces of their pretty simple life stories: recalling people and places I have no idea about, complaining about their life partners, asking/thanking for food in too many phrases which are always the same, and saying ""..."" A LOT - and none of it is too creative or immersive to actually enjoy reading it like literature, or funny to keep reading just for lols.

Mild Spoilers:
[spoiler] - I'm 55 hours into the game, wrapping it up - and I just got what safe travel mode means. I think that one could be explained better - safe from what. Or I am just slow, which is possible.

- Too many XP potions are needed to build everything. And XP potions event is too hard to trigger - only once a day (why?), only sometime in the evening (why again?), and only when you manage to actually click on the table while Buck himself lies behind the table. If I needed like 10 of them - rare triggering is fine. But I need like 50 for all the updates and one events gives out only about 5. Just too much grind compared to other resources types. It also says Buck should give them to me if he is super happy. He doesn't. He gives out popcorn.
[/spoiler] 

Bigger spoilers:
[spoiler] - I am not doing a second play-through for one achievement (about Giovanni). You can not do anything else in the game differently, so why make people play again? It's better to either be able to collect all the achievements on one go, or to have only like half of them doable first time, which means adding more choices thus adding some replayability - so people have more motivation for a second play-through. 

- Not being able to satisfy Elena without someone playing music for her to hear is honestly just a bad decision. No hugging ok. No decorations - fine. But then let her be more happy about the food or something...

- Stanley buggily locking himself in for too long, though all of his requests are done, not allowing to collect bottled ectoplasm is too much. Got completely stuck without the ectoplasm for a long while, not even knowing it was him who had it in his room, I thought it was gonna be on the map like the rest of them, so I decided I was missing someone. Then I gave up and looked it up, and it was buggy Stanley all along. I traveled, slept, waited, reloaded for like 2 game weeks before his Mushroom Majesty finally deigned to open the door. Took his ass to the everdoor as soon as I could after that.

SPOILERS AHEAD, read at your discretion.

I might return to get the last achievement later, or I'll just hack and get it that way, but for all intents and purposes, I've 100%-ed the game. Fifty-six hours of this shit, goodness gracious. Spiritfarer is easily the most overrated game I've played in my life. 

The game is very beautiful. Not gorgeous. But very beautiful. Bit too plain to reach ""gorgeous."" The music is great. Not wonderful. But great. Bit too samey and exploitative to reach ""wonderful."" Now, the premise... The premise is awesome. Really is. The idea of an almost pathologically altruistic palliative nurse on her deathbed hallucinating taking over Charon's duties to take her family, friends and patients that she saw off this mortal plain further into the afterlife is brilliant!

Unfortunately, almost every good thing in Spiritfarer is ruined by the game DRAMATICALLY overstaying its welcome or its overall bloatedness. The rest is ruined by clueless game design. Sorry.

I saw a review that simply said ""galley slave simulator."" This phrase perfectly sums up 90% of the game process. Every single task relating to resource production is done manually, repeatedly, one by one, always. You will watch the plant watering animation hundreds of times. Literally. Same for harvesting, taking cooked food out of the oven, shearing sheep, smelting metal ingots, waking up and several others. None of those are skippable. They all have a secondish-long delay at the end with you just standing there.

Several of the production buildings, namely the Cellar, the Chicken Coop, the Cow Stall, the Crusher and the Smithy, might as well have not existed. You will unlock the cellar at about 60% completion, use it twice to make five or six dishes (it has three slots) for the collection and never use it again. Same with the rest. Wait, my bad, the Smithy is good for 40-50 uses, and it allows you to enjoy the animation of Stella hammering a glowing blob of material into a sheet about 10-15 times per item. The minigame is literally to hold and release the mouse button repeatedly. Gameplay! Fishing… is bloated, boring and terrible, and might as well have not existed either. Thank god Astrid does most of the fishing for you!

TWO old ladies have dementia. One off jackpot! 
Bruce and Mickey can go fuck themselves.
Elena is a see-you-next-Tuesday.

The Jackie and Daria update is among the worst content updates I’ve seen in a game. Dull, annoying, hamster wheel-like. Both characters, while certainly adding something disability-wise, barely blend with the rest of the game.

Oh man... I didn't want this to devolve into a rant, but in all honesty, it couldn't be helped. The game is just bad in so many ways. It had the potential to be fantastic. All the necessary components are there! It's just that they're diluted and marred with shit. I would even let the shoddy coding slide. Screw it. The camera sucks giant ass during resource-collecting events (dragon, pulsars, etc.)? Let it. Characters phase out of existence and you need to reload the save to get them back? No problem. Stella's platforming is... inconsistent to put it as politely as possible? Whatever! None of it would've mattered if the game was three times shorter and more focused and automated. But it's not. It's a buggy grindfest that, by the end of it, makes it nigh impossible to appreciate the beautiful parts because you've seen/heard them tens of times, and you just want the next motherfucker to get off your boat.",1660075048,1660075195,False,4,0,0.498257815837860107,0,True,False,False

My boss Hades gave me a job, and I'm getting that job done! 

I'm glad to see them go. It's my job to get these spirits where they are going to, and they can't take it with them, and neither can I. So I just go through the motions as a boatman. I don't develop an attachment to my customers. Don't come crying to me about how you don't want to take the plunge into the afterlife. I've heard it all before.

I just put up a facade that I actually care about their problems. But the fact is all I care about is Those sweet coins they were buried with. No coin? better learn how to swim! It's just like any job, and this is how the sausage is made.

The Music is ambient stuff. nothing memorable. The story is blah, but genuinely nice in some areas. The gameplay reminds me of mobile pet city builders, but without all the predatory microtransactions. However the bones of such a game is there. 

There is lots of hurry up and wait gameplay mechanics, which is definitely a quality you see in all those countless thousands of farmville clones still being made to this day. Waiting for crops to grow. Waiting for your boat to reach another area. Waiting to cook food. All signatures of a game that was designed to make you spend your money. Strangely building new buildings on your boat is instantaneous. It's almost like they wanted to make this yet another mobile game where you pay for crystals to make your tasks go faster, but scrapped that and turned it into an actual video game late in its development cycle. and I have to say that it's better for it. Cause those games suck, and are a symbol of the decline of human decency.

For everyone else-
After finishing the game and exploring it as much as I could, I can't recommend it and genuinely don't get how this game has gotten so much praise outside obvious emotionality surrounding its themes. It starts off strong narratively, but that initial energy only carries the game so far before dropping you squarely in Fetch Quest: The Game. It's a pitfall I hoped wouldn't plague the bulk of the narrative, but outside a few segments of platforming and base building that exist really just to service the many, many fetch quests, this game doesn't have much else going for it outside pleasant visuals.

Of all the characters you meet in Spiritfarer, only one really managed to feel organic, alive, and connected to the game's core narrative, and you pass them by early on. Nearly all the others felt largely tacked on with story arches contrived in a ways that either made it seem like you could almost see the writers reaching for your heart strings or whoever was in charge didn't consider the overall flow. Many had me going, ""Neat. Couldn't care less about your backstory,"" and others felt kinda like the devs intended the game to be played in a specific way and failed to consider how flat things fall when the player deviated from that flow.

Perhaps this game would've done better with voice acting. Hard to say though. Apart from the writers realizing less is more with only one child-like character, voice acting may likely have revealed how flowery to woody to long-winded the dialogue can get - especially with a couple characters towards the end of the game. The over-reliance on mechanics that halted all progress until you figure out where to get a single item from a single location/activity/character for a single upgrade was also a massive misstep. This comes to a head especially with one that requires a chance interaction using a specific activity that's (was for me at least) largely pointless by that point in the game. 

All in all, it was a nice game, but certainly could've used more mechanical revision (like the irritatingly long wait animation after overcharging the pick axe) and narrative polish.

I also have misgivings on Jackie's and a related character's story arch as someone with experience on both sides of the proverbial couch, but this review is long enough. If there's a sequel, there's certainly a lot that could be done with what's here though.

I have seen a lot of people saying they cried while playing this game and formed strong attachments to characters. That didn't happen to me and I have teared up at video games before. I think the primary problem is that the game wants you to become attached to the spirits  on your boat but your primary mode of interaction is doing chores for them and collecting items to improve their houses. You spend a lot more time sailing around collecting resources than you do actually talking to them or befriending them.

I also think a huge amount of the story is not readily apparent enough to keep my interest. i am getting a ton of character backstory from  the Wiki which cites the art book. Maybe it's all laid bare at the end of the game but when I am 14 hours in and having to have the gaps of characters' lives and backstories filled in by the Wiki that makes it even harder to care about these characters. I think more of my time is spent trying to decipher how they died or why they know Stella than it is getting to know them.

In short, the story is cool, but I finally got so tired of sailing from island to island to collect resources and play the same tiresome minigames over and over that I am taking a break. I might finish it, I might not, but it's just exhausting and not fun. For instance, the part I'm at requires you to upgrade a character's house which involves metal sheets.

Step 2: Make ingots by playing the foundry minigame. If you don't have the ores, sail to collect them. If you forget what you need go back to the blueprint table.
Step 3: Get powder by playing the crusher minigame which is literally just mashing e. If you don't have the rocks you have to sail to pick them up. If you forget what you need go back to the blueprint table.
Step 4: Forge the sheets by mashing E in the foundry minigame. Go back to the blueprint table and realize you are missing something else and have to pick it up.

This is part review, but mainly a way to express my thoughts about the game and how it has positively affected me. This isn't specifically meant to be read, more of a way to find my own voice and express myself.

I'm someone who tries to see the beauty in things when times are tough. When things get difficult, I try to at least see the best in it. I try to see the beauty in life, no matter how hard it gets. Even when things are at it's hardest, I try to get myself to see the best.

Recently, I have had a relapse of 'unpleasant thoughts', something I haven't had in a while. it started with a sudden intrusive thought, which almost led me to the end of things. Thought to be a one-off thing, I brushed it aside but those thoughts became more common. I suddenly started realizing that I was not in a good state of mind. Despite being communicative to my friends, I couldn't tell them this. I felt shameful, even partly detesting the idea of telling them. My voice felt caught in something, I didn't feel my own anymore nor that I had my own ideas or thoughts. I felt irrelevant, but couldn't help feel like I'm just cosmic dust then waiting to drift back into the world. I was losing grasp of my own reality, but in the midst of it all it reminded me of this game. Seeing that it went on sale recently, I turned to it and got a copy.

The game reflects the way I perceive concepts of tough times. It doesn't just dull out and become bleak. It's almost calming, colourful, serene. Almost eerily pleasant. It was a way to emotionally relax and stabilize, despite all the rough things. It felt right to play it, the beautiful animation and colour palettes. The soft to engaging music. Most importantly, the characters. The way each of them are written and have different ways to express themselves. The way they all have different stories of how they got here to their journey in the past-life, all leading to the Everdoor. It was beautiful.

Something I didn't expect was how hard the first character would go. I adored them upon introduction, and I loved the dynamic that was played. However, when I approached the Everdoor and was met with the dialogue and moment of their end, I couldn't help but break. Something inside me tore open, and all these repressed feelings poured out. I was open, most importantly to myself. There was a rush of so many conflicting thoughts, but it was something that needed to come out, something that needed to happen.

I can't help but thank this game for getting me to that point, a bravo to everyone who put this together. Though it can be hard to stick around, the beauty of this game captures the beauty of living life that I needed to see.

Thank you, Spiritfarer.",1659844939,1659844939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: Having played most of the game at this point, chances are I probably won't pick it back up. Firstly, I don't want Stanley to ever leave me. Second, I just.. don't like much of the last bit. I don't mind their stories nor the characters themselves, but this seems like many other indie-esque game trope where you need to jump through hoops and painful fetch quests to add more play time. I hate the idea that the only way to supposedly bring peace to this grumpy, weirdly loveable dog is to.. complete tasks with my abilities that are seemingly impossible for me because of my conditions. I quite literally can't complete the tasks, and so I'm stuck, thus can't even continue with it if I felt the need to. /:

 

I haven't played much, but the game seems wonderful thus far. I'm someone who really struggles with the concept of death and that separation, so it's been a nice process to play through in a more casual, entertaining way. The only part I wish there was is some character options, such as changing colors of things like clothing or hair, or a custom item like jewelry etc could be added. I know we play specifically as Stella, or Daffodil, but character customization has always been a huge thing for me that I enjoy and helps me enjoy/be present in a game far more.

This game is about dealing with -expected- grief, unexpected grief, and letting go of people you build relationships with. The emotional level is something you have to expect some maturity. It also teachers you that first impressions of people you meet, are not true, and when you get to know people you learn what pains them and why they act as they do, for better or worse. 

I recommend this for younger and older audiences, just be wary you might have to talk with children and explain some life lessons after playing this game, it's a good teacher but it can have heavy subject matter. 


I wish there could be some improvement to the tediousness of some work stations and some way to sort the food tab. I had 30+ dishes and trying to figure out which were fried just took extra time.

I have it on PS4, I have it on Switch, and it's very likely my favorite game of all time.  I've played this game.  And apologies for the following wall of text.  tl;dr:  It's good.  Buy it.

Let's get into the basics:  Spiritfarer is, at its core, a game about service.  Where most management/life sims are about the accumulation of more and better and bigger, the general end result of all that effort is money.  You don't need to put your veggies in preserve jars in Stardew, but you have an entire basement filled wall to wall with preserve jars anyway, because you get more money that way.  Spiritfarer approaches things completely differently.  

You don't build the mill because flour is worth more money.  You build the mill because someone said their favorite food was a type of pie and it's the easiest way to get flour.  You don't feed your passengers because you're punished otherwise, you do it to make them happy.  You hug them, and listen to their troubles, and build them homes and places to work and play, because the point of the game is service.  There is no tangible benefit to doing something if it's not going to make one of your passengers happy.  You can stick to selling the valuables you find that are meant for selling.  You can even grow valuables in your garden, if you like.  But you will likely never feel any pressure to grind for money; rather, it serves more as a measure of time played for upgrade rollout purposes, and I completely forgot there was even a currency system near the end of my first playthrough.

Here's the bad:  This may sound like there's not a lot of things to do.  On the contrary, it's easy to get overwhelmed.  My typical day early game consists of waking up, watering all the plants and replanting, gathering food from the kitchen and setting the next meal in the oven, shearing the sheep, passing out food and hugs to all my passengers, realizing it's the late afternoon and I forgot to set a destination and have been sitting idle, plotting a course to my next destination only to veer into some rainfall so my plants will get watered overnight.  I didn't reach my destination.  I didn't move the story forward, or accomplish anything of note.  And it took a lot of effort to not accomplish these things.

In most life sims, this would absolutely drive me nuts.  But in Spiritfarer, I actually succeeded that day.  All my passengers were fed and happy.  Job done.  Some people may not like the lack of a tangible reward from this kind of gameplay loop, but generally the drive to see the passengers happy will keep the player moving forward.  The endgame can become something of a drag as a result though; for reasons that become apparent once you begin understanding the story, the later passengers just aren't as enjoyable as the early ones.  As a result, I found myself at the end having missed two spirits, neither of whom I liked in the least, and running across the map not really enjoying their company while I finished up my completionist needs.  The end of the game is beautiful; but the endgame, depending on who's left on your boat, can feel like a grind.

Now the good:  The music is beautiful.  The characters are well-written, with a surprising amount of depth behind the game's lore.  The progression path is simple, easy to understand, and sufficient to drive the player forward.  The emotional moments vary from neutral to profound.  One of these spirits will remind you of someone you've known and lost, and that spirit will break your heart.  The gameplay is solid, with a wide variety of things to do, places to explore, skills to unlock.  And due to the nature of the game, it will always have replay value so you can hang with your favorite spirits again.

And it's good hanging with them.  Interactions aren't in-depth, but you have just enough daily activities to deal with that you don't really find yourself wishing for more.  Sidequests are generally enjoyable, with a dry and simple tongue in cheek sense of humor that never feels inconsistent with the tone of the game.  There is no combat, and no failure condition, but that lack of stress over dying is made up for by the constant need for new materials, meals, ingredients, fish, ores, lumber, berries, spirit activities, and all the work that goes into service.

The game has co-op, and is Remote Play compatible.  One player will control Stella and can do everything that can be done in singleplayer.  The co-op partner will control Stella's cat, and can work the foundry, sawmill, kitchen, loom, etc.; but cannot advance the story or talk to NPC's.  It's an awkward experience for two people who are both new to the game, but an experienced Daffodil helping a first playthrough Stella can significantly reduce the amount of game time spent on things like lumber, planting, and smelting.  In a sense, Daffodil's player is simply adding onto the game's overall theme, providing yet another layer of service.

I want more games like this.  Games where being good consists of doing good.  Where the end goal is a better, happier world, achieved through something other than exploding the bad angry people.  Where we can be proud of being unproductive because it made our virtual friends happy, and where the generation of happiness in and of itself is the thing which makes us feel good.  This game is not perfect, but I will love it to the Everdoor and beyond.",1659756496,1659756496,True,86,1,0.89295649528503418,0,True,False,False

Such a beautiful game, the experience of playing made me smile everytime i boot up the game. I'm really enjoying the game so far and hope to meet new spirits and hopefully help them fullfill their last request.

Hour 23, Amazing. i cried for the first time in years when it's time for stanley to leave.Poor kid, just wanted to make people happy. Now my huge ship has only 3 occupants left and 1 more still searching. i really don't want this to end but thats the point right? learn to accept when its time to go.

p/s: after months, i literally cannot finish the game because of how emotional it became. I've finished another game before with an amazing emotional story and after it ended, i literally can only think about the game for a whole week and can't do any work because im mentally shut down.",1598157275,1659628237,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b][u]Characters / Story[/u][/b]
First and foremost in this game are the characters / passengers that drive the story. As you are playing through, you get the [i]uncanny[/i] feeling that you know these passengers: All of the people aboard your ship will remind you of aspects (good or bad) of people you know in real life. They are fully fleshed out with deep backstories and unique personalities.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]
This game mixes elements of [u]Exploration[/u], [u]Platforming[/u], and [u]Farming Sims[/u]. There is no combat in this game and yet it is still fun to play (similar to the game Gris). There are also a bunch of mini-games that are actually kind of fun instead of obnoxious time drags. Everything has added audio cues which makes it easier for my ADHD to stay on task.

[b][u]Art[/u][/b]
The artstyle of this game is just plain beautiful with a lot of added polish. The colors are vibrant and alive. I love all the little animations thrown in here and there. You can tell that a lot of love and effort was put into making this.

[b][u]Music[/u][/b]
A very memorable soundtrack covering a wide range of emotions. From scaling a writhing sea dragon to serenading crops as they grow: Precious few albums sound as good as this.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The game has a great story that plays throughout, and the spirits/characters that you help have their own little lives that intertwine with yours along the way. Letting go is the hardest part, and pulls a bit on the heartstrings.
The game is easy to understand and the direction isn't linear to the dot, allowing you the freedom of preparing for the next spirits. The game has a great way of setting progression blocks to ensure that you get enough materials to get you through the next area, allowing you plenty of time to get everything and understand how the mechanics work for each area. Each spirit has their own personality with a theme, even down to the house that you build to provide shelter for them on your boat!
I've loved playing this game so far, and highly recommend it!

EDIT: After completing the game, 35 hours of gameplay according to steam (albeit some of it being gone due to servers being down on Tuesdays), I can definitely say that this is a great game! The storyline and characters are all heart-touching and the fact that so many of them are inspired by real people adds an even greater touch to the game! I haven't had anything bad to say about the game, much less experienced anything that would dissuade me from recommending it! It's such a great game to play if you want to get into the feels, and it has amazing art and gameplay!

However, after a week of playing and saying goodbye to animal spirit friends, my best friend/dog died. I took it pretty hard as anyone would. I didn't know what to do; all I knew was to distract myself. I continued to play this game, but it took on a much different tone. I never got to say goodbye to my dog. And even though Robocop visited me in my dreams, I never got the real closure. He didn't die of old age, so it was unexpected and awful for me to handle. But the game's tone shifted and I was suddenly caring about every character. I was bawling my eyes out with every departure. 

This game really did give me a relief, a form of acceptance of his early departure. Thanks devs for such a great game. I am sure it was meant to teach a bigger lesson with human souls and themes of death, but he really was my best friend.

From gameplay to design to controls everything is very solid in my opinion. But the characters and their stories really get to shine here! There's a lot of very different people you can collect on your ship, each with very distinct personalities and looks. I LOVE their designs and the dialogue, how you get to know their story the more you talk to them. I took my time to get everyone comfortable on my boat, from finding out what they like and dislike, to who they do and don't get along with and I got really attached to most of them during that time.
I will warn people that this game deals with some heavy topics, mostly death. But I'll say it's done in a very charming and not at all graphic way. It's all through dialogue and some vague pictures of people during their life before getting to the end.

Personally I feel like the story benefitted me personally, as I've not had to deal with death in my life much at all, and seeing it through this games lens makes me appreciate life more. Just being there for other people has an immense impact on their life, even if you might not feel that way.

Anyway, prepare to cry, but not in a depressing way, if you pick this game up.

As beautiful as the music, the character designs, the artwork, the animation, the feel of movement, some of the funnier NPC interactions/dialogue, the entirety of Overbrook as a concept, and the theoretical story was, i would not recommend this game to others. You may ask why? And the answer to that is. I don't know. I finished the game, i attempted most if not all of the achievements, i spent hours gathering resources and feeding sheep and passengers and farming and. I think at some point i realised it just felt like. a checklist. of sorts. at the end after I had all the buildings that let me make whatever I wanted and I had access to every location, I had cooked every meal, caught every fish, all the requests took minutes. Jackie boarded my boat and left the next day. I don't know. I just don't know why I didn't love it. I think i thought I would be heartbroken, seeing these characters I was meeting ""die"". The only time I shed a tear was Atul's parting, and I suspect that that was because he broke out of the formula. The checklist. It affected me because of its abruptness. All in all, I don't think that this game gripped me the way emotionally I thought it would, and I think I would hate to send any of my friends on a 50~ hr shopping trip. I'd advise they just listened to the soundtrack or read the lore on the wiki. Sorry to be a downer.

Stuff like Minecraft or Terraria makes me feel overwhelmed with how many recipes and options there are, combined with very little guidance. Spiritfarer feels much more welcoming in its resource management style.

NPCs will help you figure everything out as part of the game's story and there are no penalties for taking your time with anything. Spiritfarer wants you to be able to take in the game at your own pace.

That relaxing game play is contrasted nicely with a story that is often emotional and giving you food for thought about life's big questions. You'll get to know a variety of quirky passengers who board your ship, some fun, some a little more abrasive. But the thing they all have in common is you are tasked with helping them come to peace with passing over to the afterlife. It leads to moments that can be heartbreaking as you have to grapple with how to say goodbye to characters whose time has come.

The beauty of Spiritfarer is that beneath its bright, charming aesthetic is that it has emotional depth. It'll make you contemplate the significance of life and how to carry on despite the grief of losing people you care about. It's a thought-provoking, satisfying experience.

Like many management style games, it does have a lot of repetition in the tasks you need to do, so your mileage will vary for how fun you find that. But especially now that the game has been upgraded to the Farewell Edition, I found the experience entertaining as a nice stress-free management game combined with some platformer elements.

They all resembled someone I know or have known in my life, which made letting go that much harder, but also cathartic. This game was equal parts fun mini-games and emotional therapy. I can tell the project was a love letter from the developer to their loved ones, which is what made it so unique and special.

-Gorgeous art style, from character designs to backgrounds
-Story and feeling of discovery
-Platforming is fun, especially once you expand your shrine abilities
-Sassy meeples across the lands

[b]Minor pet peeves:[/b]
-Pacing of game-play slowed to a crawl around 80% completion, making it hard to stay motivated to finish (but I recommend you do it for your own closure)
-By the end, I had an abundance of crafting ingredients and no reason to use them. Don't be like me, dial back the doomsday prepping. lol.

[b]A personal note:[/b] When playing this game, I was coincidentally doing counselling for building my resilience to overwhelming emotions.

972660,119472967,76561198034744095,350,5,484,0,484,1658709389,"TL;DR: Love a lot of what's here, but the gameplay loop and characters are really unsatisfying.

There’s a lot that I do really like about this game like the art, character design, music, and movement controls, but it’s just not enough to keep me going.

A huge focus on the game seems to be the characters you bring onto your boat to progress, but they’re all a part of this weird kind of gameplay loop. You bring them in, do them some favors, get some snippets of their lore with no context, and then after all that they’re just like “aight im done lol bye”. I don’t feel like I’m given enough to really connect with these characters before they decide to leave. The game only gives me the option to talk to them when they give me more chores to do in order to get to the next part of their specific story. I’ve had Gwen and Summer on my boat for what I’m guessing was like 4-6 hours each, but I didn’t really feel anything when I took them to move on. I mostly just gave them food and hugs while I worked on getting the things they needed.

It doesn’t help that the rest of the game feels like a lot of going back and forth between the same islands looking for new materials and never really knowing exactly where to go. I want to explore and find new spirits to bring aboard. But it turns out by the time I find one, I end up needing something that I don’t get till way later. And I only find this out after going all across the ocean looking for it. It’s not so bad early on, but after a certain point it gets pretty tedious. For a specific example, here’s a single quest I need to do for Atul’s story: 

I need to get him some fried chicken to progress his story, so of course I need chicken and fat to make it. Turns out chicken is unavailable until I get the icebreaker, so I go to the shipyard to see if I can make it. Apparently one of my shipmates needs to pass on so I can get their Spirit Flower, so I need to wait until Gwen’s ready to go. Meanwhile, Atul’s just asking me “Hey where’s my chicken?”, and it's basically one of the only things I hear from him the entire time. I can’t talk to him about anything else, just feed him and hug him. So now Gwen decides to go to spirit heaven and I got the flower I need for the icebreaker. Great. Get the icebreaker, go to Nordweiler, get the chicken, step one done. But where’s the fat? Turns out I need another two specific spirits to come aboard in order to get the building I need to make the fat and Atul’s still nudging me about getting his chicken. But now I have this owl guy who wants me to get a certain ship upgrade that requires another material that requires more specific material and after a certain point of trawling the whole ocean filled with apathy I’m just about ready to let this frog starve.

From my experience, the characters have some traits I can pick up on, but I’m just not given enough to really get attached to them. Yes being able to hug all these animal people is cute, but talking to them and being given the option to learn more about them before I send them off seems pretty important too. It also makes the final hug you give them as a send off much less impactful because you’re encouraged to hug them every single day. It’s a small thing, but I feel like it means at least a little bit. I may have gotten a bit off track, but I’ll try and summarize it like this. During my hunts for materials, I’d much rather be talking to the people I feel I’m supposed to be attached to and not just hugging and feeding them. It’s like a Tamagotchi with extra steps.

I’m willing to admit that as far as the characters go there might just be something I’m missing, but it’s not helped by the gameplay loop of find someone, get new chores, scour the ocean for a specific set of items, get given some backstory I hardly understand, repeat 3 times, then say goodbye. I really do want to like this game, but I think at its core it’s just not for me.",1658791754,1658791754,False,4,0,0.567820370197296143,0,True,False,False

The whole game at its core is a cozy management game about dying, but there is so much more to it, with each character finding their purpose and understanding parts of their lives.

The design in this game is beautifully detailed and everything is completely cohesive throughout. From the animations, to the soundtrack, to the character design everything immerses you.

Death is a topic that many people find difficult to talk about, which is why Spiritfarer has a good way of doing so, it shows that time doesn't wait for you to make amends or make the decision about understanding your story and who you are. Death comes without warning and can be sudden or prolonged, which is seen throughout each of the characters. There are some characters which you will lose, who have finished everything and characters who haven't. Spiritfarer also teaches you how to let go, and as someone who has found it difficult to let go (in both the game and in life), it has made it a little easier somehow.

An overall beautiful experience. I cannot recommend this game enough!

GAMEPLAY is intuitive. Pretty straightforward. From the very beginning, no need to check control menu. It's getting easier and easier to keep up with events, quests, discoveries etc.

MOTIVATION
There's always something to do. I set my own pace. And that's the beauty of it.

CREDIBILITY
Authentic protagonists and a credible interaction structure. Actions & reactions of characters seem non-generic, i.e. quite appropriate and understandable from a realistic point of view, albeit not too predictable. I get to know the personalities and i gotta say, i get to love 'em. How I interact with the crew members is just like family. Acknowledging different parts within me, I find a profound sub-message within each character, thus being able to identify with those i take care of during the journey at sea while taking care of those parts within me during the samsaric journey we all participate in.

STORY
There is an intricate, almost intrinsic reward system at play. And that's what I appreciate about it so much. The self-paced story line makes it clear that it is truly about the journey, not the destination. Whatever I do, it is up to me when i do it. Which brings me to the final point and, for the time being, my conclusion of this review.

P(E)ACE
Starting out, I caught myself rushing into the doer-maker-achiever-mode. Since then, I've been slowing down somewhat since i came to realize that the crew members come up with their ideas at the appropriate moment anyway. So no need to hurry and worry. What a relief, especially for those of us who, when entrusted with the task of taking care of lost souls, succumb to the helper syndrome time and again ;)

Visuals are beautiful, characters are intriguing, the story is uplifting yet somber, and the music is inspiring to the point it will stay with you long after you finish. It draws you in to the point where you just want to keep playing. I deeply wish they'd keep adding more characters, but unless they add them as paid DLC, there comes a point where new content doesn't pay for itself with new sales.

Don't play this game without tissues nearby or you'll regret it. You WILL cry. No maybe, no possibility. You WILL cry. Maybe not for every spirit, but there will be at least one that hits you to the very core of your feels. And when it comes time to say goodbye to that spirit, it'll feel like you're losing someone real, not a character in a video game.

The only negative I can speak of in regards to this game is that the art book provides a lot of backstory that the game doesn't. It helps to make sense of a lot of things that the game doesn't give anywhere near enough detail on. Maybe that's the intention, and it's up to the player to fill in certain things from their own experiences, and that is honestly a brilliant approach. Although, if I'm to be honest, sometimes growing things in the garden or field can become a bit repetitive and grindy. But using them doesn't play a huge part in story progression, but if you're a completionist you'll use them often.

In some cases, I was just relieved that they were gone. But in this game, I openly wept for every spirit I sent through that door. You probably will, too, at least for a few of them.

Spiritfarer is far from perfect. There are some parts of the story I loved, some that broke my heart, some that felt very unsatisfying. Most of the time it was a joy to play, but by the end I was glad it was over. Which is all probably very poetic given what the game is trying to tell you about life and moving on.

Spiritfarer is incredibly beautiful and that's what I'll remember the most. Art, music and animations resonate with the themes of the game: sprites are drawn out carefully, with relaxing colors and lines, and the slow animations set up a very therapeutic mood. Often I would stop moving and remain idle just to enjoy the neat animations of Stella and her cat knocking around.
As in all management games, I think the key is making all repeatable actions enjoyable, and they mastered that in Spiritfarer. Small, short actions that you will have to perform a thousand times, such as fishing our taking vegetables out of the ground, simply sound and look so good. The game is undoubtedly grindy, which might be an issue for many; even when the endgame approaches you still get new buildings to work in and new tiers of items to process, maybe unnecessarily. In any case, moving around with your boat (and specially customising it! it was surprisingly entertaining to rearrange all houses and buildings a la Townscaper) feels relaxing until the end.
I won't cover much of the plot here, but it does have room for subverting expectations. Soon you get to know the game loop of meeting cute animal spirits, taking care of them and eventually releasing them to the Everdoor; but, as the story unrolls and the world widens, characters start deviating from that process. Some might not be as adorable as you'd expect or demand you to tend for them in different ways. This has a big impact in the player and ensures the spiritfaring process remains fresh until the end. Cool.
Not much to criticise other than the extension of the game, the grinding required and the fact that I got stuck hard at one point with nothing really pointing out where to go. UI is awful at times, looking for autosaves in the main menu was a total nightmare. And then there's Alex, of course.",1658310582,1658310582,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The art style is adorable and the hug feature is downright the best part of the game. The story and morals are beautiful and actually make you think about your perspective on life. I love that every character has their own flaws and they all confront their issues in unique ways. This game is truly a work of art and I recommend it to every person I discuss games with.,1658208252,1658208252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If youve ever seen Markipliers project UnusAnnus in 2020 you understand the enivitability of death and the beauty it can present. and i think this game really encapsulates that. there is a character with amazing dementia representation as well and she is very sweet. 

also you can pet the cat so great game",1658197354,1658197354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
