Baldur's Gate I allured me mainly to play the rest of the DND games, as I fell in love with BG3 quickly on. While BG1 is practically different in nearly everything apart from setting and a much, much older dnd ruleset to follow, I still found a bit of the charm I had while playing bg3 as well... with some outdated mechanics and storytelling along the way.

Story
Baldur's Gate I starts off with a pretty strong opener, you are the son of a mage who is suddenly being attacked by assassins and need to leave the home you lived at for so long, just to watch your father be murdered by forces unknown. Stuff like that can get me super pumped, but once you leave the first chapter and onto the rest of the game by being introduced to your potential companions ( I played with the canon party for the entire game just for bg2 continuity reasons), you do start to realize some shortcomings of the way the game is structured. There are still exciting moments in the story, the iron shortage, sarevok, the reveal near the ending of the game are very exciting points of the story, but the writing at times isn't the greatest compared to previous stories I have experienced, and worse of all, literally nobody has any reaction to what you do or anything you have to accomplish apart from repeating ""good guy do good thing!"" or ""you do bad I don't like that!"". While the main quest line has its moments, its the side quests that really hamper the experience with how inconsistent the pacing of any of them are or just how worth they are in a story telling way. Most of the sidequests until you reach baldurs gate is basic ""fetch me this please, kill this please"" and just ends with no lingering effect. Maybe this is cause of how BG3 handles side quests that I notice it way more, but it is pretty random if you are doing a side quest that is worth it or not. However there ARE pretty good side quests, for the base game I did really enjoy the one with the B queen (if that is a side quest or not idk). I did not play SoD as I heard that the writing is terrible there, but I did play through the tales of the sword coast, and I would like to split it into two parts. One half of it is the durlag's tower, which has really good writing and a very engaging storyline of a man struggling with the past as you explore the dungeon. On the other half you get to explore an island, which has some of the worst writing I have ever seen in terms of a jump between two different storylines. So many obvious jumps and turns, character motivations make no sense and you are forced to basically resolve the scenario in a matter that leaves things to be desired. BG writing can be a bit over the place, but I do hear BG2 writing kinda outclasses it so I do hope for that. Overall good writing, but too spread out to be considered noteworthy imo.

Characters
The characters in this game are pretty interesting... Till you finish their very short quest, then they turn into one liners who do nothing but tell you the same comment, same joke, react to the same way till the end of the game. There ARE very interesting companions, but they were added in the enhanced edition and as a way to play through bg1 in a more original way I played with just the canon party instead (I am so sorry Rasaad the monk your backstory was so damn interesting as well but had to remove you for minsc sadge). I do know that the biggest problem that bg2 fixes a ton is companion chattering, cause my GOD BG1 companions that are NOT new from the enhanced edition have 0 flavor, and once you finish their questline are just blank slates with like 5 lines to say something new. I really wish I played with a custom party instead but I had to experience these companions just for continuity sake my playthrough. They do each play distinct as the dnd classes are varied of course, but other than that I could had probably done with a custom party and had the same experience, but would had kept minsc at least as I did enjoy his 5 lines the most... and Jaheria as well you can stay. 
Gameplay
While this game is very old, it still has the charm that I was looking for in what I would imagine, a dnd much game. While this game uses the DND 2nd edition, which is VERY different than DND 5e that bg3 uses, it still holds a ton of similarities, but enough differences that took me awhile to get used to (AC is better when lower instead of higher for example). The combat in this game has a huge gap imo, as lower level has you being kinda forced into a cheese strat, where the main strategy is to have EVERYONE using ranged attacks, as nobody can survive a hit yet, and just looping them till they die. This is pretty annoying, and It doesn't really change from that till mid game when you start getting your abilities and spells in place. mid game the combat DRAMATICALLY improves, and you start to feel the excitement as you plan your next moves with the pause-real time combat system. However, end game basically turns back into a bit of a cheese, as you start encountering not 1, not 2, not 3, but like 20 traps all at once. While yes, thief can just disarm them, sometimes those traps are literally 2 ft away from the enemies, forcing you to pull them anyways. That is when you quickly realize the best way to handle the enemy over preparing, is to over prepare yourself... but throwing fireballs and ice storms off screen so the enemies get damaged, but won't engage for some reason. Especially the end fight where the boss basically summons a shit ton of high level enemies and has literally 10 traps waiting for you, throwing fireballs and forcing him to come to us so we can jump him was the main strat I had to use. In Durlag's tower especially requires the most cheese ( apart from the demon knight he was a pretty interesting boss design). Once you figure out that enemies won't engage when attacked off screen, it starts to turn into your main battle plan, and unless reasons force you to use a different strategy, most of combat boils down to that, which does get a bit boring after awhile, as while playing on hard difficulty, fighting the enemy head on is certain death for a companion, which in this game and ESPECIALLY with the canon party, insanely hard to recover from, as with the lack of a cleric, the only way to revive is to walk allll the way back to a chapel to revive, and even then their stuff is still on the ground so you have to walk back and reorganize their shit for them. Overall a ton of the mechanics I did enjoy, but being a much older version of DND, some mechanics I am glad are either much improved 5e, or removed outright ( Thanks for the much better trap detection and having really cool magic synergy that isn't just stun enemy is good in bg3).

Music
Pretty good. Not the best I have heard, but overall I liked the ost in this game. They fit really nice into the setting, and while some do get annoying like the inn theme repeating a bit too obnoxiously, I really enjoyed the battle songs and other ambience songs in this game.

Conclusion
Overall I really did enjoy BG1 a ton. Is it masterpiece? No I don't think so, but I will still look at this game with a positive outlook, and hopefully, a better point of view after I play BG2, which supposedly does fix a ton of the writing and companion issues I had with BG1 (and high level spells yay). Do I recommend BG1? If you enjoy pause real time I do, but it isn't the easiest recommend as it really depends on the taste of having to play with old ass dnd mechanics and outdated gameplay mechanics. Looking past that, you do generally get a good game, just missing some sauce that would make it REALLY good. But for a 1998 game, still really damn good.

If you're a mainstream player that's new to the CRPGs, again, you probably won't like it. The graphics are pixelated, the UI is dated, the voice acting takes you back to the 90's, and the character customization is limited, but I'm already having fun with it!

 You start off running about town and already feel the similarities to Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, etc. The characters and world building are immersive, the combat is a bit complicated since it's built on 2E DnD, but faithful. Charming, well-written, packed with personality, and I love that most side quests have a choice involved. It brings out the importance of roleplaying a lot more often, and doesn't hold back on evil options either.

Nostalgic, hard to learn, but packed with flavor. I can already tell I'm going to enjoy BG 1 :D Oh and please don't leave negative reviews just because you compare it to modern games or even BG 3. It's much different, give it the respect it deserves!

Tips for BG3 players - 
- keep in mind the game is 25 years old, graphics are from a different era
- 2E is very different to 5E. You'll get the hang quickly but in short be ready for things to be a lot less flexible. For starters, there is no Withers and no re rolls. Characters on a bench don't level up at joining your party and so on.
- It moves much faster. You can customise when the game pauses in the options menu. Don't let your characters die!

One huge positive is that the level caps are higher and you can keep your character all the way through to the end of BG2. By the end of the game your party will be insanely powerful.

Oh - and you used to be able to record your own voice (and those of your friends if playing multiplayer). I assume you still can - it takes a fair while but it is highly recommended.

Unfortunately, the gameplay is absolutely janky by modern standards, even those of a decade ago, and because of this I cannot recommend it. I spent more time in my playthrough fighting with the UI and getting my characters where they needed to go than actually playing and feeling immersed in an RPG. At the same rate, the difficulty has no indication of when it will spike, and i found myself constantly save-scumming to finish quests and fights.

I have come to understand that when this game was released, it was considered cutting edge to attempt to realize DnD 2e in real-time. These days this may feel chaotic and disorganized. I prefer the more turn based combat of the third.

Ultimately, I think this is a good game and worth playing if you can get over a lot of the dated game design. But if you‚Äôre a total newcomer to CRPGs, especially those of the late 90s, this game is a trial by fire. I would not recommend this game to anyone who simply wants to play it for the story, because on top of it being just okay, this game‚Äôs strength is the way you interact with the world more so than it is the quality of the narrative itself and that means getting deep into the mechanics of the game.

To start positively, Baldur‚Äôs Gate is great at presenting the Forgotten Realms D&D setting. If you‚Äôre a lore nerd, there is a lot to dive into here. There are countless books explaining the history of the region, its gods, and the politics of the kingdoms hidden all over the place. Bartenders will tell you rumors if you buy drinks from them, and each powerful magical item has a story in its description. There is a decent amount of environmental storytelling in the maps as well, moreso in the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion pack than the base game, which are beautiful and colorful and look like you‚Äôre playing in a painting. It‚Äôs a unique feel of 2D and 2.5D isometric sprite games like this can provide that you just can‚Äôt get from a photorealistic 3D rendering. Unfortunately, the character models on the other hand range from okay to ‚Äúwhat the fuck am I looking at?‚Äù and the lack of a unique visual profile on most of the humanoid sprites makes it tough to pick out important targets like spellcasters when the combat starts.

The plot of Baldur‚Äôs Gate is fine. It‚Äôs a pretty bog-standard D&D adventure of discovering an evil bad guy‚Äôs plot to take over a kingdom and eventually saving it. There is a bit of interesting in-game politics that sets the backdrop for the campaign and ties into the characters, but it‚Äôs not by any means some deep or thoughtful narrative. The real strength of the story comes from how you can interact with it via choices made in dialogue, combat, party composition, etc. Outcomes of major plot points aren‚Äôt going to change, but side quests can be much more open ended by simply having the right (or wrong) companion in your party. And the side quests are so numerous and wide in scope that many of them will have direct connections to the main quest, even if they aren‚Äôt necessary to progress. Combine that with the sheer amount of companions in this game (29 in total) and the way they interact with each other while in the party, and there is simply no way to see it all in a single playthrough.

The only real issue I have with the narrative, outside of it just stopping instead of having a proper ending, is that its pacing is crippled by the side quests and gameplay in general. There is a calendar in the game keeping track of the time you have spent on your adventure, but it is never important outside of certain companion‚Äôs quests. The big bad evil guy will always be about to reach his goal, no matter if it takes you 2 in-game days or 2 in-game months to find him; and you will be spending months preparing for that next step. Following the main quest alone will leave you severely underleveled and you have to grind side quests, which is time consuming both in-game and in person. Healing and recovering spells means resting for at least 8 hours at a time. And if you don‚Äôt have many healing potions or spells, that means you could be spending literal in-game weeks trudging through a dungeon. All of this makes it almost impossible to avoid ruining the pacing. Maybe it‚Äôs a testament to everything else that I find this is immersion breaking, but it is nonetheless.

The reason you will have to do some grinding is that this game is HARD. Part of this is AD&D 2e‚Äôs design, but some of this is on the game too. Characters, especially early on, will have very little HP depending on the class. A martial focused class like a fighter might be able to take a hit or resist being hit in the first place, but god help your mages who can easily be killed by a single arrow until around lvl 5. And since combat plays out in real time, characters can be obliterated in the blink of an eye.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing that combat is this hard, even on easier difficulties. I do have a problem with it playing out in real time though. The pathing AI is atrocious, and the pace at which it plays out is fast. Thankfully you can pause combat and still choose actions and even set up auto-pause triggers for certain events, but it‚Äôs not easy to get the hang of nor all that satisfying once mastered. I never felt like any of my successful battles were a result of my immediate tactical decisions like it would in a game like Xcom, mostly because there isn‚Äôt much you can do while watching them play out. Most of the strategy has to come from knowing what you‚Äôre up against ahead of time and preparing before the actual fight.

AD&D 2e has this, quite frankly, terrible spell slot memorization mechanic in which every spellcaster must choose their spells for each available slot on a short rest. For example: if you have 3 lvl 1 slots and want to cast magic missile 3 times, then you had to have already memorized 3 magic missile spells during your last rest and you won‚Äôt be able to cast any other lvl spells that you‚Äôd know until you swap slots on the next rest. It forces you to plan ahead for encounters and dungeons, except there is no way of figuring out what to expect on your first playthrough so your best bet is to just Edge of Tomorrow your way through the game. This isn‚Äôt the only complaint I have about AD&D 2e either. In this system, the thief class is the only one capable of disarming traps (of which there are a lot in this game that are unavoidable and will only trigger for player controlled characters for some reason), mages can fail to learn spells from scrolls on a dice roll (which easier difficulties at least disables), THAC0 exists, the list of shit goes on. It‚Äôs an outdated and unnecessarily complicated system on its own, and translating it into a video game only serves to highlight its issues.

Then there‚Äôs the gameplay elements outside of the AD&D system. You know all those cool companions that you can form a party of 6 out of? Well you‚Äôre gonna have to remember where you left them because they are going to remain scattered across the world if you talk to them and decide to swap party members. Only a few of the Enhanced Edition characters will hang out at a central location. Companions not in your party are not getting experience points either, so you better be happy with your decision on who‚Äôs in the party and pray they survive. You‚Äôd think that the game wants you to replace dead characters based on how many there are, but I am not going to spend 30 hours grinding up a replacement when they are 7 levels behind. And I‚Äôm certainly not gonna waste my time trying to revive the dead because they don‚Äôt come back with their stuff, and I‚Äôm not about to spend 40 minutes trekking back and forth to get everything with how annoying this inventory system is; being that individual characters need their inventories managed separately. Some of this is easier to overlook than others, but I have to call it out because it‚Äôs clearly a problem that was fixed in future sequels and expansions.

Obviously, I wouldn‚Äôt say that all of these problems make the game unplayable; I‚Äôm still recommending the game after all. I do think it‚Äôs important to mention though because it‚Äôll backhand slap any newcomer across the face and probably deter them from sticking with it. It almost kept me from doing so, until it finally clicked for me in the final chapter of the game. Perhaps on a replay, now that I know what I‚Äôm doing and what to expect, I will have a better experience. I just wish that better experience was something I could‚Äôve gotten the first time.",1706160815,1706380384,True,37,0,0.805579006671905518,0,True,False,False

It has aged since then and some of the gameplay mechanics that used to be fresh won't feel new to those who are familiar with similar games that came afterwards. It's still a very fun RPG though, with a fantastic lore thanks to the DnD universe.

The main enemy, Sarevok, is a very cool antagonist. You and him are tied by fate and blood which makes the rivalry personal in nature, which is great. But the fun part with this game, especially compared to BG3, is that the main quest doesn't have that much of a grasp on your journey and you can therefore focus on many sub quests in plenty of different areas if you want. There is no time limit breathing down your neck either, so you are comfortable at exploring the world and completing tasks to make your characters stronger before facing your Bhaalspawn step brother.

Storywise, it's a pretty simple tale. People get murdered and you murder the murderers most of the time. I'd say it's ""Conan-esque"" as you will usually get into combats to prove your point, but that is the nature of the Bhaalspawn, after all, so it makes total sense.

There's a solid amount of different enemies and locations, enough for the game to never feel dull. You can go pretty far in terms in leveling up, far enough for you to learn very fun spells or techniques.

The game uses an old version of DnD rules so the 5th Edition-familiar players may feel a bit lost as some spells and abilities differ from what they know. It's also a game that has a very steep learning curve for non-DnD players. However, just like BG2, there is an instruction manual in the game files ( judging from forum posts, it seems a lot of people don't know that ). You may want to refer to that and not to wikis unless you don't mind getting yourself spoiled by mistake.

It's a bit emptier than BG2 overall, of course that is to be expected ( back then sequels always felt like their original counterparts but with more content, those were the good old days! ). There are less engaging dialogues, romances are nonexistent, making your companion characters feel like random generic NPCs. This hurts the game quite a lot when you compare it to BG2 and BG3 which both have fantastic dialogues.

Traveling across the land is less eventful than in BG2. In BG1 you will go through certain areas a few times, and once you've cleared them, there won't be a lot to do but you'll still have to go through them to reach specific locations. BG2 got rid of that issue with a clickable world map, allowing you to go exactly where you want and bypassing those wilderness maps.

The music is very good. Not as good as its sequels though. But still good enough to have some tunes sticking in your mind for a while.

A very cool aspect of this game is that once you finished it, you can import you character to the sequel, along with its accumulated levels of course, allowing you to have a more complete journey if you want.

Overall it's not the game I'd recommend to play first if you want to get into the Baldur's Gate franchise. I would recommend BG3 if you can't stand old graphics and want a more complete experience. If you can tolerate old games, go for BG2 first as it has better overall content and explains the BG1 story with enough detail for you to know enough but not everything, which is cool if you ever want to go and try it one day. I personally got into BG2 a long time ago before playing the first one and I got hooked instantly, so I suggest you take the same guaranteed path. But this one here remains a cornerstone in RPG gaming, so if you are not satiated yet, go for it. It's pretty fun still. Plus, there's a few mods that add content ( ex: NPC interactions ).",1706074782,1706075133,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Allow me to start with a semi-quote from Firebead Elvenhair, a minor character.

Actually there are quite a few good recent games, but BG is easily the reason why they are available, as it is one of the first isometric RPGs ever made, back in the '90s; the others just followed its path.

The story takes place in the Forgotten Realms‚Ñ¢ and follows the adventures of a young orphan, unveiling the mistery of their birth and trying to prevent a war breaking between two lands.
The setting is a faithful adaptation of AD&D rules: races, classes, skills and all that.

This EE boasts improved graphics, several subquests and even four new characters (each with a definite backstory).

For context this is a review from someone who was raised on AD&D but just never played any of the BG games until now so the Enhanced Editions are all I have known. As an ongoing project I am taking a character from BG1-BG3 in chronological order of events after completing a play through of BG3 and wanting to get the full context of the story.

If you are not familiar with AD&D getting to know the system might be the biggest barrier to entry. There are a number of things that are not apparent and I don't believe they are ever explained in game but I think most RPG players can intuit enough to get through the game (like lower AC and THAC0 is good). If you are willing to look for some info online there are good explanations out there that helped me out in my play through. 

The best part of this game has to be the feeling of open exploration. You can wander around sword coast getting into random encounters and finding quests just like you might in a hexcrawl on the table top. All of this is facilitated by the real time with pause combat. This game is the first that I have really enjoyed that style over turn based but it does make sense for the game flow here.

The story of BG1 is decent and ties the adventure together but it really didn't feel like anything special to me. The stand out story moments pretty much all involve the main antagonist who is introduced surprisingly late in the game but is a certified badass. The companions are pretty basic and don't have much interaction outside of their combat and idle quips. 

In combat your character is generally the star of the show since they are the only one you can really customize and your friends have surprisingly bad stats for their roles which is VERY important for your survival in low level AD&D. You will want to optimize your character at least a little bit or the combat can be rough. Once you make it out of low levels to around level 5 and have some decent gear the combats get much easier.

There's a certain scent to summer that harkens me back to desperately trying to remember, and find all the easter eggs and charting everything in pen and paper on a notebook, as I switched between six cds like a dj, because that was state of the art technology for the time. I've played it 20+ times, as 20 different characters, and roles and combinations, I still doubt I've found things, and I still get blown up by traps I've forgotten the precise location to even with 110% on find traps, because I move too quickly down corridors, and they all look the same. The characters are like best friends, and indeed, all my best friends IRL I've played multiplayer with since I was in high school, 25 years ago. Once upon a time, I also posited Baldur's Gate as the forefront of RPGs, and fantasy, and drove my Bethesda fan friends mad, much to gloating in 2023 with BG3 vs. Starfield. My whole childhood I struggled with 2.5 D&D rules to play with my Dad, until Baldur's Gate made it like breathing for me and now my brain still ""soft"" resorts to it on a regular basis. There are no quests I don't enjoy, and it remains endlessly quotable.

HOWEVER:

The Enhanced Edition is truly absolutely abysmal. The multiplayer servers are crap. While I dislike changing the fire arrows to +2 (instead of + 1  + fire) because it makes the low level kobold commandos unreasonably deadly if you don't fireball them like a Megumin addicted to explosions, and I dislike changing the art for composite and regular longbows (it's just so unnecessary? WHY?) these are admittedly minor enough to be ignored. But the UI I literally *cannot* use, it actually hurts my vision, and I have no choice but to revert back to the original via finagling. How do you even do that? I have no other remasters that give me this problem, including the glitchy HoMM3 HD. The glitches are also rather unforgivable. There's no telling what will make it struggle, and it forever seems to be a case of their lack of investment either emotionally as fans or monetarily in a long term vision.

Beamdog's added characters are jarring with the original cast, Dorn can't blame his evil alignment for being annoying and patently *un-fun* to take along, because Edwin is evil and hilarious, and even Montaron and Xzar have some charm points about them, and that's not even my nostalgia goggles talking because I never did that back then. Chandra is a little too Manic Pixie which emphasizes how her spells are going to backfire and possibly kill your whole party. I never take Xan because he's such a downer, but I found myself doing so for just a dose of normalcy recently.  Don't even get me started on Siege on Dragonspear. It seems not enough of Beamdog's writers actually ever ENJOYED the original, so they had no idea how to help bring it into the future, and more's the pity. Baldur's Gate has a very loyal devoted fandom of decades, and they literally could have hired better mod writers by just asking any of the forums.

I can't in good conscience recommend the enhanced edition, even twisting myself into pretzel knots. The only thing I can say about it is at least the core game is SOMEWHERE buried under the other poop, even if it takes a powerwash to get it clean, and the multiplayer is NEARLY unusable. For BG3 fans, absolutely Jaheira, Minsc, Imoen, the originals are all here, but you can see which parts are Beamdog vs. the original by quality alone tbh.

10/10 original. 3/10 Beamdog get your act together. You have an opportunity now to make millions. Take it, or forever regret it.",1704810799,1704810799,False,1,0,0.478571414947509766,0,True,False,False

I still have the 6 cd box in the loft and so glad never threw it out. It's part of gaming history. Got to BG but had to restart as I rolled a weak mage (I never play squidgy classes plus a bit rusty...so no idea what I was doing tbf), with Khalid as tank?? and Neera and Rasaad...even on core rules we were scraping by. I HATE Neera, not just her annoying voice\accent but the fact she wiped us out with her stupid wild magic, daemon summoning, hiccups etc. countless times. At times I rage quit. Then her arrogance at some point saying without her we wouldn't get far...and her constant romantic harassment like I'd choose her over Immoen...argggghhhh!!! Rasaad is completely useless he can punch and throw darts, that's it.

So re-rolled my favourite class = pali but went with cavalier. Chose the old favourites: minsc, dyna, khalid, jaheera, immoen...much more fun!!! Actually feels I can complete it without reloading 6 times every toughish encounter.

To conclude: obviously games have moved on and doesn't have the same impact it had back then, but still very playable and enjoyable. Definitely worth playing if you want to experience BG3 in its entirety.

Side quests and shenanigans are good but the chapters are so random and there is no way of knowing some things you need to know for the quests.(Like Kivan leaving your party since there is a time limit to his quest and his objective appears only on Chapter 4 and you can get him in Chapter 1.)

Some of that might be for nostalgic reasons with it being the first RPG of this type that I played several years ago when I was like 14 years old, and the game reminds me of better times, but in saying that, back then I was terrible at the game. I just constantly died and didn't really understand the mechanics or how to do combat effectively.
Nowadays, I'm much more aware of how to play the game effectively and I find the combat fulfilling and tactical - especially if you use the SCS mod, which makes the enemies smarter and more difficult to defeat.
Ultimatley, I would highly recommend this game, but I think a lot of the younger generations might have trouble with it. The graphics aren't amazing (though the art style itself hasn't aged so badly, because they were all handrawn backgrouns), but I think that younger generations are wanting constantly eye-catching, explosively dynamic, cinematic experiences, and that's not this game.
If you're happy with an amazing RPG with a great combat system, in the style of back in the old days, then this is for you.
If you're looking for a cinematic MMO combat experience, then this isn't for you.

For me though, it's one of my favourite games, and I have way more hours spent on it, than the hours my Steam says. I used to play this game a lot before Steam even existed.",1703781441,1703781441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The tutorial at the beginning essentially only tells you how to move around and talk to people, and throughout my time playing the game, I would have to look up several guides to understand what the stats in the game ended up doing and wether or not it made sense for me to invest in them. All you can do is use the manual pdf which is buried somewhere in the gamefiles or use unofficial guides, as the game's mechanics are not intuitive at all.

What makes the gameplay somewhat sluggish and uncomfortable are issues regarding the UI and the controls of the game. The pathing of your units is abysmal, probably the worst I have ever seen in a video game so far. The UI often fails to properly display casting animations, which can be confusing, as you won't be able to tell wether your character has begun casting their spell yet or not.

These issues, although being annoying, are mostly due to the game's age and don't ruin it entirely. Unfortunately, there are other flaws in  the game's design that with prolonged playtime gradually made me want to stop playing it. These flaws have a great influence on gameplay and cannot be avoided or ignored.

Everything in the game is based on RNG. You can barely influence what actually happens in combat. The game will punish you heavily for things that you have no control over. Often, your characters might die instantly due to some invisible trap you could not have possibly seen, or due to some poorly balanced mage boss that kills them with a single spell, without giving you any possibility to prevent their deaths. When you are facing off against the tougher, less balanced enemies featured in the game, the progress you'll have made by leveling up won't matter too much, as it mostly rewards you with additional HP and stat upgrades. 

These will prove to be useless against most mages, who can make your party run away in terror, kill your less beefy characters with a single spell, or turn the one character you have based your entire strategy on into a literal hamster, all without giving you any chance to do anything about it. The mages you frequently end up fighting in the game generally seemed to be pretty overpowered.
 
As you can only swap out your dead party members with new ones or revive them at high costs that scale with their level, and as their inventory will remain on their dead body, a dead companion will often force you to lose a lot of gold, items and -most importantly- time. It is a lot more bearable to quicksave and reload every time somebody dies. This means that you will spend a lot of time fighting the same enemies over and over again, praying that your RNG is favorable, so that your characters manage to stay alive. When one of them kicks the bucket eventually -due to some arbitrary dice roll- reload and start over. This is what fighting any mage or exploring any dungeon that features traps in the game boils down to. Either that, or going through the aggravating experience of trying to distribute your dead companions' loot on the rest of the party.

The game clearly has some strenghts; I really liked how most of the enchanted items felt unique, there were interesting environments to explore, and the character progression is also fun; however, the core gameplay will most likely make you want to kill yourself. Unless you really don't care about your mental health, I don't think this game is for you. It is one of the most overrated games I have ever come across.",1571520636,1703781020,False,8,0,0.494630783796310425,2,True,False,False

+

Character Creation: 
This is one of my favorite parts of the game, creating your character.
In the original Baldurs Gate there already were tons of diffrent ways you could create your characters.
The Enchanced Edition however includes the Class Kits from Baldurs Gate 2 and with Multi-Classing and Dual Classing (which if im gonna try to explain the craziness of that this review would be twice as long) it makes for an insane ammount of replay value.

Gameplay: 
I'v heard people say that this game is complicated  . .to which i say . . compared to modern versions like the Dragon Age games it kinda is, it can get really hard at times too but thats part of why i love Baldurs Gate and other D&D Games.
Its not the kind of game you can just rush through, you have to have some strategy, pay attention and sorta ""learn"" the game.

Music: 
In general a Good soundtrack, don't have much to say here honestly, there's nothing really specal that sticks out.

Characters: 
Apart from the character creation and having lots of diffrent dialogue options to choose from, there's a total of 29 party members to choose from in the game including 4 new ones added to the Enchanced version which is a nice addition.
You don't get to interact with them as much as you do in for example the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series and even though some of the Party members are more useful than others the ammount of people you can choose to have in your party alone makes for lots of replay value.

Story: 
Bioware and Black Isle(Known as Obsidian Entertainment nowdays) have a talent for creating some great and intresting stories in video games and Baldurs Gate is no exception. It's one of the best things about this game in my opinion(dont wanna say much here because i dont wanna spoil anything)

Graphics: 
May not look much compared to Modern games like the Dragon Age Series but(then again it is nearly 20 years old) back then i thought this game looked great dispite the awful resolution in the original version.
Thankfully the Enhanced Edition puts the BG2 engine into the game and makes the resolution extremely nice.

-

The AI in both BG1 and 2 is really derpy at times, there have been plenty of times when i'm in a narrow dungeon and some of my characters go somewhere completely diffrent than what i told them(or even worse goes the wrong way right into a trap or an ambush).
But thats a nitpick for me honestly.

And then of course the thing everyone talks about the Siege of Dragonspear update, oh boy oh boy.
While i don't like the new cartoonish sprites, they look really out of place in the game but i can tolerate that because at least you can disable them.

There might be a couple of bugs here and there but i can forgive that.

The new UI in both BG1 and 2 i thought was Ugly compared to the original which was just fine and i don't understand why someone would even think of changing it.

Final Verdict: 10/10
Even though i i at first got turned off by the New UI when it was first released, after i sat down and replayed it... again i got used to it, Old Ui SoD Ui this is still an epic game.

Even after all these years Baldur's Gate still holds up as one of my Top 10 favorite games of all time, i could play this game forever and never get bored of it.

This game is basiclly one of the reasons why games like the Dragon Age series exists today and if you like me enjoy any RPG made by Bioware or RPGS in general this is a must buy.",1437075491,1703702723,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

You are in the middle of a fight and everyone is missing every swing of the sword and every arrow flying, or it is over in a heartbeat as someone as rolled a critical hit on a low health enemy.    This is very prevalent early one in the game, you do a lot of menial quests while the main story might be on hold as you might find you are under levelled for an enemy or a group of enemies.

It is slow paced and if you are not prepared to put in the hours to see it through you will miss a very satisfying story.  But so often you as the player character can be quickly out of the game all thanks to a dice roll and it is then game over.  But once the characters are getting a few levels under their belt and you have an OK amount of coin (money and inventory pace is almost part of the difficulty) it will get easier.  

Pausing the game often during combat is your friend and assess the situation, changing orders, drinking potions.  Taking damage is not a trivial thing, you can heal by resting or potions or temples but they all cost, resting in the wild, ambushes, in an Inn, you could be attacked, potions aren't cheap and temples aren't either.

But I would highly recommend this game, the story, the sheer depth of everything, the hundreds of hours you could pour in on a single play through and then trying a harder run using the more difficult player classes.

Not necessarily just the enhanced edition, but the original Baldur's Gate too. I will bear that scarlet letter for the rest of my days with pride.

I love low-level fantasy RPGs. I love low-level D&D. I love low-level just about anything. It's more of a level playing field. Mages are just starting out and still quivering in fear, soaking their special magic-man jammies in nervous sweat as they watch a fighter stroll up to them with a big 'ol ax. Ranged combat is king because it's all about offense, and every second they take to trundle over to you is a second you have to make them a living pincushion. Even backstabbing feels worth it. x2 damage means a lot when you're dealing with 1d6 shortswords or 1d4 daggers. The whole game feels more dangerous, more open, and you have to build your party slowly while dodging the entire ecosystem of the Sword Coast (which seems to have a vendetta against you). 

I don't want wizard chess. I don't want fifty abilities. I don't want to have to memorize so many spells that I have to read a novel of descriptions just to figure out that if I cast fireball, my dudes will all die unless I nudge the AoE gently to the left. What I want is simple. I want man with sword, man with bow, man with stabby-sword, man with lightning bolt fingers, and man with touchy-touchy healing powers to wrestle their way up to becoming the heroes of Baldur's Gate - fighting for every inch.

That's not to say that I'm a hardcore player or super into min-maxing. I'm not. I couldn't play my way out of a paper bag. I am a big baby. But levels mean something when your hit points double from four to eight, when you get that extra spell and suddenly you can clown on all those kobolds who bullied you in high school, and when you come out of a fight down four party members and barely hanging onto life and that's a GOOD outcome. Higher level play just... doesn't do it for me. This is a straight-up power fantasy, and it's great. That's what makes Baldur's Gate 1 so special to me.

Most of all, it's a great modding platform. The community is what really makes the game, and Beamdog has been great in facilitating their creativity and know-how. I've never seen a developer of this size working so closely together with modders before. It's great. The game isn't unplayable without mods but even purists are missing out just with QoL and graphical tweaks alone. Could I play without unlimited arrow stacking? Yes, I suppose I could. Would I? No, I'd rather shot up by a hobgoblin drive-by squad toting poison arrows. (I'm still bitter...)

In any case, this game good. Other game? Also good. This game better. You play!",1703474788,1703474788,True,1,0,0.487522780895233154,0,True,False,False

Despite the mechanics and combat being the landmark used in countless similar RPG titles, they are admittedly obsolete now and aren't up to par with others of the genre, more modern ones. I guess I recommend it, however the main, obviously game-breaking issue, is the unacceptable path-finding. Unironically more than half the times, both in and out of combat, the characters cannot, for the life of me, find their way to where I tell them to and get stuck either with each other or on onjects. So basically constant need for micromanagement in movement makes this a very unenjoyable experience.

The general gameplay is still very enjoyable and the story is interesting and engaging. There are a ton of class/race/subclass combinations available which greatly adds to replay value, and most (if not all) of the quests have different options or paths through them for the player to try out.

There are a few things that the player needs to know in order to make the experience of playing smoother though - like setting up autopause options and changing the custom AI scripts so that your characters aren't being dumb in combat (like squishy spellcasters going into melee, or wasting spells on trivial encounters).

There are also a few minor annoyances that show the game's age, like pathing issues and characters getting stuck on each other when trying to move around, or the tedious inventory management. And it has to be said that the balance is atrocious - some of the spells that are acquired at very low levels stay absolutely broken overpowered for the duration of the game and others (even higher level spells) are utterly useless. 

My major (personal and subjective) complaints about the game are firstly that I find the trap system very annoying - some dungeons have hidden traps in them which must be detected by a thief, but trap detection range is very low and it ""ticks"" only once every 6 seconds which forces the player to very slowly move one of their squishier characters through a dungeon at the front of the party, stopping every few steps and waiting 6 seconds at a time. Failing to spot a trap can easily result in party member death as some of them deal huge amounts of damage and can hit multiple targets.

My second major complaint is the fact that BG1 seems to have started the CRPG trend of having a large part of the latter section of the game take place in a big city, which is never as interesting or engaging as the areas that preceded it. Going from exploring an exciting fantasy open world to trudging through identical copy/pasted buildings or a literal sewer kills my desire to keep playing 100% of the time.

Overall though, if you can look past those little gripes and you don't share my own subjective complaints then Baldur's Gate 1 is still a great game worthy of it's place in the RPG hall of fame, and definitely worth playing.",1701866453,1701866453,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I find the gameplay and story in BG1 to be very dull.

The first 3 towns have almost nothing going on, and the only quests you can take on involve fighting a group of enemies, with either little to no dialogue. I can count on one hand the amount of times i used my charisma stat in dialogue. The only remotely interesting thing to happen in the 7 hours i've played was Sarevok killing Gorion, but nothing has happened since.

Short Answer: I had a dang good time in both the original and new content!

Pros: 
-The characterization is excellent, BioWare and Beamdog really know how to bring a clump of pixels to life.
-The stories are varied and engaging. Some are kinda dated, but they made the effort to make this ‚Äúyour adventure.‚Äù
-The large selection of companions was overwhelming at first but now I can appreciate the variety they add to multiple playthroughs.
-I appreciate that the game as a whole accommodates a lot of play styles, letting you be heroic or villainous, and having companions who can aid/enable you.
-The major villains from the original game and the expansion are excellent nemeses for the protagonist, with some NASTY final battles in both adventures.
-Now that I have started BG2 I really appreciate what work put into Siege of Dragonspear to make the transition to BG2 a little smoother than ‚Äúand then you were captured.‚Äù

Cons:
-I don‚Äôt think I would enjoy playing ADnD in real life (thankfully BG does all the math for me). It is somewhat impenetrable and inaccessible (a +1 means -1 except where it means +1, still not entirely sure what a THACO is).
-Pathing has killed me a few times but building impeccable pathing is pretty much impossible anyway, since it can‚Äôt read your mind. I still tear my hair out when my character walks the direction that leads into a trap or ambush but that‚Äôs what save-scumming is for.
-The first few hours of the game is rough on a new player who has to learn just how many hard-knocks this school can have, but once you get going with gear and spells and party composition it lightens up. This does require you to know how all your party‚Äôs classes work, which requires more onboarding.

Overall, I spent about 140 hours to finish both the original game and Siege of Dragonspear and I am considering another playthrough as another class already.",1701572495,1701572495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Absolutely worth playing if you can get into the 2nd Edition D&D rules, which are admittedly pretty clunky in their old age. Unfortunately, the game doesn't do anything to help you learn those rules, so I'd recommend watching a beginner's guide if you're new to the system. Mortismal Gaming has a good one at :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPyY0X5jmg
The story and setting are both top-notch, and it's a pretty great low-level campaign. The Enhanced Edition is a perfect way to experience this story; install and go with no hassle trying to modernize the old aspect ratio or non-scaling UI of the original. It also adds a few characters and quests, which you can safely ignore if you are a purist.
If you enjoy the base game, I'd even recommend trying out the Siege of Dragonspear expansion. Reception to it was pretty mixed, but I had a lot of fun with it. It's set between Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, and attempts to fill in the story gap (not that it was really needed). While only a few quests reach real brilliance, and it does kind of feel like ""fanon,"" they did a good job giving you multiple ways to solve problems in a number of sections, and your actions do have consequences even if they aren't drastic.

The short version:

- It is old. So the graphics are rather simple, and you might be annoyed with some control features
- The amount of content is huge. You will have enough to do for weeks.

Now some info and recommendations for this type of game:

- It is a Dungeons and Dragons Style RPG. This means three things:
1: You cannot be good at everything. Carefully consider who you wish to be and what your skills are. That also includes moral actions. You cannot be a dick and a saint at the same time. 
- Save regularly. Fights are dependent on a random number factor. This can kill you in a second, or let you win with ease.
- You cannot complete every quest in one playthrough. Some will only be available if you're aggressive or an ass, or if you pick the corresponding companions.

Some recommendations for the game itself:
- Maps / graphics are static and cannot be viewed from a different angle. Move your cursor around to find hidden entrances and stuff to click.
- Check the loot of every enemy you killed. Quest items are not always marked and WILL disappear after a while.
- Look into every house / interior and talk to everyone. Many quests are hidden this way.
- Leaving any area in a specific direction actually matters. Leave an area upwards, you will find new places in that direction. Same to the left, right, etc
- lower or negative stat values from an item CAN be better. Just see which values turn green (better) or red (worse)",1699482454,1701415932,True,78,1,0.887162148952484131,0,True,False,False

Unless you are a crpg fan, BG3 is a very specific flavor of CRPGs (because its Larian.) and you will not get the same gameplay. there isnt a turn base system in BG1 or 2 and there is no pushing or throwing or enviromental hazards outside of spells and traps. no oil barrels. 

BG uses 2e I believe (correct me if i am wrong) and BG3 uses 5e, which means very different systems further contributing to a different experience.

Baldur's Gate is a very long game and doesn't really hold your hand at all, but after a few hours, you will have picked up on most of the game's system to plan effectively for combat encounters. The story, in my opinion, is the best of what Baldur's Gate has to offer even though it is a very by-the-numbers fantasy adventure, but that is exactly what most D&D tabletop games end up being so it is faithful to its source material, with all that being said the story is interesting enough for you to want to keep playing to see what happens.

The main issue with Baldur's Gate is the filler content. Many side quests are just uninteresting which in itself is fine because you can't expect every quest to be a hit, but most side quests come down to simple fetch quests. I found the content added in the Tales of the Sword Coast to be very uninteresting, it has fetch quests that are even more drawn out. Tales of the Sword Coast has quests you'll do for the XP boost, but not the actual content of the expansion. It might seem like I'm really tearing into this game now, but Tales hardly brings down the overall quality of the game, skip it if you want.

This is the Enhanced Edition of the game and I think it accomplished everything it set out to do very well. This port ran great on my machine, never had a single crash in my first play through which lasted over 60 hours. I thought the content added in the EE was good, maybe it would stick out if you played the original game back in 1998, but I didn't so it worked just fine for me. the only way I could tell that it was new content was that most of it is voice acted which isn't a bad thing.

Twenty five years after it was released, and I'm still trying to find new ways to play the game. That fact is likely more eloquent than anything I am likely to write, but I'll try nonetheless.

While the gameplay will same dated to some, it certainly did not feel that way at the time. Largely true to 2nd Edition D&D, it did not go out of its way to make things easy for players. Spells did not refresh in 10-30 seconds, but only after your party rested for eight in-game hours. You did not heal while running around the map, but instead had to use magic or spend days resting at an inn. Don't have the right weapons or spells? You might find yourself entirely unable to defeat an enemy. When you beat the game, you felt like you earned it. If it took 80 hours to do so? Well, that was normal.

The real standout for me, though, was the NPCs. In BG1 and later BG2 the companions you recruited to take with you on your journey - and there were plentiful options - were given real personalities and goals of their own. From the girl next door (and honorary little sister) Imoen, to psychotic megalomaniac Tiax, these were characters you could not help but remember. You just had to remember not to bring companions with opposing perspectives together, or they might try to kill each other.

The overall story for both BG1 and BG2 were perfect high fantasy. It all starts in a fantastical world, which had been under development for decades before the notion of a game called Baldur's Gate ever even sparked into existence. A young, inexperienced hero starts their epic journey, gaining in power until they are able to defeat the evil, bigger-than-life villain. Well, some villains. You might be recruiting some villains to help you. Your call.

However, it is also a game that came out in 1998 and it shows. It was absolutely a game that benefited from this Enhanced Edition. The HUD is more manageable, the character textures sharper, and the turn based gameplay mostly unchanged. I also like that the game updated the D&D rules to allow for more classes and weapons to be used in-game. Basically, I felt like I was reliving my childhood, just with a few surprises in store.

My main issue with the remake is the new content. While it was great to hear the original cast back in their iconic roles (RIP David Warner), and it creates a nice bridge between Baldur's Gate and Shadows of Amn, the writing lacks the BioWare touch. Characters such as Neera, Rassad, and Glint do not fit into the game because their dialogue is written in sharp modern contrast to the original game's dialogue. It can be jarring as a result. It does not help that you can automatically tell which dialogue options are listed by alignment (1=good, 2-neutral, 3=evil). 

Overall, I enjoyed this game. The importance for me was how I felt playing this remake, more specifically if I felt the same awe, wonder, and fun I had playing the original way back when. And despite the new jarring dialogue, and characters, I felt like a kid again.

You want to be a generic human fighter? Go for it. You wanna be a psychopathic orc wizard and flay thousands? You can if you'd really like it. The options you are presented with to roleplay your character are nearly endless and it's impressive for a product of 1997 (with some modern updates with this edition).

You start off by building your character in a very detailed creator, you may be a human, elf, half-orc and a few other races. You also have a variety of classes and kits within those classes to pick from so you can be essentially whatever playstyle you can imagine, even down to the detail of it complimenting a good or evil character. There are even over a dozen fun voices you can give your character that add all the more personality to them. Then you are thrust into the world of the Sword Coast.

Whoever your character is, they have a pretty privileged life as you reside in a castle world famous for its library, but one day tragedy strikes and you must run away for your life and explore the harsh world around you. This epic journey to discover yourself brings you from tiny mining towns to rugged mountains, stormy coasts and green plains until eventually you reach the famous city of Baldur's Gate itself. Baldur's Gate really gives you the authentic urban experience as you must deal with petty criminals, attempted murder and overzealous law enforcement, but the walls contain the great secret you are searching for.

The main story is beautiful and gets a 9/10 from me as it has relatively few flaws that can actually ruin the experience for a new player. Now onto the expansions

Tales of the Sword Coast adds a village wherein you can undertake new quests if you so desire, including but not limited to icy islands, quests across the sea and discovering ancient evils that were locked away for good reason. Depending on your morality and what you enjoy doing this may not be the longest expansion ever but it adds good content and adds some replay value if you want those achievements.

Siege of Dragonspear is the big selling point Beamdog made with this edition, does it hold up? First to address some ancient controversies that may turn off some people, a specific individual who caused controversies and review bombings is a relatively minor character I spoke to like twice and doesn't bring up a certain topic unless you really pursue it, so do not worry if that concerns you.

SoD is in my opinion a really well made expansion that added some context to the setting of the second game, expanded on relationships made in the base game and makes for some dramatic storytelling that kept me engaged the whole way through. There are also new companions who are added as well, if you enjoyed the really clever and fun companions before then there are a few new people you may be pleased with, and if you don't like them then you may avoid the majority of them as most are not relevant to the plot.

After winning the events of the first game your retirement is interrupted by an invading army that flooded the city with refugees and is now threatening you, so everybody bands together and marches on dragonspear castle in an attempt to thwart this so called crusade. There is a ton of tension and drama going on behind the scenes so you will get a kick out of this if you are into it.

The basic setting is essentially the same, you won't really find yourself in too many strange environments that differ from the base game but in a brand new region. On top of all the new content you also have a myriad of fun new side quests to do that I found to be just as strong as what you would find in the original product. SoD is truly a work of love and I really enjoyed my experience with it!

The other expansion is a relatively short one known as the Black Pits, you are a captured fighter in the Underdark fighting for the entertainment of depraved Drow. Not much to add here other than its an arena and you must fight for your life against ever increasingly difficult foes.

All things considered this game is a masterpiece of a roleplaying experience and I very strongly recommend this, even if you know nothing about DnD you will have a fun time with this game and the drama you will be found participating in.",1700516670,1700516796,True,4,0,0.564311802387237549,0,True,False,False

However, if you are expecting any character interaction like in Bioware's later games, this one unfortunately doesn't have that. This would change in the second game as it has more of a focus on its characters, but there is still an interesting story here, and I'd recommend you play this one first before you play the second. They also added a new ""difficulty mode"" called story mode, or, as I like to call it, game journalist mode, where the game literally plays itself. Look, this game can be a cruel mistress and is very difficult at times, but I'd recommend looking up guides on how to beat certain encounters that are giving you trouble. You'd be surprised at what you can do if you play your cards right. This game is very rewarding when engaging with the rule set, but playing in story mode ruins the entire game and experience. You might as well look up a playthrough online, as you would get the same experience. As for the difficulty as a whole, I'd recommend Normal for a first playthrough and Core Rules for later playthroughs. Any difficulty above Core Rules just adds more health to the enemy's and makes your party do less damage, which is a very lazy and artificial way of making the game harder. There is one problem with this version of the game, and that is that the new 2D movies by Beamdog don't disseminate the information that the original movies do. I'm not sure why they changed them in this game because they didn't in the second. Also, the new companions are terribly written and clearly not part of the original game. There are two mods that reconcile these flaws. The first to remove the new companions is Convenient Enhanced Edition NPCs; the second to restore the original movies is BG:EE Classic Movies. Both can be found on GitHub. The most recent version of Convenient Enhanced Edition NPCs is 4.3, and the most recent version of BGEE Classic Movies is V2.3.1. Extract them separately with WinRAR or 7-Zip and drop them into your games directory. Run the executable for both.

Or you can create your own party at the beginning, but you'll miss out on the organic nature and camaraderie of the legendary notable AD&D characters you can recruit along the way.

Even on easier difficulties you can and will die multiple times if you don't pay attention to the environments and enemies you're facing.

Loot is varied, helpful, and allows your characters to progress, such as gaining new spells, special enhancements, new ammo types, ect.

Yes, it's old-school, and clunky in places, but it has charm, it's organic, well crafted, and made to high standards that is sorely lacking in many modern day RPG's. It was made by people who cared about what they were producing and had a deep love of the source material, and it shows.

As much a masterpiece today as it was in its heyday, and well deserving of its place in anyone's RPG library, offering hours and hours of rich, handcrafted adventuring alongside the legendary characters and heroes of the AD&D world.",1700157144,1700157386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First things first, for the love of God, if you have never played ADnD before do not play on core rules setting, or frankly even normal difficulty. Easy or story mode is the way to go. Easy provides enough challenge for the new player to sink their teeth into, story basically turns the combat into an automatic affair, which might seem boring but is absolutely preferable to being murdered constantly without really knowing why or what to do about it. I played my first playthrough on core rules thinking I would get the 'authentic' Baldur's Gate experience, and, frankly, I wish I had given myself the grace to lower it at some point in the process. This is true for every game, but it is especially true here; there is no shame in pushing that slider down to whatever level feels manageable. 

Second, autopause is your friend. With exception of maybe damage I recommend turning basically all of them on at the start and then get rid of whatever ones annoy you most as time goes on. 

Finally, remember this game is largely a slow and relatively low stakes adventure, especially in the mid section. Mess around, go exploring, find out what you like. Learning how to take your time is key to enjoying the experience. Listen to the birds, appreciate the environments, grow to love the sound of your characters' footsteps. Games that operate at the pace this one proceeds at are rare these days, so learning how to slow down is, I think, maybe the biggest hump to get over before you can really fully fall in love with it. Level ups, story info, new areas, everything comes slowly in this game. Breathe out and take your time, there's no rush.

Take these going forward and I think you'll start to understand what it was people fell in love with back in the day. As someone with an interest in gaming history and a love for modern CRPGs, I went back into this without a clear vision of what to expect and it took me a while to see the sparkle through all the esoteric mechanical elements. Work with these strange features and they'll do you wonders, though.

If a character joins up and tells you that they need to get somewhere, try to head that way as soon as you can. It's easy to get sidetracked and that particular NPC may leave you for good.
Try not to miss out on the powerful artifact just east of the Friendly Arm entrance and the very useful item hidden in the farm fields in Nashkel.
Your party should include at least a Cleric, a Wizard, a frontline fighter, and someone with thief skills. Most of these roles can be multiclassed if necessary (a Cleric/Mage is fine, for example.)
Don't hoard your consumables, use them whenever things get rough.
The Golden Pantaloons can be carried over to the sequel and doing so while also finding and holding on to that game's set of Pantaloons will eventually net you an interesting reward in the sequel's expansion.

Character Stats

Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma. Most attributes are very top-heavy, 17/18 is where they start having real impact while the difference between 10 and 14 is minimal.
Armor Class: Lower is better, 10 is the worst. Your defence against physical attacks that's based off your Dexterity bonus, armor, shield and any magic protective spells/equipment.
THAC0: Lower is better, 20 is the worst. Your attack rating, equal to the number you need to roll on a 20-sided die to hit 0 Armor Class.
Saving Throws: Lower is better. Your non-physical defenses against magic attacks, poison, etc. To succeed at a save, you need to roll equal to or above your Saving Throw value on a 20-sided die.

The writing isn't much better, and I'd even say that modern Bioware hasn't yet sunk this low.

Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a modernized version of the beloved 1998 classic, preserving the essence and nostalgia of the original far better than Baldurs Gate 3 does while offering enhanced visuals, improved mechanics, and various quality-of-life improvements. It remains true to the original's spirit, delivering an experience that captures the magic of the past. The original ""Baldur's Gate"" narrative is renowned for its depth and complexity, far more so than that of Baldurs Gate 3. The story in ""Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition"" is a testament to the art of storytelling in RPGs, featuring intricate character development, morally ambiguous choices, and a world steeped in history. It's a tale that immerses players deeply within the Forgotten Realms universe. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition includes the original game as well as its expansion, Tales of the Sword Coast. The wealth of content and side quests provides countless hours of gameplay, ensuring that you'll never run out of adventures to embark on. The modding community for Baldur's Gate is thriving, with numerous user-generated content and enhancements that can be added to the game. This level of customization far exceeds that of Baldurs Gate 3 and thus allows players to tailor their experience to their preferences, extending the game's longevity and replayability. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition has had years to mature and develop a dedicated fan base. The result is a polished and refined gaming experience with patches and updates that have ironed out many of the original game's issues unlike that state Baldurs Gate 3 is in at this point in time. The continued success of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition has solidified its status as a timeless classic. It has consistently received praise for its ability to capture the essence of the original game while making it more accessible to modern audiences.

Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition stands as a testament to the enduring greatness of the original game. It not only respects the legacy of the Baldur's Gate series, Unlike its contemporary counterpart, but also enriches it with modern enhancements and accessibility.

I really love the improved UI system, and how it incorporated the extra features for the character creation system that Baldur's Gate 2 introduced, as well as adding new difficulty levels - story mode for one thing.

I will say that the new DLC for the game, Siege of Dragonspear, really adds to the fun. Love the storyline of it, and the additional characters and locations it provides. I particularly love it from being a bridge between Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 - I never could understand why the original developers never thought to properly do that before.

Overall, this is a must have for all those that loved Dungeons & Dragons and isometric RPGs, whether you're a veteran of Baldur's Gate or a newcomer. The fun is still there, and its great to replay this since I first played the original back in the 90s.",1574460421,1698954147,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Would recommend a Youtube guide that describes BG combat as it uses the AD&D rules, as a number of things are counter intuitive to how you would think it would work if you are more familiar with modern D&D. For example, AC is based on the overarching THACO system. So as you put on better armor, your armor level goes down, which is confusing, but that's what this game wants. You want to get your AC into the negatives as that means you are harder to hit.

The Beamdog additional companions suck. Neera is a god tier companion in BG2, but in BG1, she sucks, same with Rasaad (literally worst battle companion in the game), the edgy Orc Blackguard (he big and mean, that's his character). The writing of all these new editions completely clashes with a game remade 18 years after the original. The tone is completely different, you can tell the writing is being done by a person who was 3 years old when BG1 released.

The plot is very intricate and requires you to think about the greater context of the world other than chasing down the bad man with the horns. It has a lot to do with the war economy, trying to inflame tensions between two nations. and that's all I'll say. It's a smart political story that most developers today would not trust the audience to understand. 

100% recommended, but just watch a guide to understand why combat works the way it does. Yes, the best guides can be over an hour long, but it'll make your next 80 hours much better,",1698638107,1698638107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A good example is that BG1 has one of the best dungeons in any game I've ever played as well as some really bad dungeons which are made worse by the games horrible path-finding.

At its core the game is an old school game based on an old school RPG, its tough and rewards preparation and a certain level of paranoia. Some enemies can instantly kill you (the game signposts this relatively well), you can stumble into encounters way above your level and many of the crowd control spells are brutally powerful. 
Where the old-school feel works really well is wandering around the wilderness areas finding items, quests and characters to join your party. 
I've got complicated feelings about this game and could write a long rambling review but I'll just note down some key points.

Story: Great idea decently executed but let down by uneven writing quality and the occasional exposition dumps.
Game-play: Satisfying combat held back by middling to poor encounter and map design. But when it's fun, it's fun.
Characters: Base game the NPCS are very basic and although they are often elevated by fun voice acting performances I would highly recommend trying the BG1 NPC project mod. This gives some dialogue with the characters which is overall very good with some hiccups here and there.
Music / Sound: Very good, helps make adventuring in the wilderness a lot of fun
Graphics: Character models and animations are fine but the wilderness backgrounds look great, urban environments are so-so.

If you are into classic RPGs and haven't played this I would say give it a shot but it's not a must play in my opinion.",1698607175,1698607175,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So, if you are curious about trying this game because its a classic, i won't stop you and i would actually recommend to TRY IT, but the moment you hit some frustration or you feel progression slowing really down, to drop the game and never look back. You should be able to get a good 10 to 20 hours of decent fun. 

I guess i'll start with the good stuff. The charm of the game is still present decades later. Its impressive how much life the developer were able to inject in the game with limited resources that they had. For that alone, it is worth experiencing. Some of the characters quote has been literally etched into my mind forever. The story is still good by today's standard and the world feels large even though it is split by map. Really, i can't stress enough how much on the presentation level, lore and immersion, i have nothing but praise.

The problems lies in the difficulty and the progression. This game is EXTREMELY punishing, even a bit too much. Lets say you are a party of 6 against a warrior, a mage and two archer. Chances are, you are about to get fucked unless you get godlike rolls. The best approach to any fight that has a large group of enemies is literally to cast Horror 2 times and hope a good portion of the enemy group start running around. If that doesn't happen, well GG tough luck, better reload. Another example, you are fighting a strong mage with two minions. You try to put him to sleep and charm it. Tough luck, your two rolls missed and the mage cast a bouncing lightning bold and 3 member of your party is dead. Welp, better reload since its pretty much over. And example like this i have a ton of them.

Then, there is the randomness when resting or travelling. Why on earth does every time we rest and or travel there is chances of enemy encounter in a game i can reload whenever i want ? And i know the dev knows this is stupid, because in the last area of the game, guess what, to make it easier to reach the last boss, you can rest 100% guarantee no encounter (at least, it felt like that). Why is this activated at normal difficulty i do not know. And with encounters this punishing, guess which option the player is going to choose.

Also, talking about punishing, i never used the resurrection in the chapel and i don't see the use of it. When a party member dies, you can resurrect it at a chapel, but you need to transport ALL of there stuff back to a city, since all when they die, they keep the stuff on the ground. Why on earth would i do that instead of reloading. ?

Finally progression. So for the first 10-20 hours of the game, you met new companions, you level up, etc. Progression is a bit slow, but comes at a steady pace. But, once you reach the 25 hours mark or around level 5, progressions start to slow down to a crawl. Barely any new companion, levels takes forever and better gear is rare. Feels like you start to stale a bit and you feel you have to grind in order to keep up.

So as you can see, i have some gripe with the game. I think im glad i played it, but at the same time, i felt i wasted my time. Maybe with BG 2, i can feel the first one was worth going through since you can import you character from the first game. But has is, i only recommend for people to TRY the game, but to not finish it. Create a character, reach level 4 or 5, get some party members and do some quests, but the moment you start to feel progressions is too slow or the game is too frustrating, drop the game and play something else.",1698521084,1698523393,False,1,1,0.481751799583435059,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed more than 100 hours of the main campaign on both Core Rules and then Legacy of Bhaal difficulty (which acts as a NG+), and could easily go back with a new character in the future.

Magic felt excellent, character development and choices were slow and impactful, and it really felt like playing through my own D&D campaign. Even the combat system is 20 years ahead of it's time.

Having said all that, Beamdog are lucky this is going down as a positive review rather than a negative.

'Enhanced Edition' is a misnomer - the newer content added by Beamdog sticks out like a sore thumb as amateur, poorly written and not well integrated into the main game. This should be optional, instead they've rewritten a game and altered history to better suit themselves. Fortunately not much of the main campaign was touched, bar a few goofy characters and pointless side quests, which I promise you you will not miss. In fairness, the quality of life content such as a potion bag was appreciated.

However, the expansion they added - Siege of Dragonspear - I highly recommend against playing and just moving straight on to Baldur's Gate II. I can't adequately describe how bad the writing is in Beamdog's own creation. The SJW nonsense hits you in the face right out of the gate - all the men are bumbling idiots for example, whereas all the women are filling traditional male roles and are strong, ruthless and obnoxious.

That aside, the story, dialogue and quests are clearly written by somebody who did not know what they were doing and had no respect for the source material. It reads and feels nothing like the previous excellent game we'd played!

Previously excellent characters have had their entire personalities altered to suit MODERN AUDIENCES and what these people think they want. A previously fearless barbarian companion, famous for his pet hamster and battlecries, was reduced to a bumbling idiotic sidekick who all the others constantly made condescending comments about. Anyone making those kind of comments in the first, true game would have been beaten to death with his huge hulking fists (S 18/93).

One of the first quests I received was 'Cheer up Torpil' - what the hell are we concerned about the emotions of a sulking background NPC, and why is my epic high fantasy roleplay being written like a twelve-year old's text messages?!

I could go on for hours, however it's not fair to focus exclusively on the piss-poor job Beamdog did 'enhancing' the world. I said earlier 'the first, true game' and that's exactly how it will go down in my memory. Don't let these people take what we love from us. 

Baldur's Gate remains an excellent game, and truly worth a playthrough or two, especially for those too young to have enjoyed the original release.

I was also a big fan of the exploration aspect of different maps of Baldur's Gate 1 main game, was always intrigued to find out if I'd find a NPC or a new type of enemy. 
The combat and the RPG character building aspect did confuse me a bit as I'm not familiar with D&D, but I had a friend help me with it. I quite liked the abilities each class had and it was always exciting to identify new types of loot for use and how they might change how I play (Keep in mind I played BG1/Sword Coast on Normal and Siege of Dragonspear on Core Rules).

The Sword Coast DLC was really enjoyable addition, I especially like the Durlag's Tower dungeon, which is easily the best dungeon in the game. Good mix of puzzles, story and combat encounters. The other stuff in the village is also fun with the getaways to the mage dungeon or Balduran's Shipwreck Island.

Siege of Dragonspear was another addition made my Beamdog in the last decade and I really enjoyed the story in it. I love the increased focus on the Bhaalspawn aspect of your character and how they elaborate on that. The additional dialogue from companions is also a great boon. 

I will be going back to play more older CRPGs now and I cannot wait to play Baldur's Gate 2. 

Highly recommend it to RPG fans :)

I'll admit, I didn't expect much from [i] Baldur's Gate [/i] going in. [i] A top-down, initially PC-only RPG from 1998?[/i], I thought. [i] How good could it possibly be?[/i] Well, as it turns out, this game is very good indeed. I picked it up on sale based on a friend's recommendation, and as you can see by my hours played, I've been thoroughly enjoying it.  For one thing, it's a D&D game, with all the classic high-fantasy adventure and aesthetics that description implies. As a 5th Edition D&D player myself (and a longtime fan of J.R.R. Tolkien and the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard), my interest was piqued when I learned of this connection. With swords and sorcery aplenty, this is a great game for fantasy fans, even if the story isn't terribly deep or complex. Secondly, the combat and experience systems are really well-done and simple enough to understand once you read up on it, or if you happen to have played old-school D&D. Thirdly, each party member is unique and has lots of personality. However, it did take a few abandoned playthroughs for me to reach the point where I liked this game. The interface is more than a little clunky by today's standards, particularly if you're not very used to a mouse-and-keyboard interface (as I wasn't when I bought this), and all the character stats can be a bit confusing at times.

You start to understand the mechanics. You start to realize how ridiculously powerful your character can be if built correctly. More importantly, you look up how to cheat in a bag of holding. This game holds charm, but only for the those that are willing to persevere through its initial difficulty and ancient mechanisms. 

I would strongly suggest this game, and I would also strongly suggest you build a fighter/something else. I played through with a fighter pure first, and decided I didn't enjoy it enough so went back and did fighter/mage/thief and I am now having a blast. The story is fun, and the items are sometimes very powerful.

Some things hold it back, basically things from the past as this a remaster and not a full remake. For instance the first couple of levels (like 1-5) is so boring. Also quests have timers, side quests are very short usually a few ingame days. Main quest thankfully has no limit on it. So once you start a side quest you better finish it, also companion quests are the shortest timer on them so always prioritise them.

Also the main quest is very short I assume because of the remaster (EE) since the journal and map pretty much show you where to go, but the meat of the game is the exploration and different outcomes.

This a grand adventure in storytelling and well worth it if you're willing to be patient and suffer through brutal abuse. Starting off at lvl 1 with DnD rules is no small feat so prepare to die as if you were trying to cross a river in Oregon trail...or wait...do kids even know about that reference anymore? The horrors of Dysentery?! I suppose not, so I'll put it this way, this game will have you save scumming constantly at first, which is a critique I had decades ago and what I think is its biggest barrier to entry now. 

If you persevere through the first few hours you're in for a treat. If not, I suggest playing bulders gate 2 first or lowering the difficulty to story mode. The rewards for the patient are vast but if you're opposed to old graphics, reading, grand storytelling, and some tough adventure...well...this probably won't be your cup of tea. Many are coming here from Bulder's Gate 3 wondering where it came from and I'm here to tell ya its a different experience. A great experience but different...don't be surprised if it doesn't clique with you immediately. I adored this game in my early teen years and I still get thrown off by the ""charms"" of its age when I come back decades later. Give it a few hours and if you still don't like it, try bulders gate 2, neverwinter nights, or another oldschool CRPG that might tickle your fancy.

Again, they don't make games like this anymore (with some indie exceptions) but if you want to experience where Bulder's Gate 3, most of Bioware's games, Obsidian, and some Bethesda titles came from...this is the granddaddy of them...and he won't just threaten to whup your ass while walking 4 miles, with no shoes, during an ice storm in the winter.

BG1 is still well worth playing, although you see how time passed regarding world building, quest design and combat-story balance. You'll enjoy it more when you don't try to compare it to today's standards, as through today's perspective, the game is unnecessarily grindy while at the same time having an annoying exp cap too far before the end, and, in my opinion, the story doesn't really deliver and the side quests remain superficial for today's standards. Just the Add-On content gives a hint at what Bioware would create with BG2. 
Still, it is an enjoyable experience, especially seeing it as a time capsule of the first steps in actual modern RPG design, and of course paving the way for the legendary BG2:Shadows of Amn and ToB, which are masterpieces that definitely withstood the test of time (I still consider BG2 one of the best games ever made).

The Beamdog-made add-on Siege of Dragonspear in my opinion took a lot of unnecessary crap. It is - of course - better done than BG1 as it is more modern, and the story quality is somewhere between BG1 and BG2, making it a nice interlude with some memorable moments. In my opinion, it also doesn't spoiler too much. Instead, it triggered just the right amount of nostalgia to directly jump into Baldur's Gate 2 again, and I appreciate a lot seeing how much effort people put into a game that wasn't even necessary, but still fits well in between part 1 and part 2 and gives it a kind of canonical connection. I noticed a few bugs and SoD makes it hard to play an evil party, but who cares. It was a lot of fun.
At the time of writing this review, I just finished playing through BG1 and SoD and it took me more than 90 hours for one playthrough, so this is also value for money regarding the time and fun you get. Please don't forget that you can import your character directly into BG2!

Too bad that Bioware started to go downhill after that. Both Neverwinter Nights and Dragon Age: Origins were without doubt great games, but they never again reached the level of perfect writing both in story and party interaction. Dragon Age died with part 2, and Mass Effect died with part 3. It's always sad to see great studios go down, but well, thanks to CDProjekt RED, Larian Studios and others, there are still great RPGs out there.

I'm replaying BG1 and BG2 to get the whole experience and brush up my memories, to enjoy Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 even more than I already do. I recommend you do the same :)",1695759656,1695760025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They do not flee of hard work. 

the game really tries to immerse you. there are no waypoints or absence of gore in story or in mechanics. EVERYTHING has consequences. npcs and side characters has wants and needs and will demand them of you. the fights are challenging. (although I played in story mode it was clear to see) the game has puts lots of effort. and if you also install npc project mod. you will be overjoyed.

I played dragon age origins before this and I did enjoy the story but the many slow pace factos drew me away from the game. my problem with these kind of RPGs are that they are painstakingly slow. we have 6 slots for characters and when you ahve 6 you share the same exp. that was something I learnt from a video while playing dlc... there are many secrets, expolits, and many more that you need to learn. the game is way too wide to try to do all the missions in one playthrough. this is common for a real RPG tho.

but my problems with dragon age continue here. even while selling items I have to sell them one by one for each character. and although the game is old, there is no stash... and when you have full inventory you might suffer the same fate I did which is losing your items because the game replaces your item with the quest item hence dropping it to the ground hence it will vanish after a while hence you will either be stuck in a quest if it was a quest item or you might lose a container that you cannot acquire again like I did. tbh with you this was tilting as hell. the game I played more than 40 hours means nothing no more. even my save is worthless. I can't bring this to the 2nd game anymore. not only that but when dlc starts they dispense all your side characters with their inventory. meaning all the valuable items you had on them is gone now. there are some empty buildings people use to stock items as stash. as I did I put most of the unique items or very strong items in game to such stashes. and what do I now? the dlc won't allow me to travel back there so yeah my save is busted yet again. 

the game is handcrafted, wide, thought provoking, immersive these are all true. but the flaws... there are many a dialogue in which you will think your characters are talking to brick walls instead of each other. this is not a common happening but I played with more than 1 mod meaning this probably happens a lot more. in the dlc there wasn't much of a mod so I ve seen it much more and I must say this is a big minus on the game. what is the point of making a system that you will have to put many an hour, slow the pace of the game to the hellpits and don't make it right so the immersion is gone either way. 

look although the game was hard to play as it was old I still enjoyed the game and I would have played it again even if I had known all of this before. many of my problems stem through the game's choice of prioritizing npcs. npcs that you can get in your group might force you take another npc or leave, might want to do something and you would need to promise to do it and if you don't do it for a long while they might leave. a good natured character might argue with a bad natured one and leave. a good natured character might flat out attack you for a bad action you took. 

so the main source of the story is not you it is the npcs and I would have no problem with that except we are still playing a game with an end. with everything I have said above this makes everything very very painstaking. the details are lost, the bugs are lost many things the devs couldn't have gone through to give us such a wide world. this is of course what many a people will ignore to experience such a living world.(way better than skyrim on that part) but the point stands that the pros comes with cons and this is not a game that is for everyone. I really aspire to play an RPG game that will blow my mind and this wasn't it. I would still prefer this over a generic assasins creed game but there I knew what I was getting as in here, I face many a stupid things as burning my save as aforementioned. 

the game was hard on the cons than the pros and I haven't even got to why I couldn't finish dlc off of a bug. but alas I don't have to. from the first achievement of the dlc to be a rare one it is clear people didn't like the dlc anyways and I can understand. so I won't suggest the dlc but the main game.",1695441934,1695441934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Baldur's Gate is a 2D isometric CRPG from the golden age and critically acclaimed as one of the best of its genre ever made. With the original hailing from 1998, the game needed some work. The enhanced edition provides several updates, such as native support for current high-resolution monitors and over 400 improvements to the original experience.
But does this time-worn classic have what it takes to stand amongst the pantheon of current CRPGs, or has it been slain and left in the dust?

[h1]Story[/h1]
Having spent your entire life behind the thick and sturdy walls of Candlekeep, you have little experience of the world beyond them. Your foster father, Gorion, has done everything in his power to keep you out of harm's way, but as mysterious circumstances unfold, fate forces you to flee and leave your friends behind.

It is here beyond the walls of your former home that tragedy befalls you both.

Now alone, you, ""Gorion's Ward"", as the game refers to you, are drawn into a conflict that threatens to plunge the entire Sword Coast into war. With little more than vague directions from Gorion, your journey begins.

Baldur's Gate is one of the few games that captivated and enthralled me within the story for the entirety of the campaign. The narrative is well-written, the conversations feel honest and realistic, and the general world-building brims with impeccable detail.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3]Your life ends here.[/h3]
Combat encounters in this game are a double-edged sword. All of them are engaging and story-driven moments within the world-building, but they can become incredibly tedious due to the 2nd Edition ruleset. I won't cover the ruleset in great detail, but quite a few resources online explain it far better than I can under such character limitations.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039637204

Engagements begin upon encountering an enemy, and usually, there is a frontal dialogue to detail the reason for the fight with your new enemy before the battle begins. There are very few abilities to utilise here, especially for melee characters, and they will tend to engage and swing at the enemy until it dies. Casters are more complex and require a little more prep work to be effective in encounters. You need to memorise spells from scrolls and then rest overnight to be able to use that spell, but once they learn the magic, it is theirs forever, and they will only need to rest to replenish its uses.

Buffs for your party are critical within Baldur's Gate because many enemies are immensely mighty, and the odds are often heavily stacked in their favour. Buffing your party with haste, armour, and stat increases will help level the playing field, providing you with a fairer position to fight.

[h3]There are s-so many places I would rather be.[/h3]
As with any RPG, regardless of its format, exploration is critically important to improving your character through experience and rare loot. Baldur's Gate 1 is no exception, as the best items are hidden off the beaten path and usually in the hands of deadly foes. The diligent explorer will comb the world for these items and attain rewards for their prowess with riches and powers beyond description. Steel yourselves, as these enemies won't hand over their treasures without a fight.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039636862

[h3]Yes, oh, omnipresent authority figure?[/h3]
There are over 25 companions to choose from within the world. Each of them is unique in that they have their own personalities and moral compass and may choose to accept or decline your invitations based on what they know of you, and may even decide to leave you if you deviate too far off their moral compass. There are clear synergies to factor in, as some group dynamics work better than others, and that should be considered before inviting someone new to your team. But it's all about experimentation, and as a worst case, if you decide they aren't a good fit you can ask them to leave, but be aware if you do ask them to leave, they may leave for good.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
Baldur's Gate isn't going to blow you away with cutting-edge visuals and a crisp resolution, but it does, however, look exemplary for its age. The environments have a clean visual style that doesn't overwhelm your senses but lets you appreciate the world around you. The improvements of the Enhanced Edition did a lot to bring this game into the current era. But with that said, the camera is static and isn't freely controllable, so you will have to accept that what you can see is all you have.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039637366

The above is also true of the audio, where many tracks have been lovingly restored or recreated to deliver a very nostalgic experience with a far more modern edge. Having the original soundtrack remastered is excellent because this has to be one of my all-time favourite soundtracks.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
This title is originally from 1998, and I will safely assume everyone with a modern system will run this game flawlessly. There are no graphical flaws or issues to report.

[h1]Final Thoughts - Excellent[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
Baldurs Gate is defined as one of the greatest CRPGs ever developed, and rightly so. It is everything you want it to be and more, allowing you almost true freedom to complete objectives how you desire to and providing substantial consequences for those decisions. With a likeable retinue of characters and a dense, well-written storyline, Baldur's Gate has well-earned its crown and I look forward to seeing the games that try to contend with it. This game is worth its already discounted price, and if you're a fan of the genre this is one you cannot miss.

In comparison to more modern cRPGs, Baldur's Gate is very freeform in how you can approach things. The story is there, largely well-written, and frequently referenced, but for most of the game you're free to go and explore anywhere you wish. You can kill just about anyone you meet, or help them out of course. And there are something like 20-30 potential party members, so that no matter what alignment you end up on you can always have a useful party along for the ride.

The 2nd edition D&D rules the game is based on are quite archaic, but do offer a huge amount of variety. There are a lot of classes and sub-types to play around with in addition to dual- or multi-classing. A fair few races with different bonuses. A bunch of stats (although charisma/intellect/wisdom largely don't do much). Loads of different weapon types. Absurd amounts of spells, scrolls, potions, etc. It genuinely feels like a D&D adventure in game format, especially at the start with all the exploration.

The quests, exploration, and story are the highlights. Though this game is story-light compared to something like Planescape Torment, what's there is still very interesting and sets things up for some real strong potential in Baldur's Gate 2. It's an all-around good game. And if you can suffer its shortcomings, well worth a playthrough.

There are those shortcomings though...

Baldur's Gate 1 most clearly shows its age with pathfinding. It's atrocious. Wanna see party members banging their heads against each other for 5 minutes straight, no matter how often you click for them to move apart? You can, in this game. It's infuriating when it happens, but also not an insurmountable problem. Party AI in general is also very rudimentary, but that can also be said for more modern games like Pillars of Eternity...

Similarly the user interface leaves a lot to be desired. Only being able to quick-slot 3 items and 3 spells? One of the most obnoxiously limited and clearly dated inventory systems in the RPG genre? Sure, Diablo 1's is MUCH worse, but that's literally as low as that bar can actually go. A UI that on a 21:9 by monitor can only be toggled between ""you-must-be-blind"" and ""please-wear-a-telescope"" sizes. This on top of everything important being communicated in a dialogue screen with oversized text. Wanna know what that enemy mage cast, or whether you're even hitting your enemy with basic attacks, or whether your spell even did anything? Scroll through the lines in that dialogue screen...

The game only runs at 30 fps, because gameplay logic is tied to that frame rate, which turns into an absolute stutterfest when panning the camera. The environment design is generally very simplistic. The end was clearly rushed as the environment design is largely atrocious, the encounter design even more all over the place than the rest of the game, and the quests barely there at all. The writing at the end was good and definitely made me interested in BG2 though...

As mentioned, the encounter design is all over the place, which is common in cRPGs. Surprisingly I thought BGEE was actually mostly... too easy. On Core Rules difficulty. Get some magical (+1) weapons and ammo the moment you can afford it and there goes your level 1-2 party demolishing most level 6 groups trivially. There are some hard encounters, even brutal ones that subvert the game mechanics, but they're few and far between. Mostly either at the very uneven end, or in the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion content. And even those were far easier to deal with than the nastier fights in Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2. This was a bit of a problem as the endless easy fights combined with slow walking speed pre-Haste-spell meant the middle of the game dragged. It didn't drag nearly as much as PoE though, and only for a while. Haste fixes things nicely!

There is some more archaic design holding the game back, like no respecs. An issue if you put proficiency points into the wrong weapons, or you're a sorceror and picked the wrong spell. Saving a lot helps. On that note, the quick save system with multiple rotating slots is actually much more convenient than in most modern cRPGs!

The writing, while overall quite good, is a bit shaky. It doesn't have the same tone throughout, even if you ignore Beamdog's anachronous additions. Some areas of the game are much more fleshed out than others. And the end of the game is very rushed in encounter and environment design, although the story is quite compelling at that point.

With the right perspective there is a lot of fun to be had here, even for a newcomer in 2023. I had a great time playing through BGEE and the ending made me look forward to booting up BG2. I suspect that game will truly live up to the classic status, with what's been set up here, while I think BGEE is more just a great game held back by a lot of minor annoyances and it being the first RPG of its kind for BioWare. Planescape Torment is a big step above for me, although that game is more story-heavy where this is gameplay-focused.

If you think you have what it takes to look past the annoyances to the gem underneath... pick this up and give it a go. You might just have a really great time with it.",1694813428,1694813428,True,11,1,0.665870308876037598,0,True,False,False

I can get past the outdated graphics and the crusty UI. I can handle the dubious pathfinding and the clunky combat. I can even tolerate the annoying inventory management and inscrutable magic menus.

What I can't get past is the AD&D ruleset. Hope you like rolling for stats until the random number god gives you enough points to not be useless. THAC0 is one thing, but insane one-off rules like having exactly 18 strength giving a 1d100 bonus to the stat that are never explained or hinted at mean that going in blind you are [i]guaranteed[/i] to build a character who is not merely suboptimal, but an active hindrance to your party.

I've heard this game's writing praised for decades, but I guess the nostalgia goggles are firmly set on people's heads because I'm 6 hours in on my current attempt and there's scarcely any story to speak of. Quests amount to ""I dropped my knife in the woods, please fetch it for me"" or ""kill wolves and bring me their pelts"". Character interactions aren't a thing after you recruit them. Fan-favorite Minsc runs around barking combat shouts about ""butt-kicking for goodness"". Maybe this seemed like Hamlet when you were five years old, but it doesn't cut it today. Dialogue choices amount to ""yes [good]"", ""yes [evil]"", and ""I should go"".  Maps are huge and [i]empty.[/i] You're stuck at such a low level that combat amounts to coin flipping whether you get instantly killed on the first turn or not.

I'm sure this was mind-blowing in 1998. Anyone considering playing it for the first time today should steer clear.",1693226581,1693226581,False,15,3,0.523552238941192627,2,True,False,False

The overhauls put in by Beamdog are, for the most part, marked improvements over the original version although some might miss the old aesthetic (there's always GoG for that...). Some people have complained about the new characters/content not completely meshing with the old but I saw nothing really that jarring IMO and I think they did a decent job integrating things. At this point most if not all lingering bugs have been patched, which is a nice bonus, and the UI/AI enhancements are really quite good.

This is not to say that there is no fun to be had with Baldur's Gate 1, but when I found that the boss in the Cloakwood mines was the hardest for me personally, and that the traps are usually what get you killed, it doesn't seem like the best work. However, this was their first go with this engine and the game is absolutely fantastic given that fact. I do wish that some of the fights were more organised on the side of the enemies since it just seems like everyone is just standing around, excluding the final fight where it does seem a bit organised. 

If you are new to this series or type of game, I would strongly recommend understanding AC and THAC0, and apply your weapon proficiency slots wisely. I also highly recommend the following classes when starting the game: Cavalier, Berserker, Priest of Tempus (if you don't plan on taking Branwen), Skald, and Swashbuckler (if you don't plan on taking Imoen or the other thieves), more or less in that order.

I never got very far, but I always loved just making a character and exploring around. The hum of my CRT monitor and the whir of my old Gateway PC doing its best not to implode. It was a great time.

Over 20 years later I decided to replay this game since the Balder's Gate 3 has come out. I have now finally beaten the game and it was a blast. I played on story mode because I just don't have the time to constantly reload every time the dice decide I need to die in battle. If you have the time there's some fun combat and little tricks you can do. If you just want to see the story you can still get a ton of fun out of this game just due to the amount of role playing it allows you to do. 

The graphics in the base game certainly have a late 90s charm to them. Their have been improvements to the UI, but he graphics are pretty much the same as I remember them. It can make it a little bit difficult to see everything you can interact with, and some parts do look pretty bad. Still after a few hours I kind of forgot about the graphics and just got sucked into the story. One thing with the UI is you do need to start a playthrough, go into the settings, and there will be an option to scale the UI. If you don't click on that the play area will be zoomed out to oblivion and the menu options will be shoved as far to the side of the screen they can go.

The endings of the game don't vary too much, but the way you get there can go a surprising number of ways considering the age of the game. If you want to just get lost in the lore and dialogue trees there is more than enough to keep you entertained on the Sword Coast. There are a bunch of side quests, a stupid number of interesting NPCs and companion characters to talk to, and if you feel like it there are oodles of documents and books to read. That's not even considering how many different dialogue options you can get depending on your rep, previous decisions, player class or race, and how funny you decide to be. 

I recommend this game for the most part. The combat rule set can be fun, but it is incredibly unforgiving and can quickly become frustrating. People that understand, or even like, 2nd edition AD&D rules will have a good time with the combat. If you don't like that rule set it can be a lot to dig through and kind of a pain in the behind. Luckily there's a bunch of difficulty settings to dial in the challenge to be as high or low as you want it. And if you just want to see the story of Balder's Gate that by itself is worth the price of admission. I definitely recommend this to people that want to sit down and just enjoy a deep old as heck game. I do not recommend this game if you don't have patience for wonky graphics, frustrating rule sets, or don't want to read a lot.",1693007128,1693007128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can get the game to work well enough with DXwnd but every time you talk to someone the screen will have to scroll to centre the characters in the top left of the screen.

If it wasn't for this, I wouldn't recommend the Enhanced Edition. Instead of just updating the game to run properly on newer systems and adding some quality of life tweaks (they did do this and a good job they have done in this area) they also saw fit to replace and add many things to the detriment of the overall package.

Most critically, like other older methods of updating the game, this release essentially ports Baldur's Gate 1 into the Baldur's Gate 2 engine. This changes some of the core mechanics, changes the spell effects to be a bit more flashy and in general you are not getting the original experience. The changes are not radical, but it's worth keeping that in mind.

Similarly, the new cinematics are not only less numerous than in the original, they also brush over important details found in the original FMVs. The ending cinematic in particular is almost incomprehensible and you'll want to look up the original on youtube once you complete the game as the replacement will leave you absolutely puzzled as to what has happened.

The majority of new content and characters are poorly written and even more poorly voice acted with no option to remove it if you want the vanilla experience. Most of it is easily ignored and I do wonder if it only sticks out to me because I'm so familiar with the original game.

The new UI is uglier and feels like it has had much less love put into it than the vanilla game, tool tips no longer have a nice scroll opening animation and instead you just get a fairly ugly flat scroll texture with text in it. The journal looks unfinished but I will concede that it is better organised in the enhanced edition.

Other graphical changes like sprite outlines, sprite smoothing and character selection circles are painfully ugly and turned on by default. Some people may like these but to have them on by default is going to give some people a very bad first impression, especially people who have played the original game.

**
I recommend turning off sprite outlines and filtering in the graphics options, and in the feedback menu turning on classic character selection circles. This will go a long way to making the game look like it once did.
**

A further odd choice is a filter that is placed over the background art, making it look blurrier than it should. Zooming out one click and zooming in actually removes this and it looks much nicer. Clicking the middle mouse button to reset zoom will reintroduce the filter. It's very odd. I found that zooming out three clicks on the scroll wheel resulted in the cleanest look and luckily the game will save your zoom level so it's not a huge deal. [An update allows you to toggle this filter so this paragraph has been rendered moot somewhat.]

For new players there are additional difficulty options to make the game easier which you can ramp up on the fly once you get the hang of things and veteran players will like the higher difficulty modes that are available.

So, in conclusion this is probably the best way to play Baldur's Gate on a modern computer but it will take a bit of digging around in the options menus to get everything to your liking and it is just not as faithful to the original game as I would like. The new content is not very good but can mostly be ignored and in the end, the core of Baldur's Gate is still here, one of the best CRPGs ever made. I wish Beamdog had been more respectful of the original developers intentions when adding content and making changes but the core game still shines through.",1508546909,1692620783,True,23,0,0.700191974639892578,0,True,False,False

This game is, on the one hand, a snapshot of CRPGs in the late 1990s, and on the other hand: a fantastic and engaging romp through a traditional D&D world.

However, this also adds to what makes the game so charming and also hardcore. For instance, if one of your party members dies they must be revived at a temple. This can mean lengthy backtracking through various areas and potentially losing more companions and expending resources.

Baldur's Gate 1, developed by BioWare and released in 1998, stands as an enduring testament to the profound impact that video games can have on immersive storytelling within the realm of role-playing games. This venerable title has carved a niche for itself within the pantheon of gaming history, earning commendation for its intricate narrative, strategic gameplay, and meticulous attention to detail.

Set in the iconic Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms universe, Baldur's Gate 1 unfolds within the Sword Coast region, offering players a chance to embark on a compelling journey filled with danger, discovery, and camaraderie. Its narrative is characterized by a rich tapestry of lore, replete with diverse characters, intricate subplots, and a meticulously designed world that beckons players to explore its every nook and cranny.

At the core of Baldur's Gate 1 lies its gameplay mechanics, which seamlessly meld tactical combat with interactive storytelling. Players are presented with a myriad of choices that influence both character development and narrative progression. The isometric perspective allows for strategic maneuvering during battles, while the implementation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ruleset ensures a deep and rewarding experience for those who relish in intricately crafted systems.

Graphically, Baldur's Gate 1 showcases its age, yet its visual charm is far from diminished. The hand-painted backgrounds and character sprites evoke a nostalgic allure, capturing the essence of a bygone era in gaming. This timeless aesthetic contributes to the game's unique appeal, serving as a testament to the craftsmanship of its creators.

However, no masterpiece is without its blemishes. Some players may find the initial learning curve of the game's mechanics daunting, and the user interface, although functional, could be considered less intuitive by modern standards. Furthermore, while the game's immersive world encourages exploration, certain areas may feel unnecessarily sprawling, potentially causing pacing issues for some players.

In conclusion, Baldur's Gate 1 stands as a compelling entry in the annals of gaming history. Its captivating narrative, strategic gameplay, and atmospheric world-building have solidified its status as a classic within the role-playing genre. While its age is discernible in its visual presentation and interface, these aspects do little to diminish the overall experience that the game offers. You may find Baldur's Gate 1 to be a thought-provoking study in interactive storytelling and game design, showcasing the potential for immersive engagement and narrative complexity.

I haven't really experienced DND much irl, and when I did, I've had really poor experiences, and while, yes, things have happened in this game, that would make me think that dnd is bad and would made me quit it forever if it actually happened in a campaign, the fact that I can simply load and retry and save scum did alleviate that. And, ultimately, the writing did pick up, and I did get invested (it took me like 15 hours to get hooked, though) and I have a great experience with the base game. I don't think I do recommend it at full price, but, if you like dnd, then you might wanna give it a try once it goes on sale c: (the rules are a bit antiquated, and sometimes extremely frustrating, but I think the adventure is worth it, there are some moments in this game that felt very memorable, and I'm quite attached to all the characters that I had in my party by the end of the game)",1691619278,1691619278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Recently, I have been thinking I might have missed out on a classic. Not really. Now that I have tried it I think I would have disliked it back then too. Just so many silly flaws that add up. I love RPGs and I love D&D. I have enjoyed the old Krynn trilogy very much and the Eye of the Beholder series. 

The combat is just so lame in BG I. I find that the ""real-time action"" thing just highlights the fact that nothing is actually happening most of the time while the actual action is being described in a tiny text window where events fly too fast for you to see and keep track of. It just doesn't work and definitely is not a step up from traditional turn by turn RPG combat. Moreover, walking around takes forever. The graphics and animation are obviously meh because it is so old, and I find that the game mechanics don't save it at all and the story seems to be nothing special. The last straw was my encounter with that wizard at the inn where I was supposed to meet two allies. Even when you kill him and combat is over, there is a good chance your panicked characters will be left running around stupidly for several minutes and there is nothing you can do except watch. That is just such a dumb game design choice and I honestly don't want to have to live other experiences like these. Unfortunately, I played it a little bit too much trying to like it and I can't get it refunded anymore. Oh well.

The Canaanites were a people inhabiting the land of Canaan

Canaanite religion included the worship of a supreme deity, El and his consort Asherah. The Canaanites also worshiped Baal (god of rain and thunder), Anat (goddess of war), and Astarte (goddess of love and fertility).

Canaanites and Israelites
Israel refers to both the people of Canaan and the later political entity formed by that people. For the authors of the Bible, Canaan is the land that the tribes of Israel conquered after they left Egypt, and the Canaanites are the people they displaced from that land.

In Genesis, the curse of Ham is described as a curse placed on Ham's son Canaan by the patriarch Noah. It occurs in the context of Noah's drunkenness and is provoked by the shameful act of Ham, Noah's son, who ""saw his father's nakedness.""

Can it be true that Sword Coast in the game and lore of forgotten realms is Jerusalem, Israel? the Southern Levant !

Seth, one of gods of Egypt is precursore god Baal. Egypt was conquered because immigrants Hebrew and Syrians financially drained that state. 

According to Egyptians Baa is person's character, and thus idea of immortal mind that is soul, Socrates thinking. Means that our characters or minds will go to heaven along with heart of Aristotelian precision that is alive(as in nourished floral, plant life domain), feeling(animals domain) and reasonable( only found in humans). In the moment of thinking we do 'tend  to view this moment when we are alive as immortal if you think about it. As long as human is alive is immortal.

Seven Virtues of the Soul are Purity, Peace, Love, Joy, Bliss, Powers and Knowledge.

Animals, like domestic one like dogs or cats has souls that has virtues too, they're virtues make them wanting to be raised. But if you see someone who raises animals well, it is proof that that person is good believer, as animals are raised best by these that believe.

The souls which have seen the most are to enter the seeds of men who will become philosophers, lovers of beauty, men of culture, men who are dedicated to love;* the second group those of law-abiding kings or military commanders or civic leaders; the third group those of politicians, estate-managers or businessmen; the fourth group those of men who love exercising in a gymnasium‚Ä† or future experts in bodily health; the fifth group will live as prophets or as initiators into one of the mystery cults;* the sixth group will most suitably live as poets or some other kind of representative artist, the seventh as artisans or farmers, the eighth as sophists or demagogues, and the ninth as tyrants.

Set had a positive role where he accompanies Ra on his barque to repel Apep, the serpent of Chaos. Some stories say that Apep has his origins as the severed umbilical cord of the god Ra

Apep, also known as Apophis, was the great serpent-god of chaos in ancient Egyptian mythology. Some stories say that he has his origins as the severed umbilical cord of the god Ra. Ra was the foremost of the Egyptian gods, having domain over the sun and therefore all life.

In ancient Egyptian mythology, Ra, the god of the sun, was believed to battle Apophis, the god of chaos and darkness, every night as he journeyed through the underworld. According to the myth, Apophis was a serpent who would try to swallow the sun each night, plunging the world into darkness and chaos.

Each night, Ra and his allies would battle Apophis, and each night, they would emerge victorious. However, the battle was never truly won, as Apophis would always return to threaten the world once again.

Baldur, too, for many years pretended to be his brother Thor.

And Odin called himself the Third, High, and just as tall.

Three figures sit on thrones; High on the lowest, just as high on the middle highest, and the third on the highest of the thrones.

The blind god H√∂d, deceived by the evil Loki, killed Balder by hurling mistletoe, the only thing that could hurt him.

It lacks a lot of the character progression systems we see in more recent TTRPG-based CRPGs like the Pathfinder games from Owlcat (or Baldur's Gate 3, even), but there's still a lot to enjoy here. With a few good community mods to expand companion interactivity and romance, this is a fun and engaging game to tide you over till BG3. Having just finished it with 44hrs played, I already know there was a lot more I could've seen if I'd looked. But the main story kept me glued to my screen, so much so that I didn't bother trying to complete every side quest as I normally would in a game like this.

Baldur's Gate 1 is very, very old now, and it will almost certainly not appeal to modern RPG player preferences in terms of gameplay... But the story hits as hard as ever in 2023, and will truly make you feel immersed in its world. The humor is also on-point: many of the dialogue options you can pick are downright sassy (but still perfectly medieval), and characters like Minsc add a lot of heart and levity to the game without ever ruining the mood.

This was a game that I was going to give up on, but I am glad that I saw the light and came back it after my moment of weakness with Final Fantasy 16 earlier last month.

An adventure so nice, I partook in it twice. Before I had even decided to play the game, I would always google ‚Äúis baldurs gate 1 worth playing‚Äù and the answers seemed to almost always be ‚Äúif you want‚Äù. 

With this video I wanted to, in a way, answer that question. Short answer is, yes, at least once. After beating it twice, it may be a while before I feel I‚Äôll have to beat it again. I have two characters ready to transfer to Baldur‚Äôs Gate 2. Leon S. Kennedy, the level 6 Ranger and Tony Soprano, the level 8 Cleric.

In 1 working with a low-level cap means that enemies never feel out of place. Bandits never have better gear than the guards of the big city, and regional bosses are powerful compared to what is around them, and you never so out level them that it becomes comical when they think they can best you. Companions are not overly written, their more an idea of a companion, the mad wizard, the sultry rouge, the na√Øve paladin, the brooding ranger. Some are interesting concepts like Minsk, a standard altruistic fantasy character type, but everyone thinks he‚Äôs only that way because he has a brain injury. This is a strength of the game, not having overly complex backstories and emotional reasons to be fighting the same evil the player allows you to switch between then as needed to suit your party. Their stats not people, and you never need to feel bad about taking the ranger because you need someone with a long bow, and risk missing out on some important side quest or story element. This is important because one of the games greatest strengths is the class building. There is a lot to choose from and its fun to just mess around with it in character creation. Most weapon and gear types seem to have at least a few good options in game, and it being low level even if you're stuck with a plus 1 weapon till the end game you won't feel under powered, Because the enemies are not high-level requiring lots of abilities and a minmaxed party to beat. The story is alright, you get the most out of the moment-to-moment gameplay. Which is good, the scripted enemy encounters are well made, the side characters are fun, the whole game has a lighthearted feel to it, and you encounter colorful characters that might be out of a story book again their ideas of a character not people. It's an adventure is the best way of saying it, not a world ending life or death struggle, and adventure that you can feel accomplished for completing. One criticism I do have is that the evil options are lacking. It's almost always better to do the good option both in xp and item rewards than to do an evil choice. The companion characters are also kind of limited, and basically need good, aligned ones to balance the party, a problem the good characters do not have. The good news is that being good or evil is irrelevant and you can for the most part freely mix and match character alignments, there also a lot of one hit kills in the game, not a fun mechanic and not much way around it.

Suffice to say that the sheer diversity of intuitive and creative play possible in a 25-year old game that was the sophomore project of an understaffed developer trying to figure out a novel way of translating tabletop play and old-school Leiber/Vance-style sword and sorcery aesthetics into video game motion in a completely new engine (originally built for a failed RTS), is well worth experiencing for anyone with any serious interest in the genre. It doesn't just ""hold up"" - something has most certainly been lost for RPGs in the move towards streamlining and spectacle in the quarter century since then, and I honestly believe BG1 is still one of the best demonstrations of the creative potential of real-time gameplay in RPGs. Chapter 6 of this game moved me more than pretty much anything in Mass Effect 2/3 or Dragon Age Inquisition.

But again, you'll find enough recommendations for BG1 here. The real surprise is Siege of Dragonspear - having been set up for disappointment, it has been a joy to discover a genuinely interesting interquel that balances - in fact, harnesses - its limitations for some very impressive use of this creaky-yet-shockingly-flexible engine for storytelling.

Old-school D&D has three axes, as I see it: roleplaying, free exploration, and flexibility. BG1 is the peak of the 'free exploration' axis; its sequel is the peak of flexibility; and Planescape: Torment is the peak of roleplaying. All three of these games form a shrine to the first thirty years of D&D, a near-perfect triptych in my view. But very few RPGs capture the experience of entering an empty map full of truly dangerous dangers, and truly rewarding rewards, like Baldur's Gate. The entire gaming space owes Beamdog a debt of gratitude for making this masterpiece playable by a new generation (even if I don't care much for their new content). 'Preservation' of classic games is as important to our medium as it is to film, and projects like the Enhanced Editions -- more ambitious than a simple rerelease, but with deep respect for the original -- are needed for other classic titles.

It is almost impossible to softlock yourself in this game, so don't worry too much about optimizing your party. The right strategy and the clever use of consumables and magic items are more important than your build. Just pick a class that sounds fun, roll with the game's punches (even NPC deaths; they are ALL expendable, trust me), and avoid save-scumming if you can -- the sense of reward when you finish the game will be huge.

I don't post reviews often, but it appears that the lowest common denominator has decided to be very loud with regard to this game. It's a fun game, and it deserves a fair shake.

GRAPHICAL UPDATES:

People complaining about cartoonish graphics have no place posting a review on the Steam market. The thick black border they're talking about, a simple graphical update that makes the game easier on the eyes at 4K and other modern resolutions, is entirely optional. In fact, the option is in Graphics settings and couldn't really be easier to locate. Other than that, the only updated assets are textures that were blatantly unable to survive the HD transition (the original Baldur's Gate used an actual picture of coffee grounds to appear like the ground/road, for example, an interesting choice that can only work on the old, blurry 800x600 CRTs of yore.) The replacement textures are high-quality, tasteful, and lore-friendly. 

USER INTERFACE/USER EXPERIENCE (UI/UX) UPDATES:

The UI recieved one update of any consequence at all: Journal entries now appear at the top of the screen to alert you to the fact that you've acquired a quest or learned something new about an important, ongoing chain. This is ultimately a useful feature, but on this particular issue I can see why some people might be annoyed. The UI element is a little noisy, and given that this is the sort of game where one could understandably have purchased a real-world journal to track activity, it does markedly change the experience from the original. I'm personally of the opinion that the improvement is a complementary one, mostly to make the game enjoyable for a generation of gamers born into quest markers. This should be an optional feature, probably, but it's presence doesn't render the title the sort of hyper-active, dopamine-fueled, flashing slot machine that other reviewers make it out to. This is still a far cry from Hearthstone.

REBALANCED DIFFICULTY:

There are more options, one of which brings the ruleset into alignment with Baldur's Gate 2, making for a smooth transition (much like the options offered by the WeiDU tweak packs for the original or the BiG World Project.) This is strictly something you can't complain about. The original difficulty settings were notoriously limited and once the system was mastered, woefully inadequate. As a long-time veteran of the series who obviously cares way too much about it, and as a game developer who's worked on RPGs in the past, this is the one change that should not interfere with your decision whether or not to buy this game. 

POLITICAL ISSUES:

Why this ever needs to be a section in a game review is beyond me, but the current state of affairs makes it necessary. Brace yourself for stupidity. A large reason for the negative attention this game has garnered recently is... The expansion contains a transgendered character. *GASP* Lock the kids indoors, shut the shutters, draw the curtains, as from the state of things, you'd guess Strahd himself descended upon the town to wreak havoc. In reality, it's an inoffensive NPC with an aside that points to a gender transition at some point in their past. Why is this offensive? Well, never mind the Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity, an item that has changed the PC's gender since the game's release. Never mind that Eliminster, iconic wizard extraordinaire of the Dungeons and Dragons universe, lover to Mystra the Goddess of Secrets, Survivor of the Time of Troubles, and WotC's best sales-driving cover man since Drizzt Do'Urden, spends a good chunk of time walking the earth as a female and makes several appearances. (Let's all be honest about what we'd do with Polymorph Self.) Anyway, in summary, the idea of magically changing genders is not new to the series and has somehow offended a humorless group of teetotalers. 

***NOTE***
This game is very old. It contains a number of bugs. Some of them have been in the game since Black Isle held the reins, some are a natural consequence of working with a game from the 90's, and some of them are indeed derived from Beamdog itself. However, it's worth noting that they seem to genuinely care about this game, and as someone who has worked in the soul-sucking industry for several years, that's a pretty rare feat among developers of largely-known IPs taken as an aggregate. They regularly patch this game, developed a new expansion, and provided free, substantial content updates of high quality. They easily could have released this game, made a quick buck on the brand recognition, and abandoned it. They easily could have gotten away with reserving the content updates only for those who bought the expansion. I highly recommend supporting Beamdog as it currently exists, if only to encourage more genuine passion in an industry that's in sore need of it.",1459866208,1689496211,True,10,0,0.527033567428588867,2,True,False,False

Prior to playing the enhanced edition i used to play the original version as a young teenager and i barely remember much of the game. In itself i dont really have much nostalgia for the game nor do i think that you should excuse any issues a game have, except its graphics, with the phrase oh well its old. Baldurs Gate is definetly a good game but i just want to point a few things out that might turn off some people already but i will also mention the many good things that might attract new people to this game.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
As a ""real time"" strategy game baldurs gate tends to be harder than it actually is just because of some design issues. You dont really have to understand what the numbers actually do except that you have to know which number is better. The lesser armor rate someone has, the better as base armor rating is 10 and a platemail will lower it to 1. While other numbers like weapon damage are better the higher they are. Some things dont even do anything in the game like infravision or some spells.

Also when you start a game you might be overwhelmed by the many different classes. But this is actually where the most fun lies. I often had my most fun creating a different class and testing out new team compositions. There are probably over 40 classes with 10 or so primary ones. There are lots of different weapon types to skill on and they do all have a porpuse despite some being clearly better than other ones. As an example bastard swords are the best one handed weapon type. But the problematic thing is that in baldurs gate you can only get better gear really by buying / finding enchanted magic items. There arent that many enchanted bastard swords in baldurs gate, but lots of longswords. Some enemies are immune/resist certain weapon types.

Therefore a variety is needed which is something the game doesnt warn you about. Another example is that the archer can choose a nemesis, an enemy type he is better against. The game gives you the option to choose dragons and so on. But there arent any dragons in baldurs gate at all! These things are just plain bad game design. Many of these issues could have been removed if the game wouldnt have sticked to the pen and paper ruleset that strictly.

Combat itself is incredibly fun. Well in early mid to lategame at least. Because in the early game you wont have any options really to do much as you are still collecting party member and slowly gain skills and stronger enemies will be fought. Each harder situation needs careful planning and execution. You are annoyed by small fry and dont want to click the whole time and control every class yourself? There are lots of premade scripts you can activate that does this for you. Class restrictions on armor and weapons add another layer of depth to the game.  

Some classes are clearly better than others. As an example you dont want to play as a wizard slayer on your first run as he cant wear almost any enchanted gear and his stats dont make up for his negatives. Some classes are starting to get good only in baldurs gate 2 because here your max level will be around 8. Its fun trying out new things and still being able to win with classes that are more complicated and worse than other ones. You could see it as an additional difficulty option. While starting first on the D&D difficulty rules may be intriguing it can be quite difficult on your first run, with lots of reloads but being quite doable with some preperation. Highlights where for me the various special encounters that can be really though and require you to prepare a lot for.

[u]Enhanced Edition[/u]
The launch of the enhanced edition was one of the worst launches i have witnessed. The game features lots of bugs and foreign languages that the original game had werent included in the game. Over the time many bugs are fixed yet still many persist. These arent game breaking but pretty annoying. Like a click above an item may even delete it at times. I still prefer this version during a sale over the original.

Now the enhanced edition did add some smaller ""nice to have"" things into the game. Just some smaller stuff that made the game overall more comfortable. I still wish there would have been an option to turn the game into vanilla mode via one click and just add the widescreen support mod.

The big new changes are the 3 new characters with their own quest lines and the black pits.While the characters itself are a great addition i personally never use them in my parties except maybe dorn. Rarely i take the new mage with me and never the monk because its low level dungeons and dragons. Monks are just complete lategame heroes and they are just a complete burden in the early levels.



[u]Multiplayer[/u]
Multiplayer can make a lot of fun in this game if you and your friend both are on the same mindset while playing the game as you either want to skip all the dialogue/read only the main stuff or really want to read every bit of detail. If one of you is on a different mindset it can really be annoying or a borefest for the other. But overall multiplayer is a good reason you might want to pick it up.

[u]Black Pits[/u]
Probably my favorite part about the enhanced edition is the new story campaign. Its a simple battle arena story where you get money train your fighters and try to escape the whole situation. You level faster and the annoying early game is basically not there anymore. I have some complaining to do. The whole campaign is way too short and some of the later fights are just plain idiotic to add in here. Some might rage quit at the trolls as some people dont know that D&D trolls are only killable trough fire. Another thing is one of the very last matches puts you up against clay golems. Which are immune to anything except enchanted blunt weapons. That would be fine but they give you around 5 of these to fight at the same time. Not really doable on harder difficulties if your whole party isnt prepared/ build around this fight. Multiplayer wise Black Pits wont work. After each chapter the game will get stuck in an arena. Sad beamdog.

[u]Story[/u]
In itself i always tought that people overhype this story. Its average fantasy stuff. I didnt really personally like the story but didnt hate it either. Its mostly that the main story is just badly told. Generally speaking what sets the game apart and makes it stand out are the various characters you meet (around 26 companions all with more or less fleshed out story/personality) and the fantastic writing. There are lots of situations where i burst out in laughter as the game itself is actually pretty serious but the hilarious jokes dont break any of the immersion i had. The whole worldbuilding is great too as ferun is pretty credible.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Baldurs gate static backgrounds still look pretty good. You shouldnt zoom too close to your player characters tough.

[u]Sound[/u]
Often my second favorite thing in games is a good soundtrack and a good atmosphere. There are lots of fantastic tracks from the famous title music to the calming yet mysterious night tracks. I love it.

The voice acting is, for the most part, great too and the enhanced edition adds some new fantastic voices aswell.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
I did have much complaining to do, partially about the enhanced edition, partially about some general game design issues too. But that doesnt mean i didnt like the game. Infact its one of my favorite games. But there are some clear issues with early game combat, non explained gameplay features and some things just being fluff and not having any ingame porpuse. But the whole gameworld is just so incredibly immersive combined with the fantastic OST and as the game goes on the midgame is so incredibly rewarding and boss fights are so perfectly challenging that for me it was a really good game inspite of its flaws.

This is a game that makes you feel for your childhood: that sense of wonder and endless possibility, having to face greater responsibility and rise to the occassion.  This is my fourth-favorite cRPG behind both Pathfinder games and Planescape: Torment.

A note for the vast amount of people who have bought this game and have it sitting in their library for years like me, or people wanting to experience this classic and its sequel before diving into the third game (or just want to play classic cRPGs).  

The main story is very short and very intriguing.  You could blaze through it in 10 to 12 hours.  There is a LOT of side content, most of it are one-off little segments into the lives simple characters in this world with no narrative consequence.  There are a lot of sub-maps each with one to a few of these little diversions.  The UI is servicable for a modern audience.  Don't let it overwhelm you.  Most of it isn't very relevant aside from the journal and inventory screen for general gameplay and the character screen to level-up.  

My recommendation is if you're hesitant to start a massive 75hr experience due to real-world time constraints, then you should set the difficulty mode to story and focus on the main story (which does well to guide you throughout) while dipping into some of the side content every now and then.  Story mode lets you bypass all the challenges of this 90s cRPG and enjoy the world and writing.  You may also consider playing a fighter or monk (or any heavily-melee focused character) as to be able to enjoy a more simple combat experience.  With story mode, creating the most powerful character is irrelevant.  You can play whatever class you want, however poorly you want because your victory is guaranteed.  If you're feeling confident on the gameplay front, you can at any point switch story mode off for as long as you want.  

You'll find a very tight first half of the game until you get to Baldur's Gate where you narratively given a chance to investigate things at your own pace.  You'll also find a whole host of companions in their proto-typical form to modern companions.  They are more-so ideas of characters with very little to say or do besides act as mechanical and combat support to the player.  The Enhanced Edition adds a few companions who have some of the only rudimentary character arcs in this first game.  It is not important you who want to roll with, just pick them up, see how you like the ""idea"" of their character in your group.  You can for the most part kick anybody out of the group with little consequence.  The only time there is minor consequence is in the first quarter of the game where you will meet two groups of two who each want to join your band for the first major quest.  They make it very clear what their goals are, so it will be hard to miss.  I did not bring one of the pairs along, and overall it did not matter.  

Give this game a chance.  It's a classic for a reason.  Meet the game half-way on the overall naivety of its world.  This is the kind of game you look back on and remember the heart-warming feelings it gives you more than anything.",1689010834,1689010834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The music is great, the characters are great, combat is mostly great if you play it turn by turn, and the choices you make really feels like you are making meaningful choices in this world.

[h2]Baldur‚Äôs Gate I Enhanced Edition Review[/h2]

[h1]Good things:[/h1]

Baldur‚Äôs Gate is an cRPG that is based on Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition and for many people like myself was the first cRPG game they ever played and was the game that made many people love cRPGs. It is also the first game in The Bhaalspawn Saga and it is great because it starts with mystery and it makes the players experience the D&D system from an early levels making them feel weak at start and really feeling more powerful with each level as they grow in experience and power and with time game unlocks new areas for the player with more powerful enemies so the player can test his new spells and weapons.

If you liked Baldur‚Äôs Gate as a kid you will love Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition even more thanks to quality of life improvements. You no longer have look for certain X and Y on the map or to click every chest and barrel and stone and everything just to be sure you didn‚Äôt miss any treasure ‚Äì now you can have all the lootable containers highlighted, and you can pick items from defeating enemies without having to check each body separately as all items laying on the ground in a certain radius near your team are shown on a special interface that lets you loot them directly.

Enhanced edition also added half-orc race and classes from Baldur's Gate II like barbarian, sorcerer, wild mage and all the Kits for all classes so now you can play as berserker or kensai or archer etc. in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and import your hero to Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition to continue your story. They even added some new kits like blackguard ‚Äì an evil paladin or dragon disciple ‚Äì a sorcerer with dragon blood or Tyr and Tempus to Cleric kits selection and Shadowdancer for Thief or 2 kits to choose from for monks. They even added a completely new class available only in Enhanced Edition called Shaman that is a spellcaster that uses druid spells but learns them and casts them like a sorcerer and has a unique ability to dance during combat and summon spirits to attack his enemies for him.

And for you that did not ever played the original Baldur‚Äôs Gate the most important info is that it has great story. The main villain is someone you hate from the start but the more you learn about him the more you understand why he is the way he is and what made him be like that and that there was a big chance that you would be in his place and he could be in yours. The more books and letters you read in game the more deep the villain gets and that is what makes this villain great. He is not just some Mr. Bad Guy just for the sake of being bad ‚Äì there are reasons behind his actions and he become who he is because of his upbringing. The more you learn about the game world and the villain the better the game gets. At the end of the game I almost felt sorry that I have to kill him. Also even side quests have different ways of solving them and things you can miss if you don‚Äôt pay attention to details so you can end up helping someone evil without even knowing it.

If you love cRPGs in general you will also like this one. It is older than many other cRPGs you played so far but it is great and this game is one of the reasons why cRPGs become popular. But this edition is full of improvements over the original game so if you really never played Baldur‚Äôs Gate then this is the version you should buy and play to experience what others have experienced because you are really really really missing out if you haven‚Äôt played and finished Baldur‚Äôs Gate in your life.

[h1]Bad things:[/h1]

If you have any antivirus and I mean any at all even a basic one in Windows like Microsoft Defender you will need to google how to set everything in a way that it will let you make saves to the cloud and will read the saves from cloud otherwise it can jump between cloud saves and saves on your PC making playing the game difficult and it can even reset any changes in the setting you made.

There still exist a bug where party members can get stuck on each other and you have to pause the game and click the STOP button and move one of them away. In some locations it happens much more often than in others and it makes them more frustrating to play.

Baldur‚Äôs Gate I was never made with the intention of you playing as the bad guy so even when some quests can be finished in an evil way they most of the times give worse rewards and also drop your reputation increasing prices in all shops and if your reputation drops too low you will be even attacked by paladins and town guards all the time. Most of the time roleplaying as evil guys is just about doing quests in the evil way and then paying the clerics in temples money to fix your bad reputation so you won‚Äôt be attacked by paladins and guards. You can‚Äôt really be truly evil in this game and playing as evil is almost like playing as someone neutral. Enhanced Edition didn‚Äôt do anything to change that so you still will have to balance your reputation all the time to not make prices in shops be too high but also to not be too good and not make evil characters leave your party. In the end just playing as the good guy fits the game and whole story much more than being evil and is more satisfying.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
You must gather your party before venturing forth.
Baldurs Gate is a classic and a masterpiece, and the same can be said about its sequel. Bringing in thousand and hours of immemorable gameplay and the RPG experience.

And with this recent replay, where I tried to exhaust most everything it has to offer at a digestible pace, as opposed to my actual first playthrough, where I felt overwhelmed and rushed through a few of the chapters; This one impresses quite a lot. 

It's also impressive how well these games have aged, even though they did receive a visual touch-up from the Enhanced Editions (really sad how IWD2 will never get the same benefit). But the 2D art especially is pretty much proven to be ageless. The one area that hasn't aged all that well is the huge amount of party micromanagement with regards to items, containers, and everything in-between that. It's honestly another game within the game. Just moving items around, to min-max all the space you have available, with different party members able to carry only so much, moving unidentified items around, potions, arrows. It can sometimes be very annoying. 

The other area that hasn't aged well is the path-finding of the party members, but this was an issue in all Infinity engine games, and is well known, so no point in beating a dead horse. The enhanced editions, or if I'm just not remembering it right maybe even the originals, seem to have another issue with path-ing where sometimes 2 or 3 party members stack up onto each other and then it's a real pain to get them unstuck. But this is all sort of nitpicking in a very impressive and great rpg.

Other impressive things about the game is how open it is, and even reactive in its narrative in sufficient places. Even though the main story beats are the same, it is still impressive how they put the work in, even originally, to coerce the storyline back to those intended beats. I never got too far in Baldur's Gate 2, an error I intend to correct after being done with Siege of Dragonspear; hopefully in time for BG3; but I hear BG2 is a lot more focused in its narrative and what it allows you to explore.

The gameplay still remains the same old real-time with pause. Probably my most favorite of systems. This has also aged very nicely; if you like the system that is.

Otherwise, not much else to say about this one. It's very impressive for what they managed to achieve back 25 years ago. And thank the heavens for the enhanced editions.
It's also impressive how it's a stronger rpg than most rpgs nowadays, with very few exceptions. 
Also luckily the genre has had a resurgence recently, with the Pillars of Eternity and Pathfinder rpgs. And we hope it manages to keep on going.

The game is set in the Forgotten Realms universe and features an epic story, memorable characters, and a deep and complex RPG system.

The enhanced edition includes updated graphics, improved UI, and new content, including new characters, quests, and areas. The updated graphics are a significant improvement over the original game, making the world of Baldur's Gate more immersive and detailed. The new UI is also more intuitive, making it easier to manage inventory and navigate the game's many menus.

One of the strengths of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is its deep and complex RPG system. The game features a robust character creation system, allowing players to choose from a wide range of races, classes, and abilities. The game also features a complex alignment system, which tracks a player's moral choices throughout the game, affecting how NPCs interact with the player and ultimately affecting the game's ending.

The game's story is also a major strength, featuring a vast and immersive world with an intricate web of storylines and characters. The game's main quest involves a search for the player character's true identity and the uncovering of a larger conspiracy, but there are also many side quests and subplots to explore. The game's characters are also well-written and memorable, with unique personalities and backstories that make them feel like real people.

Despite its many strengths, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is not without its flaws. The game's combat system, while deep and complex, can be slow and tedious at times, especially in the early game. The game's interface can also be overwhelming for new players, with many menus and options to manage.

Overall, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is an excellent update to a classic RPG, featuring updated graphics, improved UI, and new content while retaining the deep and complex RPG system and engaging story of the original game. While it may not be perfect, it is a must-play for fans of the RPG genre and an excellent introduction for new players.",1687793536,1687793536,True,9,2,0.604409456253051758,0,True,False,False

Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a regular on any greatest games of all time list with critics noting the improvements to story characterization setting party dynamics and gameplay.  I don't disagree.

This praise can sometimes lead people to imagine the first Baldur's Gate is skippable and that is what I want to correct.  Not only would a run of two be incomplete without a play through, the first is worthy of serious attention.  Many complain of the inferior gameplay but the enhanced edition brings it up to being fully on par with SOA which just makes sense.  SOA was refined from the missteps of 1 any remaster should apply those same lessons where it doesn't disrupt the story and core mechanics and so they did.  

The characters are less dynamic then in two which in my opinion is what sets that game apart and where much of two's praise and influence comes from.  The world is larger and more rural and empty.  The real color beyond the maps themselves is in the writing which tends to vacillate between jokey 90's references and overwrought melodrama.  When it's in it's stride it tends to be confined to certain very memorable quests which rival and in one notable case exceed anything in Shadows of Amn.  I am of course referring to Durlag's tower.  Durlag's tower is indisputably the finest dungeon of this medium relative to the time it was released.  The tower is itself a meditation on the constitutive psychology of a contested life, a life of greatness, of cruelty, a life indeed of violence.  Of course Baldur's Gate itself is themed on this question of violence as human nature and the dream sequences communicate this thoughtfully but they never manage the perspective of Durlag.  In a way this seems unavoidable.  The main character despite whatever can be evoked through setting and reaction is and feels like a largely blank slate.  Durlag is a person, a hero and legend, who lived has a definite end and details and whose thirst for attention in life now has you exploring everything including his deepest failures secrets and humiliations in death.   With tasteful nods from literature to the holocaust and complimented with probably the greatest in-total challenge of the first game players would be seriously remiss to skip this entry.  To trespass the deepest regions of the tower as you do layers of Durlag's psyche you will ultimately recover the Macguffin dagger: Soultaker.  Inside that dagger through some strange alchemy is the soul not of Durlag but of you.  Seeing it's contents is a kind of loot that you will carry in real life forever.

This story takes place in a fantasy realm, where there is a strong emphasis on imaginary creatures living in a world inspired by folklore and magical constructs, and explores the absolute polarization between good and evil.
The narrative frivolously makes use of comedy and drama, but has a relatively serious undertow. The story lore follows the same principles that are exhibited in classical and similarly themed works of fantasy literature and classical role playing games. All of this takes place in a magical and seemingly medieval setting, fully realised by making use of renowned fantasy lore and role playing mechanisms.
The story features a protagonist who's heritage is initially obscured, and takes place in a land that surrounds the city of Baldur's Gate. This land is a grand stage, that may freely be explored, and also directs the protagonist and a chosen group of followers towards their destiny, and the plot unravels during play.
Each storyline is unique, because the story is played out by decisions that are made during play. The story ultimately leads to a climax that is preset, but the storyline that is followed and with whom, may freely be decided. Other characters also inhabit the world, and everything exists in an imaginary fantasy culture, which may be derived from classical works of fantasy literature, but is fresh nonetheless, and supported by original and creative ideas, which are enjoyable to read and immerse oneself in.

The protagonist's appearance must first be chosen and may be customized; by choosing a gender, a race, and by assigning personal proficiencies.
A party of friendly companion characters may accompany the protagonist, and may be recruited during the adventure. Their skills and abilities are developed during play as well, and every character has their own inventory. Companion characters may also use artificial intelligence to further customize and direct their potential. These characters are capable navigators, who may switch between equipment at any given time. They may also engage in conversation, trade with other characters, and the group of adventurers may have a certain reputation in the world based on their actions or who they recruit. A total of six companion characters may travel together at the same time, but there are many more that the protagonist may come across.
The viewpoint on the world is displayed from a bird's eye perspective, showing a landscape from a certain altitude. The distance from which this landscape is seen, may be drawn nearer and further away by zooming in and out. This viewpoint displays a landmass on which the protagonist or the companion characters may freely travel, if directed to do so.
Controlling the action is made possible through an on-screen and enabling interface, which is used to direct companion characters by pointing and sending them to a location in the world. A world which they occasionally may interact with. The action may, (and should,) be paused at any time, in order to issue commands to each individual character. This enables to swiftly micromanage affairs. How companion characters are positioned and under what circumstances, is of tactical importance. This encourages deliberation and weighing off one's chances.
Companion characters are meant to adventure across the land together. These characters all have three hundred sixty degrees sight around them, and reveal the limited radius in which their vision may be observed. Unexplored areas on the map are blackened out before they are explored. Once explored, these areas remain visible, and may be freely revisited. What exactly takes place at a given location may only be directly observed by positioning a companion character near a location, otherwise whatever takes place at those areas is unseen and obscured. These maps are predetermined environments where non-predetermined events may take place. Adversaries and side-characters may occasionally appear, and there is a sense of unpredictability to these encounters. The outcome of these engagements has a degree of randomness to them as well, and may be tactically and strategically managed through the use of various items, that may be gathered or stored in containers. Additionally, there are day and night cycles and weather conditions, such as rain and thunder taking place in outdoor environments, which may affect what is taking place there at different time zones of a day.

The environments are artistically crafted, and contain a wide variety of realistically drawn (two-dimensional) art assets and details. Texts are well written, and characters are voiced with enthusiasm.
Companion characters play a large role towards enjoying the play, they have abilities that may complement each other. Competently using their abilities plays an important role, and their miraculous effects each have their own distinctive designs, synergies, graphics, and sounds.
There is a wide variety of locales. These places have a specific purpose in the world in relation to the storyline. They encourage exploration and are accessible from a larger map. This map enables the party to immediately travel to those locales.
Companion characters may also have banter, which may play a relevant role during the story, or they may spontaneously comment on certain situations. These companion characters are all prominent archetypes, who may have conflicting agendas, and with enough encouragement, may show romantic advances, or may prefer to leave the group. Their needs should not be ignored.
A relatively large amount of classical and orchestral sounding music and other sound effects breathe further life into the world. Some musical notes are reoccurring, and therefore the music is thematic. Many environments have their own musical scores, and may play more dramatic melodies when there is action taking place. Environmental sound effects, such as birds singing or water splashing, may sometimes be heard when observing certain areas on a map, which makes most maps immersive to navigate through and travel across.
Lastly, the story is expanded after a decade of real-time passing, which is a unique happening. This downloadable content closely follows the original work, and progresses the story, which may be saved in-between titles, and may also carry over to the next instalment.


This moldy image shows an example of a map that is beautiful, and encourages exploration because of such artful extravagance:

There is a pretty steep learning curve at the start, because the game is based on an older version of the DnD ruleset. It is however very rewarding to start steamrolling encounters when you get a good grasp on the rules and mechanics.
I really appreciated the story, it's very lowkey, which is something I love with lower to mid level adventures.

My main gripes lie in the combat encounters and the class balance, which all boils down to the edition used for the ruleset.
I have to highlight here that I only played on Core Rule difficulty without any mod.
Combat encounters aren't particularly exciting. Open with CC and slaughter the poor sobs, rinse and repeat. Higher difficulties probably change that giving ennemies better saves against CC, but I felt the damage bonuses were unfair.
The class balance is a whole other can of worms. Casters have the best gameplay, period. They start out relatively weak and later become gods of war, which is why most ""optimal"" builds dual or multiclass into mage. There is no meaningful decision to take on physical damage dealers during leveling other than proficiencies. But as I said, this is an issue with the ruleset used, it's not the fault of the game.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing the game despite my gripes about some of its systems.
I highly recommend it to any fan of cRPGs. It is truly a classic and it's nice to see where the genre comes from and how far it has gotten nowadays.",1687016216,1687016216,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the game itself: its incredibly good, as long as you are patient enough to actually sit down and understand how the systems work. This is a much larger task than it initially may seem - 2E/AD&D is exceedingly non-intuitive to people who only have knowledge of the modern systems - so actually learning the game may take some time. Once you get past the initial hurdle of answering the question ""Why do I get hit so much"" [hint: THAC0], it becomes easier with time. Obviously, with the game being as old as it is, there are many *questionable* design choices that will absolutely frustrate you when you first start out, but over time you get used to it. Aside from gameplay, the story is obviously amazing and will keep you engaged throughout. I recommend that you go in blind the first time through and piece it together, then read a synopsis later if you truly can't figure it out - that's how it was meant to be played, and not doing so takes away from the expeirence.

For the enhanced edition: Similar to the game, its well done. The game is very stable, and I can't recall any crashes or bugs that I ran into during my runs through. I will say that the UI changes from the original are a bit irritating - I'm not sure why they would add what seems to be a mobile device-like menu into a PC game - but you can largely look them, especially if you never played the original.

I'm a big nerd. If it's even slightly nerdy, count me in. Star Trek, pointless flame-wars over things that don't exist, Linux, talking to my cat because I find interaction with members of my own species profoundly disappointing, and Dungeons & Dragons. I don't have a beard that makes me look like I've grafted a shrubbery to my face, but there's still time. Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk are big nerds too, and before BioWare was assimilated by the malignant, cash-harvesting, game-ruining behemoth we know and despise as EA, they almost single-handedly revitalised the then ailing CRPG genre with 1998's Baldur's Gate.

It came in a giant box, on multiple CDs, and it included a game manual so hefty you could beat someone to death with it. It was an actual thing you held in your hands, caressing it gently like a newborn, inhaling that ""new game smell"", and poring over the manual like it was the Gospel of Christ. Who needed a girlfriend when you had a freshly-minted copy of Baldur's Gate in your sweaty, Cheeto-stained paws? Certainly not me.

But time marches on, you get fat and old (and married), and triple-A gaming becomes a depressing creative wasteland controlled by vultures in suits whose only real interest is in the abomination that is ""live service"", and getting kids to bankrupt their parents through pre-orders, endless torrents of DLC that should have been included in the base game, and loot boxes. Because, you know, who doesn't love being shafted over and over again by Kotick The Hutt, and Android Wilson? Am I bitter? Yes. Yes, I am.

Anyway, Baldur's Gate... it was great back in the day, and it's great now. Mostly. If you've played Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin, or Owlcat's Pathfinder titles, you'll be used to a whole lot of quality of life additions Baldur's Gate doesn't have. Despite Beamdog's best efforts, you can't turn a run-down hovel into a stately home, and it shows. This may or may not be a problem for you, depending on how tolerant you are of unintuitive interfaces, clunky inventory management, and 2nd Edition AD&D... which is just bizarre. Want your mage to use a crossbow? Computer says, ""No!"" If your AC is -10, you're bullet-proof. If it's 10, you're going to get slapped around like a red-headed stepchild. Also, THAC0 (To Hit Armour Class 0), which I still don't properly understand, but it's a thing, and it matters. Read the manual. I mean it.

Beamdog have thoughtfully provided an array of configuration options in the main menu, including a selection of difficulty levels which you should absolutely make use of if you're not a masochist. The game can be brutally unforgiving if you're not prepared to micromanage weapons, spells, and tactical positioning. If you'd rather cruise around the Sword Coast at a leisurely pace, concentrating more on exploration and narrative, Story Mode is probably for you. It gives your party massive buffs, and seriously hobbles enemies. Also, you can't permanently die in combat. On anything above Core Rules, the game will basically break into your home, eat your pets, emotionally cripple your children, and then set fire to everything. This is a classic, no-holds-barred CRPG experience, and it absolutely does not care about your feelings.

I can't say too much about the story without spoiling things, so I won't. It's generic sword and sorcery shenanigans set in Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms, so expect to run into a few notable characters, including a crotchety wizard whose name begins with 'E', and a Drow who is very handy with a pair of magical scimitars. Accompanying you on your grand adventure are a varied selection of joinable NPCs, some of whom the game obviously wants you to take with you, but party composition is not forced, and there are no penalties for choosing one NPC over another.

Beamdog have added three new, fully-voiced, NPCs to the mix, so you're provided additional options not available when the game was originally released. They all provide running commentary on what you're doing at any given time, but you can tweak this in the options menu if you'd prefer them to shut the hell up and just haul your crap around for you. (Seriously, having Xzar or Montaran, I forget which, continually bellowing ""I am become Death, destroyer of worlds!"", every time you fill a gibberling full of arrows gets extraordinarily annoying after an hour or so.)

The game takes an open-world approach to exploration and you navigate via a series of expansive zones accessible from a larger world map. Freedom is only really curtailed by either the story (several zones are inactive until certain narrative events take place), or your party's ability to handle whatever hostile entities inhabit a given area. In a very general sense, the further North you travel, the tougher things get, until you reach the bustling metropolis of Baldur's Gate, where the narrative threads converge and things get really interesting. (One map is fairly crawling with basilisks, so... have fun being petrified all day long at level five.)

There is no level-scaling here. Bite off more than you can chew, particularly during the early game, and you will die a horrible, grisly death. On the very first map after leaving Candlekeep, there's a black bear. It's not hostile until you antagonise it, but if you want that sweet, sweet XP, you're going to antagonise it. If that bear gets a lucky dice roll, it will one-shot you. Running around shooting arrows at it is a better plan, provided you don't run into the wolves and gibberlings on the same map. If you're smart, you'll set the game to auto-pause whenever you encounter an enemy, (or trap, because those will effortlessly kill you too.)

The music and sound design are both fantastic, with some great voice-acting from major NPCs. The graphics are... the opposite of fantastic. 1998, remember? Now, this is the 'Enhanced Edition', so you've got coloured character circles, better paper dolls on the inventory screen, smoothed sprite outlines, a reworked UI aesthetic, and the ability to zoom in or out at will. BUT... zooming in on a game that was originally played at a resolution of 640x480 has predictable results, with the once-gorgeous painted 2D backdrops reduced to a blurry, pixelated smear. Zoom out on your fancy widescreen HD monitor and your characters are basically six badly-dressed mosquitoes buzzing across a vast green field, so you're going to have to fiddle about a bit to find the sweet spot. Fortunately, Beamdog have given us a scaleable UI, so you won't spend hours squinting at the character screen like Mr. Magoo, desperately trying to decipher text three pixels high.

The weakest aspect of the Infinity Engine games was always the path-finding, and it's still terrible. Expect your party of six clueless adventurers to take wildly disparate routes to any destination unless you micromanage them like a flock of wayward sheep. Inside the cramped confines of a trap-laden dungeon, this can be infuriating. Navigating Durlag's Tower while Minsc wanders obliviously into a fireball trap, or Jaheira strides purposefully into a room full of ghasts will have you using a selection of words likely to make a sailor blush. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it is something you're going to have to learn to live with.

Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition gives you a lot of game for your money. The original title plus the official expansion, Tales of the Sword Coast, and Beamdog's own campaign, Siege of Dragonspear. There are hours and hours of classic RPG goodness here, and despite it being very much a product of its time, Baldur's Gate tells a rollicking tale and remains hugely entertaining provided you can get past the less than stellar presentation.

The AI is programmed to just fucking murder you and your party at all times so you have to mash that quicksave button like a sous chef on cocaine because one missed saving roll on your PC is probably going to kick you back to your last save. So (thank God!) there's Story mode, meaning you get to auto-resolve some of the more unbalanced combat encounters, rather than being forced to do what I did as a teenager and have one or two tanks kiting aggro and running around in circles while everyone else shoots/throws projectiles at the enemy until they die.

That said! I really believe that BG is unfortunately, and maybe even unfairly, overshadowed by BG:SOA, yes SOA ups the voice acting, character interactions, score and story. And the D&D mechanics inherently make the combat, well, just much less boring because you have so many more buttons to push and your fighters miss far less often. BUT! BG has ""impeccable vibes"".

There's a real open world game energy here before open worlds were at all a thing, and the amount of exploration and weirdness hiding on each blank field map square is so much fun. Let alone that feeling of finally reaching Baldur's Gate itself after bumpkin'ing your way around the country and tiny villages. Man, it's worthwhile.

Maybe my expectations were set too high based on all the praise I tend to hear about it, but even that aside, I would not have enjoyed the game.

As a role-playing experience, it failed me. I rarely if ever had the chance to breathe life into my character through interacting with NPCs and quests, because NPCs just spat their life story at me, wrote some objectives into my quest book, and sent me on my way. I remember only one time I was given any kind of choice, and it was one of the last quests I tried. Even RP aside, the writing was really boring to me. I have heard of a later portion of the main quest which I found interesting, but nothing to encourage me to keep playing.

What about the gameplay though? Well, this game helped me realize I cannot stand isometric, real-time RPGs. Or strategy game, I almost want to talk it. I wouldn't call it's mechanics bad, but they're definitely not for me. Maybe I'd enjoy it more were it turn-based or were I already a fan of AD&D.

I don't like the new characters added by the enhanced edition (dialogues and voices are too corny for me), but since I don't have to include them in my party makeup it's not a big deal. For grognard D&D fans of 1st or 2nd edition, this game is a must play; those liking 3rd+ edition may find the character skill system less free-form, but that can also be a positive since each character is unique and requires the support of the other party members. BG (and BG2) are my favorite computer games of all time, and the enhanced version adds some nice modern touches.

UPDATE: Encountered a strange bug. I have 0 mods, so this seems an enhanced edition bug. Went into the Jovial Juggler inn and Khalid and Monteron got stuck in the same spot during the area load, and would not move from that spot. Had to reload and was annoyed I lost a few minutes of game play....

UPDATE 2: I encountered Baeloth out in the wilds, a very powerful DROW magic-user. I was level 3. No matter my choice in dialogue I was forced to attack him which is stupid. He's a high level magic-user. Who in their right mind thought it would be okay to do that to a party? It's just stupid. Once again Extended Edition showing its inferiority to the original.

If you don't like the new NPCs you can just ignore their writing and quests but they let you use a more varied party that compliments the original cast.

Sadly the port could never solve the issue with the game being dreadful and too long for its own good. The first Baldur's Gate is abundant with empty maps and the blandest of stories, it's kinda insulting that this game is regarded as a classic while its early and late 90s peers in the CRPG scene (Western and Eastern) were more interesting. Only play this if you're intending to play BG2, but even then you should probably *just* start with BG2 with a wiki/youtube rundown of the BG1 plot that can be summed up in 5-10 minutes.

Some people say the game is outdated, but I think that is subjective. I personally feel that it holds up very well for it's age, likely because of it's simple(and quite pretty) graphical appearance. 
Although it does literally use the outdated Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset, it is still very fun to play once you get accustomed to it.
The story is a masterpiece with dozens of memorable characters and locations. Rather than spoil anything, I will simply say that you should get the game and see for yourself. Even though it follows a 'linear story', there is still plenty of exploring available.
It should run on pretty much any modern PC, as it is certainly not a demanding game.
I personally prefer waiting for sales before I purchase anything because I'm cheap like that, but I can definitely see it being worth it's normal price.

I had only played the original BG1 once when it first came out but spent a lot of time playing BG2+ToB. I had played the Steam version of BG2EE but found it unplayable in just the first couple of minutes so refunded it but decided to give BGEE a shot anyway. 

If you're a D&D fan the game is as enjoyable as it was back when it first came out. I was slightly put off at first by how the game played and looked but after a couple of minutes of tweaking it runs perfectly good. 

I couple of tips if you're going to try it out:

1) Go to C:\Users\username\Documents\Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\ open up the baldur.lua file and edit the line:
SetPrivateProfileString('Program Options','Maximum Frame Rate','45')
to 45 from the default 30. You can experiment with the frame rate but I found 45 to be just perfect in my experience. 

2) From the in-game options menu or by changing line ""SetPrivateProfileString('Graphics','Scale UI','1')"" turn on UI scaling. Game looks much better and character portraits aren't too small to see. 

3) I found assigning the WASD keys to camera scrolling and turning up Keyboard Scroll Speed to max really improved the playing experience allowing you to move around and click-to-move much more efficiently than mouse scrolling. 

After the above tweaks the game runs perfectly and I found it really enjoyable despite the fact that the original came out back in 1998. I can't wait to replay the full series before BG3 comes out.",1681539247,1681539247,True,6,0,0.597176790237426758,0,True,False,False

Baldur's Gate often reads like there are plot elements, lines, and entire character personalities pulled right from a developer's D&D session. Reference heavy, characters with little dialogue other than enough to give a personality like crazy evil guy, butt kicking force for goodness, revenge focused guy with dead wife, lawful stupid paladin, etc. A single writing style or characterization for the protagonist is pretty much nonexistent as what kind of things you say are just all over the place. Usually giving a positive or negative (or good/evil) style response or with questions or a more neutral sounding affirmative but it's a mixture of serious, funny, ridiculous, pop culture references with near everything you say. A very large amount of NPC encounters or lines are references to Monty Python, X-Men, Judge Dredd, The Simpsons, the 80s Newhart show where the characters act as a reference to characters from the show and tell you you're from the wrong generation if you say you don't know who they are instead of asking for an autograph, plays, a dwarf says slightly altered lines from the song Sixteen Tons, the miners you find will cough and say they think they are coughing up blood but if this game released after Zoolander I have no doubt that would have been changed to a weaker sounding cough with the line changed to ""I think I got the black lung Pop."" It can certainly be entertaining at times but not as memorable narrative wise or as character driven as many stronger games in the genre.

There are some nice things about the old 2nd edition D&D ruleset and some of the mechanics in Baldur's Gate 1. The morale system where your enemies and allies (different NPC break at different levels) can break and have a panic effect applied is a nice way to add some realism to encounters, more than the typical everyone just is ok fighting to death all the time you get with basically every other game and your party leader's charisma or a bard playing music can raise that morale level. Weapons have speed values that make them attack slower or faster in each combat round, something gone in new editions and Pathfinder, that makes it so a lot of weapons just don't make any sense to use because they just do less damage or have less additional features (damage types/armor break/trip/disarm/etc). Hitting faster in the round can mean a lot if you end up being able to apply status effects, break an enemy's concentration on a spell, or outright kill them before they get to attack. I like that there are enemies that just naturally resist certain types of damage (slash/blunt/pierce) that is basically gone from new D&D and that even the armor or magic equipment you get might protect better or worse against certain types of physical damage. Punching people can knock them out which allows you to either steal things from the area without them seeing and losing reputation for killing them, charm person spells can also allow this or can change an NPC's dialogue and give you new information about them. Your charisma bonus (or penalty) is added to your reputation which can alter some conversations, rewards, and for some characters having a high or low enough reputation might make certain quests available or get you attacked by people that might have asked for your assistance. On the negative side of the old rules are the very low chance to hit low level characters frequently have, wanting a low armor value (preferable in the negatives) is odd, THAC0 is a more complicated system to calculate hit values since you want it to be lower and classes decrease it at different rates but magic items say they add to it even though they make it easier to hit, and everything about how stats work is completely different from how it is done from third edition on (like your constitution being over 16 for more health won't matter unless you are a warrior class and the bonus constitution health only applies up until a certain level or that the game says wisdom can resist spell effects but never actually added this to the game).

When it comes to changes made in the EE addition, the four new recruitable NPC characters (with one being a more of a secret find as he is the main antagonist of the Black Pits arena style add on) are all decent enough additions. They each give you a class type different from what you get in the main game for recruitable characters, though the monk character could probably have benefitted from better stats or unique items with how weak the class tends to be (especially in the low level environments of BG1). Either mistakes or problems from lack of models in the original game are often fixed here or changed such as characters casting spells they shouldn't be able to, characters with the wrong alignment, a massive amount of character that had the wrong model/gender or alignment (be it a issue of time, mistake, or just not having the model until later games) such as a quest where an ogre mage teleports to hell which has now been corrected by giving him a devil model, unique items for certain characters just not giving them the bonuses they are supposed to (taking a character like Alora from poor to the best thief in the game thanks to her rabbit foot item). A very positive change is in adding the new spells from Baldur's Gate 2 into this game, giving spellcasters more options and making the druid class more useable. They brought in the feature from later games with this engine where you can hold tab to highlight interactable objects in the environment, as well as adding a button to the UI that just toggles highlights on and off. Some new weapons and equipment pieces have also been added and some missing or nonfunctioning content or conversations have been added (most of these had to formerly be added with the Unfinished Business mod, which is still useable and still adds other content). Having potions and ranged ammunition stack at much higher number improves inventory management, as does adding in the Baldur's Gate 2 items that allowed you to store gems/jewelry, scrolls, and potions. An instant quick save and load and having the game in a digital format that doesn't need to swapping between six CDs is also a nice bonus.

Some of the class kit options added to the game that were from Baldur's Gate 2 give you almost no positive bonuses at low levels and don't add anything of value to the game, unless you plan to import the character you played through Baldur's Gate 1 into Baldur's Gate 2. Though they are still welcome additions. Pathfinding issues are still frequent, I don't know if it is new to this version but I don't recall having frequent problems where characters would actually walk inside of each other and get stuck. Limited character interaction, many don't have a quest or anything unique about their character or equipment, this makes it so a lot of them aren't really interesting or memorable unless you add mods into the game. The text box isn't handled that well, all the text being far too small by default (but that can be changed in options) and scrolling doesn't work well. With the enhanced edition, there was probably no real reason why certain weapons end up with much better items than others (two handed swords, long swords, daggers, and short swords tend to have better endgame equipment or frequent drops of magical versions compared to most other weapons) and it would have been nice if there were some store options or more extra equipment added especially considering they added Baldur's Gate 2 weapon proficiencies to each class. What hurts the gameplay the most -

...or maybe it does. Because the new content stands out precisely because BG1 is a big piece of shit. It's one of the worst cRPGs you could possibly play. It's totally linear. Every conversation and confrontation ends in a big, dumb fight. The combat is horrific--I know some maniacs out there like Infinity Engine gameplay, but I would sooner drink lava than sit through endless combat encounters in this game. Worst of all, the companions are nothing. There are no relationships. No conversations. No real dialogue trees. It's like a template for what cRPGs would later come to be, but nothing more than that.

I love every BioWare game. BG1 is the exception. This game is awful. If you want retro RPG, go play Fallout. Even Diablo is less linear! If you really, really want an Infinity Engine cRPG, though, choose any of them except BG1. BG2 is a good option. Or Planescpae: Torment.

228280,135032398,76561198005445451,0,1,3963,0,3959,1679532828,"I've played Baldur's Gate a lot back in the late 90s. It made me a fan of Dungeons & Dragons, CRPGs and this sort of Infinity Engine game. It did certainly breathe fresh air into the genre and was a first view into how party-based CRPGs would develop. And it was a proving ground for Bioware and their approach to story-telling and character interaction within the main cast. Looking back on it though, it is more of a prototype of what would come and it is of course surpassed by many games including its own legendary sequels, Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal.

This means, it does a lot of things less good than other games even within the Infinity Engine games. The combat encounters and dungeon designs in Icewind Dale are deeper and more rewarding. Planescape: Torment trumps it by a country mile in story telling, dialogue and writing. Baldur's Gate 2 of course brings it all together and defined what a modern CRPG to this day looks like.

Still, I love the first Baldur's Gate. Sure, a bit of that is nostalgia of me sitting in my room back when I was 15. Living in a really small village with less than 500 people, I would come home from school every day and play Baldur's Gate together with a friend from the neighbourhood. We would explore every nook and cranny, replay it with different party set-ups and even get us some tabletop Advanced Dragons & Dungeon sets to try our hand at traditional role-playing (adding his brother and other friends). 
And in the grand scheme of things, one aspect which Baldur's Gate still is really good at is emulating a certain part of low-level classic Dungeons & Dragons. No, you're not a legendary hero yet. You're roaming the country-side of the Sword Coast, exploring dense forests and mountrain trails while fighting low-level Kobolds and Hobgoblins. The rare  slightly enhanced magic user or special monsters like Basilisks or Sirens feel like little boss encounters. You really feel the level up from level 4 to 5 and a harsh level cap ensures that most of your characters won't see level 10 and beyond (lucky thieves though, eh). 
A lot of Baldur's Gate is walking through the wilderness and I understand for some people, that is boring. For me, it is incredibly relaxing. When you get to the nominal city of Baldur's Gate in the second half of the game, the pacing changes and it becomes more of a first look into how Baldur's Gate 2 would be with lots more dialogue, intrigues and decisions to be made. The included content of the add-on Tales of the Sword Coast then sees your party experience a proper and challenging several hours long dungeon-run into Durlags Tower. Durlags Tower, I stand by this, remains one of the stand-out dungeons of the franchise and an exciting high-point of Baldur's Gate 1 - even if it has nothing to do with the main story.

So should you play Baldur's Gate 1? This depends what you want out of it. My personal stance is: To properly appreciate Baldur's Gate 2 and the on-going storyline, you should give Baldur's Gate 1 a go. If you can't get into it, you might want to at least watch a Youtube story-explanation before going into its sequel. Before you feel like a god in Baldur's Gate 2 and your characters going Level 35 and beyond, it would be worth it to feel how the basics work with a level 5 group. You can import your character and some of your equipment into Baldur's Gate 2 for a feeling of one connected epic adventure. Many characters form Baldur's Gate 1 return and you will get more out of the sequel if you play this one first. 
I say you can still have a good time with Baldur's Gate 1 with the right mindset. And the Enhanced Edition helps in some ways... but hinders it in others to be quite honest.

So yes, the Enhanced Edition. This feels a lot like modding Baldur's Gate 1 in the early 2000s. It adds higher resolutions, some useful items from later games (such as bags holding gems, potions and scrolls) and even some magic, character classes and other features only included in later D&D games. Those quality of life-features help a lot with enjoying Baldur's Gate more. But even after years of patches, the Enhanced Edition still has some smaller bugs here and there, some glitches with sound and graphics. 
And then there is the completely new content: New characters (one even romance-able) and quests. While Beamdog tried to make them fit in naturally within the game world, I can't help but feel they are mostly out of place and not of the same style and quality as the original content. I liked Neera (a wild mage) the most of the bunch, but her quest felt unfinished. And the renewed UI, while technically improved, lacks a bit of the atmospheric texturing and feel of the original release. Speaking of: You can still get the Original game in a box set with Baldur's Gate 1&2 and all the add-ons in ""regular stores"" so you might consider this if you are a purist. I still do reccomend the Enhanced Edition for newcomers, though.

So in the end - Baldur's Gate is an important release, even if Baldur's Gate 2 is the actually essential game. If you are willing to jump head-on into those classic RPG-experiences, I would recommend to at least try Baldur's Gate 1 before going into 2 because it is a rewarding experience to play both back-to-back. Maybe do a run-up before going into Baldur's Gate 3 (which at the time of this writing is still in Early Access and will hopefully release in 5 months). It's what I am doing at the moment and I had a good time with this game and now I'm having a great time in Baldur's Gate 2. So I recommend Baldur's Gate 1 to anyone who wants to play the franchise, as a stepstone on your way to Baldur's Gate 2 and beyond.

This was one of the first isometric RPGs I played. Back in the day it was one of very few games that used actual D&D rules. Being able to create an entire party of characters was the biggest draw for me. It wasn't so much that I didn't like any of the NPC companions, but that I already had a party in mind that I wanted to use. But there are some annoying companions you can get, for sure. Some of them will even leave your party if you don't do their quest with them. It can be interesting to play with only companions, but it's nice that you don't have to.

The map is fairly diverse. A fair amount of dungeons, and a ton of open map area to explore. Lot's of secondary quests, so if you're having trouble with fights, just do a few of those to get ""practiced up"" and you're fine. The main story/quest is pretty good, too.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, this is a low-level campaign, so don't expect to become a god in an instant. You can export your character to BGII though, so there's that to look forward to. Secondly, a significant portion of the game is made up of sparsely populated wilderness areas. While finding an interesting encounter is exciting, it can become tedious to clear each wilderness map. Additionally, many of the side quests in the beginning are lackluster fetch-quests that offer little reward.

As you progress through the game, the final city hub can be a frustrating obstacle to navigate. Completing quests becomes more tedious and annoying due to the hub's layout. The dungeons also present their own set of challenges. Some have very thin corridors that are difficult to navigate, especially when trying to disarm traps.

Lastly, the new characters added by BeamDog are not great, so keep that in mind when building your party.

 Touch spells and in my case the ghoul touch spell. 
Original developers of BG included a +4 thaco when using ghoul touch.

Well guess what Beamdog decided to do.. yup they just took away the +4 thaco bonus this is completely irresponsible. They made the spell completely useless. 

Example: Its so damn bad now that I went as far as to make a Bezerker/mage and even with his thaco bonus the spell is still dog shT and cannot be used because its so unreliable and  you can't hit anything. 

This game which many of us hold dear to our hearts like me since I played this game on and off again my entire life well this game deserves to be handled better.

I don't think Beamdog should be able to just ruin things. 

They call it an Enhanced Edition but they just quite LITERALLY made this spell worse. 

I don't care about their reasoning they can tell me its because they ""THOUGHT"" it was a bug. 

It does not matter what you think it is you need to think if you are ruining something or not. 

I don't understand how the people who made this decision were not smart enough to think of this.

Imagine being the original developers of BG you know that DnD has a million rules and you know you cannot realistically fit everything in your  game. Especially in a timely mannor. After all time is money and they want to get the game out the door at some point.  

But  look at BG orignally it had things that were unfinished. But you know what they were also in a GOOD PLACE. So this means the original developers had made ""good judgement calls"", 

For instance they added the  Sorceror and it was not complete but it was also still in a good place. Its spellcasting ability was not reliant on charisma it is still intelligence. But who cares it still works right? Yes! They may not have had the time or money to finish that is what it came down to. But they made a good call because the stuff they finished was of higher priority. Because spending time on one thing means taking time away from another. 

So that example is kinda  what I imagine went on with touch spells. 

They did not finish them but they tried to give them a little something so they would be in a good spot. That something was  the +4 thaco bonus.

It would have cost them more time and money to add things for example possibly: Touch specializations that your character could invest increase his skill at using them. 

Or making your ability score modifiers improve your attack with those touch spells like may be dexterity or your casting ability score. 

I mean who knows what ifs, ands, or buts  

ALL I KNOW IS THE DAMN THING DOES NOT WORK IN BGEE NOW THANKS TO BEAMDOG RUINING IT.",1578863173,1677788358,False,1,2,0.348465591669082642,13,True,False,False

My first complete playthrough of the game (also played a little as a kid, but never finished), and it is an engaging world. Though the interface and general tech are dated, it still holds up. I played entirely on the Steam Deck and though at times challenging, was still a blast. This playthrough could be considered ""rushed"". I did mostly the main questline with some of the side quests. Definitely did not see all there is to see.

First and foremost I felt the weight of my choices and saw the consequences. I ended up being despised towards the end of the game because I killed some guards (who were attacking me because of my prior choices. lol.). Though the story is linear it does seem that depending on the choices you make the endgame plays out a bit differently, especially in terms of your standing with the different factions.

The story and lore felt very deep. I play D&D regularly (and recently finished a campaign in Waterdeep), and it was cool to encounter or hear of some of the locations and factions I have visited previously. Being based on and tied into such an expansive world as D&D felt good.

You encounter so many different characters, each with their own motivations. The number of party members you can recruit felt a bit overwhelming. I do feel this is a game that benefits from multiple playthroughs and taking your time finding the right balance.

Combat did get a little stale, as playing on the Steam Deck made it difficult to use individual characters abilities. Overall though, it still is one of the most iconic CRPGs and the combat fits nicely.

If you haven't played this game yet and are considering it, just know going that it is a bit dated, but very rewarding. It is one I hope to revisit over time and explore more of the content.",1677698780,1677698780,True,4,0,0.579445004463195801,0,True,False,False

Because if [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] isn't already seated as an example of perfected games, it should be. Now, [i]ahem... YOU MUST GATHER YOUR PARTY BEFORE VENTURING FORTH.[/i]

[b]Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition[/b] [i](BGEE)[/i] is a masterpiece. But it's also more than that. This game is why we don't have games like this anymore. The level of detail put into this game is so vast and widespread that you can easily play through the main story of the game and wrack up 100 hours of time well wasted. Mind you, that isn't for everyone. BGEE takes dedication and patience to play which is very much counter to modern titles. But instead of gushing aggressively over a title that has survived the testament of time with such an overwhelming degree of praise, I'm going to spend this review with fun tidbits and mild hot takes. On we go:

For starters, if you're the type of person that willingly plays a human, [i]you're boring[/i]. This isn't an opinion; it's a fact.

I'm fairly certain that this game can be run on a PC powered by a potato. I haven't tested this out, but I'm probably correct.

If you've never played table-top D&D, [i]THAC0[/i] stands for ""To Hit Armor Class 0"". Essentially it refers to the roll needed for a character to score a hit an opponent with an armor class of zero. Or more easily understood: the lower your THAC0, the higher likelihood you will hit your theoretical opponent. It's kind of one of the most important numbers to know.

There's so much side content in this title that 100% save files are something of legend.

There's actually more difficulty settings in the game than the established ones when you first start the game. What I mean to say is that playing the game as an evil mage is likely the hardest possible mode you can possibly make for yourself at any difficulty setting. Don't believe me? Try it out for yourself.

It goes without saying that Baldur's Gate is and will always be on the top of my recommendations. It's that good. At $20, it's more than a steal. Don't do yourself a disservice.

Now getting into the enhanced edition its still clunky and not intuitive starting out. Any back knowledge of D&D helps to lessen the burden but, it can take awhile to know how everything is done. It can be a lot to gather a party of six and have to in someways micromanage each to become successful, but stick with it get some armor and weapons or spells if you are a caster and just know that unless you know this game inside and out it is meant to be a rough start for a bit. When you start to get the engine going that will be your starting party it will become more immersive and you will get the flow of how it plays. Its a thoughbred CRPG in the fullest sense. Lots of reading and strategic thinking. It is still really combat heavy so always be prepared. It is an all time classic, and was how I learned to play these types of games.

Aside from me having to get a bit scummy with some of the fights in the final chapter of the game, I thought that the story and quests were done well. The game has this almost cheesy type of presentation with how it showcases the world, characters and events that I honestly really liked a lot. Maybe I'm just used to more ""gritty and grim"" interpretations of fantasy worlds, but I thought that the way this game portrayed it's setting was nice and usually light, while still being able to have serious moments. As far as criticisms go...well it hasn't aged badly per se, but some of the gameplay still felt sort of off. I don't hate THAC0, but I wouldn't prefer it over the later systems. I admittedly prefer turned-based gameplay over real-time with pause but that wasn't something I found too much issue with. The main problem I had (aside from the pretty bad AI pathing from my party) was how random things can get despite me not doing much different. I am well aware that this is how the tabletop game has always worked, and to some degree how every RPG videogame works, but it would be a lie to say that I didn't find it kind of weird how I usually didn't have to alter my strategy to pass fights or obstacles but instead just...try the same thing again, this time with my party rolling better.

Having 100% the game I can say that it's replayability is great for the amount of classes there are available. But, since this is a -low level setting- (characters cap their exp at 161k, around level 8 for a Fighter) you don't get access to the game-end level 7-9 cleric/mage spells later to be found in BG2, which it isn't an impediment at all. Level progressions feels natural, the spells available are fun and it's nice to figure out how to deal with some enemies.

Storywise it's ok, nothing too fancy about it. Sarevok it's a very fitting villian for the setting in which the game is set. 

Newcomers to the game might find the rules a little bit too complex and bloated, since you have to read though a lot of abilities. 
If you enjoy tons of dialogue, reading the Faer√ªn lore found in books, old-school WRPG mechanics and just having great party members (with a few exceptions) this is the game for you.

Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition represents a classic role-playing game (RPG), originally developed by the company BioWare and published by the company Interplay Entertainment in 1998. This remake (2012) has been developed by Overhaul Games, a division of Beamdog, and published by Atari. Further notable remakes of the development studio are Baldur‚Äôs Gate 2, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment.

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ You could play as the stereotypical good guy with a team of righteous characters. Or, you abandon your mortal shell, and create a demigod by using import / export shenanigans after you have collected all attribute books. Break the game by importing your own group of min / max freaks, and commit countless atrocities that would make the former God of Murder proud. Embrace your destiny!

+ The remake introduces a ton of quality of life changes for the base game, which translates into more content and technical modernization including a glorious 4K resolution. An additional DLC and sandbox mode round it up.

+ Kudos to the Legacy of Bhaal difficulty. It transforms every monster into an abomination of unparalleled power blessed by the four chaos gods.

o The side quests are a mixed bag, you have the good, the bad, and the pick-up-the-item-I-just-dropped ones. My favourite quest develops around the boy Albert, who turns out to be a lesser demon from the Nine Hells. The problem: the quest can be done in less than a minute, and the surprise at the end remains unused. One of many wasted opportunities for great adventures.

- The majority of companions are basically mercenaries, and interactions between them are rare. I see them as a way to fill my ranks with like-minded individuals, while role-playing around my reputation. Because if they don‚Äôt like what you do, they will leave you in a heartbeat.

-- The amount of dead space in the outskirts can only be described as atrocious. Occasionally, the game sprinkles some trash mobs here and there, but it remains a tedious grind to search every corner of the world map. Again, those regions should have been filled with interesting side quests in order to incentivise and reward exploration.

[i] Summary: [/i]

A solid remake of the game adding more content and technical customization, and to my personal surprise it has held up well. More importantly, it allows the younger fan base to experience a classic title among the RPG genre.
Most of the negative aspects diminish the overall attractiveness, but do not break the immersion while exploring dungeons filled with the promise of untold riches.

Recommended for people with a fetish for a certain hamster.

The story was pretty lackluster for me personally was kinda bland and didn't really care all that much except for some of the newer characters, actually payed attention to those one probably cause they are constantly talking and giving there opinions on everything still like them though. I don't enjoy rolling the dice for your stats though, to get good better stats to able to play on the harder difficulties kinda of annoying and tedious spending 20 minutes rolling a dice so I can play the game. Got lost immediately after getting the couple and had to pull up some videos to figure where to go and what to do next don't enjoy wasting time running around trying to figure out which npc I need to talk to, to progress the story. Legacy of Bhaal difficulty is honestly impossible for the casual player without a guide to cheese it props to all the people that play this difficulty for fun, hell even normal can be a challenge.

Despite living in the shadow of the masterpiece Baldur's Gate II, this game is still worth a playthrough. I mostly play for nostalgia these days, but a first-time player will need to know a few things before picking it up:

- This is a low-level campaign. You're not going to become a god in this game (but you can export your character to BGII).
- A big chunk of the game is sparsely populated wilderness. This makes exploration fun when you find an interesting encounter, but can be tedious to clear each wilderness map.
- Many side quests in the beginning are underwhelming fetch-quests and are not very rewarding.
- The final city hub is a pain in the ass to navigate, making completing quests tedious and annoying.
- Some of the dungeons have very thin corridors and are a pain in the ass to navigate, especially when considering disarming traps.
- The new characters added by BeamDog aren't great.
- I haven't played Siege of Dragonspear but I haven't heard good things, do your own research on that.

If you're looking to dive in to the world of Baldur's Gate and want to play the original, you will enjoy this game if you can deal with the above points. The main quest has an interesting story and is fun to progress through. If you get annoyed or bored with the side quests or wilderness maps, you can skip them and focus exclusively on the main quest.

If you're not playing this for nostalgia, play it once as a warm-up for the amazing Baldur's Gate II.",1675803504,1675803504,True,8,0,0.623447418212890625,0,True,False,False

It seems like a really overrated game to me, even though it clearly inspired many other games in the genre.
People complain about nostalgia goggles for games like Morrowind, but I think it's really true in the case of this game.

Gameplay-wise, you need to cheese to get anywhere, or use some jank tactics. There is also a really annoying mechanic, in the story, to do with iron mines, that makes certain weapons break- not sure what the percentage is, but it was frequent for me. For some reason wooden weapons are impervious but iron is like sugar glass.
Besides that, if you don't follow a guide regarding character creation, and roll a good set of attributes (painful), then it's likely you won't get anywhere, at least on normal mode. There's no cerebral challenge in the gameplay really, at least in the beginning, its like watching paint dry, roaming around an ugly canvas, until you get to 'the action,' then the combat is played in an awkward manner because the enemies are buffed to hell and the spell system is tedious.

Some party characters you can acquire will have like 4 health, others are not much better, which is abysmal considering the early game fights can do so much damage that even a meta character build can be one shot.
The class system is complex but there is a very finite number of viable options to get anywhere, not that you will get much out of that.

The story so far has been quite boring, it hasn't aged well. Its cheesiness is not endearing, and the characters are all irritating & very forgetful, and I feel like my face is being rubbed in the authors ideals rather than exploring anything interesting, or impactful. I'm not a fan of D&D, but Neverwinter Nights was more enjoyable, even though I gave up with that too.",1426018188,1675447402,False,5,4,0.411980301141738892,0,True,False,False

There are lots of people who will say this is a rip off, because you can still buy the original game for half the price and fans have been mod'ing it for years and those mods will give you many of the upgrades (plus more beyond what the enhanced edition offers). Those people are telling the truth! If $10 is that precocious to you (and you're doing single player) - you should consider it.

But if you don't want to spend the time setting up a twenty year old game on Windows 10+ or if you wanna play multiplayer with friends, I HIGHLY recommend the EE. Sure, BeamDog isn't Black Isle - they're a little cheesy and a little over-eager and their content sticks out like a sore thumb...but it's a very enthusiastic thumb and I, at least, forgive them their excesses.

This game is a classic for a reason and the wandering you can do through the wilderness as a low-level D&D party is enjoyable. The game can be pretty mechanically frustrating - it always was - but it's so juicy once you get into it that it's alright.

Baldur's Gate 1 is probably worth playing on its own, but if only have time for one Baldur's Gate this one is the lesser one. Baldur's Gate 2 is more interesting, better written, more difficult (in a good way) and a classic of the genre. This one is good. It's fun.

  Some games fuel the creative spark in a generation of future game designers.

     Some games stand the test of time, and embody best of what there generation had on offer.

       This game however as aged like a fine milk, and what 'charm' it once had, has vanished the instant there was any attempt at the same genre on offer.

          I would like to say it is a 'bad game', however doing that would be an insult to 'bad games'.  

             It looks terrible, the writing is atrocious, the voice acting is vile, the story is uninspired, unremarkable, regurgitated plot dregs dug out of the waste paper basket of an unimaginative seven year old.

   It is an RPG, that has no role play, no game play, and frankly, no game.

    Did I mention the save files get corrupted, and you often cant use them any more, for no explained reason?

[h1]Graphics & Sound: 6/10[/h1]
[h1]Narration: 5/10[/h1]

‚úîÔ∏è A vast world to explore.
‚úîÔ∏è A huge amount of possible companions, who sometimes have interesting interactions between them.
‚úîÔ∏è Pretty rich character-building possibilities.
‚úîÔ∏è While the game is old, the graphics remain nice enough if you don't look too closely.

üí≠ The game is long, took me around 100 hours to finish.

‚ùå My biggest issue with the game is how little is explained inside of it - expect to spend a lot of time on wikis if you want to understand the game mechanics.
‚ùå Related to the previous point, a lot of situations are just extremely difficult (or even impossible) to deal with if you don't have the adequate preparation (the right immunity spell usually), which can cause a lot of frustration if you don't have sufficient knowledge of the game.
‚ùå While the Enhanced Edition improved the game's user experience, it is still pretty clunky. For instance there is no display of the areas affected by your spells - you have to try and ""calculate"" them yourself.
‚ùå The Enhanced Edition isn't completely bug-less.
‚ùå While the exploration is pretty free, the story itself is very linear. There are extremely few significant choices the player can make inside the main plot, aside from giving rather ""good-aligned"" or ""bad-aligned"" answers in dialogues (which usually don't really change the outcome). 
‚ùå Sometimes the direction of the main plot didn't feel very credible to me - in the sense that I saw no reason for my character to do what the game expected from them.
‚ùå While you have a lot of companions to choose among, you only get the opportunity to really level up a few of them - the companions not currently in your party don't level along with you. I find it pretty sad because the companions don't have that much reaction lines, and over time they tend to repeat themselves a lot, and allowing to swap companions at will would have really helped that.
‚ùå The inventory management is a pain, especially when like me you want to pick up all the loot you can, even when it's not reasonable, and you should really pass on those 1 gold piece short swords.
‚ùå I didn't play it much, but the multiplayer left me a negative impression - having to handle the pause-based gameplay is really a hassle, and the way the party is bound together left really little space for players to do stuff on their side, which left a lot of pretty boring moments.

Overall the game is old and clunky, but it also has some charm, and was pretty interesting to play around in solo play. Despite all the negative points, I do recommend this game if you're willing to tackle its weaker aspects and spend a while on the wiki (no seriously, that's important, I find the game extremely difficult to play without an exterior source of information).

I'm sorry to say that, but this was one of the most disappointing gaming experiences of my life, and I can not really understand how this is supposed to be a classic. While the story (so far) is ok, the dialogues have charm and I actually like the graphics, the RPG mechanics are just trash.

I don't understand, how anybody could think that the D&D rules are acceptable. Everything is completely random, especially in the beginning, where everything (including you) will often die after one successful hit. The rules are quite complex, but that complexity serves no purpose whatsoever. Instead, there is a very specific rule for the tiniest detail, each level up works different, a lot of things including entire attributes have no meaning for all but a few characters and so on... But the worst sin that any RPG system can commit is still using the level value for calculating things. If you are sufficiently higher leveled than your opponent, he will never be able to even hit you, even if you are the worst fighter in the world regarding all other stats. But its not like you can really increase your stats anyway (and no, that has nothing to do with the time of release, Final Fantasy and Diablo for instance are older but allow you to customize your character during progress).

The final reason for me actually quitting is the ultra-slow pacing. After 16 hours I barely reached my fist level up. Maybe I just suck at the game, but probably the truth is somewhere in between.

As a last thing, the highly praised companions could not convince me. I was bombarded with new group members from the very beginning on which makes them feel rather random and exchangeable to me so far. It was still interesting to see how Bioware did that kind of stuff in their early days.

So in conclusion, the RPG mechanics are extremely weak and could not motivate me at all and for a purely story driven game the story, companions and world were too mediocre for my taste.",1672769960,1672769960,False,4,2,0.447734057903289795,0,True,False,False

This ""enhanced edition"" as it's called changes a host of things, but unfortunately it's for the most part for the worse.

They adapt many aspects of the second game into the first game without giving it any thought, thus ruining the careful balance of the first game. Changing the ""big"" weapon groups into single weapons makes the in-game experience worse due to the low amount of different weapons in the game, and thus you have to know what to choose from prior experience. Originally you could make a decent choice and get a nice selection of weapons, but here you MUST know which weapons are dropped and which aren't.

Another big change is the dispersion of thief skills, which is baffling. Originally the game had the two stealth skills under one skill, which meant that even at the low levels of BG1 the player could enjoy the various game mechanical effects of the thieving realm, but now you must invest double the points into stealth which greatly lowers your capacity to use the other skills.

They've changed some of the items to be super OP(frost arrows for instance), and added a slew of new, equally OP, items into the shops(elemental darts for instance, each does an additional d6 of damage compared to the 1d3 they usually do. Suffice it to say that this changes the power level of darts to an absurd degree, since not only do you do triple damage with them, they're super good compared to the other weapons due to a high fire rate, which means you do 3d3 + 3d6 per round. A regular swordsman still does d8 + bonuses). 

On the UI part they've clearly made the game worse. The icons and party member pictures and such are really tiny, taking away from both precision of clicking as well as immersion. The in-engine cut scenes are zoomed out to be ants, for some reason.

Graphically there's some huge immersion downgrades, changing from the admittedly poor quality 3d animations of the original into still 2d art. This in itself wouldn't be a problem if they hadn't made some massive changes to the feeling of these tidbits, thus removing the point entirely. For instance, the death animation of the original made it clear the player character had a special role as your death signalled the animation where your essence is drawn into a very sinister ghostly icon. The new version on the other hand has a simple disintegration that really doesn't tell you anything. Strange choice indeed, since you could easily have put the ghostly icon there as well.

In short, the people making the enhanced edition apparently haven't grasped the core concepts of the game they've changed, but have rather added stuff without much thought.

The only reasonable things I personally agree with are the higher stacking limits of arrows, and the auto-rest. 

Why the recommendation, then? It's Baldur's Gate 1, and it runs on modern machines. That in itself is a worthwhile thing, even with the many foolish design choices.",1672605775,1672605775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To date, I do not believe I ever returned those disks -- I was that friend, but unintentionally so. Foolishly, I thought ""Baldur's Gate"" was a hack and slash from the ""Dark Alliance"" series and was not much of a 'reader.' Loading up hacks and giving myself various, seemingly high level items and experience, I found that I could not just go around killing and getting more loot which measurably increased my ability to slay whomever I liked, as in, the RPG experience most are accustomed to.

In the latter half of that decade, I'd quit ""World of Warcraft"" with more than a year of my life ""/played"" looking for titles that would capture the immersion and roleplaying aspects of that addiction but something locally administrated and quickly decided that ""Baldur's Gate"" needed another fair chance. I was in that transitional phase, living with my parents. I believe I was in between two summer courses of conversational Spanish and epistemology, and my parents were going to Hawaii, so watching the house was my task. That week, all I did was play this very game, occasionally catching movies on television -- remembering in particular ""Dante's Peak"" -- eat frozen pizza, and sleep. Nothing else.

While most of its dungeons are lackluster, save for the often reviled ""Durlag's Tower"" (that is an excellent dungeon) the wilds and exploring of them is unparalleled. That week formally introduced me to Dungeons & Dragons, Ed Greenwood's ""Forgotten Realms"" and how it might have felt to play D&D in the early '90s and late '80s with its ""2nd Edition"" ruleset implementation. n.b. Read a brief on THAC0 before you play if you want to conquer ""Core"" difficulty.

Beamdog's treatment at times can detract from the original experience for some. If you have never played the originals as they were published, one would not be able to isolate anything amiss unless performing a careful examination of writing style and voice acting. Even then, it poses a challenge at times as the original version had an odd cast.

If only I had an opportunity to play this game growing up, it would definitely leave a huge impression and a lasting influence on me, like many other games of my childhood. Unfortunately, all I had at the time was a few gaming magazines with articles on Baldur's Gate and the sequel. Being a small kid with nothing to do, I read them many times over, of course, wide-eyed and eager.

Fast forward to modern age - game graphics and design made a gigantic leap forward in just 10 years time, while I did the growing up part, leaving Baldur's Gate far behind and forgotten. Naturally, once I got my hands on it, I tried to play through the series, even started with Baldur's Gate 2 three or four times (thinking, surely, the second part has aged less than the first), but always dropped it an hour or two in.

Finally just a week ago, it dawned on me, that Baldur's Gate 2 starts where first part left off in a most literal fashion (always bugged me that you start at level 7 :D and, no, I don't remember a single word from those ancient articles I had as a kid). So decided to try the first game and, luckily, that went down a lot smoother.

Now, that silly intro aside, here are my thoughts on the game.

Pros
- Extremely cheap nowadays.
- Very lighthearted, humorous and easily digestible writing - which ALMOST ALL modern cRPGs lack (looking at you Kingmaker, with your walls of poetic dialogue text for every drunkard dimwit NPC you meet along the way).
- Starts at level 1 and serves as a very good introduction to game mechanics, which are expanded on in later iterations.
- Generate a full party or pick any from wide selection of companions you meet along the way. No less than 20 and some even have quests (although, pretty clunky to complete, if you want to 100% this, as switching party members is not very streamlined, without going into greater detail).
- Large variety of classes and class combos to play as, spells to cast, unique equipment to find, locations to explore and secrets to discover. I was expecting the game to be very shallow, since it's based on one of the early DnD editions. But depth kinda blew me away, even today.
- Various difficulty settings with a good balanced middle ground at Core - game slowly ramps up difficulty and never goes overboard, with some exceptionally difficult and often optional fights in between (except for the final battle, don't know what happened there - it's brutal).

Cons
- Graphics aged awfully and that's a massive roadblock for anyone willing to give this game a chance. Environment are often a pain to look at - a lot of obvious procedural duplication, and yet, everything seems hand placed at the same time. It's ugly and hurts to think about.
- Interactivity and quality of life features are, obviously, very dated. Don't expect fireball to have a circular ground targeting indicator, no, you're going to throw it blindly, and you're going to turn half of your party into lumps of charcoal (which could be considered a sadistic 'feature' of sorts, but will often just mean, that aoe spells can be thrown only at a large distance).
- SUPER NARROW cave environments and mazes mixed in with mediocre pathfinding for a party of six who are additionally colliders to each other. Need I say more? Ok, I will, sometimes characters will just clump into a single grid tile, and will get stuck in one place for a while - ALL SIX OF THEM.
- Personal opinion (spoilery) - I got bored of the story half way through. 'Kill this bad guy, but there's another bad guy pulling the strings, who also has strings, that are pulled by a third bad guy, and then there's some plot twist on top of that'. I don't know, it's a cluster. Honestly, I liked side quests a lot more, than the main storyline - bigger variety of enemies and things to do.

Overall, well worth the 5$ I paid for it, but comparing to some of the modern cRPGs, I would not give this game multiple playthroughs. Back in the day, I'd play it up and down many times over. Sadly, time was merciless to Baldur's Gate, and turned it into a gentle attraction you fondly remember liking as a kid, but would be too uncomfortable to ride as an adult (even though, I just finished it, as an adult... This doesn't make sense anymore, but i'll keep it in - it's a pretty sentence, and since comments are disabled, I'll :cringe: for you and with you, dear reader).",1671333155,1671333155,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I love the auto calculations and highlights for who can use equipment. Color text shows the advantage vs disadvantage of inventory items (so less THAC0 confusion for new AD&D players). The tutorial has been expanded. Ammo counts are 4x higher, increasing carrying amount. Extra carrying cases from other games are introduced early. I'm exploring the new spells, sub-classes, and fighting styles. The auto-reveal of interactive items and map journal is a time-saver. 
An overseen feature is the time clock. Characters in the party can grow impatient about unfinished missions, keeping the player focused on the main plot. Travel time, action speeds, and carrying capacity were real issues in this edition. You may have to triage some of that treasure. And actions have consequences. If you get caught stealing, leg it before the guards arrive.
It has a few flaws, but I'm very happy with the overall game. Otherwise I wouldn't have played it again. The biggest flaw I can find is only one campaign can be saved.

So at core, you are looking a game that is 22+ years old. There were lots of license limitations to Beamdog as far as i heard. 

It's a party based isometric RPG that uses Dungeons&Dragons 2nd edition ruleset. You create main character, find NPC's suit to your ideals, goals. Overcome enemies, gain levels and items, solve plots, help people or help yourself, deal with the brewing trouble in the region.
Main quest is kind of a linear but nearly every little quest has multiple paths and they affect you one way or another. With every class comes a different play style so multiple play-throughs are quite common. 

This game changed cRPG in its release and set way for a new era, many awards and professional critics have already shown its excellence. Here is my thoughts anyway. 

+++Story / World : One of its strongest aspects, BGEE defines a very intriguing world. Political, personal events are curious, lots of quests and characters to discover. Empowered from D&D universe Forgotten Realms, your adventures take place on Sword Coast, which many books, games already established quite well. When you set foot and pay attention to details, you will find yourself immersed in an magnificient world.
Your character can continue to Dragonspear and then to BG:II EE which i strongly suggest. Then the positive comments i can gave is not enough. Upon completion, you will be like you have read 9 books of good fantasy role-playing.

+/- Game System: 2nd Edition D&D is imbalanced and complex. I am a DM-GM of 5thE and Pathfinder 2.0 on pen &paper and i don't want to go these old systems. However since it's a PC game, some of that imbalance turned into a feature for most people.
You can make characters can single handedly finish game , even on harder difficulties. Lots of cheesy combinations. Some like it some dont. There are mods to fix this, or bump this aspect more. Anyway 2nd edition created immense replayability for BGEE that's for sure.
So it's neither a plus nor a minus. 

+Graphics / technical: Well its'a game of 22+ years. It's working on modern systems, with 21:9 and 144hz 3440*1440 support, i had NO crashes or bugs /crashes due to technicality.

+++ Voice Acting/ Sound/ Music: It requires mention. Quite good regarding its age. Music is masterpiece. 

Overall EE fixed TONS of bugs, made it modern day compatible added new items, BGII classes and kits, new difficulty and its still updated and supported and its still modable with active and helpful community
Visit: https://forums.beamdog.com/categories/bg%3Aee-discussion for all kind of info and help.

It was great to go back through BG and all the extras, Tales of the Swordcoast, but I'm 45 minutes into SOD and I'm just hunting through how I can afford to get rid of Safana as soon as possible.

I got the EE without any knowledge of Beamdog, their expansion, any of their writing, anything, because I played the original BG, BG 2, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, all of it. I wasn't really paying attention to anything to do with these extras or this company. I still am not really. But 6 years after their huge release controversy, I understand and agree with that their writer Amber Scott is off her rocker and needs desperately to learn to do better more nuanced writing. Because this is kind of butchery.

Safana gets dumped into your lap as a forced character when you finish BG and the game flashes to SoD prologue in a dungeon and Imoen, no matter your choices, is a trailing character and not a companion talking about current events and helping along, but not directly. Ok. Sure. 

But Safana takes to some pretty creepy sultriness. Pushiness in fact, like she's just a hairs breadth from tackling you right there in the middle of the dungeon right in front of that skeleton rising out of its crypt attacking you. It's really creepy. Her click, select, and order lines are super cringey. The last thing I want is a nymphomaniac that has now been turned into a super sarcastic dissenter (I haven't gotten that far?) that keeps throwing suggestiveness at me like a dog in heat. Sultry ""Yes dear?"" Stretched out into almost 4 syllable lengths every single time. Poor voiceover acting drawing everything out painfully long is making me dread having her for even another minute.

Ok, so past the prologue. There are only 2 thieves in SoD.

In BG which I have just enjoyed fully revisiting I ended up getting rid of Khalid and Jaheira as soon as I could conscionably do so because I simply could not abide the reality of a WARRIOR that is a defender, a front line strong man that is meant to take on all kinds being a simpering coward and stuttering fool jumping at every shadow and every kobald we had to fight. How does a WARRIOR, a FIGHTER have literally less spine than a stable boy? And Jaheira's general disgust for all things civilization that makes her intolerable if you don't want to occasionally mocked lightly ""omni present authority figure"" in a mocking tone, funny enough, but eventually gets annoying. But what is obnoxious is her constantly going on about every trace of people and it's destruction on nature. I get it. She's a druid. But she's a bloody HARPER. They DEAL in civilization. 

But Khalid and Jaheira being annoying are not deal breakers in BG in ANY WAY! because there are a PLETHORA of companions in BG. And they can be endearing if you don't mind their issues. Me? I mind a coward of a fighter that is best as an archer with gauntlets of ogre might, renamed in EE edition to Tokkar or whatever for composite bow, or given dexterity gloves to survive better as a pseudo tank front liner. It just doesn't match any form of ""role playing"" to handle his personality for me unless you really get into a Jaheira that is a truely domineering woman forcing him into everything. Pretty grim assumptions, especially with Amber Scott (the writer from Beamdog) perspective that she CLEARLY trashbinned because ""we cannot have a nagging housewife trope Jaheira, so I'm going to write a sweet romancy side quest for them 2"" uhhh that does not fit any role-play my friend. It just... doesn't. It really does not.

Moving on. SoD is harmed deeply by Safana by anyone who cannot stand this extremely forced nympho not nympho rewrite re-voiced overacted responding to everything because by GOD Amber Scott wanted her to not be seen as JUST a sex object but now she is MORE THAN EVER, I guess until you get to her side quest... because there are only 2 thieves. Where as before in BG there are 4 fighters, and several fighter multi-classes. 3 druids, 2 clerics, several cleric multi-classes. 

You are FORCED into having Safana. Forced to deal with Amber Scott's rewrite, and forced to have the ""Yesssssss ddeeeeeaarrrrrr.....??"" every single time you activate her. ""Sweetheart?"" ""Mmmmmmm"" like a moan.
Direct her ""Whatever you like.""
LIke. WHAT? I'm NOT in a relationship with you! Don't call me that. What is so breaking for me is that she IMMEDIATELY, well, that, the second she throws Coran out for cheating on her after a... 2 month relationship? Double standards much? SO CRINGE.

And for whatever reason no matter who else is in my party, she is the only one that responds to external situations, and makes it as sexual as possible. I really don't want to deal with that overt of a narrative and pushing on of characters onto me. 

So this get's a thumbs down overall because the Enhanced Edition is Beamdog is Siege of Dragonspear. They did some pretty clumsy and terrible implementation, overdone and poor writing, and then pushed it on agenda rather than being nuanced. In terms of their ideas for representation, sure, great, whatever, just make it actually representative and nuanced. Not completely out of the norm and bizarre or blunt force trauma. I just met a character, they just dumped a guy, now they are sexually harassing me with every click for the rest of the game because I am forced to have them in my team when I had no interest in them in my team ever before just because the Beamdog writer didn't like how she was one dimensional? I mean, no one I ever knew that ever played BG ever bothered with Safana. Ever. So... now she's forced on people because this one writer didn't like her? And that character is forcing herself on the player in what feels quite a rebound, over the top harrassment style? This does not feel ok.

Thanks but no thanks Beamdog. If I hadn't already purchased all of these enhanced editions because they were all on extreme sales because of these major writing faux pas' of yours, I wouldn't be buying them at all because I don't know how I will be getting past the hours between Safana and recruiting the next and her having definitely skipped the sexual harassment seminars at work and school. Do some better coding so it isn't ALWAYS that one character responding in a group selection, so there is variable response, so it doesn't feel like it is Safana's party when it is in fact my character's party. Ugh. So much Ugh trying to get past the prologue and handle having Safana totally forced on me. I may just have to ditch my character and make a thief dual or multi-class so I can actually see the rest of the expansion.

edit: Apparently whomever you put as last in the order of your companions responds more frequently, or is the 1 whom responds to everything. Not sure if that will be companion responses to NPC dialogue yet, but at least I've got her moaning in my ear less by moving Minsc to the 4th slot, though that sucks for formations. Oddly, Minsc never chimes in where she constantly moans at me.

Edit 2: Fortunately, you can immediately kick Safana when you start ""chapter 8"" after the prologue and replace her with the other thief. You cannot backstab with him, which leaves much to be desired, especially as a thief/cleric his range is slings, but I guess he'll do.",1669057796,1669077780,False,3,0,0.476832658052444458,1,True,False,False

The Co-Op worked surprisingly well for a game of this age besides a couple disconnects. This was our first type of game like this where you control a full party of adventurers as opposed to one character each.

Pros:
- A whole lot of bang for buck if you shoot for the 100% playthrough (306.7 hours for our one playthrough of main game, Siege of Dragonspear and Black Pits)
- Tons of variety between the default companions in the game and the ability to make custom ones

The story and writing is still there and it is good, but the gameplay is torturous.

There's no dungeon master to narrate and change the flow of a fight, it's just enemies that can decimate your party if you're not going in completely min-maxed.

The narrative in the game is good, and there's an interesting adventure to delve into but the entire game revolves heavily around fights and the fights are, excuse my french, dog shit.

The game mechanics are good, however you need to dig into deep into the rules to understand what you need to use for different enemies, especially for the harder ones, otherwise it's manageable.
The Enchanced version makes the game better, however some of the added NPCs breaks the immersion which is frustrating sometimes, but you are able to ignore them fortunately. And last but not least, you have to walk a lot.

No the problem comes when I get told to clear Nashkel mine fairly early in the game.

I go back in and methodically check each level of the mine I find a few stray kobolds and make sure every corner is explored. Nope still can't turn it in. I think ""Ok well I should still be able to turn in the main quest to the mayor right?"" Nope I return to him and he just reiterates the need to clear out the mine. I don't know if there's some hidden door (because they sometimes blend in a little too well) or if there's just one stray kobold I can't seem to find.

except on the highest difficulty. do not play the highest difficulty without console command mods. it is not fun and it is not worth your time or the Steam cred. i just finished the game on the highest difficulty immediately prior to writing this and i will never do so again. just as you should do never. i am writing this review *specifically* because of how unfun and tedious the LoB difficulty is, despite the game being otherwise challenging. 

the highest difficulty goes beyond a challenge and makes the game unplayable. entry level enemies that have 80 hp and can one shot your most powerful fighter at lower levels. a single lightening bolt trap can wipe out an entire party at lvl 12. do not play this game on the highest difficulty without mods that allow you to instantly heal or kill at your will. i would usually feel bad for cheating the ""challenge"" but this was no challenge, it was a stupidly balanced setting and it should have never existed. 

just to be clear, i am a freakn master of this game, i've been playing it for almost 20 years.  i had a meme team of demi-gods with maxed out stats, all at lvl 10-12, which is 2-3 levels higher than the level cap.  i spent months building this team. the 4 melee's all had over 150 hp, which is a freakn lot, and they had grandmastery in all their preferred weapons. it *still* took me 15-20 seconds to clear a group of kobolds or gnolls. oh? did you take a bunch of damage spells with your spellcasters? lol jokes on you bruh cuz ur finna sling about 5-6 Fireballs at a group of Kobolds to kill em. 

they could have easily just jacked up the damage and AI without turning *everything* into a damage sponge.

I have made it a goal to do all there is to be done, and after my most recent playthrough, I think that I can confidently say that I can address a quarter of what this game has to offer. 

The story itself (not including its sequel ), is pretty decent throughout, but I think where this game shines is its ending. But I must admit, that the Enhanced Edition cutscenes do not portray the story nearly as well as the original (which I have never played), so I would ask you to look up the original cutscenes to truly get the best story experience, as I think it makes major plot points more clear. 

The classes are fun, diverse, and interesting, although I would have liked to see more balancing with some of the subclasses. In theory they are awesome concepts, but in use, they are underwhelming and underpowered (ex: the Shapeshifter is great example of this). 

The combat and mechanics hold up relatively well today, in fact, there is a reason why many other similar games use this very same system, it works. The game itself can be a little overwhelming at first, but where the game truly shines is its subsequent playthroughs where you can explore and experiment once you have gotten use to the tricks and niches this game plays to. 

I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs or what not, in fact, the only problem I had was a reforming party screen carry over through saves, but was quickly fixed by restarting the game.

The story is very interesting, i just couldn't stop playing, I wanted to know what's gonna happen. There are many companions so you can easily choose who suits your party better. They have their own stories and quests so you can know them better. There is a lot to explore, the world is big and filled with side quests (they are not repetitive), secrets and traps of course. You have a lot of freedom and in many situations you have to make a choice (you have to choose 1 of 2 options and it's good/bad most of the time). So you can play a good character and help the others or be a villain and steal stuff, kill people etc. The game is hard, i played on core rules and died a lot, like A LOT. It's kinda easy to get stucked on a hard boss fight and you can try several times or comeback later. I actually learned to make a quicksave every few steps. The combat is meh, i don't like it that much and playing mage is a nightmare escpecially on low lvls but it's getting better tho and in Dragonspear it felt really good. The game is old so of course it doesn't look amazing but graphics aren't that bad and it didn't bother me.

This is a game premised on recreating the experience of low-level Dungeons & Dragons, and it really commits to that part; The stakes are low for most of the game, more dangerous monsters like dragons and beholders are nowhere to be seen, and the player probably won't even reach level 10. It also emphasizes freedom to explore with a large number of maps to roam around freely, even in the early game, and you have plenty of sidequests to find. Although your companions aren't particularly complex, they all fit well into broad D&D archetypes and there's no shortage of options. The one thing that will probably be a sticking point for a lot of new players is the fact that the mechanics are based on second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and as such, they can be confusing or even unfair. There are plenty of difficulty options to remedy this, though, including a trivially easy ""story mode"" setting.

Lots of replayability options with this game. The classes are pretty expansive, the magic system has depth, the stories are fun. Many, if not all, quests have varied endings. Choices matter to a surprising degree. You'll trip over the number of companions you find, and that's on top of being able to custom make a party of 6 yourself. It's filled with charm and character, much like Witcher 3 now that I think about it. There's adventure on every tile, and behind most doors. Literally, just start opening doors. After checking for traps of course. Quests abound, and if you get dialogue options it's best to assume your affecting one. It's old school DnD, so less forgiving. Combat might take some getting used to, I played on Core Rules. That said, I look forward to higher difficulties.

THE GOOD:

- Loads of options for character creation that vastly changes your playstyle on repeat playthroughs.
- Plays just like classic D&D, except it's much more fluid and combats don't (always) take 2 to 3 hours.
- A wealth of charming characters and party members all around. Yes, INCLUDING the Enhanced Edition characters: they aren't nearly as bad as all the boomers make them out to be. They blend into the game extremely well.
- Getting lost and running around the map on a looting frenzy is pure bliss.
- The music and sound effects, while obviously a product of their time, still hold up well to this day.
- The game's real-time combat is very well handled. Being able to stop time and micromanage your moves whenever and however much you want is very handy and satisfying.
- Finally, the story. Wow. This is without a doubt my favorite story in any RPG game. The main plot is simple but takes some really creative directions, party members have awesome stories that start here and carry over into the sequel, lots of fun sidequests to follow, and the interlude, Siege of Dragonspear, was actually one of the highlights of my playthrough. Baldur's Gate has all the energy and joy of a tabletop romp with your friends, except the story is all just for you. This is undoubtedly the star aspect of the game.

THE BAD:

- Some of the old voice acting is kinda cringy.
- Damn, 2nd Edition rules are confusing as hell and make my eyes bleed.
- In true D&D tradition, Wizards and Sorcerers are the best classes in the game, but are complete garbage for the first 5 to 8 levels. The maximum level in Baldur's Gate 1 is level 9. If you want to play a mage, you will have to survive the entire first game being carried by your party before you can unleash pure carnage upon the Sword Coast in the sequel.
- Stealth can be really finnicky and hard to understand at first.
- There are some pretty extreme spikes in difficulty in this game. Make sure you save often, and if you get stuck don't be afraid to go do something else for a bit.

ADVICE FOR NEW PLAYERS:

- Don't be afraid to play a mage; you can definitely still contribute to your team, just be aware of the risks.
- Don't listen to all the yammering minmaxers online; unless you're doing a solo + hardest difficulty run, basically every class is viable in some way or another.
- Playing an Evil character with an Evil party is really fun, but be aware that it makes the game harder.

Crewman06 stated: ""I purchased the original game before the company of the ""enhanced"" edition took part in taking down the original to sell this. The game adds new content which takes away from the hard work that the original company put into their game, the essence of the original is twisted and ultimately lost. The hard work put into the original is what made the game great. the new content feels like someone's poor attempt at writing themselves into a great story, with little effort and understanding of what made the original story great, while forcing their views and values upon future readers and, taking credit for the whole thing... No, just no. ""
While DKapple's post had a nifty title I think should be re-stated; Avoid Beamdog products at all costs. ""I rushed out and bought the ""enhanced"" versions of these same games without doing my due diligence, and so I refuse to believe that that 4 star rating is an actual representation of player satisfaction with the ""enhanced"" version of the games. ""Enhanced"" -- it turns out -- doesn't mean ""patched to fix bugs"" or ""updated to run on modern machines"" -- it also apparently means ""bland graphics and shoe-horning in characters and writing that never existed in the original games and were never meant tod"". Couple that with the fact that you must now buy the bundle just to get the original, and the whole thing is a deal breaker for me.

I tried a great many times to get through it over the decades, but I alius get bored of its big empty world and dull gameplay eventually.  Well, this time thanks to the Enhanced Edition and its much needed QoL updates (mostly highlighting interactable objects so you don't have to painstakingly hover over everything as if this was a darn point & click game), I finally managed to slog through it.. although it was still not a great experience

Seems to me you just spend most of yer time waiting for yer characters to slowly move from point A to point B, once in a while getting distracted by a pack of weak mobs that get demolished within a second or two, even on the (second) highest difficulty.  There's absolutely no challenge, no thinking or strategy needed (except for two battles.. the superboss and the final boss, and said strategy only consists of casting buffs, drinking a few potions, and moving back to a strategic position).  There's no puzzles, the maps are bland and boring to explore, every indoor area is recycled to shit and mostly pointless, there's not really any story to speak of, and what little there is of it is told poorly and inconsistently

Overall, the ""game that revived and saved DnD, and created its own genre of classic RPGs"" is, imo, the dullest and most overrated DnD game there is.  Before I move on to a non-BioWare CRPG to see if it's the genre or the company that's the problem, I guess I'll play through the new fanmade-but-totally-official Siege of Dragonspear xpac, just incase I stick around long enough to play BG2 someday.

The Enhanced Edition simply brings it to modern pc's with minor graphical tweaks, enhanced resolutions and combines the original baldur's gate with the must have Baldur's gate Tutu mode of old. It basically makes the game run on the Baldur's Gate 2 engine with all the updated classes, kits, weapon skills, updated spells and what not. Just now you don't have to mess around with disk swapping, modding and multiple levels of installs! 

Along with those tweaks they also added 4 new characters who can join your party to fill out the new kits added in Baldur's Gate 2: A Blackguard (Not an actual kit sadly) , a Wild Mage, a Sorcerer and a Monk. All of but one of which have a quest for you to go on, new weapons and armor to find and brand new fully voiced dialogue, most of which fits in pretty well with the original audio quality from 1998 lol. And if your a purist, don't worry, you can completely ignore them or kill some of them on sight and just be done with them lol.

As an added bonus included with the game is a new mode called ""The Black Pitts"" , an arena mode where you make a party of up to 6 custom characters and fight 15 battles for a psychotic and charismatic Drow arena master by the name of Baeloth! His voice acting is fantastic and stands out among the new content. It's fun, short and lets you easily build up a custom party of adventurers you can take back into the main game, or just goof around with. Very fun, absolutely recommend you check it out as a fun bonus!

All in all Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is an amazing package of a game with tons of content, memorable characters, great voice acting, outstanding music and I cannot recommend it enough! And after your done here there's also a new expansion for the game called Siege of Dragonspear and the much superior sequel Baldur's Gate 2! Which has also got the enhanced edition treatment!

[*] Slow Character Movement [i](locked at 30 fps - you can increase it up to 60fps on the .lua file under Documents/BG, value after ""Maximum Frame Rate"" - this may somewhat clip the in-engine ""cutscenes"", since everything hapens faster, but dialogue remains the same speed - i recommend 45fps)[/i]

This is obviously a classic- it inspired many of the other games I play. It's a good early attempt to translate TTRPGs into video game form. I think there have been some serious improvements over the years though. The game kind of relies on the player already understanding the math of TTRPG dice. I don't actually play TTRPGs, so telling me a sword hits with a certain dice roll doesn't help me figure out if the sword is good. D&D alignment systems have never made much sense to me either (neutral vs. chaotic, good vs. neutral seem very subjective).

After 150 hours of adventuring the Sword Coast, I feel like my adventure has come to an end. I thoroughly enjoyed my time exploring the hand-painted maps, discovering hidden artifacts of power, facing orcs, goblins, gnolls, dragons and so many other creatures. The dialogue, the books, and the music kept me engaged as I gained experience and together with my friends, defeated the evil threatening Faerun. It was really fun to cast spells, disarm traps, unlock chests, and crush my enemies. Party management and combat strategy opportunities made this game really fun to play. It brought me back to my teenage years as I played D&D with my hometown friends.

The Dragonspear expansion is also really fun and adds valuable content to the game.

I am posting this on both the review for this game, and the first in the series, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced edition.

I absolutely LOVE this game, and everything about it, and the other game in the series. I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...

Before IT happened.

The update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more. 

Before now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play. And, unfortunately, it was the fault of the people who brought it back in the first place.

--HOW BEAMDOG CAN FIX THIS--

-Implementation of the old character and save game formatting
-Option to use the old UI
-Option to turn the Console Command on and off IN GAME. The steps to do this in the first place were a nightmare in and of itself.

--Things that COULD help--
- Scale the difficulty levels back down a little. Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.


As it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. It pains me to say that (as you can no doubt see from my time in this game), but as it is right now, it's not worth any money.

*****EDIT 7/2/2022*****

It's been a long time since my initial review after the Siege of Dragonspear update. While I can say that the DLC is still very much not worth your money for what it is, I can say for certain that, as I have said in a comment below, it has gotten much better. Settings were introduced and added that allow you to play the game with as close to its classic UI as possible with a few added bells and whistles.

Used program to roll stats (human paladin), Core Rules difficulty, played with full party (mostly didnt cheese), did Tales Of The Sword Coast expansion (didnt do Black Pits or newest DLC), use of wiki was limited (mostly for checking which companions should pick).
Will continue with Baldurs Gate 2.

PROS:
+ Bunch of spells to learn and use
+ Can play solo or in party
+ Bunch of items to find and exploit/sell
+ Interesting quests/encounters (many interesting moments)
+ The land and Baldurs Gate feels big
+ Dungeon design is very good
+ Combat generally is challenging (as long as you dont cheese or arent going to a lot lower level zones - there isnt any kind of enemy scaling in the game)
+ Feels rewarding to master the system (still feel as beginner, even though managed to beat the game)

CONS:
- No bank, mostly store spare equipment in barrels/boxes
- Graphics (the quality is the problem not aesthetics/style, but this is an old game)
- Easy to miss content (need to check all nooks and crannies)
- You will die a lot
- Incompatible companions will kill each other or leave party
- Too high or low reputation will make specific companions leave
- Disbanding companion most of the time will make them stay in the same place (RIP Faldron, your fault for not running out of flooded mine)
- No indicator for size of AOE spells/effects
- Movement for full party can be clunky (blocking each others movement)

+/- Bunch of companions (some come in pairs), basically impossible to see everything in one playthrough
+/- If you know then many ways how to cheese system

Summary:
If you dont have any more modern RPG you want to play OR if you want to know from where many modern RPG game decision took place (or at least got inspired from) OR if you just a big DnD fan (who is interested in older systems) then I suggest this game. Game is solid, but you can feel age on it.

The story is... flawed, the first 5 chapters pretty much just boil down to ""now you must fight the bigger bad"" repeated like 6 times in a row until you get to the city of baldur's gate and most of the characters outside of Sarevok (the main villain) are incredibly shallow and uninteresting, even your companions barely have any dialogue most of it being their introductory dialogue, banter while you explore and their combat lines, there are exceptions such as Minsc who is a lovable goofball but they are that, exceptions.
The story, at least for me, fails to intrigue due to a lack of interesting characters and a very weak first 5 chapters as so much of it can be boiled down to ""you kill the bad guy who tells you hes working for another bad guy who you kill but you learn he was working for a bigger bad guy who is actually also working for a bigger bad guy"" it gets quite repetitive and the story feels like its at a standstill until you get to Baldur's Gate at which point the story improves drastically.
This game is frustrating, clunky and you have to learn an edition of Dungeons & Dragons that hasnt been in use for like 20 years just to know what THAC0 is, all of this while youre trying to learn the basics of combat, spell use and a solid party composition or why the fuck 3 of your longswords broke in the same fight against 5 hobgoblins. Its going to be overwhelming for a new player without a guide.
Once you finally understand how to play the game well this game becomes genuinely very fun to play and steamrolling through the game on a second playthrough thanks to all the knowledge you gained from that first playthrough is very cathartic.

TL;DR: Baldur's Gate 1 is a clunky, outdated game that is very hard to get into as someone that just didnt play it when it came out or hasnt played many games from that era of gaming and also has a story that i dont consider to be very good for the first 5 chapters but it was a revolutionary game that changed the landscape for western rpgs to come and its a very important game for that alone.
Is the game worth playing? Kinda, as a casual gamer that just wants to find something nice they can jump into and just play for the story, no, its gonna be painful and unfun. 
As an rpg fan that wants to experience a relic of its time that while clunky helped pave the way for many games to come, many of them being incredibly popular franchises and games such as Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Kotor and many others, yeah, i'd say its more than worth giving a shot, you might find something you really like.",1653960302,1654080059,True,15,0,0.668970108032226563,0,True,False,False

Mechanically wise the game aged really bad, it's slow and not in the good way.
Everything being up to roll makes for a more than frustrating experience, you will get into encounters and you will 90% die the first time you encounter them, a game requiring you to have foreknowledge of a fight to get through it is not good game design.
A lot of mechanics are poorly explained and even with the ""tutorial"" it was a chore to understand.
The game puts some roadblocks on you and expects you to ""earn"" the right to progress, and bets on you having nothing better to do in your life to push on through, maybe it worked in 1998 but go get a better game.

You'll see that most strategies rely on cheesing more than taking foes head on, which is testament of how the game is appreciated by those who ""appreciate the genre""

[h2][i]Camaraderie, adventure, and steel on steel. The stuff of legend! Right, Boo?[/i] ~Minsc[/h2]

[i]Baldur‚Äôs Gate[/i] returns as [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] and brings some sweet new features to the table as well as definitely makes it more convenient to play, especially for newcomers. The original game was developed by BioWare and released by Interplay Entertainment in 1998, whereas the remastered version was done and released by Beamdog in 2012. 

[i]Baldur‚Äôs Gate[/i] is a good old classic isometric CRPG based on the 2nd edition of [i]Advanced Dungeons & Dragons[/i], which is heavily related to rules of the ‚Äò90s tabletop roleplaying games. Well, the main difference is that you don‚Äôt throw dice here, simply because the game does it automatically, besides it‚Äôs conducted in real-time with an option to pause whenever you like. Anyway, despite being old, [i]Baldur‚Äôs Gate[/i] looks genuinely decent even after all these years, mostly due to its unique 2D graphics generated by Infinity Engine. Not to mention the atmospheric soundtrack composed by Michael Hoenig and amazing storyline.

When it comes to the storyline, to put it briefly without going into details, [i]Baldur‚Äôs Gate[/i] takes place in Forgotten Realms, which is a high fantasy setting. The prologue starts in an ancient library fortress Candlekeep and serves as a tutorial. Well, as it quickly turns out, the protagonist has to immediately leave this place along with his foster father Gorion. However,  as soon as they walk past the safe walls of their home, things get complicated. The story unfolds step by step, as the hero progressively is being thrust into the world at the brink of war and chaos, with countless monsters, bandits and assassins hired to take his head. Eventually, it all leads to discovering an intricate plot developed by an evil mastermind, as well as learning the origins of the protagonist‚Äôs sinister heritage.

Alright, but what‚Äôs new about [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] and what‚Äôs been changed to make good ol' [i]Baldur‚Äôs Gate[/i] worthwhile for both veterans and new players? Well, first of all, the original expansion [i]Tales of the Sword Coast[/i] is now an integral part of the game. Furthermore, there are a lot of bug fixes and overall improvements, including a new interface with high resolution widescreen support as well as cross-platform multiplayer option. However, most importantly, what makes [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] worthy of your time, are the new features related strictly to the gameplay - this is where the remastered version shines, especially after comparing it to the original. Well, at the very first glance you can see that old cinematics have been replaced by new cutscenes in hand-painted style, all directed by Nat Jones. Besides, during the character creation process, you‚Äôll notice new portraits and voices, not to mention the variety of colours to customise appearance of the protagonist. Speaking of which, now you can choose from a few additional classes for your hero, whereas the original ones already have their respective kits. Another significant novelty is the Story Mode difficulty level, which is just perfect for new players, simply because it works as a sort of ""god mode"". Apart from that, Beamdog changed sprites of many items, reorganised journal and character record tabs as well as added really useful mechanics such as highlighting objects and containers, quick looting and screen zooming. Also, now the game pauses whenever you open the inventory tab, which is a huge relief. Surprised? Well, in the original [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] if you opened up your inventory during a fight, everything was still in motion. Finally, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that now, when you travel between locations, loading screens appear no longer.

Ok, now about the controversial part - [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] introduces four new playable characters and three of them have their own unique questlines with a few new tracks composed by Sam Hulick. The only problem is they stand out from the rest of the recruitable companions way too much with their dialogues and classes, however, they‚Äôre rather solid in general. Well, at least those unique quests yield some useful items. Oh, I almost forgot about [i]The Black Pits[/i], which is a sort of separate adventure with arena battles. Yeah, I almost forgot to write about it simply because it‚Äôs mediocre at the utmost.

All in all, [i]Baldur‚Äôs Gate: Enhanced Edition[/i] is a well-made, solid remaster of a legendary, classic cRPG that was a worldwide bestseller at its time. [i]Enhanced Edition[/i] gives a second life to one of my personal favourite games and I simply can‚Äôt say no to Imoen, Jaheira, Khalid, Dynaheir and, of course, Minsc and Boo. So, in the end, 9/10 would gather my party again. And, lastly, thanks for reading my review.",1549651333,1651918422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nor did I appreciate the subtle yet overwhelming information provided by each item, contributing to the overall lore, that tells multiple stories about nobles, monsters, towns and history if you just pay the slightest amount of attention. 
This game truly spoiled me as it was quite far ahead of its time. It set a rather unfair precedent for other adventure/fantasy/DnD games to follow, as the devs were obsessed with DnD prior to creating this and the main dev had read every single printed book, magazine or general information about Faer√ªn and put all of that knowledge into making the perfect game.

Each area has side quests, both self contained and far reaching, seemingly random events, absolutely brilliant background art that even to this day has never really been reached in both quality and detail and most areas are used in the main quest too. 

Each magical item has a backstory, some unrelated to anything to do with your adventure and some only seemingly unrelated, yet brilliantly injected with information one might find useful and fascinating. 

You'll start on an adventure after witnessing your foster fathers death, seeking aid from his friends that will lead you to a country wide iron shortage, orchestrated by a corrupt merchant guild, yet somehow seemingly intertwining with your own personal journey 

This game was always intended to have a sequel and you'll find yourself level capping at 9 (higher with patches) but that was always intended to be half of the journey.

All in all this game still holds up in every way, even the graphics are beautiful to this day.",1651636360,1651636360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game runs on very old school D&D rules, which are very restrictive. When I won a tough fight, I never felt like I won due to any strategic planning on my part, it was all just a roll of the dice. Characters die at the drop of a hat, and there's nothing you can do to get an edge in combat, other than re-loading your save every two seconds and praying the gods rule in your favour. 

Maybe back in the 90's, this game was a masterpiece. But when compared to contemporaries like Pillars of Eternity and Divinity, it just doesn't hold up.

The story, the open world nature of it, trying to explore and understand what was going on... I played through it many times when I was younger, and I had a hankering to do it again. I'm not sure if I've seen all the 'enhancements' so far in this version. There are certainly a few extra NPCs to add to the party, and they've reworked the Inventory interface to make it much clearer what your stats are, and what different equipment does to your stats (young me would have appreciated that as the first time I played it, I had no clue!). They've improved the journal a bit as well, it doesn't look as pretty but it keeps track of your quests in a bit of an easier way. That's a good and a bad thing, as it makes it feel 'gamier' and slightly less immersive, but it is convenient. So I'm on the fence about that change.  

Overall, I always thought that Baldur's Gate 2 really improved on this one in terms of visuals and gameplay.

Every now and then a game comes along that completely defines (or redefines) a genre of game and Baldur's Gate is one such masterpiece that is one of the most important games of all time as it defined the cRPG genre.

PLOT:  Good but not exceptional.

COMBAT:  Game uses AD&D 2nd Edition rules set.

GRAPHICS & SOUND:  Adequate but dated.  There is no getting away from the fact that this is based on a 20+ year old game.

REPLAY VALUE:  Excellent ,may different companions and side quests.

ISSUES AND BUGS:  None.  Works ‚Äústraight out of the box‚Äù with no messing around and appears to be completely bug free!  In over 130 hours of game play I have yet to have a single issue.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND TRADING CARDS:  Steam achievements and trading cards for those interested.  There is an awful lot of achievements in this game (129 in total).  Many require the Siege of Dragonspear DLC to complete.

VALUE FOR MONEY:  The base game isn't too bad but by the time Siege of Dragonspear is added it gets a bit pricey.  Look out for bundles and offers in sales.

LONG REVIEW
Every now and then a game comes along that completely defines (or redefines) a genre of game and Baldur's Gate is one such masterpiece that is one of the most important games of all time.  Yes, it is is 20+ years old and does show it's age but this is the game which defined the cRPG genre.  I also accept that it since been surpassed by Baldur's Gate 2, Planescape Torment (still the best cRPG of all time in my opinion) and more recently the Dragon Age, Pillars of Eternity and Divinity series of games but it is definitely still worth playing whether it is your first time or you are returning to the game having played the original.

There is a good amount of content here.

BALDUR'S GATE.
The original Baldur's Gate gate game but updated the the Baldur's Gate 2 engine and numerous bug fixes (mainly to the background mechanics of the game).

TALES OF THE SWORD COAST.
The original expansion to  Baldur's Gate. Again  updated the the Baldur's Gate 2 engine and debugged.

SIEGE OF DRAGONSPEAR.
This is a separate DLC and not part of the base game.  It does offer genuinely new content (a bolt on adventure) that can be played as a follow on after the main game is completed or as a stand alone game.

THE BLACK PITS.
An arena style combat game.  No further comments as its not really my cup of tea.

With Pillars of Eternity and Torment: Tides of Numenera this style of gaming, having fallen out of favour, has made a comeback.  I think this is due to the fact that, whilst graphics moved on and games became more visually appealing the actual gameplay often suffered and there was a whole era of games that looked visually stunning but were real dogs to actually play.  (Whoever thought quick time events were a good idea should have been strangled at birth!).  Although playability is one of the strengths of the game people new to the games (as opposed to old hands returning) might struggle a bit at first picking up the vagaries of the 2nd edition AD&D rules set.

In terms of what the enhanced edition offers over the original other than the ability to run seamlessly on modern hardware and support for modern screen resolutions I'm not sure most of the other added features really add a lot for the game to be honest.  The ‚Äúauto loot‚Äù function is nice and the capacity of containers (gem pouches etc.) has been significantly increased so inventory management is less of a chore.  Personally I couldn't care less about the multiplayer options.

The difficulty curve in spot on with no nasty difficulty ‚Äúspikes‚Äù that some games suffer from.  It may be advisable to go to the end game and face Sarevok before doing the expansion areas accessible from Ulgoth's Beard.  I played the full game including the expansion before facing Sarevok and with the extra equipment and XP found him to be a bit of an anticlimatic walkover.

The game works ‚Äústraight out of the box‚Äù with no messing around with settings and is exceptionally stable.  In over 130 hours of game play I have yet to encounter a single issue.

Overall definitely worth picking up.  The base game isn't too badly priced but by the time Siege of Dragonspear is added it gets a bit pricey.  Look out for bundles and offers in sales.

When I say it crashes frequently I mean every 1-2 load screens it locks up and I've never had this much trouble with another game.

One day I started the game and it stopped crashing for a couple days and when I was able to get it run stable I didn't shut it down for fear of it going back to crashing. For two days without shutting the game off and just pausing and alt-tabbing out it ran fine. It seems to be related to auto-save or steam access. I have tried turning off auto-save, cloud saves used offline mode but nothing seems to work. This seems like a very solvable issue but still makes the game very unplayable 90% of the time.

Runs smooth and plays well when it works but it just crashes so frequently it's hard to justify the purchase even at the low price. It's very unfortunate since I loved the original Baldur's gate.

This is a fine game but in the nearly 25 years since its release and when I played it to completion it has been eclipsed in the genre in almost every way and still sits at a $20 price point when not on sale, far too much for what amounts to a genre prototype.


Taken at face value, Baldur's Gate is perfectly fine. It's an isometric CRPG adapting the rules of AD&D which allows for an automated dungeon crawl experience. I remember playing it as a kid and it was great then, but that's because it was one of the genre progenitors. Looking at it through the lens of over 20 years of genre evolution has shown how much subsequent titles have raised the bar, despite owing a lot to this one for laying a lot of the groundwork.

For the higher-level RPG aspects such as party members, story, quests, etc., the game is incredibly shallow and unsatisfying. Nearly all quests are returning an item an NPC lost. Party members have very basic introductions, simple quests, and little beyond their introduction and quest dialog, almost never talking beyond their confirmation or selection voice barks. Almost every NPC around the world has little or nothing to say with barely any dialog trees to explore, and an overwhelming majority of those that talk to you have 2 or 3 options that all lead to a fight. The world is devoid of interesting locations or things and even the dungeons are fairly bland.

For the vast majority of the game, however, the combat is what you'll be engaging with, and that's at least the highest point of the game. Throughout the entirety of the genre, I feel that real-time-with-pause is incredibly poor and turn-based combat is irrefutably better. Unfortunately very few of these games offer a choice between them and so here you're stuck with the RTWP option. There's not a lot to it, you click on the enemies and then your characters go to attack them, do so, kill them, and you repeat it for 40 hours. Again, as an early release in the isometric CRPG genre, there's a lot missing that has become standard. Melee characters have little in the way of skills and abilities, instead relying on potions/scrolls to do things for them and then proceeding to swing repeatedly at whatever's in front of them. Even thieves and rangers and anything else you use as ranged is very similarly restricted. Playing as a magic user as the main character, at low levels there are so few spells to use that there are few options for even a caster. It's not bad, but it's not good.

Finally, for the base content, there's the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion content. It's geared towards absolutely high-level parties towards the end game and even then it's almost overtuned. Playing with a high-level thief with dozens of points in trap detection and disarming about half the traps in this content were insurmountable. The enemies and encounters were similarly difficult and occasionally reliant on special damage that was incredibly uncommon to find. Quite honestly if it were possible to remove this content from the game I would have done so. As it is, it's thankfully easy to avoid completely.

Beyond that, the Enhanced Edition has plenty of technical improvements or game updates, some are fantastic, some are horrible. Obviously, the fact that it simply runs on a modern system is a massive positive. It also supports 21:9 resolutions out of the box and everything overall looks sharper. Fixing 20-year-old bugs is also an obvious unquestionable win. The less positive options are the additions. There are new NPC's and their related locations that don't mesh with the game well (at all really), aren't enjoyable in their writing or personality, but thankfully can be avoided almost entirely. The EE also has included some ""advanced AI"" scripts for party members which I cannot recommend turning off fast enough. All of these scripts cause the AI to attack on sight, often meaning encounters cannot be taken at your pace or by your planning. They also use offensive spells and abilities even on enemies they're not needed for and use defensive spells even outside of combat and far away from an encounter, wasting them for no benefit. There's also the new Black Pits combat-centric content but with my aversion to this genre's (and in particular this game's) real-time-with-pause combat, I cannot recommend it in any capacity.


Overall the original Baldur's Gate is an okay game, but it is nearly impossible to recommend after so many years of advancement in the genre. If you do feel the need to play this title make sure to grab it at a deep discount. Even under the idea of ""completionist"" or a prelude to the sequel, a one-paragraph summation of this game is all you need before you start Baldur's Gate II: Shadows Of Amn. Having played about three hours of the sequel, even that short introduction makes that title infinitely easier to recommend due to how much further along all aspects of the game have evolved in that short time span.",1646320543,1646320543,False,55,3,0.614831745624542236,0,True,False,False

Graphics are not as great as they could have been for a 1998 game 
(fixed my original statement due to a troll who only focused on my original line here about how bad they were, thank you Prez)

Game play is.. blah

I should like this game, but its very... I dont know the words to use. 

I have been playing D&D for over 20 years, someone with a THACO of 6 does not miss 4 out of 5 times, and someone with an AC of -7 doesnt get hit 4 out of 5 times. 

The quests are not geared for the correct level, for example I am playing a level 7 fighter and I am put up against 6 to 20 enemies at the same time.. then I wonder why I die a lot. 

The quests are very vague and offer very little guidance as to what you need to do, and a lot of it just seems like your running back and forth constantly instead of being able to just keep moving forward.. 

example QUEST ""kill the mage in the temple"" [you travel across the world to go kill the mage] QUEST UPDATE ""I have killed the mage, now I must go back to Bob and let him know"" [travel across the world to tell Bob] QUEST UPDATE ""I have told Bob who now wants me to go back to the mage to make sure hes dead [Travel back across the world] QUEST UPDATE ""I have verified the mage is dead, now I have to go back to Bob"" 

Such a huge waste of time.. On top of that you get all these little quests.. in which you have to battle odds where you are VERY outnumbered and VERY out leveled!! like wizards who just repeatedly cast ""confuse"" or ""fear"" that always hit you even though you drink potions that are suppose to prevent it.. I also have party members who, for what ever screwed up reason that I cannot figure out, cannot use their weapons all of a sudden? (Corbin in my game cannot use her bow, no idea why, its equip but I cannot get her to select it.. she has 1 buff on her.. she has arrows and shes not over encumbered..  magic resistance which apparently does NOTHING cause she still gets ""confused"" or ""feared"") 

Now, I am sure your gonna get the people on here who say ""oh this was so boring, I beat the whole game in 6 minutes and was able to level up with ease and yadda yadda yadda.. I dont understand why I am struggling with this game, but MY game is just plain BS with the impossible odds, the fact that enemy wizards can just cast ""Fear"" and ""confuse"" again and again and again and it seems like it take 2 minutes in real time before its gone.. and NOTHING can prevent it.. then they put 30 to 50 enemies on you all at once but dont give you real opportunity to gain the levels necessary to actually be able to fight that many.. I probably wont put much more time into this.. I want something I can actually have a shot at enjoying and I just find myself more confused and pissed off than actually having fun.. Gonna start from scratch one more time, then its getting uninstalled and never looked at again.. games should be fun.. not made to intentionally piss you off due to glitches and impossible odds..



[UPDATE] sad to say I dont like this game, tried again last night and after spending about 30 to 40 minutes on one quest I finally had to look it up online, shouldnt have to do that for games.

I suddenly had the urge to play some of the old school single player games from the 80's.  Yes, very different than what you youngsters might be playing but there is just something very attractive and fun about being able to control a party of 6 with summons that don't take up any of those 6 slots.  

You can pick a pre generated party, or roll all new 6 characters for your own party or mix it up.  Also, once you get going in game you can pick up npc characters but you need to drop your own to keep it at 6. Dropped characters from the party remain where you leave them and can be grabbed again later.  I myself rolled 6 of my own characters but then swapped my rogue for lmeon, and npc,  which wasn't bad but wished i had stayed with mine.

I love the fact i can pause at any point i wish other than when aving dialog with NPC's but then it's pretty much paused anyways then.  But to be able to switch up how i am going about a combat situation at any moment is great.

Yes there is alot of side quest but dont kick yourself in the ass trying to complete everyone of them, but i had fun completing most.  It's slow at first, but things pick up once you learn areas and how to handle ceertain creatures.  Save game ALOT so you can come back to a moment earlier than your last death.  Every time i was about to leave an area i save, after a big fight i saved, after moving along a map so far i saved.

Graphics is limited to making character look at you want, but its an old game and for me i was 100% satified with how the over all graphics was for such an old game.  Spells casts look great, can see arrows fly and hit, blood and gore.

Once done with all 3 of these i'll probably do it again with a different character set up and stick to my own all the way thru as much as possible.

It has taken me a decade to finally manage a single finished playthrough of roundabout 35-ish hours of this game. With the CRPG genre having experienced a revival as of recent years, beginning with Pillars of Eternity through Disco Elysium and now Pathfinder; Baldur‚Äôs Gate still stands out as this juggernaut of a game and while I have never played the original version, I can kind of see where a lot of the nostalgia seems to be coming from, but likewise it‚Äôs a pretty rough game compared to what players of modern games of the genre may be used to.

On a technical side, the game ran largely fine. I did not experience any major bugs, glitches or similar. Abilities and whatnot seemed to be working fine as well. Although I did experience two crashes within only a few hours of trying the Multiplayer. There are a plethora of frustrating gameplay quirks too, which may very well be attributed to how old the game is but nevertheless are worth mentioning: Most notably, the horrendous pathing causing parties of any size to regularly get stuck on map geometry. This is particularly an issue on harder difficulties ‚Äì and also during the later stages of the game, when more precise actions and managing your party is required to overcome harder fights, although given the relatively low level cap of BG 1, this will present a larger critique for Baldur‚Äôs Gate 2. 

Aside from that, this Enhanced Edition of the game has been in the center of a fair bit of controversy, ranging from UI changes to the inclusion of new party members that are often mentioned as feeling somewhat out-of-place. While I haven‚Äôt bought Siege of Dragonspear, which seems to be generally accepted as the worst offender, I did not feel like this was the case and reasonably enjoyed playing around with E.E. content.

Gameplay-wise, BG doesn‚Äôt feel like the hardest game to get into. Despite concepts like THAC0 being often mentioned as roadblocks for new players, BG also makes a solid effort of simplifying your character management ‚Äì from very simple UI design of color-coding positive/negative changes in your attributes like AC, to managing your different spellbooks; Essentially, BG does not feel any harder to grasp than any of its modern contemporaries. Spells do have a tendency to become fairly complicated in their descriptions but as with the pathing, this does not really become an issue until the very late stages of the game. 

Where BG does feel different, however, is in the way the game‚Äôs story is structured; And is likely the biggest factor in the decision of whether it is worth trying today. This is a twofold problem as well: Firstly, BG 1 is not in itself a thoroughly finished story and instead has an open end that directly leads into BG 2. Secondly, the game is incredibly tonally inconsistent. This latter point can be either incredibly charming or immersion breaking depending on your experience with DnD as a tabletop. Without spoiling any specific quests, what BG often does is flip-flop between humorously written sidequests while also trying to lead the player through a campaign that may have them commit mass-murder within the first third of the story. 

This often ends up feeling a little odd, even amateurish from a storytelling perspective, but does capture this very human impression of regular DnD campaigns. Seeing the staff having modeled for the original character portraits, or sneaking in some snarky jokes into the PC‚Äôs possible responses and also the voice acting being overly dramatic heavily leans against modern trends of featuring stricter and consistent storytelling. 

This tone, together with comparatively extremely large maps and combat encounters almost on a minute-to-minute basis has the first half of the game, or about twenty-hours of content at times feeling more than an ARPG akin to Diablo rather than what people may have grown to expect from the genre. BG 2 is fairly similar in this, doubling down on earlier and more grandiose dungeon crawls, while also becoming more sophisticated and consistently serious in its writing. 

Another notable difference to both BG 2 and other genre contemporaries is how companions are handled. BG 1 features a fairly large cast of almost thirty characters. Naturally, one result of having such a sizable selection is that this game only features very lukewarm interactions with said characters, like extremely short quests that are often tied to their permanent recruitment / availability, or party banter. However, what is interesting and I have not seen any other game try to thoroughly attempt, is to create cross-companion conflict. Usually these kinds of games tend to tie the contentedness of the PC‚Äôs companions only to the player‚Äôs own actions ‚Äì rather than their choice of whom to travel with. Here, however, if you take companions that have personal conflict with one another, either due to their alignment, or actual personality, companions may actively turn on each other. I do like this kind of interaction and coupled with the more in-depth writing of companions in Baldur‚Äôs Gate 2, think that it made roleplaying my characters a lot more interesting, albeit also more dependent on my own creativity / head-canon.

+ Generally stable; No outstanding bugs, or glitches. 
+ Competent and beginner friendly UI; Although somewhat lacking in in-game help during character creation.
+ Active community; Easy-to-access modding tools.

+/- 30-40 hour long campaign
+/- Pacing may alienate players; Little connection to the larger plot until the last chapters of the game.
+/- Large map design and over-reliance on enemy encounters may make certain stretches of the game a slog and contrast the heavier text-focus during the later chapters.
+/- Cliffhanger ending that requires continued play through Baldur‚Äôs Gate 2 and onward to properly appreciate the story.
+/- Companion interactions (Aside from E.E. additions) may feel lackluster under modern RPG expectations.
+/- Tonal inconsistencies that may turn certain players off of the already thinly stretched story.

- Horrendous pathing issues that are exasperated by prominent dungeon-design decisions; i.e. extremely claustrophobic corridors prohibiting proper party control.
- Difficulties in Multiplayer connectivity / crashes.
- Gameplay suffers heavily during the latter stages of the game due to the inability to control the flow of combat over pausing; No distinct overview over turn/round-order;
- Inability to experience the rule of Tiax‚Äôs duke of manure as an Ending.

I am not sure whether I enjoyed Baldur‚Äôs Gate. It‚Äôs certainly a unique experience and it‚Äôs worth a playthrough just to see how the CRPG genre has developed, but it‚Äôs also an absolute slog to actually play through and I am not willing to believe that this is entirely down to personal preference rather than actual design flaws. Large maps and frequent combat encounters lend the game a Diablo-esque feeling and leans well into the adventuring fantasy of the DnD tabletop. The writing is equally ambitious as it is charmingly stupid; depending on the player to know when to take it seriously and when to just roll with the snappy remarks of a what often feels like a middling DM. Beware that you‚Äôre not buying the kind of immersive experience that you may have come to expect from modern titles, and that Baldur‚Äôs Gate 1 is not a complete experience without it‚Äôs sequel and, with a bit of patience, it can be a pretty good experience even today.",1644909351,1644909393,True,7,0,0.639308631420135498,0,True,False,False

The game itself stems from D&D 2e, so many of the innovations added later, like feats, aren't in the game; so you'll be choosing a main class or maybe one of their subclasses, which are largely divided along racial lines, & mostly be leveling those or multi-classing (with which humans have a special advantage). It also uses THAC0, meaning the LOWER you armor class, the better.
And using this old ruleset also means things will be very difficult, sometimes your characters will get crit-ed & explode into hamburger meat, or get turned to stone, or get hypnotized & attack your other party members; some encounters will be borderline unfair, that'll just be the nature of it.

The story is troupe-y high fantasy, the kind of old fashioned story that I find refreshing compared to modern fair that work hard to ""be taken seriously"", as if such things are inherently juvenile.

You also can't run away, because he follows you into other areas. There is no warning about him, either. But surely you can defeat him. No, he stops you from being able to control your character and then bursts you down with magic missiles. 

So I looked up how to beat him, because this doesn't seem right.
Well, earlier in the story I met two extremely shifty people who were trying to rope me into some kind of scheme involving a mine. The game threw an NPC at me whose only purpose was to warn me of them, and sure enough, they talked just like snake oil salesmen. 
""Great,"" I thought. ""I mastered that encounter by not falling for it!"" Later I learned that the mine was producing bad iron, so I felt confirmed in my suspicions. 
Well, the joke's on me, because you need those two to beat that fight with the assassin!

Baldur's Gate is an old game. Beamdog modernized it in several ways, as I understand it, but it's best to go into it with the mindset that it's a game from 1998. The game systems are converted from 2e AD&D, and have plenty of clunk as a result. Dialogue and character choices abound, but what was a staggering ability to change the Realms and companions around you nearly 25 years ago may feel somewhat limiting today. I'd suggest treating the game partially as a sandbox, and to treat the clunky or limiting aspects as prompts- let your imagination fill in the rest.

The story of Baldur's Gate revolves around the ward of a fellow named Gorion. Growing up in Candlekeep, the largest repository of lore on the Sword Coast, their peaceful life is shattered when Gorion tells them to prepare for a journey and leave. Along the Ward's adventure, they'll meet colorful and fleshed-out characters. They'll use their unique abilities to slay monsters, decide the fate of the innocent and guilty alike, and unearth a mystery baked into their very essence. The story is intriguing, and the characters are interactive and well-written. The companion quests are some of the best parts of the game.

The combat is a conversion of 2e AD&D. It's real-time with pause, and the harder fights are going to require some micro-managing of your party (or at least, they did for me). I never found the difficulty in Baldur's Gate 1 to be a roadblock, but I also never engaged with it very heavily. It didn't serve to further the experience for me, but it was inoffensive. If you want to engage with it on a highly strategic level, you'll need an understanding of THAC0 (To-Hit-Armor-Class-Zero), saving throws, and spellcasting. I personally wasn't interested in engaging with the system this way, but the game didn't generally force me to. I played a Half-Orc fighter, which was a highly effective and simple build.

It should be mentioned that your character in Baldur's Gate can be carried onto Baldur's Gate II, and your save information from Baldur's Gate II goes straight into Baldur's Gate: Throne of Bhaal. I actually gave up on my playthrough a short way into Throne of Bhaal, after spending several years with my character going through Baldur's Gate I and II (at a leisurely pace, the games aren't that long). Throne of Bhaal becomes way more combat focused (and way harder), and the story drops in quality bit. In fact, It might be more accurate, actually, to say there was way less story. There was occasional dialogue and cutscenes that seemed designed to ferry me to the next combat encounter  This is due to time constraints when it was developed, if I'm understanding correctly. Regardless, it sucked to suddenly have the difficulty jump so high after 200 hours of playing. Do with that experience as you will.

Beamdog's additions are fantastic, by the way. Neera is a personal favorite, and the added romances really make Baldur's Gate feel lilke a more modern BioWare game.

Personally, my greatest joy in playing Baldur's Gate is taking note of the origins of some of BioWare's games. BioWare games have been favorites of mine since I was a young boy, with KotOR, and I've enjoyed almost everything they've made since. It's an absolute joy to see the origins of KotOR's D&D-inspired mechanics, and Dragon Age and Mass Effect's multi-game world states.

If you're curious about Baldur's Gate, it's worth a try. I'd make sure you buy it on sale, though. It's got a lot of charm, and a lot of intrigue, but even with Beamdog's enhancements, it's a 25 year old series. There's clunk there's issues, and $20 is maybe a little steep. It goes on sale very frequently, though! I'd recommend giving it a try, and seeing how you like it!
As a note, if you like Baldur's Gate, or even if you enjoyed parts of it but had issues with the greater whole, you should try it's modern contemporaries! Pathfinder, Divinity, and the like are all worth looking at.

++ Characters are well-written (mostly) and interacts with the alignment of your character in basic ways. 
++ Dialogue is often very well written, witty, and sometimes funny.

+ Diverse selection of spells and items keeps combat fresh (though no where near something like Divinity)

-- If you aren't familiar with old school DnD systems like THAC0, this game is going to be a steep learning curve

Now, some might think that many people feel about BG in this way due to nostalgia or elitism. But here are some arguments why BG is really better than most modern RPGs:

1. BG is based on D&D. Even though more complicated than your usual open world RPG, having a rule system like this is quite rewarding. First, every stat can be calculated easily and nothing is hidden from the player (unlike modern RPGs). So when you fail, you always know WHY you failed. Secondly, the D&D system ads a level of complexity that makes BG worth playing several times. Thirdly, combat allows many tactical possibilities and is quite challenging (unless you use exploits of course)

2. BG does not take you by the hand and still, you always know what you have to do. This is a balance that not many games achieve.

3. The game world is huge. Even though it consist of different maps, the world is interconnected in such a way that it feels like an open world. It gives you a sense of wonder because behind every corner, there could be a new adventure. While modern RPGs get boring very fast by following fixed rules of what you might find at a point of interest (a collectible, a quest, some other repetitive chore), BG manages to surprise you.

3. The story is one of the most epic stories in video game history. The Forgotten Realms setting, while full of cliches, gives a rich lore that fits it perfectly

4. You play with companions. This makes the game more tactical and motivates several playthroughs. Furthermore, the characters are quite likable. 

Unlike the sequel, BG 1 has some flaws: the dialogues are poor. Some of the areas feel quite empty and could have been smaller. Finally, if you are a new player, the game might be too hard.

- Very close mechanics to Fallout 1 and 2.

IMO one of the cornerstone series that ties the mental imagery we come up with in pen-and-paper gaming together with the fascinating graphical representations/interpretations of the game devs--and actually written in concert with D&D rule sets. Nothing is perfect, so it is said, but this software makes a pretty darn good vanilla game. There's so much love out there for the entire compendium--the number and type of mods is incredible! Beamdog did a great job of breathing the life back into these titles. It was harder to run the old floppy copies in emulators than seemed worth it. if you don't know the Baldur's Gate lineage and you do like isometric-perspective computer RPGs, then I think you'll do yourself a favor by dipping into this library.

The overarching story is well-written, the characters, dialogs and interactions are great fun, but after a well-paced start in terms of plot progression, you get stuck in a rut (chapters 3-5) exploring large area maps at a dreadfully slow pace with no way to speed things up (all walk, no run), and you are pretty much forced into it in order to get the money, items, and to level up if you want to survive until you can unlock the interesting bits of the main story.

The side-quests in each area are very basic, and a lot of the combat is against small mobs of low- to medium-level creatures. Rather than 'Dungeons & Dragons', it felt like 'Wilderness & Pest Control' at times... This was all fixed in Baldur's Gate 2, so if you're looking for less exploration and more story + engaging side quests, you can skip this one.

This game uses AD&D (aka Second Edition D&D) rules. I was an avid player of pen & paper AD&D as a kid, but this reminded me how imperfect and weirdly balanced those rules were when they first came out... At least in P&P, we could improve on the rules, adopt the numerous modifications published later in fanzines, start our characters at level 5... The video game follows the core rule set, which means that all of its shortcomings can be felt here. Plus it's a truncated version of the original rules (e.g. unlike in the P&P, Wisdom and Intelligence are not used for saving throws here, so unless you're a class that depends on those, they are useless abilities; Charisma is used a bit in interactions, but unless you have 16 or more, the points are wasted...), which is all the more frustrating.

So prepare yourself to be patient‚Äîand die a lot on the harder difficulty settings‚Äîin the beginning, with no way to skip ahead. You will not have much fun until level 5 (especially with the spell casting and rogue classes; Warrior classes get all the fun) and progression in the beginning is rather slow‚Äîturning into a crawl if you multi- or dual-class, as you will be splitting your xp between the various classes.

Bottomline: If you're gonna get it for the nostalgia factor or for story continuity, go for it. Otherwise, ask yourself how much time do you want to spend watching your party trudge through pixelated landscapes, and whether you will find it soothing or aggravating... Depends on the day for me.",1642357249,1642360345,False,1,0,0.456273794174194336,0,True,False,False

While this game series is well known as classic games, the entry level of this game to the new players are actually very high.  D&D 2nd edition carries a lot of concepts that is very different compared to the latest generation of video games and some of the concepts are difficult to digest even for players familiar with latest edition of D&D rules.  Examples are concepts like THAC0, Dual Class.  These concepts are abolished since D&D 3rd edition.

Spellcasting related concepts add another layer of difficulty to understand the game mechanics.  Any one who read the spell descriptions would feel lost easily.  Casting time is a numerical number;  Spell effect lasting in rounds, turns, and seconds, which the length of a round or a turn is never explained in game;  Saving throw mechanism is not explained as well.  So basically the developer expected the players to be very familiar with the whole D&D 2nd edition rule books.  This in my opinion is the biggest hurdle new players need to cross.

Next challenge is the RTwP system.  This is a system more difficult to understand than turn-based systems, but it carries its own advantages.  While turn-based combats requires the players to control every character for every action, in the RTwP system the players can just buff the whole team with one or two spells then sit down and watch the team to eliminate all the enemies.  So RTwP is a system that is friendly to experienced players, but unfriendly to new players, especially compared to turn-based system. 

The game‚Äôs main story line is excellent.  Side quests are plenty and interesting.  Teammates are fun and charismatic.  Interactions between teammates (includes you) are amazing.  Romance options are not bad.  Plenty of challenging fights to enjoy.  The whole game experience is very satisfying.

Although this game's main story line does not change, it still has a lot of replay value.  The player can test out difference character builds, try different team components, make different choices, use different spells, etc.  

If you are wondering how I played for so many hours, I have been replaying the game with additional restrictions.  I set two additional criteria for my runs:  1) solo  2) no-reload.  No-reload carries a Role Play factor and a much higher level of stress.  It presents a challenge that if you are really in Faerun, what will you do?  While in a normal run you can handle all kinds of situations easily, in a solo no-reload run, you have to think very carefully about how to handle situations that normally is not handled by your class.  

For example, when playing a non-thief class, how to handle a trap with a domination spell?  A failed saving throw for the spell in a solo run means death instantly, and for a solo no-reload run means the end of the run.  Try the luck, or buff up saving throw, or summon minions to be the sacrificial lamb, or use a protection scroll, or drink a mind protection potion, or use a charge of a necklace, or simply don‚Äôt take the risk and walk away.  There are plenty choices and only in a solo no-reload run, you will seriously weight all the available options and decide carefully.

I have successfully complete the solo no-load runs on insane with berserkers, bards, sorcerors, fighters, archers, paladins, and several multiclass characters.  These runs give the most satisfying gaming experience so far, and I will recommend the experienced players to try.  In these runs, you will re-learn your spells, portions, scrolls, weapons, items.  You will have a new understanding about different classes and play styles.  

The DLC siege of dragonspear is newly created by Beamdog team.  The quality of the DLC is decent and worth to play through at least once.  

Achievements in this game are very challenging.  The biggest challenge is the Legacy of Bhaal difficulty.  This is only recommend for very experienced players.  Especially in the earlier stages, the game difficult is at least 5 times higher than insane difficulty.  New players please do not start on this difficulty, it will ruin your game experiences no matter how good you are with other PC games. 

DLC related achievements tests more on patience than skills.  The choices made in earlier chapters of the DLC will have impact on the final chapters which will affect your achievements.  Some of the DLC achievements are very easy to miss without a walk through.",1506226527,1640656629,True,2,0,0.502190351486206055,0,True,False,False

Elsewhere (the app store, on my old Mac), I had put in at least ~40 hours- and that was rushing the game. The story is very engaging, with interesting plot twists. The combat is clunky, but sort of lends to the games' charm. I love the NPCs, especially Minsc. He's my favourite. 

It's not all pros, though. As this is reliant on the old AD&D system, the game is lethal by design. I save scummed my way through my first playthrough, and had to as combat was very difficult. Not necessarily a con, but be warned going in. That being said, there is a game difficulty where it is literally impossible for you to die, so there's that.

A pet peeve of mine was that, despite all the great writing, I personally found the ending very anticlimactic. It was a disappointing change in quality, and a shame that it effected my overall enjoyment of the game.

(this isn't about BG, just about EE)

Many features make it much more user-friendly and enjoyable than the original:
* sum calculation on character creation (adding the stats was tedious in the original)
* item/gem/spell containers 
* auto-pick dropped items (very useful)
* max-xp-per-level and auto-learn-spell options (I hated saving/loading 100 times)
* 80 arrows per slot, 
* more gems/scrolls per slot,
* can now hold a bow as an alternate weapon config, without removing the shield for the 1-handed config. (still can't switch between dual-wielding and sword-shield, but that's OK.)
* F/M/T now has two weapon slots (hooray!)
* better journal/map marking
* nwn-style tab-item-highlighting 
* hard-core unpause on inventory has been removed.
* a few new characters, some of them interesting, namely Dorn and Baeloth, (while the monk s*cks, both personally and as a class < lvl 14, which is unreachable in BG1).
* better graphics resolutions (the base that every EE offers and, some of them, nothing more)
If they'd gone so far as to port back v3 rules (even as an option), it would be perfect. (now that we've seen them, v1 are intolerable in comparison)

And a few have surprisingly become worse: 
* character development, 
* then new character sheet page is somehow less functional.
* travel durations are now visible only arbitrarily
* intrusive auto-enabled auto-profiles (I wonder who wants spellcasters to empty their slots on the first wolf they see)
* BG2-weapon-proficiencies (guys, those are only meaningful for the ~lvl 20 characters of BG2).
* the cap stays to tales-161k 
* more limitations in dual-classing (no specialist classes, no BG2 rules this time)
* all the cinematics have become worse, 
* spellbook is less functional (scrolling is annoying if you knew the spells)
* somehow old characters are not importable (twasn't that difficult).
* weapon/spell slots could have been even more now that it isn't 800x600.
* still 6-chars per party (I'd like to see this as an option, in case in my 1000th run I'd like to see some interactions of characters otherwise unsuitable for any purpose)

- The system is too complex to understand. THACO sucks.
- The game is so unbalanced at the beginning.  I've read that it GETS good, but you have to slog through the beginning to get there.
- So many things that are not explained (like Charisma in conversations and so on.)
- There are many small things I take for granted now that are missing here (such as item comparisons.)
- Fights are decided by a single attack.  When that's combined with level 1 and 2 characters being wimps, your party gets wiped... you load... get wiped... you load... get wiped... you load... you defeat the enemy.  Save scumming in a game sucks, but it's the only way to progress in this game.

There's the more obvious graphics and clunky engine because this game is so old, but I could look past those things if the other issues weren't so glaring.  I will never beat Baldur's Gate 1.


I'm glad this game came out, as it paved the way for future cRPGs that I really liked.

This game is everything that a roleplaying game should NOT be. It's tedious: a walking simulator full of fetch quests where most of your time is spent on inventory management. It's boring - unless you like all that walking, I guess -, with two-dimensional NPCs, crap dialogue and a storyline that failed to really draw me in. On top of that it's quite railroady, and there's no ""open world"" to explore. If you're looking to get to know the character you created, fill them with life and tell their own unique story... look elsewhere.

The game is also just not fun to play. In true D&D style, it's all about fighting - and quests, but those are invariably about fighting, or fetching items (for which you'll have to fight). 

And the fights aren't even particularly fun, and you'll find yourself quick-saving all the time because any random encounter might kill you. In fact, your safest bet is to scout out the terrain one step at a time - foes 
you cannot see also do not see you and remain utterly oblivious to the carnage happening right next to them. If you feel that this is unrealistic and distracts from the immersion, tough luck.

FWIW you're also well-advised to save ALL. THE. TIME. Another meta-strategy you'll quickly pick up is, after stumbling into a fight you cannot handle, to reload the save you made five seconds before and try again, armed with the knowledge of the looming encounter - which your character doesn't have, but hey, who cares about realism. You'll probably have to do this a couple of times until you get lucky with the die rolls. But hey, reloading is free.

I would usually set a very low bar for a game I only paid about 2.50 for, and wouldn't complain if I'd gotten even one hour of fun out of it. As it is, though, I not only lost an (admittedly modest) amount of money, I also lost about eight hours of my life that I'll not get back. I would've much preferred to keep both, and I can only advise anyone who has NOT played this game yet to stay away from it - unless you've already played other D&D-based games and know that you're OK with all this.",1638563662,1638563662,False,4,2,0.487514346837997437,0,True,False,False

Within the first 5 minutes of playing the phrase ""Candlekeep People's Revolutionary Army"" appeared on my screen.  I hear that the ""D L C"" they added is equally terrible.

Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a blast. Against the advice of the game, I played without first going through the tutorial, but many aspects of the game that I was initially confused on (mainly HUD elements) were easily figured out after a few minutes of exploring. 

Graphically, this game is quite impressive. I gather that it is a remake of a game that came out in '98. If this is how it looked back then, hats off to the graphical artists. The HUD, as I alluded to above, is rather confusing if you haven't encountered anything like it before. I've played Tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, and the Divinity series, so I wasn't 100% unfamiliar with a HUD of this type. The story so far is very intriguing. I am absolutely invested in the mysteries that this game has put before me.

So, i'll end this with my best praise for this game and my biggest criticism of it. First, I am very impressed with the degree of choice and freedom that BG offers. Nonlinear stories are the bread and butter of RPG's in my opinion and BG excels in this. It even feels kind of like i'm playing D&D sometimes, which is a hard feeling to accomplish in a video game. 

My biggest criticism, however, is mainly with the graphical options. I play on a 55"" 4k TV, so the HUD of the game (which looks like it is meant to be displayed in a lower resolution) is quite small. It would be great if I had the option to mess with the HUD in-game. At least to increase the resolution. Maybe they tried this, but it made the game unstable? I'll never know, I suppose. This problem is fixed by changing the resolution in your PC settings, but it is a slight pain to have to do it every time before I play. 

Now, for my breakdown;

Graphics: 3/5: Would be 4 if I had an easier way to change my resolution. For the time, these graphics were great. By today's standards, the character models are super pixelated and don't look very good, but the environments are fantastic.

Sound Design: 3/5: The ambient noise is very relaxing and immersive, but hearing the same sounds from monsters over and over gets slightly old.

Voice Acting: 2/5: By today's standards, this leaves something to be desired. I've cringed at a few instances, but there is some good voice acting here.

Music: 5/5: Each piece fits its environment exceedingly well and is an absolute joy to listen to. I regret not buying the bundle that includes the soundtrack! I may have to pick it up separately at a later date.

Character Creation: 3/5: I wish there were more options to customize the appearance of your character. I've never really liked the ""pick a portrait and make a character similar enough to it"" style of appearance customization that is popular in these sorts of RPG's. However, 2nd Edition AD&D holds a special place in my heart and I very much enjoy creating a character with these old rules.

Story: 5/5: As mentioned in my summary, this is probably my favorite part of the game. There is a whole world of people-- both good and evil-- who are looking to take advantage of your assistance. Lots of quests, interesting characters, and a very memorable and intriguing story. I don't feel like i'm following a questline like in one of my favorite RPG's, Skyrim. I feel like i'm hearing about things and investigating them on my own. As a side note that is somewhat related, I love the journal. Mainly because I can add my own entries. I've had a blast writing about things i've done and need to do as my character. It is also an incredible boon that keeps you from getting lost in a mountain of quests and story threads, as was the case with many RPG's of the time.

Replay Value: 5/5: I read that you can get upwards of 80 hours of play time in this game. I'm only 11 hours in, but i'm already thinking of what i'm gonna do differently next time. The endless amount of ways a quest can turn out and the many ways you can play the game lead to Baldur's Gate: Enhanced edition having a ton of replay value. And i've yet to play through the other adventures! I can see myself playing this game again and again for many years to come.

Overall Score: 5/5: While I have outlined a few problems I have with the game, I feel like I would be cheating the developers, the fans, and even the game itself if I gave Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition anything less than a perfect score. The positives far outweigh the few negatives and i'm looking forward to completing the game and then running back through it again!",1638121224,1638121224,True,5,0,0.582309544086456299,0,True,False,False

It tells the story of a medieval adventurer who is chased by a hulking armored figure that killed his step father and is somehow trying to provoke a war that will drag all the Sword Cost. 

[h1] A Few Words [/h1]
First I have to say that I played Dungeons & Dragons with my school friends when I was a kid, so playing Baldur‚Äôs Gate now felt like an emotional rollercoaster to me. Playing this game gave me moments of nostalgia, where I remembered the D&D campaigns I played with my friends, but also provoked me legit anger, because of some weird game play decisions like enemy placement (basilisks) and the final boss fight. 

[h1] About the Story [/h1]
The game legit made me feel like a medieval hero (villain in my case) but I wish the story of the legacy of Bhaal was told along the many chapters and not just compressed into the final chapter. For the whole game you keep wandering around the Sword Coast being chased by hired killers, you get to meet famous characters like Elminster, Drizzt and you keep thinking: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù. And then, in the final chapter, boom! You have an immense amount of text and explanation telling you all about the game‚Äôs story. Feels rushed. That info and clues about your char and his half brother should have been explained earlier. That‚Äôs my main concern about this game. 

[h1] Weird Difficulty Curve [/h1]
The other would be some over the top boss fights, like the basilisks in chap 6 or the final boss fight, which are so over the top difficult that I had to use some clever exploits to win, like abusing the skull trap spell. I wonder if it was the devs intention to make those encounters THAT difficult??

So, Baldur's Gate, [b] the [/b] CRPG - the game that is synonymous with the genre itself for 90% of people, and honestly I can see why, I really can.
It has got charm, it has got soul - it is just a labor of love, and you only need to look at the manual for the game (a 150 page pdf, full color with pictures and all) for that much to be apparent.

[b] I respect this game for everything it did to the RPG genre [/b] - its influence is not to be underestimated.
I'm giving it a not recommended simply because it isn't for me, and I think I gave it a fair shot.

Now [b] on to the game itself [/b] and why I don't recommend it.

It's pretty, it has that D&D adventure atmosphere and it feels nice to immerse yourself in it...

...But holy hell man [b] this game did not age well at all [/b] - now look, I actually love old school games - some of my favorite games (either now or when i was younger) were and will be games such as Doom, Quake 1, Diablo 2, older Total War games etc.

Take Diablo 2 as an example here - it has weak endgame content, it has weak build variety (compared to modern ARPGs such as PoE), it has poor UI and inventory management, it has weak widescreen support etc (all of this is in the context of the remaster not existing) - in other words, the game is [b] archaic, it is old, it doesn't have modern technology and comfort behind it and it is full of design philosophies that make 0 sense in today's world of game design [/b] - but it's still so fun to play. It just feels good to play, to listen to that story one more time, to slay monsters and get that random loot, [b] its age aged with it, if you will [/b] - it became a part of its soul.

Baldur's Gate on the other hand to me [b] feels like a chore to play [/b] :

-the game is just straight up [b] too RNG based [/b] - I feel this is much more true in the early game than it is in the late game, but holy shit man the amount of times a random spell just one-shot any of my characters except for the beefiest fighter tank is just stupid, no skill required and no reaction from the player possible.

-the game is [b] pure trial and error [/b] sometimes - like the early game Temple zone in the first town (why the fuck are there like 8 vampire wolves and worgs when they're literally immune to the damage low lvl characters can deal, since they don't have magic damage at that stage of the game?) or any encounter where you [b] need to know in advance [/b] which spells to prepare or which damage type weapons to have (since some monsters are just immune to some types of damage, but neither the game, its in-game books, tutorials, manual, or the non-existent bestiary will tell you that.
[b] Edit [/b] - Pathfinder Kingmaker has an example of how to deal with situations that possibly  could be trial and error by giving you a warning using in-game NPCs in a lore-friendly and immersive way - shortly, one of your companions writes a journal, and that journal is your quest log - everything in there is written by her, with her emotions - the quest that could have been trial and error literally has your companion writing a comment on that quest, stating ""this seems shady, our hero (you) should probably take some invisibility potions or think of some escape, just in case that this might be a trap"" - this is absolutely brilliant and it winks to the player that he will have to fight or flight his way out of that situation - it's 100% the players fault if he doesn't get properly prepared for this after this type of warning.

-the UI is clunky,

-tutorials are sparse,

-the manual is too complicated and yet still doesn't explain all the things a player should know,

-inventory and character management is tiresome and a waste of too much time,

-quest and side-quest directions are not really clear,

On top of all this you have [b] missing basic quality of life features [/b] that we've all come to expect in games today (in general, not just CRPGs):
- when i loot something, why doesn't that particular material/gem/arrow/item automatically stack in the inventory of the character that has those items?
-why are there no spell range/AOE indicators (what the fuck does 50 ft. of range mean)?
-why can't i ctrl+click or alt+click items to equip/unequip them faster?
-why can't I speed up the boring walking parts while exploring zones?
-why must I first select a character at a temple and then select the effect i want to apply to them (instead of just selecting an effect from the list and clicking on a character)?
-why must my whole party stop what they were ordered every time I order my party leader to speak with someone/investigate something... 
-why doesn't my party walk in unison - instead they all bump into each other and pause every half a second, making my ranged guys walk head-first into an enemy spellcaster or archer?...
...and the list goes on.

Heck, [b] I don't even need quality of life and modern day UI and UX philosophies that much [/b] - bro I've played Path of Exile for 1.500 hours and I've played a decent amount of Warframe as well, do you really think I'm not used to an absolute pisspoor user experience - and yet still [b] Baldur's Gate feels even worse when trying to get into it than those games. [/b]

One last thing to mention - the [b] story [/b], at least for now, feels somewhat generic, but I actually like that tbh, it's a nice break from Pillars' animancy, watcher and philosophical ancient civilization story lol. It just feels like an adventure that's waiting to happen, with okay writing.
The only problem for me is that it is perhaps [b] too predefined [/b] - I actually went through the pains of writing a personal biography for my character (there's an in-game option for that and it is clunky as all hell to write something coherent in that game box)... and then the game shoehorned me into being with Gorion, the guy that adopted me, my whole life... bruh.
Yeah, sue me, I like generic fantasy stories where the main party goes on an epic quest to get treasure/to save the world in a colorful high-fantasy setting.

This game is for people that either played it when it first came out or played other games at that time and are somewhat used to this level of clunkyness and weirdness - I may be playing old school games my whole life, but I was still born in the year 2000 - I've experienced too much quality of life to be comfortable playing this.

Maybe it's just not for me - that is always a possibility, we're all humans, we can't be good at everything and love everything.

Even so, I'll continue playing CRPGs, and will probably play Baldur's Gate 3 some day - it's not the end of the world if I don't like the game that basically spearheaded the genre, but I am kind of sad that that's the case...

I should note that i played games in this genre - I've put 100+ hours in Pillars of Eternity, I'm still planning to pick up the Pathfinder games (and i'll probably do a mini-update here when i do), so it isn't that this genre isn't for me, I don't think so. It's more that [b] this genre got so much better with the advancement of technology [/b], that going back in time with it feels downright painful, even for someone who tolerates weird game design.",1636604367,1637551277,False,338,27,0.683942854404449463,48,True,False,False

The mechanics of this game is strictly run by the books of old DnD RP rules. Considering the technology available at the time of the creation of the game, Baldur's Gate immediately achieved mastery of the DnD mechanics in PC games and has vastly influenced the culture and progress of all role playing video games across all platforms ever since its release.

The enhanced edition supports higher and modern resolutions with great resolution scaling differences based on camera zoom level, and it even adds new gameplay features such as additional companion options that are an essential for those who, like myself, were introduced to  the original game at an early age. The replay-ability of the game is also very vast, as there are an enormous amount of character class/race builds that offer a great amount of possibilities; especially for those who want to port their saves into Baldur's Gate 2 EE and then move toward getting ready for the full release of 3. While I do not have the information on whether Baldur's Gate 2 EE  will be able to port builds to Baldur's Gate 3, I am assuming that this wiil be an available perk for those who took the time to build their characters for the subsequent games. 

The story and engaging narratives of Baldur's Gate 1 EE are very intriguing and well thought out. I find myself reading the books found within the world and the character dialogues and narratives, and I really can tell that an enormous amount of thought and care was dedicated to creating a believable world that transcends the rather primitive graphics style.

This is definitely where all DnD gamers should start if they want to immerse themselves in the stories of the masters. Alternatively and if one decides they would like to try the game play mechanics of this type of game before diving right into to the ""Big Daddy"" of them all, I would recommend Icewind Dale. Icewind Dale is a lot more based on game play than story line. If you are like me, however, you want the ultimate of both features.

Is it a prefect representation of Table Top Gaming? Hell no, There is no DM adjusting the story as the player goes completely out of the game scope, so we're pretty much penned in to what story the developers want to tell us. but as story goes it's a good one.

Separably, my wife and I have probably sunk years of play time to this game when it was originally released, well before we married with our own copies. Sadly I lost my original copies to an ex-roommate theft long ago. Hope you play em in good health.

With BG3 in early access and seemingly on the horizon for a full release (Knock on Wood) my wife and I decided it was time to get antiquated with the classic Baldur's Gate Games starting with this one and give it a complete play-through. Just for nostalgia's sake.

While the graphics are dated and 2D, The whole thing still hold up very well. The music is comforting and exciting when it needs to be.

My favourite game (out of 30+):  9/10 from me
A few things that could be improved
1) Allow a player to ONLY learn how to control the class of player selected (add a selection to allow AI control of other characters that join the group) : I was keen to get started so chose a fighter character (easy to understand how to play it) but still had to learn how to use a wizard, cleric and thief. After playing for a bit I saw why - these classes can join your group and you then control them as player characters
2) The world map needs a key and the items in it need to be spaced further apart : I was thoroughly confused when I kept selecting travelling to what seemed to be labelled as ""the Friendly Arms Inn"", but eventually (through a lot of trawling on the internet) found that the symbol I was selecting was my current location (but the ""Friendly Arms Inn"" label was right above it

I'll say that now is still a great game and one of my faves, it got me into PC Gaming it was my first PC game   Fourteen years on, BioWare's first RPG ‚Äì an isometric, text-heavy epic with sprites for graphics and an almost bewildering 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons ruleset ‚Äì still provides an expansive and enjoyable experience. I have spent years and hours playing this game and i truly love it.

The story is one of danger, as you find your way from your home after being ambushed, an iron shortage that threatens to flare tensions with neighbouring regions, and a shadowy figure in armour, Assination attempts and bandits roaming the lands. 

Combat can be unbalanced at times. and sometimes you have to micromanage your party of adventures just to get themn through battle There are a few bugs. But if you cannot laugh when Minsc shouts, ""Go for the eyes, Boo"" ombat can be unbalanced at times.  If you haven't played this game you should. Because this is where it all began. So Gather your party and go adventuring fourth.

In my opinion the best part of the game is the discovery. Everytime you find an area, you only start with a small scrap of visible land. Uncovering everything in each location is a lot of fun. However, you always have to be careful. I was wandering around a desert at level 1-2 and got my tank petrified, and then my leader. I came back a few levels later with magic that was able to prevent petrification, and still had a tough but fair battle. That demonstrates another great thing about this game, you really feel progression. I've only been playing for 20 or so hours but already I've changed from a twig to a tree, and I can't wait to grow even more.

Overall, this is one of the best games I've ever played, and would reccomend it to anyone(although be warned, this game does not hold your hand and is difficult, a tip: the lower your AC is, the better)who likes roleplaying, strategy, great storytelling and has some time to kill.",1530768485,1635102270,True,2,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Enhanced Edition has the same charm as the original, almost identical gameplay, but with the bugs fixed, Tales of the Sword Coast expansion implemented into the game, and some added content. Unlike the original, entering the inventory doesn't unpause the game (something that wasn't implemented until BGII), which is very useful when you don't have the right item or a potion equipped. And I, for one, don't miss having to change the CDs all time during the game (although, from memory, original was released on a single DVD at some point).

So, if you liked the original and want to revisit it (including the option to purchase two DLCs with more content), I'd definitely recommend this game.  If you are new to the game, but familiar with D&D, it is definitely worth a shot.

Baldur's Gate 1:

I love this game. 

Its a low level campaign based on a very good interpretation of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition. Turns out a really well developed pen and paper role playing game also lays the ground work for a really excellent game engine.

The combat is ""real time with pause"". There are turns happening as in D&D, but they are all happening at the same time and taking place in real time. That's where the pause comes in. You can just let the combat play out in real time, but at any time you may pause the game to give out more specific commands to your party members. This allows for easy encounters to not become a chore and hard encounters can be micro-managed as much as needed.

The game is set on the Sword Coast of Faerun in the Forgotten Realms, a setting that will be familiar to D&D veterans. The story is straightforward but fun.

Baldur's Gate has a great balance between exploration, combat and story/dialogue. You'll want to explore each area you come across because you never know if you'll encounter a mad priest, a band of rouge adventurers looking for a fight, a mother looking for some one to save her son, or just some random crazy NPC that will make you laugh.

The combat can seem hard to grasp if you've not played before or even boring at level 1 if you can't hit anything, but there is a lot of depth to it, especially in the magic system from wizards and priests. There are a lot of awesome combat encounters in this game. There is also a nice progression of loot you get for your characters which is one reason that compels you to keep exploring - you never know what awesome loot you may get!

Although there is a lot of great dialogue in the game and a lot of opportunity for role-playing, the npc companions do not offer a lot of dialogue. Many have ""quests"" but they are short and underwhelming. There is some banter between NPCs but not a great deal so don't expect much out of it. BG2's companions are much better in this regard.

As for the enhanced edition, its supports higher resolutions which is great. If anyone ever played BG1 with the Tutu mod installed, the Enhanced Edition will feel very similar - basically its BG1 in the BG2 engine, including all the class kits and the ability to dual wield.

The enhanced edition also adds four new NPC companions - a monk, wild mage, a blackguard (an evil paladin) and a sorcerer. These companions all have a legitimate quest for you and in general are more fleshed out than the original npcs. The community is divided as to whether these companions are a welcome addition to the game. I like all but the monk.

Overall, more than 20 years later, I still think Baldur's Gate is worth a playthrough (or severl) to this day.

Recommended.

Siege of Dragonspear:

I really enjoyed this expansion.

Although it is much more linear than BG1 or 2, it's not the straightforward dungeon crawl some people make it out to me.

In the story you are following an army as they advance across the Sword Coast on their campaign. Thus, once you proceed with the army to a new area, you cannoy backtrack. But in each area there are a ton of side quests to do. Some of them are really great.

The game features many higher level enemies than BG1, and in many ways feels like a warmup for BG2, in regards to to the enemies you face and environments you'll encounter. In one chapter there is even a huge underground sections that reminds of the Underdark from BG2.

The game is beautiful. There are many incredible and colorful settings. The game also has some really fun large scale battles, which were a lot of fun.

I liked the story. Is it necessary for BG2? Obviously not, we'd been playing BG2 for more than 15 years before this released. But it's fun, and it does take you right into BG2.

The companions are very good. They have side quests and a lot more lines than the original Baldur's Gate. Also, they did an excellent job with the cannon party members, in terms of voice acting and scripting.

Also worthy of note, the experience cap in SoD is 500k xp, perfect for dual classing. You can now start BG2 with your fully dualed fighter mage!

Overall I think it's worth experiencing, at least once if not on each playthrough of the trilogy. People will say that it's not necessary, and again, of course it's not BG2 has been just fine without it since it's release. But Tales of the Sword coast was equally unnecessary in terms of BG2 - this game at least feels like a continuation of Charname's story rather than a total side quest.

I would to preface this review by saying two things: 1. I am reviewing this as a young person. This game is older than I am, so the perspective I present in the following review will not be blinded by nostalgia. In fact, I first played it earlier this year. 2. The fact that, unlike other steam games I've reviewed, I am not doing a joke review, speaks volume to how good this game is, and how much I care about it.

This game is AWESOME. Immersive, fun characters and dialogue, charming world, fun combat system. This is the kind of game you can sink hours into playing and discovering the world. By far one of the best games I've ever played. 

The best part of the game for me are the characters, both the party members and NPCs. Each character has their own motivations and backstory, with their own morals and ideals. You can have a party full of good characters and go around the Sword Coast being heroes, or have a party full of evil characters and cause chaos around you. Better yet, you can have some good and some evil party members, and watch them clash with each other and argue (until the lawful good paladin attacks the lawful evil half orc and dies (YES, your party members can kill each other if they disagree enough. modern games just wont do this kind of stuff and its awesome)). For a game so old, the developers put a ton of effort into the different interaction party members can have, and I think they pulled it off quite well. 

This game is also extremely fun to explore. Every area - even the ""unnamed forest area number 57"" kind - has something for you to discover, whether it be a wacky NPC that will ask for 1000 gold pieces, an OP magical item, a fortress full of Gnolls, or a pair of golden pantaloons, there is not a corner of this game's world that the developers did not put some secret into. The exploration in this game just feels SATISFYING, the gameplay loop of slowly uncovering an area and talking to NPCs with fantasy name generator names is extremely addicting to me, and if you're the kind of player who enjoys to be immersed in a world, this is the game for you.

HOWEVER, this game is not for everyone. There are aspects of Baldur's Gate that I can imagine ruining the game for some players. For instance, the combat at early levels (1-4) is simply unfair. The game will throw inescapable encounters at you that your party will be unable to deal with. For me, this is not a deal breaker, as I find the story and exploration make up for the unfair combat, but if you're the kind of player that doesn't have the patience to bang their head against a hoard of Amnian Soldiers for an hour straight, this game simply isn't for you. 

The combat does become relatively fair from level 5 onward, but even then there will be some encounters that are simply unfair. This isn't helped by the fact that the developers basically expect you to complete every sidequest in the game, otherwise you will quickly find yourself underleveled for the games already absurdly difficult encounters. 

It's not that the combat SYSTEM is bad; it's essentially a 1 to 1 replica of 2nd edition D&D, and there is a ton of fun to be had with the variety of spells, items and abilities each class has. The combat system is very fun and dynamic, it's just that the developers made the encounters too hard.

The game DOES have a ""Story Mode"" difficulty where you are given the ability to breeze through every combat encounter, so this problem is technically fixed, however I find the mode immersion breaking and only turn it on in extreme circumstances (which, admittedly, is every third encounter at level 1). 

All in all, this game has one of the deepest and detailed worlds of any game I've played, fun NPCs, endless replay value with its variety of classes and races, and a simple (and kind of generic) but fun story that oozes with D&D charm. The only drawback is the horrible encounter balance, which is an aspect that can easily ruin the game for some players, but can be overcome with patience or the Story Mode.",1634522188,1634524635,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Yes, it might be a little bit archaic compared to modern day crpg's but I think that's part of BG's appeal too. It's not overly complicated and I don't feel totally lost in it's systems. For me the story flows well and I like the free exploration too, unlike some other players. The original one has very few cons for me, if at all, but the EE version has those new characters you can recruit that just don't feel right to me. Luckily you can mod them out. And don't flame me, but the so called ""canon"" party has started to bore me a little...Otherwise I have very little to complain about this gem of an rpg. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good party based rpg.

Pros:
Great story
A good cast of characters
An interesting world to explore
Not too complicated compared to some newer party based crpg's

Cons (EE Only):
New npc's do not work for me at all

Maybe this is the magic of the first game ever, maybe the magic of sitting on dad's lap while he was fighting with kobolds in the mines - but maybe this is just a well-written gameplay which ages like fine wine. I understand that the graphic needed some adjustment to current times and still needs (however this was done by BGT and then by EE really well). I know that our NPCs do not say much and there is a lot of maps where you can find basically just a lot of trees and that is all - but this is absolutely not how I remember this game and not how I perceive this game when I play it. 

The plot of the game is so interesting and so addictive that for me the story happening on the screen was the one thing, but the one I had in my head - it was the other. So there's this guy (or lady, usually I played the guy) who lives in a nice place called Candlekeep with his father, the great magician. He's old, silver-bearded and has a long coat, just like all great wizards have. And one day he says - we need to go. Prepare yourself. This is the tutorial and it is done so nicely that only after playing this THOUSAND times you can feel bored by tasks in Candlekeep. And then, by night, you get out from Candlekeep and you get attacked by a group of strangers led by huge person in a heavy armor with a big sword in the hand. He seems unbeatable. He kills the father without any problems. And you need to run. And the only thing you know is - go to the Friendly Arm Inn. There are some friends. They will help you out.

And then you meet them, and you start your journey, and you need to find your way around this messed up world, the iron crisis, the murderers chasing you for no particular reason, the bad guys you never saw when you were spending your days in dusty Candlekeep libraries. But there's a power inside you and you are good in fighting these bad guys. And you get new friends who are coming with you and are fighting by your side - some of them are a little odd, some of them are very very small (though I am sure that among cosmic hamsters Boo is the biggest and the bravest one), but all of them are with you till the very end.

The world has one plus that BG2 does not have in my opinion - it is very down-to-earth. You won't find githyankis, kuo-toas or other weird creatures - instead there is a lot of monsters that seem very real and I think that if somebody did not used to the DnD world (e.g. 7yo myself) it looks like a story that totally could've happened. Maybe this is the magic? I still don't know.

But I recommend trying this game. Use mods for additional discussions between NPCs, romances, new missions - but try this world. And I am sure you won't regret.",1630533690,1630533690,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game starts slowly, you learn all the mechanics and some other stuff in a well made tutorial, then you are free to do what you want. It is a shame that after finishing the credits the game does not let you play afterwards, since I had like 20 side quests remaining that I wanted to do/finish. You learn new skills/spells, you get more powerful, the story gets interesting. So do not worry at the beginning, it gets better the longer you play.

Should you buy it: Even for someone who does not know much about D&D ( like me)  I would recommend this game even at full price.

The beginning of the story was ok, and you get to start from level 1 with super squishy characters and see how the story began, which later continues in Siege of Dragonspear (BG1's expansion) )and BG2. Personally i find it actually start to get fun from level 7 and onwards and after you gather a few magical equipment.

Completed the first game (even tho after completion i don't think i'll play it again), now playing Siege of Dragonspear.

BG1:
The pacing was horrible, often during traveling and questing it was either dispersive or an area a bit too large where i couldn't wait to just get over with.

The story was okay but imo the way it was narrated (and the pacing) could have been better. Way too many ""pointless"" houses and areas to explore, mixed in there with quest npc or interesting items/rewards as findings.

There are several recruitable NPCs, more than in BG2, there are also some bad game design IMO, like some NPCs will leave permanently if dismissed or come in pairs. There is also a level cap and your characters can get ""only"" up to level 8 or the likes. The game in particular, like BG2, is pretty intensive on the save/load mechanic you basically fail something and reload in hope of getting a better result, reposition, dice roll etc. You can avoid doing that if you wish, but stepping on a trap, losing a party member or getting hit by certain attacks/spells is generally a big deal in this game.

BG1 SOD:
One of the good is that Siege of Dragonspear starts right away as continuation after you finish BG1 (you can also skip BG1 and start directly from SOD, characters will be at around level 6-7 with pre-set gear in such case). You'll have your character and party with the level and items you were carrying in the first game. 
First thing i noticed is you can tell it has a more ""modern"" feel, there are fog effects and subtle graphic details, a lot more npcs on screen with passive dialogs. Also the way it's narrated, and the dialogs both from npc and companions has a bit more ""realistic"" approach compared to BG1 and BG2, where it felt more like you were playing characters in a tale.

Personally i prefer BG2 so far, where quests and story and NPC dialogs are more meaningful and better designed (not exceptional, but way better than BG1).

I personally would recommend BG2 over BG1, the areas, quests and point of interests are more condensed, less empty/open areas to travel without much of interest.. it boils down to personal taste as usual, some players prefer 1 others 2, or both.

Maybe a post update to follow if i complete the Siege of Dragonspear expansion.

Note: This game can be played solo or with other players, if the latter I would recommend it played with a small group of ""patient"" type of players, as per willing to stay put, read, wait, discuss, eventually going through several attempts/reloads if failing etc and it can be a real nice experience with the right players, this is not a game where to rush stuff same goes for BG2.

Upvote cause, well it's a renowned classic apart from my personal taste and game runs pretty good, some minor bugs (some quests in journal not marked as completd if you don't run things in a certain order and conditions)",1627009718,1630315709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I fell in love with CRPGs because of that and decided to give one of the classics a shot.... Well, I tried and failed to get into it probably 5 or 6 times. I would start up the tutorial and flounder for an hour and get frustrated and quit. Because frankly even this enhanced edition feels very foreign to someone who first played CRPGs in the context of a modern 3d game.

But I kept hearing about how great Baldur's Gate is and so I kept trying and finally after my sixth attempt and after reading some guides online I jumped into the game and I've now been playing for nearly 50 hours. I love it. The writing is so good. I feel like I'm playing through a high fantasy novel. Combat is very complicated from my perspective but I read guides about how important magic protections and buffs are and once I started using those liberally it became very tractable on a normal difficulty. I plan on playing through all of the expansions and the second game using my character.

When I originally purchased it off a store shelf in 1998, I had no idea what an incredible ride I was in for. It was like I was playing pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons, but I controlled the entire party and didn't need to coordinate schedules with others in order to play. And the story, world, atmosphere, open exploration, excellent music... just blew my mind. I was quickly hooked.

I've since come back to replay Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2 many, many... many times over the years. The game world almost feels like a second home. The Enhanced Edition makes the game easier to install on modern PCs, and adds a number of helpful quality of life improvements, some bug fixes, and support for modern resolutions-- so this is the way to play Baldur's Gate in the present day. The added characters are decent as well. I'm a particular fan of Dorn Il-Khan for an evil party. I'm somewhat less of a fan of Neera and Rasaad, just personal taste.

This is a great game, and I continue to enjoy it in 2021. If you can get over the dated visuals (which look much better in high resolution, zoomed out a bit), I think you'll enjoy Baldur's Gate.

Baldur's Gate is one hell of a game. Sarevok's reign of terror along the Sword Coast, the Iron Crisis, the progeny of a dead god wreaking havoc on the realm. It's a classic, make no doubt.

Though more of a fresh coat-of-paint than the remake we all wanted, Beamdog's Enhanced Edition is overall an improvement over the original game--especially now that the many bugs that plagued the game at launch have been ironed out. Of particular note are the additional party members and quest content, which are closer in quality to the quintessential sequel, Shadows of Amn, than the original.

Baldur's Gate is a masterpiece. I recommend--in the strongest possible language--that every gamer play both main titles at lease once. I must, in a heartbeat, recommend any gamer out there who hasn't already picked up Baldur's Gate to grab the Enhanced Edition immediately.

In a heartbeat.

But to players of the old school, my fellows and friends, I cannot say the same. Beamdog's Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate is nice, and in many respects superior to the original game, but the new content is far from game-changing, and there's simply too little there to justify a full play-through if you've already journeyed through the original game a half-dozen times. Unless you're a huge fan of the game, I guess. Like me. In which case: have at it!

After Twenty years coming back to this game. Game is still well written even more than many of now a days games. I think I liked story as much as I liked about 20 years ago. I think this story is still as relevant as 20 it was years ago. Many new games could learn from this game's story. Story is not about saving the world its rather story about main character and political situation of Sword Coast. Choises player make feel important but not game chancing. Plot unravels slowly and is really well written. I m many cases one could be reading D&D novel book, but instead reading it you are making it. After beating this game one wants more. 

Technically this game is made with BG2 engine. It greatly improves to gameplay from orginal game. You can play as sub class of character, so its easier to carry hero to BG2. Since landscape was already hand painted zooming out dosen't make it feel ugly. I would say it is still beautiful. Unfortunatly this game is hard, getting first few levels can be a pain. Many fights feel too hard. Higher resolution does not help it. For first timers I would recomend reading some guides to get past start. 

EE edition brings also new characters to play. I think those new heroes make this game shine even more. They make story more lively the same way as sequel of the Baldur's Gate. New chacaters out shine the old ones, still all the characters feel well written. It is nice feeling to meet them again in BG2. 

If you lke D&D novels give this game a chance! Story rewards the player and it is still one of the best written game until to day.

I played this game religiously, back in the day, and this 'enhanced' version has hit me right in the nostalgia.  Hearing Winthrop once again proudly proclaim, ""My hotel is as clean as an Elven arse!"", actually made me tear up a little.

Yes, it is old (just like me) and yes, the visuals are appallingly dated (just like me), but it still puts modern rpg's to shame.  The depth of the story and the excellent writing are second to none.

I did however grow up with Icewind Dale and will use that as my starting point on the game.

Where Icewind Dale either encouraged you to make a full party or play online with others; BG gives you the third aspect of recruiting heros mid game as you adventure. I made the mistake (not really one but ya miss out on some dialogue/story)of making a full party my first run through. I high suggest just making your primary character and then choosing which companions to keep as you come across them or loose them. 

If you haven't played BG, it uses the old 2e D&D rules which can be hard and unforgiving at times. With that in mind this is a game you should save a lot and frequently. 

While the graphics are old, even the enhanced edition came out several years ago, it still plays well on a modern gaming laptop. I currently use an Omen and I have no issues in compatability or just clashing of old graphics with new tech; like you sometimes see in playing a 1st gen console on a modern hd tv. The music is also really good and frequently aids in absorbing yourself into the game. My only complaint there is while the game was full screen I couldn't adjust laptop volume with normal hotkeys...typcially had to alt-tab back and forth till right.

Depending on how focused on the main story you are, the difficulty (from 1st run on I always chose the normal....basically settings set to match 2e rules), and whether playing solo this game I would say takes rough 15-20 hours average. I've had much longer runs but that's typically due to wanting to do every quest or turning my character into a merchant and finding/selling every item.

If you're into RPGs, if you want something to play solo or with friends, and most importantly if you want something that doesn't necessarily require the internet I highly suggest this game!",1629527365,1629527365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, if asked if you should play this series, then I can tell you with a resounding 'YES' that you should.   Now, it's been awhile since the original game has come out, and since then Beam Dog has released the enhanced versions of the games.  This has drawn a lot of controversy with how they have handled the original licence, especially when it comes down to the expansion pack (which was all done by Beam Dog).  By expansion pack I am refering to Siege of Dragonspear.

I won't go into the reasons behind the controversy, but personally, although I think this content is weaker than anything else in the series, it is still extra content.  If you miss this, then you will probably always be wondering what it was that missed.  You may even feel as though you have not experienced the entire story, although there is a counter arguement that the entire pack is unneccessary.

Personally, I would take a new party out into BG1 and just play through everything.  Baldur's Gate 1 is a great game, and was the best representation of Advanced Dungeon & Dragons on the computer.  The series, which was already ranking high on most people's favourite's list, then went into the stratosphere with the launch of BG2.  That game is a lot of people's all-time favourite game, and it is easy to see why.   

After the initial escape from a dungeon, you emerge into the city of Athkatla, and it is here that everyone just gets really exciting and interesting.  There is a crazy amount of things to do, and events happening.  Trust me, for those who read this and know, they will have a 'knowing smile' about what I mean.  If you enjoyed part one, then you will absoloutely love BG2.

So should you buy this game?   Yes, most definitely!

But this isn't about the life choices of developers and the publishers they love. This is about Beamdog's remastering of a Bioware classic and the one that got them both started. 

Now not much really to ""review"" either know these games, or you don't. They are tough. They can be confusing and super overwhelming. They will make you question why people think something like Dark Souls is challenging as they can be so unforgiving on even normal difficulty. 

They are also awesome, engaging, and deep games that allow you to play out a story in your own style, with a classic DnD feel set in arguably the best locale DnD sports, the Forgotten Realms. Add in some very challenging and fun tactical combat, and an amazing story picked right up again with the second game, and you're looking at one hells of a game play experience for the asking price. 

Now the bad. Okay so as of writing they are still putting work into polishing these games up(major patch just last May surprised me, figured like most remasters out there these were pump and dumps, but nope, Beamdog is very passionate about their Enhanced Edition series of games and is a very active developer overall), however there are still ""issues"" with the games, mostly due to limitations of the game engine, and here they are:
[list]
[*]Some quests, NPC interactions are not bugged but clearly were never well thought out by Bioware from the get-go. Some have been fixed or shortened by Beamdog, but overall confusion and ""where the f do I go"" is high with this game still, so here's hoping for some future fixes to quest descriptions so we can lower the amount of alt-tabbing to Baldurs Gate wiki lol 
[*]Pathfinding is flat-out, hot garbage as well as the AI overall. There is no way around this, it is an old engine, and you can dress it up in all of Saturday night's best clothes, but it is still an old grey mare. Party members will block each other constantly, prevent you from simply entering a house etc, so be ready as this is an updated OLD game. 
[/list]
Beyond those two issues, I can't really hack it. I just wanted to give some fair warning about more dated or janky aspects. 

If you did not grow up playing these games, you have a ""crap factor"" adjustment ahead of you, but trust me, it is worth it, and Beamdog is nowhere near done supporting these games. 

Overall score:
B+
Some flaws, little dated even with updates, but for the price, especially if you never played Baldur's Gate before, you will be in for a treat once you become familiar with the game. 

Oh, the DLC Beamdog made for this is good too, really feels like something could have come out between the two games back in the day, in a very good way.

It was truly a terrible experience. We all thought the game to be awful, but couldn't bring ourselves to insist to the other two players that we should stop playing, as we didn't want to be the kill-joy and because we also thought that it might get better down the line. It took a while for us to realize that nobody liked it and that we were all just trudging along out of consideration for the others.
Now, what is so terrible about this game you might ask?
The answer is everything except for the soundtrack.
The dialogues and voice-acting are of poor quality. A lot of the main characters are downright annoying or insulting in their quirkiness.
The main scenario is so forgettable that we, in fact, kept forgetting it. Even racking our three brains together, we could barely remember what the story was supposed to be about at any given time.
The side quests are as boring as they come, on the level of MMORPG quests, which probably take inspiration from this game anyway.
Exploration was terrible, with the map being mostly large swathes of emptiness, and rewards always disappointing.
And most importantly, the core part of the gameplay, battle, which is burdened by some of the worst UI ever designed by man.

If you want to play something similar with your friends, I strongly suggest playing something better, like Divinity Original Sin.",1628984342,1628984342,False,1,0,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,False

First, the good stuff: the characters are fun, and it's impressive that they managed to convey so much character with little more than a picture card and a few voice lines. I think the number of potential party members starts to get a bit ridiculous, and if you're not familiar with (or interested in) the intricacies of DnD and just want to kill things adequately then most of the character stats are going to blur together.

I'm sure the world is fun too, if you get into it, but it seemed very painfully generic to me. Is this because it's a standard DnD world, or because so many games have been based on Baldur's Gate since? Can't tell. But it seems like the kind of world your computer would create on its own if you Googled the word ""fantasy"" and called it a day.

I'm not going to complain about the gameplay (slow, confusing and buggy) or the graphics (pixely) or even the interface (cluttered) because all these are the stumbles that BG pioneered when trying to switch from turn-based to realtime and pioneers always make mistakes. The worst part about this game is the plot.

It's really, really boring.

At time of writing my quest log has been insisting I ""investigate the cause of an iron shortage in the area"" for about 6 hours and I literally cannot think of a less appealing call to adventure. The inciting incident of this game was my mentor being murdered, and now I'm supposed to bumble around and play bureaucrat? Where's the amazing story that people online have been praising BG for for 20 years? But joke's on me, because when I finally gave up and looked up a plot synopsis, the iron shortage IS the story. I'm supposed to investigate the iron shortage, play out the Master of the Universe ""Haha, I was working for a different guy the whole time!"" gambit a few times, and then fight the big bad who orchestrated the whole thing. The whole iron crisis. Which I am supposed to care about. Zzzzzzzzzzz.......

D&D 2.0 can be quite fun at mid-high levels: that is the level range conveniently featured in its loved and clearly superior sequel Baldur's Gate 2.

Unfortunately, BG1 is low-level D&D, and it happens that playing D&D 2.0 at 1st level is a torture: any character can be instagibbed with one well rolled hit and the only viable strategy (outside of save scumming) is to equip a ranged weapon on every character and kite melee enemies. For ranged enemies, the only thing you can do is pray to the RNGesus and hope to not get instakilled.

This gameplay loop will remain as such for many, many hours, for 2 reasons:

1. Because level 1 and level 2 characters have access to no fun abilities. Mages have only access to 1 spell slot (always Sleep because it's your best shot of winning early fights outside of RNG) and other classes unlock their special abilities at later levels.

2. When you manage to finally kill a group of 5 ranged kobolds or whatever without anyone dying, you get rewarded with 35 EXP.  You need 2000 EXP to reach 2nd level. It's. Too. Fucking. Slow. This game simply doesn't reward properly the player for his efforts.
EXP is also further divided by the number of characters in your party.

You spent time on character creation screen, carefully picking your class kit and weapon proficiencies? Don't bother, none of that will matter in BG1. The game will end around level 8 or 9 and while you do unlock some interesting abilities at this point, you'll still be far away from the really fun stuff you can get in BG2.

Personally, I couldn't stand that boring as fuck gameplay. I turned on the convenient ""story mode"" that made my characters invulnerable and went on with the story (which isn't that great to begin with).

Zones are still pretty with great ambient sounds and musics, but these (huge) zones feel empty outside of seemingly randomly placed enemies and NPCs rushing to you to talk about mundane stuff you don't care about then promptly disappearing never-to-be-seen again.

Character sprites, spell animations and combat visuals have aged poorly. They do the job but they obviously can't compare to the amazing visuals we get in modern games.",1627434159,1627434983,False,2,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

It follows 2nd Edition Advanced DnD rules, meaning the manual is a whopping 154 pages long, and the character creator can seem daunting to most people who're either new to this type of game, new to the series, new to DnD or just new to Classic RPGs in general.

Though the story is a lot more enjoyable from the perspective of a Good/Chaotic Good character/party, as back in 1998 the Dungeons and Dragons franchise wanted to distance themselves from the media speculation -- Evil characters are by far the least satisfying to play as, and don't have a great deal of influence on the overall story. (Though it was fun to meticulously explode pretty much every NPC in sight at that point, despite little consequences beyond more guards being spawned.)

The gameplay itself is Real-Time with Pause, and there are so many different combinations and layers of experimentation to try out within the game's boundaries, it's hard to say any particular build/set of builds are good, you'll have to find what works for you and your current play style. That being said, it is insanely difficult just jumping in without doing any form of ""grinding"", which for me was doing sidequests, arguably the main focus of the game.

The Black Pit is also a great addition, though not exactly story-based it was certainly a fun gauntlet for post-game characters, even being able to import/export that progress between the normal game. I even managed to get someone to play Multiplayer for this particular game mode, starting characters from scratch, and I've never in my life had to do so much planning to beat a boss before. It was insane, but gratifying.

I've almost played 100 hours of the game, beating it once for a Good party and again for an Evil party, and I can't imagine I've even come close to finding all of the content within the game. But I definitely want to, and it gets my gamer brain going just thinking about the different quest possibilities and outcomes -- something that seems far more important than the actual main story.

Pick it up, it's totally worth it if you haven't played it already. I have no nostalgia whatsoever, my bias is actually more towards just preference of the genre than anything else. So if something complicated, long-winded and difficult is your cup of coffee, then I'd definitely recommend it.

I loved the game twenty years ago, I still love it in that version :)

If you haven't played Baldur's Gate ever, this version is the way to go, just the good resolution is a sufficient reason ^^

Pros:
It's Baldur's Gate, the game was solid back then, still is today.
If you liked it more than twenty years ago, you'll probably like it now.
I really appreciate the ability we have now to zoom/dezoom, allowing us to see a very large portion of the map

Cons:
I think this ""enhanced"" version should have come with: 
Better multiplayer management -> like, interrupting all players when any of them starts a dialogue with a NPC is really annoying
Better dubbing/translation -> in French version, some voices are still in English at random moments in the game

There are probably some rooms for improvements in terms of inventory management, or combat timeline as the game is turn-based, etc. but overall, it's fine, the game runs smoothly.

EDIT:
Oh one major thing should be fixed in this game: pathfinding/collision, but mostly pathfinding, i.e. the way characters move on the map -> it's buggy AF, they'll stay stuck for entire rounds before figuring out the way to go. 
Sometimes, the struggle for finding a path makes sense but most of the time it does not which leads to extremely annoying moments where your characters get stuck and sometimes killed because they seemed to dumb to even walk straight...",1626952598,1626967413,True,4,0,0.562780261039733887,0,True,False,False

Review of Siege of Dragonspear here - https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067692560/recommended/385970/

The first game in the epic RPG serie. Since 2001, I have completed this game dozens of times.
+ You have a main mission in this game, but before this mission, you can do what you want.
+ Excellent balance between combat quests and other types of quests.
+ Perfectly created game world, especially cities like Baldur's Gate and Beregost.
+ In the Enchanced Edition, the Tales of Sword Cost add-on is available in the game.
+- Great number of different locations. It's too much. IMHO of course. (In BG2 this problem is fixed)
+- 29 possible companions (25 from the base game and 4 new from the Enchanced Edition). It's too much. IMHO of course. (In BG2 this problem is fixed)
- Strange system of dual clases.

First off, the controls are weird. It takes a while to learn and it isn't easy. The UI inventory feels clunky and all over the place. Dropping items for example on the ground could be implemented much more smoothly. No shift-clicking or control clicking is implemented. Drag item, drop here, with weight AND limited inventory space per character. Get used to setting up your keybinds for a good while.

The main UI is also strange. You can't customize it to your liking, even though it is overall O-K.

Left and right mouse click will let your units move. With that said, accidental move orders are bound to happen; misclick. There is no option in the game to select your entire party except yourself. Finally, my biggest gripe, slow XP gain. I haven't even gotten to level 2. Each and every party member who kills a unit will not share XP to your party. Just themself. Or it is as it feels? Enemies are therefor too tough and I constantly die. Getting gold is also difficult until eventually you cannot afford to resurrect your party and all you have left is a mage with 4 hp. 

Great idea. Horrid gameplay. I'm still going to TRY to play through it though and I spent a lot of money on the game. BUT.... I do not recommend anyone getting the game. Stay away. It's not fun.",1625672146,1625672592,False,1,0,0.480893105268478394,0,True,False,False

Some comfort foods are just as good as you remember them, some are only comforting because of a distant childhood memory but aren't particularly ""good"" meals, some comfort foods are those that have been a staple forever and they are constantly being updated and added to.

Infinity Engine games, of which this is the first, are all of these things. While the classic game has some definite issues when played on modern machines, the core game is solid and has managed to remain playable even two decades later. However, the enhanced edition came along and made it playable by incorporating updates to the UI, mechanics, and made it match up with its even more expansive sequel. 

Bioware cut its teeth on this game, and it shows as all the things they have evolved over the years have their foundations in this game and its ability to humanize the NPCs, provide options for play, and make the same quests still interesting even years later. I find myself resisting the urge to create new characters again and again, and I am pretty sure that character roll screen has consumed a significant portion of the gaming hours in my life.

I do sometimes wonder if I hadn't experienced this originally in 1999 if it would be as tasty today. A part of me thinks it definitely would be, but if I had grown up on more modern UI instead of playing the Ultima, Bard's Tale, and SSI Gold Box games in the 80s, I wonder. Yet many games today are still trying to capture lightning in a bottle like this classic as can be seen in Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2 & 3, Torment, and others. Hell, I would play a game today in the Infinity Engine if it were brand new - and you now can thanks to Siege of Dragonspear (although I haven't played it yet - I plan on going into it after I finish the game with this new character, unless I get distracted).

I finally sat down, made a new character to get the full experience instead of taking breaks, and finished it. After finally finishng it while also completing a decent chunk of side content I can say without a doubt that this game just isn't worth playing to me.

The game is 7 chapters in total (not including the dlc which adds another chapter after the main story ends), but each chapter is only about 30 minutes to an hour long if you decide to just go from story beat to story beat. The only reason the game is as long as it is is because there are so many different areas to explore you spend the majority of your time not even doing the main quest, it's running around these side areas. This would be fine if not for the fact that these side areas have almost nothing in them, are pretty big, and your character moves at a walking speed. You can run into enemies, npc's to help with world building, and side quest stuff. Now I don't mind having these 3 being the main focus in side areas to bump into when exploring, the issue is that there are so many side areas and almost none of this stuff to do in them. It just becomes a slog to go through all these areas looking for something cool, and you realize the majority of it isn't. One area had me defend a cow from a bunch of enemies and that was supposed to be the fun encounter, and another had me pick up a cats body for a girl so she can bring it back from the dead. None of it is interesting and I feel like I got nothing out of exploring other than some better items. 

Now it's DnD and getting better items is cool. However at a certain point you just have so many you don't care anymore. Hell I got to the point where if I had to identify an object I would just ignore it because I had so many items I needed to identify already, and sitting around waiting for the ability to cast identify just to find out it's the 4th wand of paralyzing or another cursed ring got incredibly tedious.

As for companions, there were very few I enjoyed. The majority of them had a quick side quest you do with them once you meet them, you do it, and then they ask if they can stick around for a while. The only one I noticed who had a quest that actually took some time to complete was Neera the wild mage and even that ended on such a poor note I genuinely got angry at the devs for thinking that this was the way you end a companion quest line. Another major issue to me is the fact that the companions will just leave out of the blue. Now, I have to say I don't mind the idea that companions can leave or even turn on you if they don't like what you are doing, it's something that could happen in Planescape Torment and I loved it there. The issue here is that there is no warning other than a complaint made halfheartedly , and they can leave almost immediately after getting them. I ran into a drow elf and helped her out, and she started to travel with us. I ran between 2 different side areas, helped someone out, and next thing I knew she was gone. No warning, she just left the party and all the stuff I gave her was gone.

The combat is fine, it's the AD&D rules set and while I never played it in the tabletop format it works fine here. My only major issue with it is that the rogue I had in my group, Imoen, would refuse to detect traps until she was right on top of them and at that point they had already gone off. 

As for the story, something that this game gets very high praise for and what I wanted to care more about other than the combat, it just isn't well done. The prologue holds my attention but once I hit chapter 2 i'm bored out of my mind. You don't feel like what you're doing is connected to what happened to you in the prologue, and while the whole thing is actually connected it really isn't revealed until the end of chapter 3 or 4 where you learn what's going on, but by that point I just didn't really care. I get that this is supposed to be the first half of a campaign with Baldur's Gate 2 being the second awesome half where all the cool stuff happens and the story comes to a close but if I was playing in a tabletop campaign that had a slow first half and the DM said ""I know it's boring now but just put up with all of this till the second half of the campaign, it gets much better I promise"" I would walk away, because i'm not gonna put in the time to wait half a campaign to get to what the DM considers to be the good moments when the DM could have just made the first half of the campaign have awesome moments. 

Now, you can't compare this game to the newer CRPG's on the market, as time has gone on where newer games will perfect what Baldur's Gate did. However, I find that even comparing this game to other CRPG's released around the same time it still doesn't compare. The 2 major ones coming to mind that I can compare this game to is Planescape Torment and Icewind Dale 1. Planescape Torment is a smaller game than Baldur's Gate but the story held my attention all the way through and had much more interesting companions with companion quests that didn't suck. I enjoyed every moment of that game and the philosophy it poses is really intriguing and made me want to go back and do another play-through sometime soon. Now one could argue that Planescape Torment is a different kind of CRPG in that it's less combat focused and much more story focused than Baldur's Gate  and that's why the story was better, and beccause of this I have to talk about Icewind Dale 1. Icewind Dale has much less of a story and is much more combat focused than Baldur's Gate, and I would still argue that Icewind Dale has a better story. The game is much smaller than Baldur's Gate and because of that it leads to a more streamlined well told story because everywhere you go to is tied to the main story, it isn't like Baldur's Gate where you can end up in a bunch of the unmarked side areas that aren't important. In Icewind Dale everywhere you go is important and I remember that story so much more because of that.

In conclusion, while I get that Baldur's Gate 1 is the game that heavily influenced the CRPG genre into becoming what it is today, I would rather play the games that came out only a year or 2 afterwards as they  do what Baldur's Gate 1 tried to do so much better in my eyes. I do plan on playing Baldur's Gate 2 still as people say it is the better of the 2 games, but at this moment in time I'm gonna hold off as the amount of wariness this game instilled in me makes me afraid the sequel will be the same or worse.

I completely and totally recommend this if you ever played it when it or Icewind Dale were first released. You will surely not be disappointed in how this enhanced edition holds up. But, if you're a younger gamer who cut their RPG teeth on Elder Scrolls or any other games released in the last ten years, you might be in for a disappointment and I think it's only fair to be honest here: this game came out in December of 1998. It's a great game, but a mechanical step down if you're spoiled by games with modern graphics.

If you can step over that hurdle, this is one of the classics that every gamer should play through at least once. The storytelling is solid, the humor is consistent, the character building is what D&D was all about. Walk around like an overhead RPG, then spacebar to pause/unpause for refined control of the action in battle. Want to be a ridiculously powerful evil mage? Done. A noble paladin? Got it. A thief who just steals everything not nailed down with the help of the save and load feature? I mean, sure. The best experience is with all the DLC and the sequel, as you can transfer your characters from one game to the next and the DLCs unlock some extra levels which helps in curbstomping enemies.

So, if you're a pen and paper RPG fan or a nostalgia buff or one of the every-gamer-who-should-experience-this that I mentioned earlier, this is a classic RPG experience. Just don't buy this thinking you're getting Skyrim or Final Fantasy XV. This is a game that's worth the full price, although since you really want to get the two Baldur's Gate and two Icewind Dale games and all the DLC to properly go through the entire story, maybe you get it on sale because that's a lot of game to buy at once.",1625372804,1625372804,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My biggest Con for this game would be the weird difficulty ramp. It starts out quite difficult with many enemies killing your player character in one hit. After your party hits level two and even more so at level 3 the game just gets so much easier. Now I stomp everything that comes my way.

It's one of those timeless games where you can play it 20+ years after it was released and it still makes you disappear from reality for 5 hours like it was nothing. 

Baldur's Gate is an rpg based on Dungeons and Dragons 2nd edition. If you're completely new to Dnd, it might take a bit of learning to understand a few core concepts like Armor Class and damage dice, but the game gives you a decent explanation at the start. I'll be honest, I've played this game dozens of times since I was very young, and I still have not committed to memory what THAC0 means. 

Baldur's Gate has a lot more story and reading that a lot of games you might be used to. That's a feature, not a bug. The story and dialogue include some of the best parts of the game. Another great thing about these old dnd games, is that side-quests are both lengthy and rewarding. You hear people complain about modern single player games when they only feature an 8-hour linear story. While Baldur's Gate side quests might not be 8 hours long, you can sometimes take 4 hours or so on a well-written and engaging side-quest that will reward you with loot and a more fleshed out interpretation of the world.  

A few things are different between this version of Baldur's Gate and the original. I still have the CD's sitting at my folk's place, but they don't work on my newer computer. Some menu stuff is different. A lot of it I think is a matter of preference, but I have to say I like the old Journal better. The new map is nifty how it zooms in and out. For all the things they did fix, I can't fathom why they didn't fix the clunky movement. In the game, you'll probably have a party of 6 adventurers, and they quite regularly get tangled up when they try to go through narrow spaces and whatnot. That would have been my #1 thing to fix, but you get the authentic Baldur's Gate experience. 

One final note, I and many other people have always liked Baldur's Gate II even better. A big reason for this is because in Baldur's Gate 1, you start at level 1. Thematically it makes sense, but combat flows quickly in real time as the game processes the turns taken by all the characters and enemies, and when you're level 1, you can get 1 shot from a stray critical hit from just about anything. If you choose to play a mage, you could be getting one shot from level 1 all the way until you reach level 4, and you'll probably end the game around level 8. So this game is one where you'll want to be saving every couple minutes. On my most recent playthrough I purposely made a tanky fighter because it's just annoying to play a level 1 mage and get one shot from a bandit's arrow. 

I realized I kind of focused on the bad things, but Baldur's Gate is a true classic. The storytelling is great. The customization regarding what type of character you want to play is great. The world is very well fleshed-out. It'll drag you in for hours on end and you won't know where the time went. And then you get to play Baldur's Gate II afterwards which is even better.",1625012323,1625012323,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You don't have enough inventory space to carry their junk after they get killed, so that all gets left behind unless you root around to maximize the value of your inventory- not that it matters since there's virtually nothing worth spending your money on anyways. Every which way you turn, another ridiculously overpowered enemy is waiting to get dog-piled and somehow still kill all 5 characters in your party without taking a single hit after a solid minute of combat, even with party members equipped with magic gear and casting spells on them!

This was my first time through it as I was much too young to have played it when it originally came out, and it really did hold up. Some things are pretty dated, like the inventory, but at the root of it all is the great RPG gameplay you would want. I know some people recommend starting with the second game instead and it feels like you would be doing yourself a disservice doing that. The beginning is for sure that old Gygax play style of just being brutal and aiming for a party wipe, but you get pretty powerful pretty quick with some exploration. The difficulty options introduced are really nice, as you can scale back and forth if you find yourself getting stuck and can't figure out a way around it. The story itself is just interesting too and I found that it did a very nice regional crisis story while still feeling very personal for the main character. I'm sure I could replay this game with a different class and party and have a thousand variations to each encounter, it is a vast system of skills and gear. Final thing, make sure you explore around the world, you don't want to miss the expansion content that it does not steer you towards. Some of that content is the best of the whole game and left an impression.

To be blunt it's been awful, riddled with bugs, and full of useless upgrades that are sometimes worse than useless.  Today's version is completely useless, so bad that I can't even play it any more.  There is no mouse, hasn't been for months.  You can't play the game without a mouse you see.  Beamdog resolutely refuses to admit there are bugs in their product, even though there are more than in the average roach motel.

There was an awful problem with action music coming on and staying on that was introduced with a ""patch"" that came out soon after the EE game came out.  Developers refused to admit they could duplicate it, until in a hurried rush, they fixed it with the advent of the disastrous BG 1.5.  Their computer was probably one of the few playing the game that couldn't duplicate the problem.  They finally ""fixed"" the problem by causing the forum threads about it to disappear.  They also introduced a revised method of reporting bugs, that makes it virtually impossible to report a bug.  I tried to report a problem on the new, improved bug reporting system, and couldn't even get logged in on it.

This game was better before it was modified in any way, except to upgrade the code to make it play on a modern computer.  My suggestion to Beamdog is to jettison all the new crap you've loaded on it (including BG 1.5) and publish as it was to start with.  Believe me you have added nothing worthwhile to the original.

Today I finally removed both Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2 from my computer.  I can only hope that some kindly company in the future ugrades the coding of the original game without trying to fleece it for all the money it's worth.  I was not compensated for this review.  I bought the game for myself.

Daniel J. Connors

There have been no changes since I first wrote this review.  The latest ""improvement"" by Beamdog once again makes your mouse disappear at the very start of the game.  It's hard to believe that a worse company could have taken over the Balur's Gate series.

Beamdog has now added permanent banning for a first offence to both its  Baldur's Gates games.  I made a SINGLE COMMENT on the Baldur's Gate 2 forum, criticizing my permanent ban from the BG1 forum and was IMMEDIATELY AND PERMANENTLY BANNED from that forum.  I have tried to report this police state behavior to STEAM, but have not been able to find a way.  I believe the company should be permanently removed from its possession of this game on STEAM.

As  of April 25, 2021 the game is still completely unplayable.  Beamdog has taken what was once a great game and completely ruined it.  I continue to hope that someday they will lose the franchise to the game, and that it will be taken over by a company with some moderate degree of skill and respect for the original game.  But I'm certainly not holding my breath.",1515054876,1619329019,False,12,4,0.432854652404785156,3,True,False,False

It was amazing then and you know what, it still is! Beamdog's Enhanced Edition has everything original Baldur's Gate had + a lot of improvements. I could talk about support for higher resolutions or widescreen but those are given, and of course a great improvement to the old classic. I could talk about 2D, painted backgrounds but those are great and did not aged at all. I cannot tell the same about characters' sprites but those only look bad when you zoom in (a new addition in EE version). The music is great and the voice acting too.

The most important part for me though is the world, story of my character and his/her companions and RPG elements. If you are familiar with D&D and Faer√ªn, you will instantly fall in love with the computer version of it. You will spend hours on character creation screen to make sure you get those dreamed dice rolls and you know what? You will love every second of it! You will start your adventure and if RPGs (not some modern action RPGs like Witcher 3) are your thing, you will sink into the game wanting to know more and more of the story. The world of Sword Coast will be open to you and your companions (and with Beamdog's 4 new characters you will be able to choose 5 out of 29!). You will not get any question marks or exclamation marks on the map. But do not be scared, you will never get lost. You are free to roam and discover the world and by exploring you will find a lot of great, interesting places. You may or may not find quests by talking to NPCs. You will know where to go by reading your journal or quests description. 

I mentioned earlier that you can compose your party of 6 by acquiring 5 additional companions out of 29. It does not mean that any party will do. Some companions do not go well along with others. They will express their feelings, attitude and will comment on your achievements (or lack of those). They may fight with each other when their alignment is in opposition. They may ask you for a favor before permanently joining your company. I finished the games a few times and I did not check all of them, and I am not sure if I ever will, there is so many possibilities. I tested 3 out of 4 newly added characters (Baeloth, Dorn and Neera) and they meet high Baldur's Gate's standards. Baeloth is my favourite and will suite the evil party nicely (not recommended for a first play-through in my honest opinion).  

It is also worth mentioning that the EE includes the expansion pack Tales of the Sword Coast. It adds the best dungeon in the game, the Durlag's Tower. It is not only huge but also greatly designed and it scratches the itch to dungeon crawl. It presents a challenge but also adds great rewards. Worth visiting by any adventurer and 'must see' place for every Dwarf!

I could write more about combat, spells, enemies but there was so much already written about this game that I will just say that: Metacritic User Score: 89, Metascore 91. I know that EE has lower scores and I will never understand why as it is good old Baldur's Gate with some quality of life changes plus some great additions.

Somethings about the EE, though. It definitely seems easier than the original - whether thats because the game is paused during inventory and better pathfinding - or whether it was made easier, I'm not sure.
Siege of Dragonspear is an odd one. Somehow, I'm really unable to get into it, the way I was with the original games. It feels like ToB - where you buff, you fight and you rest. There doesn't seem to be the sense of a vast world waiting to be explored.

However now that I have beaten the game I can easily say this is one of THE BEST games I have ever played. This is the original Divinity Original Sin or Pillars of Eternity. I encourage you to stick with it if you are thinking of trying it out.

Here are a couple tips for things that were not immediately obvious to me when I started.

- Armor class and chance to hit do not work the same way they do in D&D 5E. AC is called THAC0 ""To hit armor class 0"". In this case lower numbers are good, high numbers are not.
- Quicksave ALL THE TIME. This is a hard game, you will need to quicksave and reload quite often and rethink your strategies for fights.
- When your characters are out of spells or injured you will need to rest to heal them. If you have any healers in your party they will automatically cast their healing spells on rest. You can rest in the wild or at an inn, and do it as many times as you need.
- If one of your characters dies you can revive them at a temple in one of the cities. Its not quite obvious HOW to do this though. When talking to the priest you have to click on the grey portrait of your dead character and then the revive option will become available. The dead character will then respawn next to you, and you will have to go back to where they died to pick up their items.
- Some of the potential party members have timed quests. Some party members (like Montaron and Xzar) will leave the party if you do not complete their initial quest soon enough. This is not initially obvious until all the sudden they walk out on you when you are in the middle of something. If a party member starts complaining you need to address their concerns so they do not leave. If you really need to I think you can edit a game file to adjust the timing so they won't leave right away.",1617632434,1617632434,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the context I am a Dungeon Master whom really didn't like the books setting because I didn't have any childhood nostalgia so I almost always wrote my own DnD Settings.

Let me get into this review though.

You start by rolling a character. Yes rolling as you can kinda just roll the dice over and over and over until you get the stats you want. I would prefer a point buy that player can set so you can be as Under powered or overpowered as you would like. Maybe have an achievement for beating the game ""Peasant"" 10's on each stat. and let players be as strong as they want to be without re-rolling stats 1300 times (This is not an exaggeration sometimes.)

I started with my 6 man Meme team of Alex Jones, Feedle Dee Keys, DORF (The elf hunter), Gorions person, Bark Souls the Berserker, and Pharrel Williams the Bard. I realised I was missing a lot of plot elements having a party like this though so I started from scratch and entered a more serious Play through as Gorions Ward ""Faith"" a Fighter Cleric.

I resolved the Iron Crisis, Fought Bandits, but all this culminated in Durlags Tower... DAMN what a very satisfying dungeon! Filled to the brim with traps and monsters and puzzles and lore. I loved this thing.

The main story is Alright but it's 2e so the games systems are all ""Magic Items"" and potions. The armor class also works... Backwards? Using this weird Thac0 system.. Gonna be real Thac0 sucks but it basically replaces ""attack"" and Armor class. Smaller numbers is better more or less for AC.

It's a DnD style (DnD Advanced rule set) with a top down display that has a customized pause setting for people who want more control over game play during battle.
I've beaten it using all classes and on all difficulties. This game is for players who enjoy the main story and play right through, but the real value comes from all of the side story stuff. When you know what to do in this game, the mechanics, and have experimented with everything, you can beat this game in about 40 minutes. You heard me right. (I should note that in order to get to that point, I was already a player for years.) 
When played well, this game offers around 50-60 hours of amazing stories, tough (and I mean friggen ridiculously though) fights, music, playable companions and their story lines, forgotten ruins, bar fights, drunk d-bags, beautiful women, and lore. You want lore? This game has more lore than any game I've ever played.
 This game is a classic in it's own right. What you see isn't just what you get, because this game has so much more to offer. It has DLC, an amazing sequel and I can honestly say that once you've finished everything (DLC, sequel and sequel DLC) You'll look back on your character and everything they went through over those 150-250 hours of gameplay and feel like you've grown as well. 

My advice as a seasoned player, Take your time. Read the conversations, ALWAYS check for traps and learn how to build a good team with the characters the game provides. The enhanced edition has an option to build the whole party from scratch but I can honestly say, don't do that, you miss out on the ability to build relationships and have wonderfully written story line moments with your characters. If you want to build the whole party and don't care for the party growth, play Icewind dale instead.

For this review to be fair, i wont compare the game to the nowadays top down rpgs like Tyranny or Kingmaker or Pillars of Eternity. I will however compare this game to Icewind Dale, a game which shares more or less the same graphics, it follows the same gameplay principles, is set in the same setting and was published in the same period or so as Baldur's Gate. I will make no comments on graphics or character creation as it was based in an old and pretty strict pen and paper D&D version.

I have read many players commenting about how Baldurs Gate I is a game that stands out for it's story... I guess the story is... well it's boring... 

The prologue wins your interest, then you meet your first companion and begin to play the game... The thing about BG is that it offers lots of maps to explore, most of them though are not related to the story... This means that you are dumping the storyline and walk around for days upon days exploring maps and dungeons as if the main enemy is waiting for you to catch up... In the case of Icewind Dale most sidequests were either linked or were in the way of the main story... The heroes would literally solve quests which found on their way to the ultimate goal and not valse around to another area Ignoring the real threat for a ""fetch me"" quest as far as BG goes...

The games sidequests are also boring... ""Fetch me bandit scalps oh good adventurer"" (how the hell am i to play a good sided party when i am asked to gather the scalps of the outlaws you had me killed and not somehow bring to justice???), ""My cow is sick and needs medicine, fetch it"", ""I lost my boots to the enemy, fetch it"", ""I lost my cloak to the enemy, fetch it"", ""I was attacked by ""x"" enemies, kill them"", ""My hunband is missing, find him"", """"x"" son is gone missing, find him"" and the list goes on with quest missing context and  feeling... On the other side of the table in Icewind Dale i remember trying to find a Rose Made of Ice for a bard who was banished from his home for loving the kings daughter, and his quest in order to win her hand was to travel around the world searching for the flower in order to be able to return home and marry her. You meet him in a bar, drinking his days in sorrow after years of searching and not finding it... Eventually you had it forged in secret by a kick @ss blind dwarven crystal master smith who was literally guarding the way to a key npc of the story!! Side quest completed while running for main story... Or another, when i met a whole tower of undead Elves, some were mad and attacked others had their unique background and seeked my help in order to move on to afterlife...

Two games of the same period, two very different approach of how a story should be told... In BG from a certain point and on you literally ""farm"" around the maps of creeps, completing mindlessly the sidequests just for the crappy xp reward and low level gear. No sense of epicness. No sense of your party being heroes... There was no drive to play the main story at all, it was made clear of what was happenning since chapter 3 or 4? out of the total 7 and the only thing hanging was your heritage probably the only cool part in this whole game... In Icewind Dale on the other hand, every time you though you had found who was responsible for the events which were taking place, another clue or npc would pop up offering light to what you already knew and shifting the sand until the very end where you met the enemy and i was ""holy hell, no one prepared me for such and epic battle...""

Timed quests... Jesus, really... who thought of those... You would have an npc giving you a quest but failing to mention that it should be done pronto, as if in 5 days or 1 month or something to hint that you need to hurry... This lead me to failed quests and reloading older saves backtracking and moving on... And ofc the npc had to join your party which meant you had to leave behind your favorite and dressed up set up to get the underleveled and undergeared npc in a cavern carrying him as a deadload, excluding him from combat or having him using range attacks just to be able to keep him at distance until the quest was completed and dumped at the nearest point to pick up your favorite companion again, who by the way had lost the xp of the quest since he was off party....

I have read in the Internet that there lots of hidden stuff to be found etc, but seriously who gives a crap about a tome which increases your stat, when the core of a game (the story) is boring and most of the sidequests are just a dissapointment...

Crappy gear... It took me several hours of gameplay to get my hands on some magical items, and there are very few choises at that... There is probably only 1???? 2h sword of worth? No Bastard sword loot? and in general all magic/special items resolve around very certain weapons in the game... the rest of the categories for some reason are left out forcing the player either playing with simple non magical items which later on are a terrible drug for combat, or entirely throw away their proficiencies and start to play with whatever comes their way hoping for the better... 

I haven't played the DLCs yet, and I haven't tried the BG 2 game either, I will though out of sheer stuborness... (blame the dwarf in me). Following the formentioned points of dissappointment it's no wonder why i have always started the game in the past and dumped it somewhere along the way....

To conclude this extensive review mostly on the games storytelling, I wouldn't recommend the game unless you find it on a good discount. Even then buy it knowing that this is a pass timer game, keep your expectations on story telling low and make sure you read on the internet which weapons are the most common to be found in magic or special edition and build you heroes around those choises.

This game is very old and is bad compared to modern games. Most modern games, have better UI for casting spells and displays for AoE spells like fireball. It uses 2nd edition which is a bad edition of DnD. Some parts of the game feel slightly tedious and there is little input after character creation outside of spell selection and weapon proficiency. This is because it's based on second edition and 2nd edition is bad. The Enhanced Edition has a higher XP cap than the original. The XP cap is stupid and punishes what should be a valid play style. It should be a valid strategy to have a smaller party and get higher XP from being a small party. Kingmaker has that feature implemented and it's kind of balanced.

The visuals, the music, the writing, the gameplay, the story - it's all fantastic.

I don't know what I can say about this game that hasn't been said before. I've been playing this game for the last fifteen years and I haven't gotten bored of it. I don't think I ever will.

I'm not blind to its flaws though. Once you reach the titular city the pacing kind of goes out the window and you have no reason in the story to explore the massive world this game throws at you. The companions are a little flat and there are loads of them, since I think the devs assumed that people would play this game with the mindset that they were disposable - hence why there are so many thieves you can obtain at different points in the game.

That massive world is also just a little too massive. There's not too much to do in it, but I honestly find it really relaxing to just walk around while listening to the music and diegetic sound.

There's up to 100 hours of content in this game alone. You have the main questline, the countless side quests, the areas to explore, numerous dungeons to crawl, the companions to meet, and so much more. I am of the opinion that this game contains the best dungeon in an RPG, ever, in the form of Durlag's Tower. The mystery, the puzzles, the battles, and the story are interwoven brilliantly.

Durlag's Tower is part of the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion released shortly after the original. Sometimes I want to replay Baldur's Gate, and then I remember this content, and I'm instantly convinced to make a fresh character.

Beamdog also contributed some new content in the Enhanced Edition, beyond just the quality of life improvements (and system overhaul). Four new NPCs join the fray, and they're a bit more in line with what you've come to expect from cRPGs in the modern day. That is to say, very chatty.

Their writing is pretty good though, and I'd say they fit into the game quite well. There's Rasaad, Dorn, Baeloth, and Neera - my favourite. They're hit or miss characters, and they're easily dismissible in their first encounter. All of them, with the exclusion of Baeloth, have their own unique quest that scores you some pretty neat loot and character interactions.

Baeloth is more of an easter egg character. He appears in Larswood after you hit level 5. He debuts in the arena mode that the Enhanced Edition ships with - the Black Pits.

It's what it sounds like. A pit fighting mode where you make a party of up to six characters and fight enemies of increasing power at the behest of *Baeloth the Entertainer!* It's fun for a good four hours, but it's not for everyone.

Yeah so play this game, please. It's good.",1543039980,1616741218,True,1,0,0.501187682151794434,0,True,False,False

Back to the store I went, and this time bought the game split across four CDs!

I've played a fair share of the late 80s and early 90s games (Wizardry, M&M, Gold Box SSI games) so putting up with a bad UI and other problems doesn't bother me too much, I can still enjoy the old-school experience, and that's why I won't leave a negative review. Would I ever consider recommending this game to my peers or friends? Definitely not. Honestly speaking, you can skip this one and go straight to Baldur's Gate II.

I can see why, for a game that came out in 1998, the mechanics are deeper than a lot of RPGs being released today. Gameplay has aged quite well. I can clearly see how Bioware went from this to Dragon Age: Origins, one of my favourite games of all time.

The story is also okay. The only thing I didn't like were the graphics but that can be excused as it is an older game.

The siege of Dragonspear expansion is not necessary as you cannot continue your progression in it to Baldur's Gate II: EE and I didn't like the story.

This rerolling also isn't optional, you're REQUIRED to have good stats even on regular difficulties because in this game there's tons of ambushes, assasins and fights in small, tightly packed areas which makes kiting really hard and if you have low stats, you'll literally be one shot by enemies. Even with maxed out CON, you will most likely be one shot by strong enemies at the start of the game, so you absolutely need maxed out DEX and that's before going into anything actually relevant to your character class that you want to play! The fact that there are 4 higher difficulty levels than that, which buff enemies far more in their damage, more attacks per round, better hit rate, better evasion and significant HP boost makes me question the sanity of the people who came up with this. On the comple opposite end of spectrum, Story mode difficulty literally makes your entire party unable to die!!!

The battles in this game sometimes relegate to me just standing and waiting while both parties keep missing for literally 3-4 minutes straight, with my shooters missing like 30 arrows in a row against a target less than 5 feet away from them even with good stats and being proficent in bows. I probably wouldn't mind so much but you can't retrieve any of these arrows that they miss and they cost gold!

You're also unable to run in this game, everyone just casually hobbles on a slow and steady pace. This makes navigation of the large open world areas take way longer than they should.

Issues that existed already when the game came out are even more obvious now, such as sometimes objects and treasures being literally completely lost in the backgrounds and sometimes doors and entrances to places being totally hidden, so you have to hover around playing ""where's the entrance"" on top of the buildings with the entrance area being very small and sometimes, you may not even realize that it was a place you could enter because of that. This is very annoying, since it's required to do as even these ""where's the entrance"" buildings sometimes contain important things, such as quests and followers that you may miss if you don't do it. There's option to turn these ugly floating text boxes and highlighting all containers and such, but it actually doesn't highlight any of the ""where's the entrance"" buildings entrances, only the super obvious and in clear view doors!!

The enhanced edition has removed all the video cinematics, especially cutting away the iconic intro was a real shame.

The game that started it all.  Bioware's love letter to DnD and western RPGs created a PC-oriented WRPG renaissance that spurred the creation of dozens of classics including the incomparable Baldur's Gate 2, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment and non-Infinity titles like Morrowind and Fallout 3.  All in all, Baldur's Gate sets the stage for all the tropes and key elements that led to countless classics.  Yes, the game is a bit slow.  Yes, very little happens in it, compared to other more grandiose titles but, ultimately, such faults can be forgiven for giving birth and spawning such a parade of excellence.

New characters which were added in Enchanced Edition are fine, boosts the replay value for returning players.
Siege of Dragonspear is a solid however not groundbreaking add-on which goes definitely over the top. With everything, the amount and quality of magical items, characters with archetypes straight from Disney movies, amount of NPC on screen and so on.

the magic system seems pretty cool, but the area of effect of most spells is usually so big that your party gets encompassed within the spell if you try to use it during a fight against one opponent, and alot of the time the same happens with groups as they tend to group together to attack your party

basilisks are one of the most annoying enemies given that they have the ability to petrify your whole party, so good luck if youre too poor to afford enough reversal spells

magic traps seem to home in/move too fast for you to dodge, making them instant death traps if your health pool isnt big enough. another problem is that sometimes they are unavoidable, and unless you have a mage or thief in your party, i dont know how you would even detect them, let alone disarm them.

Pros: ... it's a capital C Classic, I guess... ?
Cons: Repetitive combat based on sheer luck; identical locations; bare-bones story; interchangable characters; outdated graphics
Length: Probably at least 50 hrs, based once again on your luck more than anything else
Verdict: This is a disappointment all around. If you are a fan of good Bioware games like Dragon Age 1 or Mass Effect trilogy - then skip this game, because it has nothing on them. Characters are completely interchangable - you can't talk to them, you can't argue with them, and if you leave them they will be standing there for eternity, waiting for you to come back. This game has suprisingly low amount of text/writing compared to a modern 'revival' cRPGs like Pillars of Eternity, and whatever it has, it is boring. Combat system based on some DnD rules is atrocious (you can spend minutes trying to hit somebody and be missing them) and the only way I found to play Baldur's Gate and to get some enjoyment is in Story Mode. Don't bother with this; there is a dozen better modern cRPGs instead, like Divinity games or Tyranny etc. 3/10.

I wish I could give everyone the experience of how mind blowing this game was for me. I went from games, like Mario, Alley Cat and Crystal Caves, which were pure 2D games in four colours, to this colour rich, gorgeous scenery in isometric detail. 
It was like someone vision impaired being able to get full vision and not only in a regular way but in a fantastical world, with more abilities, such as seeing infrared and ultraviolet. I started playing Dungeons and Dragons shortly before playing Baldur's Gate, seeing the rule books come to life in such a fluid way on PC was a mountain of icing and cherries on an ocean sized cake.

I am currently going through my eighth play through, this time with a friend that has stuck with it for more than half the game and been drawn into it now, to the point where they are asking when we can continue playing it. 
Admittedly, I am a little too experienced, we flew through content, my characters are min-maxed, we started clearing map areas just to hunt for some experience to tackle the next bit of the story more. This lead us to Durlag's Tower at only level four, having completed Naskel, the Stronghold, the bridge and every map area south of the Friendly Arm Inn. For some reason, I had never completed the tower, I have gone up it a few times but this was the first time I realised that we could go down.
Durlag's Tower was gruelling, we had our first party wipes, multiple times, had to come up with more tactics, use scrolls, wands and potions for the first time. This totally optional bit of game play was a delightful, ""Easter Egg"" for me to stumble over, all these many, many years later.

Classically, it is 1000 xp. I tried a thief and a mage. This makes playing an evil character difficult, because if you do not turn in the quests for xp, but rather decide to keep the items yourself for your own use, you have a very hard time leveling.

Also, the Open AL files download as old or corrupt. You, then, have to figure-out that this is the problem, and then find where to fix this. So sad. Wonderful classic game.

This game was classically hard in a couple of spots, but now it has been tweaked to make it nearly impossible on any mode that is normal or above. Modern game developers don't seem to know what ""fun"" is. ""Fun"" is when I don't have to re-do battles over and over again on normal level pulling out all stops and hoping for a better die roll. THAT is hard-cord. That should be the hardest possible level. I should not have to play through on story-mode (which here is stupidly easy) or the next easiest mode, then import my character to start them at a higher level to be able to play normal or above. 

""Fun"" is choosing whether or not to stress your heart with the frustration of very challenging battles, but ""fun"" is not engaging in one impossible battle after the other, having to edit a character or game file to get what you need to succeed. I want a vanilla experience, in that I do not need to edit things to tweak my character to be able to succeed in the game. I accept reloading once or twice at the Friendly Arm in, at the end of the mines, and a few other spots, but not nearly constantly. 

Devs should remove the 25 strength off of the story mode. That's what I'm meaning with stupidly easy. Normal should mean monsters do normal damage and characters do normal damage. They are the same hd as the characters (bzw if there are 6 lvl 2 characters, the hit dice of the monsters matches that). Go down one level, the monsters do 75% damage and are 75% hd of characters total. Story mode should be monsters do 50% damage and are 50% hd to characters total + characters cannot die. Up from normal should be monsters EITHER are x2 hd of characters OR they do 150% damage, OR they are 125% of both hd and damage. The hardest level should be EITHER x3 hd to characters OR 200% damage.

Battles should be being hd scaled based on party content. This wasn't as easy back when this was developed and may not be possible now. If not, then battles should be based off of anticipated party content. It is expected that there will be 1-4 hd of characters, scale for 2, if it is not dynamically scalable. 

Beam Dog digs its hands too far into these old classics, messing them up. They are not made better. They are made stupider to match the modern trend of catering to power-gamers, rather than leaving us RPGers something to enjoy.",1576482365,1611637644,False,1,2,0.377668946981430054,0,True,False,False

Since I'd bought the Enhanced Editions on sale a couple of years back, I decided to try them out just to see if they were as good as I remembered....

It's been about 22 years since the original Baldur's Gate was released, and the age of this game does show, despite Beamdog's tweaks. A more modern game to compare it against would be Pillars of Eternity, which feels very similar, despite the 15 year gap between the two games. For starters, the in-game character models look blurry, and I cannot fathom why Beamdog added an option to let you zoom in on your characters when all it does it make them look even more blurred. Combat animations are stiff and jerky - don't get me started on the monk's unarmed attack, which looks like he's trying to kick a can while standing on an ice rink, or characters fighting with two weapons, who look like they're attempting to play the drums. The AI is also utterly brain dead; your characters will continually walk into each other in combat when you're trying to get your seriously injured fighter to swop places with the cleric behind him while an angry ogre is bearing down on you, and they routinely get stuck on obstacles when you click on them to move to an area far away from where they are. Enemies will moronically attack the characters in your party that are closest to them, so for example, a group of bandits with bows will all shoot at the fighter walking towards them instead of the mage just standing a little further back who happens to be busy casting a fireball spell. The early part of the game can be quite unforgiving while your characters are still 1st or 2nd level, and an unlucky random encounter while travelling on the overland map can easily result in your adventure coming to a premature end. Also, the game uses the Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition rule set and the learning curve can be quite steep for those people who've never played the tabletop version of the game. There is also very little actual voice acting in the game so you will have to read lots of text, but this won't be a problem if you're accustomed to games like Pillars of Eternity.    

On the plus side, the gameplay is quite addictive with lots of areas to explore, things to do and freedom to play the way you want. The game doesn't hold your hand, as levelling up is extremely slow by today's standards, and you are encouraged to think a bit both in and out of combat. The hand drawn backgrounds like the forests and towns are still lovely to look at, even by today's standards, and the game runs smoothly, with no in-game monetization or loading screens to contend with!

If you haven't played this before and you enjoy party based RPGs with real time combat like Pillars of Eternity, what are you waiting for? Even if you're a Baldur's Gate veteran like myself, it's nice to return to the game again just to be able to play it in Windows 10 with the enhancements Beamdog has added to it.",1610559244,1610559244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With a callback to the Advanced Dungeon & Dragons 2nd edition rules, it's already gotten me all nostalgic, and to be short and sweet, I recommend the game as it is a classic and a fun game, unlike the modern 5e D&D system. 

The interaction between NPCs, PCs and the choices really make this game fun, with the many options for interactions, Charisma being a helping factor and absolutely broken spell combinations, I can get immersed in the game for hours (one of the few games that does that for me).
The game feels like an AD&D game, it got me immersed and with the many, MANY NPCs who wants to join you, the replay-ability of the game is fantastic. I've often come back, again, and again just to see the different party makeups, or make my own. With the different settings for the game as well bringing you closer to the true AD&D rules, it brings both punishment and reward for the older players. 

The Siege of Dragonspear was more fun because I played it in Coop with a friend, and we were busy making fun of the writing than actually getting immersed in the game. I can't really recommend Siege of Dragonspear because the writing and story alone read like a snarky person, everything was either sarcastic, poor attempts for being witty or downright evil comments. The story too made me laugh more than anything, with the main antagonist being said to have almost a thousand swords by their side and the Good People having barely 500 swords.

This is not the first time I've played the game (I owned the originals when they were first released) but it has been over a decade since I last played. 

Regarding the basic game (ignoring the Enhanced parts):  This is THE rpg game for me.  I've played others, but in the end Baldur's gate  saga is the standard to judge by.  That said, if you had to get just one then go with BGII.  But, if you are willing to get both then include BG as well since then you can experience the full character arc, from lowly waif that needs to be careful of what you engage until you become an epic character from legends.  There are lots of choices you can make, companions to meet, and things to do.  So many so that you can replay and get a completely different experience just by changing what you want to focus on.

Regarding the enhancements:  bottom line is that they are worth it.  In particular, adjusting to modern screen sized, changes to inventory management, quick loot, etc. 

Regarding the Siege of Dragonspear: This was the weakest part of the saga, in part since it's pretty much linear.  That said, it's nice to close the gap between the end of BG and the start of BGII.  I certainly won't be skipping it on future playthroughs.

While there are some differences with the original version,  the enhanced version works well for more recent rigs and has some improvements with general game play.   Overall I think it to be worth it, especially for those wishing to take a trip down nostalgia lane or those who may be new to the Baldurs Gate series and like this style of game play and RPG should find it enjoyable.  HOWEVER......

BG1  (Siege of Dragonspear):   

For those interested in nostalgia, this may become an issue.  For those not having played from years past and this is their first run through with with having done BG1 once already, AND planning to play BG2, this also may become an issue.

SoD is an attempt by Beamdog to create a stream of continuity between BG 1 and BG 2 by explaining what happens between them(as there was originally a ""left to the players imagination"" gap in time before.

The story may not make some players feel clear(wont spoil it).  But also one of the biggest issues is that the equipment used in SoD is pretty strong, way more so than most of the BG1 gear and comparable to mid and just stepping into late game gear of BG2  as well.  This then makes the transition(again wont spoil) from Dragonspear to BG2 that much more frustrating(again with the story issues added). 

In my mind that's a serious imbalance. To put it bluntly,  Dragonspear is a monty haul that leaves the player feeling like it didn't need to be, especially with what happens in transition into BG2.  

Most of the story is a filler episode with only a very few things relating to the BG2 transition until the end of the story and in a way I didn't feel was plausible.  ***Sorry this time I will use a spoiler*** Having the the player's party go through building up(if played that way) through out BG 1 as heroes, then doing the same with massive fanfare even in the start of it) by the leaders of Waterdeep and the city's general population, have them again become huge heroes at the end based on what they do(again) and then because they are framed (and in a really badly written/'done way that is shark jump) for killing the daughter of 1 of the leaders of waterdeep(who was trusting of them throughout the events) and then all the rest of the leadership, people who earned rep with and worked with along the way during the siege story, is just completely and utterly a bad story ""twist"" (its not a twist, its just a bad plot hole).

Thus given the story's progression, the gear progression and more, SoD is just a sad mess.  It easily could've been done differently and more fitting into a good continuity gap, but instead it just has all the earmarks of some person wanting to put their rather mark on the franchise's story fumbling it like an amateur writer would and with a completely different writing voice making no attempt to have synergy with the writing previously.",1604516748,1607225945,False,9,0,0.585191965103149414,0,True,False,False

I played the original version when it first released in 1998, and finished it multiple times over the next few years. It was the first RPG I ever played, and the fact that I enjoyed it so much is what led me to other RPGs, from Baldur‚Äôs Gate 2 to NeverWinter Nights, Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, The Witcher, and many more.

The most important thing to say in this review is that, despite being such an old game (even this Enhanced Edition is now 7 years old), it still feels great to play. Its fair to say it doesn‚Äôt have the graphical quality of a modern game, but everything else ‚Äì the story, characters and combat are high quality. I‚Äôd say the best comparison among modern games is the Pillars of Eternity franchise.

And in some ways BG EE felt like a new experience for me. The last time I played the original was probably 15 years ago, and while I still had some clear memories of the companions I‚Äôd recruit into my party, and some of the locations you travel to during the main quest, I also found alot of interesting side quests during my 30 hour playthrough that I either missed before, or were new additions to the Enhanced Edition.

-REVIEW-
Happy 11th review to me! I think it's time I covered the game that has the longest playtime on my steam account(523 hours): Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. Old one, eh? Still, I'm no stranger to the fact that this game was very revolutionary in how CRPGs were done back in the day, and even now, classic gamers like myself still enjoy this tale as immortal as time itself.

Gameplay is where I typically start, and...well, I'll be up front: this game is pretty darn outdated. Is it BAD? 

Answer: Heck no. If anything, the fact that Pathfinder: Kingmaker uses a similar system with updated graphics and rulesets shows how well known the Infinity Engine is, and that's a good thing. If anything, I love the overhead perspective, as it complemets the way battles are fought incredibly well: with tactical decisions that require plenty of forethought and pausing. Heroes and enemies alike are highlighted and easy to see, and I love how easy to figure out the HUD is. There is a bit of a learning curve to the whole thing, but there's a helpful tutorial that will assist you. The more D&D-related stuff you may have to look around for on your own, but if you have any idea of how it works, the game won't be too hard to pick up on. All in all, it's a very well put together system of selecting characters, selecting their actions, and implementing them in the world in some way. However, I do have a fair number of complaints that have stuck with me for many years:

1. Character attributes-they aren't really bad in and of themselves; I have to admit it's pretty fun to set them to super high levels if you want, but I wish they didn't have to be so blasted high in general just to get some handy benefits. Worse, some attributes do roughly nothing for characters who need them(Intelligence is the worst; even for wizards it only affects how many spells they can memorize, and wisdom can be used for lore bonuses just as easily).

2. Attack rolls, armor class, and saving throws-not these three things themselves, but rather the fact that they improve by going DOWN whereas everything else improves by going UP! I mean, talk about confusing the newcomers! Don't get me wrong, the math is easier to figure out than one would think, but I feel like 3rd edition's d20 system saved people plenty of headaches.

3. Class balance-dear freaking god, say what you want about spellcasters in 3rd and 3.5, but even then, it felt like more classes could pull their weight effectively! Not to say any class is useless, but there's a few standouts: clerics are better than druids, monks have some handy abilities that are gated until the second game, beserkers are WAY better than barbarians, kensais are only optimal if you dual-class with a mage, and wild mages are basically RNGesus bullies, among other issues.

4. Reputation-Boy oh boy, be careful how far you want to go if you're EVIL! The rep system honestly doesn't affect much outside of shop prices and special abilities for main characters. Don't get me wrong, I love how you can choose different alignments and even make choices that fit with said alignment, but aside from discouraging murder-hobos, I hate how letting your rep drop to keep evil companions happy means huge markups and bounty hunters riding your butts regardless of how your rep decreased, whereas all high reppers have to worry about are not hiring evil companions. I know I'm meant to be a hero at the end of the day, but the whole system feels so alienating, especially since this is a single-player game, and the DM is just the computer.

So yeah, I have issues, but the fact that I can control a party of six and take them on an adventure through a huge world, going on quests to slay monsters, aid the downtrodden, and make a crap ton of money in the process is a nice trade-in. The world is basically your oyster once the prologue is behind you, and there's quite a lot to do; it's pretty easy to get incredibly powerful if you work at it long enough. Being able to alter the difficulty as needed is a nice touch as well.

So yeah, the game's pretty fun, all things considered, but what about the story? Take it from me: this plot is freaking brilliant. It isn't super deep, mind you, but it's cleverly put together in a way that not only fits whatever alignment you choose, but also allows the one character you make to be the star of the show, due to the fact that the plot happens to him/her. It does a great job of progressing from humble beginnings(a ""student"" of sorts, raised as an orphan) to an adventure of solving an iron shortage, dealing with bandit groups and slave mines, and eventually investigating the machinations of a vicious madman who murdered your foster father and seeks to bring about a war that will allow him to claim the title of an evil god slain years before. Granted, the pacing is god awful, considering you have an infinite amount of time to solve everything, and chances are you'll have to jump on some sidequests to gain levels and grab some handy equipment, but the whole thing is still pretty fun, considering that this game was the closest you could get to The Elder Scrolls before that franchise was a thing.

As far as characters go, the companions you can travel with are pretty much the standouts, aside from the big bad evil guy. They all have incredibly campy and cliche personalities that do get an eyeroll from me now and then, but they're all still cool in their own way, mainly because they feel like the virtual representation of how an irl DM might describe such characters. Some even have quests of their own to complete, which adds a fun dynamic of earning their assistance. Each character also comes with their own alignments, so be wary of your reputation, lest they decide to take a hike. Moreover, some companions will actually come to blows with each other. It's a clever way of seeing personalities clash, and can be pretty entertaining as long as it doesn't happen at the wrong time! Gameplay-wise, the companions run the gamut of classes you can play as, so you shouldn't have too much trouble getting a solid party put together. Just be sure to weed them out; some companions are way better than others.

In terms of aesthetics, sound design is pretty much awesome. Voice acting is typically over-the-top, though in an entertaining way, and the music is just freaking glorious, from the calm ambient outdoor tunes, to the dark and suspenseful themes of dungeons, to the thrilling fanfare of exciting battle music. I can recount several of the tunes in my head, so...memorable points! Graphics are...well, not quite as amazing, but hey, it's an older game, and even then, I love how the Infinity Engine used these beautiful settings for their locations, especially outdoors. The less appealing bit of eye candy comes mainly from the sprites themselves. They aren't bad at all themselves, but man, you can tell there are sprites in the game; the 2-D models tend to clash with the overall look. The magic spell effects are nice to look at, though.

I'm honestly amazed I've played this game so long(a good chunk of it was screwing around with the character creator, I tend to let my mind wander on how I might play the game with each character class), but I guess that shows how much of a classic it is to me. The ruleset isn't my favorite, and even hundreds of bugfixes and other additions can only add so much(I do appreciate them, though!), but in the end, I still have a great time with it. My only regret is that I haven't played the sequel more, as I feel that's one of only a few CRPGs better than this timeless game. If you're into 2nd edition AD&D, CRPGs in general, or have a thing for the classics, pick this title up. It's a game that will stand the test of time.

 (The poison damage is now a percentage of HP, at least at poisoned arrows, don't yet know how to feel about this, poison now is more dangerous to the high and low-levels alike, but slightly less to low-levels if they can heal themselves)

If you play it for the first time, there is alot of concepts to learn, not to mention spellcasting and restrictions on gear, class etc..

If you make it past the first 4 chapters the game starts to open up once you can get to Baldurs Gate itself. The game really makes you feel powerful and at the same time you can get rekt in no time once someone crucial to a fight fails their saving throw.. 

Having a well balanced party is important but you can do the whole game solo if you like, in fact going solo is very advantageous early game given the right build, as you can level up quickly on easy quests and then go about picking out a good party (which will level up to almost match your level in most cases, or even exceed it in a very few cases; since characters level differently based on their class choice).

That being said the real challenge is to avoid powergaming, savegame cheesing and metagaming or AI exploiting every major encounter.

The game adds in class kits from BG2, and some classes, like monk/sorcerer. Adds in a couple new npc teamates. This expands how much variety the game already has in it for multiple playthrus.

Playing the new stuff is fine, but if you know the original, it feels more rewarding to ignore the added stuff. Like if you look up speedruns for the game, you'll see only playthrus by a bard kit that wasn't available in original at all. Bard in original was a pretty tough class to choose.

As for difficulty, it adds story mode which will quickly let you get thru the game. I think that's great for players from BG3 who might want to see what the old story was all about!

Core difficulty is similar to what neutral was in original. But enemy spawns are reduced, so it is easier this time around. Above that, the game does well adding in more difficulties to challenge you! Even ones that weren't available in original, but are fun challenges. There's a lot of quality of life improvements, like having ammo stack to 80 instead of 20, that speed up the game too.

The combat might be un-intuitive at first. But if you set auto-pause options right, you'll quickly get a fast and effective rhythm going for controlling a party of six in any situation.

I'll start with the positives. The graphics in the Enhanced Edition are beautiful. I can't speak to the original because I've never played it. The hand drawn backdrop has a realistic feel to it, and really helps you engross yourself in each ""map or ""level."" The Infinity Engine really stands the test of time, and for a game that was released in 1998, the EE looks wonderful. The story is decent. It's not the best story I've ever had the pleasure of playing through, but it does the job. In the first half I wasn't very interested, but by the end I did actually end up caring about my decisions and how things turned out.

The bad. The combat is horrifically dated. Some people like real-time with pause combat, some don't. I'm in the ""it's bad"" camp. It feels clunky and weird to pause in the midst of combat, select your spells or actions, and then carry on. I understand that this game is attempting to follow DnD rules (which I'll be honest, I know barely anything about), but I think the combat could have been much better had it been turn-based. It feels like an RTS, but a shallow RTS that I don't enjoy battling in. Again, maybe if I had played the game nearer its release date, I'd care more for it. However, as it stands in 2020, it's not my cup of tea.

All in all, I think the game is good, but not great. I can see why people consider it great, considering that it was released in 1998. It definitely helped pave the way for future RPGs, and for that, I can appreciate it. Even though I didn't feel like I enjoyed it that much, I keep thinking back on it and I've started considering playing the second one.

Just understand what you're getting yourself into before you drop money on this game. If you're unsure whether you'd like it or not, I'd recommend waiting for a sale, especially if you're not used to older CRPGs.",1603831732,1603903506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first 1/3 of the game is such a boring experience imo (the first half of the base game campaign, including side quests), I almost dropped it. It just took me over 30 hours to get past the suck part, so most likely not something worth enduring for most, and something to keep in mind for new initiates to this genre of game. It may have helped father this genre of games, but it's earlier sections have not aged gracefully. 

The only reason I pushed forward in this game being I had already beaten Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 1, and wanted to beat the last of the 3 main classic CRPG's that people point back to for popularizing the genre. And to see what had inspired Pillars Of Eternity, one of my favorite games.

 Once you reach a high enough level to tackle the Tales of the Sword Coast DLC content, which includes the famous Durlag's Tower, and the 2nd half of the main story (the actual city of Baldur's Gate), everything picks up and becomes much smoother sailing. Until then, you will be fighting the game's rng combat system so much you will be spending alsot as much time on save and loading screens as you do playing the game.

It doesn't help that in the base game, all of the companions I had chosen were such one note character's, I felt nothing for them at all. Except for Minsc and his miniature giant space hamster pet, Boo. and even then, in the base game, there isn't all that much to expect in terms of party interaction. at least in the party composition I had. I guess the party is supposed to interact with each other with little lines here and there, and they do. It's just there were no interesting interactions that stood out to me, imo. 

This changes in the Siege Of Dragonspear campaign, the npc's all come to life, and always have things to say and often contribute to various quests and conversations, with each other, and you. 

This game is hard at low levels, but not in the ""this is a fun challenge"" way, but the ""i just keep reloading until i win the rng of the fight"" way. then it becomes too easy as you can just let your party auto fight for you at the later levels. I never found a good balance in my style of play between too easy and too hard to the point on having to over rely on saves. 

In the end though, this is a game that's more about story. And if you play the game from start, to the very end of SoD, you will leave feeling more satisfied than you would otherwise expect, and feeling excited to play BG2.... if you can get past the first few dozen hours.",1602487519,1602487519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Baldur's Gate was a staple for our preteen years. Growing up with the advent of computer games and such a golden age of innovation. There is no experience like it (well, now days there are many, but back then there weren't).

However, the Enhanced Edition on Steam has been a disappointment. Multiplayer has many issues ranging from connection issues to saving the game being super slow and laggy. Moreover, about once every other time we play together the game will randomly crash at anything from loading to just playing.

It's immensely frustrating to have to reassign characters to a player and check all of the boxes. Why are there boxes to check for the characters and not just a single one for the players? Divinity 2 got that part right for multiplayer...

Also, the chat window seems like an after thought and we ultimately find it useless. We call instead.

It's a bit frustrating to come back to a game we love, enjoy certain nostalgia from the mechanics and gameplay, but then hit hiccups like these.

Initially had a negative knee-jerk reaction, now this is one of my absolute favorite games of all time. Baldur's Gate is fresh, deep, and most of all *FUN*. The engaging story, charming characters, and addictive combat are PURE PERFECTION; this combination remains unsurpassed by any other game without ""Baldur's Gate"" in the title IMHO. You owe it to yourself to experience this.
---

I'm a complete newcomer to Baldur's Gate. No nostalgia goggles. I have no familiarity whatsoever with AD&D, either in pen and paper form or any video games explicitly based on them. I've never played these games before, but I had heard good things about them all my life, and I was finally willing to see what the fuss was about. I played for a few hours, then had a negative knee-jerk reaction. There is an ""upvoted"" negative review here that summed up how I felt. I was wrong. VERY wrong. Here I am 100+ hours later to make it clear that I was as mistaken as it's possible to be.

You see, I was put off by the seemingly arcane pen and paper D&D rules (I haven't played an actual pen & paper rpg of any kind for over 20 years). I was intimidated by concepts like THAC0, and it all initially felt unintuitive to me. I was frustrated by the combat. My frustrations didn't seem to match expectations.

...But the game kept pulling me in. The setting, the characters, the quests, the storyline... After those initial hours expecting a Hallejuah moment (and not getting it, or so I thought), what I eventually found instead was...crack cocaine.

Once I began to learn the ropes, the game's combat completely and utterly opened up to me, and I soon realized it was the most thrilling, challenging, complex, rewarding, and PURE FUN combat experiences I've ever had with an RPG in my entire life.

Two examples at opposite ends of the spectrum (without spoiling much): One fight involving a wizard and a few basilisks was especially challenging. After experimenting with a number of ways to survive the encounter, I ultimately ended up using a combination of a friendly ghoul, a nearby group of hostile adventurers who had insulted me, my thief (with the effects of an invisibility potion) sneaking behind the wizard and ready to backstab, and a few well-timed spells. Body parts were flying (literally). 

The other example illustrates an initially less confrontational way I solved another seemingly insurmountable challenge. I was facing a large encampment of tough enemies (not cannon fodder). I tried to sneak a certain character in and use a special charm ability on one of them...and I was shocked when it worked! Not only did the enemy talk to me and answer my questions (and submit to being pickpocketed), I realized I could control them too. I suddenly realized I could walk them out of camp and into the woods away from their allies. So I walked the enemy towards my waiting group in the middle of the woods, and killed him. The other enemies weren't alerted. So far so good. After some trial and error, I realized there was no way to make this work with every enemy without alerting the camp (though that would've been hilarious), but I was able to charm, pickpocket, and then murder many of the toughest enemies in the group. Finally, I charmed the strongest enemy remaining, made him attack his friends, and then my party rushed in for a full-on assault to finish the job.

These are just two examples in my 100+ hour journey (and if anything, it almost felt like I rushed through the game).

Now there *is* some cheesey-ness...like greater werewolves constantly regenerating health, and not being able to kill them even with your strongest weapons and spells. But there are workarounds (eg special silver and anti-werewolf weapons). A minor quibble, but it's there.

Overall one of the most joyful combat experiences I've had in any RPG (what an idiot I was for almost giving up so early on)....and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

This is one of the richest, most immersive, most addictive worlds I've ever inhabited in any RPG. There is a pure *FEEL* that's just so right here...the way the game world *FEELS* to me, the sense you have as you explore and interact with the world. This is a living, breathing world that is in many ways far freer and more interactive than bleeding edge AAA titles of the current era. I feel like this game lives up to the promise of so-called ""free roam""/""open world"" RPGs in that you really can BE your character in a way that you can't in other games. There's so much creativity here, so many different ways you can play...there is simply nothing quite like it.

And there's also nothing quite like the story (that is, the main questline) and the characters here. The main story is extremely compelling, with conspiracies, twists and turns, excellent villains, and (if you're like me, coming into this 100% blind to story details) a satisfying revelation that the game steadily and intelligently builds toward. There are over TWO DOZEN unique companions here, each voiced, each with their own personalities and backgrounds. 

Bioware's other franchises (the Mass Effect games, the first Dragon Age, and the first KOTOR) came to mind; I had only played these more recent games, but I took it for granted that there was excellent story-telling and compelling, memorable characters. We're still looking for games like that today, aren't we? Well, look no further than the Baldur's Gate games. This is where Bioware did it first. The story and characters stand among their very best. Remember, I was initially frustrated enough that it was the story and characters that kept me coming back early on.

I'm happy to say that the quality of the story continues in Siege of Dragonspear which *beautifully* locks into place between BG1 and BG2 (I'm early in BG2 at the time of this review). SOD is a game that rewards you for overcoming BG1's big bad by giving you a heroic send off to embark on a large-scale siege. Thanks to the fact that SOD came out nearly 20 years after the first game, there are essentially no more hardware limitations, so the devs took the opportunity to MASSIVELY crank up the scope. What I mean is that in SOD, you'll see the streets of Baldur's Gate teeming with huge numbers of people like never before, and it's all part of a gripping plot; a refugee crisis in the face of an impending invasion. Without giving too much away, this culminates in large scale battles with massive enemy numbers. The flipside of this is a brilliantly dark plot twist that sets up the events of BG2.

I can't praise Baldur's Gate enough. Not only do I have BG1, SOD, and BG2 on Steam, I also recently purchased them for android as well. Unbelievable that I can play these games on a mobile device too. I will be revisiting these worlds again and again in the coming years.

As far as those ""arcane"" pen and paper rules, well I'm in BG2 now and it's 100% second nature to me, and I couldn't imagine it any other way. There's a reason Larian Studios went back to the pen and paper rules (complete with virtual on-screen dice rolls) for Baldur's Gate 3.

These games are now cherished favorites of mine. But not because of their status as ""classics."" It's because Baldur's Gate is among the most enjoyable and memorable gaming experiences I have EVER had in my life. I can't believe that almost wasn't the case. Again, I'm a complete newcomer. No nostalgia goggles. I *LOVE* Baldur's Gate.",1596472765,1602184125,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This one was a massive leap forward for RPGs but it's so full of rough edges that the second game and later CRPGs successfully smoothed over that it hardly compares to them. It's also severely padded with repetitive encounters and uninteresting side quests--totally lacking in respect for your time.

What would become a defining element of Bioware's great games to come--the unforgettable companions and the choice-driven conversations the player can have with them--are barely here. Random party banter which lets you flesh out your relationship with them is practically nonexistent (interestingly, except for the new Enhanced Edition characters, which range from bland to neat), which makes the writing feel a bit sparse, especially when so many quests, despite the regular dialogue trees, ultimately devolve into killing a pack of enemies here or a horde of them there. It makes you wonder what your choices really added when it ended up in a similar combat scenario either way--and there are so many similar combat scenarios strewn a bit too liberally throughout the game. This becomes less of an issue in the dense, dialogue-rich city of Baldur's Gate, but it takes so long to get there that the wait doesn't feel justified. Meaningless fights pad too much of the open world and the dungeons, but the experience isn't meted out generously enough to make some of the tough required fights fair or fun if you rush past optional content.

It's not an awful game, and there's a lot to love. It captures the feeling of wandering aimlessly around the Forgotten Realms at low level (complete with encountering Drizzt and Elminster in passing) where everything is dangerous fairly well, but that alone doesn't carry the game, and in fact starts to get tedious and frustrating well before you're done. Everything it does well is done better and sooner in Shadows of Amn. I shudder to think how many people in recent years have bought this game, tried it, and put it down when it got too boring, tough, or repetitive, then never tried the second game assuming it was more of the first.",1601798505,1601798617,False,0,1,0.447995781898498535,0,True,False,False

Beamdog altered the original game greatly, with additions being split in four categories.

You got the usual qualify of life improvements that come with Enhanced Editions, like zoom in/out, having the ability to create a full party without multiplayer, increased reactivity and pathfinding, better party scripts, or even the ability to give a thief both a bow or crossbow, and a dagger plus buckler. There's also all the new kits from Baldur's Gate 2, and new classes from more recent editions of D&D, along with a bunch of bug fixes, and the Legacy of Bhaal mode, which transforms an already harsh game into a speedrun/speedhack frenzy.

And of course, there's the new content, including new companions, their quest lines, and even a new addon filling the gap between BG1 and 2. Here, you can tell Dorn was added later in the Friendly Arm Inn for instance. I'm not saying he's poorly written, but his dialogues and voice overs are probably too modern to fit in. Or too unconsequential to the main story. Same, or worse, goes for Neera, whose lines sounded very cringy and forced to me. But to be fair, I was not interested in playing with NPCs to begin with (which have weird and low stats and no personality for the greatest part).

And I mean, Baldur's Gate has always been about spending minutes on grinding, stealing precious items, cheesing the AI with hit and runs and fireballs, and hearing that distinctive leveling sound to finally reduce your THAC0, to kill more things and loot that rare +2 or +3 weapon, and save scumming because of the many death traps. There were already games at the time with better writing and better narrative.

There's also Siege on Dragonspear, which I've yet to try.

As for the game itself, I think it can still be enjoyed despite nostalgia, dated and unbalanced mechanics, teenager story (""You killed my dad, I want revenge and kill everyone on my way!""), and AD&D 2. Starting at level 1 and feeling the progression, doing solo playthroughs or hardcore playthroughs with new classes was very enjoyable.

Developers (or, rather, re-developers) read reviews/comments/feedback and try to provide solutions. And they do make patches. In addition to #2 this made me re-rate to ""recommend"".

Then I don't believe you'll like Baldur's Gate 1. It has not aged as well as, say, Diablo II, or even Fallout 1 and 2. It is low level 2nd edition DnD. And it is MISERY. The combat is actively a detriment and consistently a negative, fun-killing experience.

There's real-time with pause, which some people seem to really like! But in practice here, you'll be doing a lot of waiting while your party swipes and whiffs at an ettercap or bandit. If the rolls aren't good, you'll just kind of die. Also, your party members still *take actions,* so even if you pause and give them a new order, you have to wait until their action pops up again. This gets VERY hard to keep track of between six party member, particularly when the flow of battle shifts quickly. It's a complex system but the complexity adds little but frustration.

You won't have many spells to begin with. Most of the ""exploration"" that takes place early in the game, before you hit the city of Baldur's Gate proper in Chapter 5, tends to be wandering around giant blocks of terrain that look more or less the same, slowly uncovering the map and if you're lucky coming across an extremely basic quest or two. The more interesting exploration and branching paths all come much, much later in the game, and it may take you a couple dozen hours or longer to even reach that point.

There are a great many niggling little issues, too. Save scumming is more or less required because if a companion dies, you have to resurrect them. To resurrect them, you have to go back to town, unless you're late in the game. Meanwhile, all of their equipment remains on the corpse, and to ensure nothing bad happens to it, you have to pick it up and patiently divide it amongst your party members. Every single time. And damage can be very spiky in this game, and until you get a stock of potions, and even after, healing is frustratingly limited.

The story is also quite boilerplate save for one reveal near the end, and even then the concept is not really explored until the new DLC, Siege of Dragonspear, and BG2. All of your companions are just kind of meme machines and you are afforded very, very few meaningful interactions with them until Siege of Dragonspear.

The Siege of Dragonspear DLC, however, is quite good, as it was made 17 years after the fact and took to heart many improvements the genre has made since those times. Also, you're at a higher level and there is significantly more impactful interactions with your party members. The villain of the DLC is slightly more interesting than BG1's, ultimately, but the story plays well with what BG1 set up. I do not believe it is worth the 40-60 hour slog it takes to get to that point, however, and I do not recommend it to anyone but the most die-hard fans, those who are curious about video game history, warts and all, or anyone who just HAS to be caught up before Baldur's Gate 3 even though BG3 takes place 100 years later.

I don't regret my time with the game for the tourism of a different time but the game's systems have not aged well and can cause more frustration than fun to those with no nostalgic connection to it.",1601277804,1601277804,False,0,0,0.407407402992248535,0,True,False,False

When it was released, Baldur's Gate set the bar for what an isometric party-based RPG should be. While I think Baldur's Gate is a great game, it is very Dungeon & Dragons meaning it has a lot of the same quirks specific to D&D games that newcomers may find frustrating. I'm used to clerics not being able to use bladed weapons, or spellcasters needing to wear robes in order for their spells to function; but not everyone is. Baldur's Gate story is great, although I found the harder battles in the game required a lot of saving and reloading. I wish the battles could be fought turned based, like in the Divinity: Original Sin games, rather than real-time (or slowed) with manual pausing.

The story is mediocre by today's standards and the voice acting, while passable due to a few standouts, dances around the good and bad sides of mediocre.

The other campaigns/expansions are also very good.

I find myself returning to BG1/BG2 for its excellent replay-ability and general excellent quality. Time for another playthru!

Baldurs Gate I is an excellent Dungeons n Dragons type game that set the standard back in the day. DnD made video game, and done damn well.
The plot and characters are interesting and neat *Bender takes a picture*.
The writing is hilarious. Plus there's plenty of other cool things for you to discover, like secrets and hidden treasure across the world.

There's tons of different classes and kits, you can dual class or multiclass to make just about any kind of character you want.
BGII also brings massive improvements to the playable classes/kits, compared to BGI some kits were quite under-powered in more ways than one. BGII has done quite the good job in fixing and improving upon what was already a standard-setting game.

The ""Enhanced Edition"" rerelease of Baldur's Gate has many convenience features that make the game easier to play from a modern standpoint, but at arguably too high a cost. Beamdog has not only removed around half of all the cinematics in the game, but also replaced the other half with (usually) pleasant-looking but shorter and blander substitutes. The humor, character and dynamicity of the originals are gone, unless you restore them with mods.

This is a theme that carries over to the rest of the Beamdog's ""enhancements"" as well‚Äîmost come with a cost in character, usability, and/or vision. Someone at Beamdog must have a real chip on their shoulder about BG1, because they oddly and for no good discernible reason went through the entire game and redesigned many small gameplay systems and content with little to no regard to BioWare's vision or understanding of the original design's purpose. These changes include removing the outer gates of Baldur's Gate and other similarly arbitrary measures.

They also changed the original engine to the BG2 one, and neglected to port over the original character sprites, so the rerelease uses the sprites from the wrong game. Another side effect of this engine port is that they forgot to restore many small engine features from the original game that lacked from the sequel, like ambient character sounds for NPCs and creatures. This version lacks many such features from the original.

In version 2.0, they remade the UI engine from scratch, and in the process they introduced a humongous number of bugs and usability issues to it. In over four years, they haven't even started working on fixing these problems, despite early on promising to the player community that they would fix them. Since then, they've started a large number of other development projects and extracted almost all resources from the Infinity Engine games, ensuring that the countless bugs and regressions they've introduced to them will never be fixed.

That said, the original game is old and has its own long set of (mostly technical) issues. Unfortunately, it's difficult to say which version of the game is the best, as they all have their own drawbacks and it ultimately comes down to preference which ones you can tolerate the best. Still, if you think the issues I've listed about BG:EE would bother you, then I recommend you play the original version instead.

This is not a review for the Baldur's Gate games, which rank among the best games ever made. By all means, everyone should play them if they get the chance. However, Beamdog's enhanced edition of the games has *huge* problems in multiplayer involving crashes and connectivity problems that make it virtually unplayable for many. 

Fixes include ludicrous measures such as turning of one's firewall(!!!), tinkering with router settings, creating a network with Hamachi and more. However, even these ""fixes"" don't work for everybody. In a time, when you can just click ""invite"" in your friends list to start a session or outright jump into a game of someone else this is just unacceptable. For several weeks we tried to get the multiplayer to work, and even contacted Beamdog for support; but it was a lottery and we managed to actually *play* the game for only one session. 

Therefore, I would warn everybody who wants to play these games with friends, to rather get the original versions and mod them a bit. Else you might be in for a lot of frustration.",1579426715,1597439054,False,31,3,0.608560800552368164,0,True,False,False

BG doesn't hold your hand the way a modern game does. You have to really explore the maps to solve quest 
now nav points or ed lines on the floor, most of the time not even any good pointers by the locals and you pretty much have to finish your quests to become big and strong and able to withstand the tougher enemies. 

The battle system is finicky and needs some getting used to, experimenting and dying in the process is part of the deal. 

However, if you can look past these nuissances you find a huge and compelling world. With all sorts of nicely written characters, ranging all over the spectrum of high fantasy fever dreams. 
A game to enjoy over long stretches of time and an  oldschool rpg , so you'll need patience, some appreciation for the beautiful (in their own way) predrawn backgrounds, the rough but ultimatly rewarding battle system and the fact that you pretty much have to find your own way around. 

Got all that fine It will be fun I promise :) 

Otherwise may be you stick to the more modern variants of the genre, nothing wrong with that, I'm not always in the mood for these shenannigans either, but if I am the reward is a kind a gaming experience you hardly ever get nowerdays in a quality you harldy ever got in the good old days :)

It is another of a series of infinity engine cRPG games I never got around to playing as a kid, though I started up a campaign in my early teens.  After playing through Pathfinder Kingmaker I have to say, this game is much easier.   Though you can chalk that up to it being shorter overall.
What can be said about Baldur's Gate that can't be said about every D&D campaign you've ever had with your buddies and a tough (but fun) DM?  Wicked Big Bad with a terrible plan for wanton slaughter?  Check.  Campaign hook that starts with the death of the main roleplayer's (you) father figure? Check.  Monty Python-esque humor and writing that is as epic as it is self aware and fun?  Check.
This game is a timeless D&D experience on infinity engine goodness, waith all the cRPG quirks you'd expect. From stuck characters to crazy difficulty ramps, it plays hard and asks for investment.  Don't be discouraged if you die, it happens to everyone.  It's a game that asks for patience and strategy but rewards it with excellent sensation of triumphing against the odds and earning some sweet loot to boot.
As for the story itself, it's a mythology by this point.  Bloodlines of dark gods intermingling within the shadows of conspiracy, and a dark prophecy tying it all together.  Not exactly a twist you wouldn't see coming today, but like listening to an old bedtime story or hearing a campfire tale about a legendary hero vanquishing the forces of evil (or embracing its seductive power) you can't really fault it for being what it has always been.

Maybe at one point this was one of the greatest RPG's of all time, but it sure as heck didn't age well.

Gameplay is tedious and actually difficult unless you like setting up party tactics and relentlessly pause and micromanage your group; or you set it to easy.
You have to be ""nice"" the whole game, otherwise you won't get your party, which really throws off the immersion.  What's the point of choosing to be chaotic evil if you really can't be, as you need a team to survive.

Every map feels like a big slog.  It reminds me of Diablo but not in a good way.  Click, click, click - as you explore the black areas uncovering nothing but boring fields filled with ambushing npc's.

Treasure is not remarkable - oh hey look it's another halberd or useless gem.

Dialogue is mostly pointless and doesn't feel like there's any strong repercussions; or at least you won't care.

[h1] Baldur‚Äôs Gate: Enhanced Edition Review | Arcade Theory [/h1]

When Baldur‚Äôs Gate III was announced, I was stoked to hear that Larian Studios would be developing it. No offense to Beamdog, of course, but to be able to experience a classic RPG series in the style of Divinity: Original Sin II was enough to motivate me to go back and play the original Baldur‚Äôs Gate games again in anticipation of the upcoming title. If you have read my [url=https://arcadetheory.net/icewind-dale-enhanced-edition-review/]Icewind Dale review[/url], you will find that I have expressed my favoritism of Baldur‚Äôs Gate over its sister game series. It is in this review that you will find out why.

Summarizing the gameplay mechanics would be akin to summarizing the D&D rulebooks, so I will leave you, dear reader, to read the manual on your own initiative. The game itself plays like Icewind Dale due to sharing the same game engine. It is isometric, real-time, and relies on the use of unseen dice to determine whether you land a hit or miss. Usually miss. Such is the folly of dice-based combat: it is by no means an unbalanced or unfair system, but it is simply mystifying how your paladin can completely miss swinging his broadsword at an immobile blob of jelly congealing on the floor or how your ranger fails to land his mark against a wyvern the size of a barn‚Äôs broadside. Outside of that, the game‚Äôs mechanics works without fail, even if it is frustrating to deal with.

Your character is canonically known as Gorion‚Äôs Ward, raised by your aforementioned foster father in the fortress of Candlekeep. You were doted on heavily, yet raised with a stern hand in anticipation of the events of Baldur‚Äôs Gate, though you were never told why you would ever need to step foot beyond the walls of the keep. Why has your father never told you of your true heritage? Why is it that even at the eve of your departure, you have never been lectured once on the topic of your destiny? It is through your adventures in the Sword Coast that you shall piece together the untold story behind your past.

But you will not undertake this adventure alone. Five companions of your choosing shall accompany you through bandit-afflicted roads and spider-infested forests. Like Icewind Dale, you may opt to create your entire six-man party at the very start, but in Baldur‚Äôs Gate, it is actually advisable to create only a single main character. Unlike Icewind Dale, there are actually recruitable companions scattered across the Sword Coast. They come in many flavors of classes and alignments, ranging from paladins to sorcerers and from lawful good to chaotic evil. The reason it is encouraged to seek them out is because they have their own personalities and unique dialogue, a stark contrast from your robotic player-made companions who are required to pick from a pool of generic voice sets just like your main character. The recruitable companions don‚Äôt have this kind of issue.

Let‚Äôs take Minsc, for example. Minsc is quite possibly Baldur‚Äôs Gate most popular companion. This loveable oaf is not quite right in the head, but where he lacks in brains, he compensates by being a bona fide killing machine, excelling in the two-handed sword weapon style as well as being proficient in the accurate longbow. Recruiting him is like nabbing two candy bars for the price of one as he is joined by his pet, a furry little hamster named Boo. In Minsc‚Äôs 8 Intelligence mind, Boo is the brains of the duo as he is a sentient miniature giant space hamster capable of dispensing sage-like wisdom when it is most needed. At least, according to Minsc.

If you decide to hire Minsc, you must also assist him in rescuing Dynaheir, a complimentary companion that serves as his ‚Äúwitch‚Äù and protector. Once you have rescued her, the pair becomes inseparable. If you dismiss one of them, the other leaves your party as well. Should one of the two die in battle, the other will react to their death‚Äîin Minsc‚Äôs case, he will go berserk, potentially maiming your own party in his grief. Such complexities in personality will only exist in your party if you choose not to go with the premade route. Each companion will express their likes and dislikes of other members of your party. Some companions will come in pairs just like Minsc and Dynaheir and will react appropriately should something occur to their partner.

I don‚Äôt want to reveal any more details about the story to those who never played the game. I will say, however, that the main questline is an enjoyable experience. The writing is a key part in that it is always fun to explore the choices you have in the dialogue line you get to say to the NPC you are speaking to. Being able to go from speaking like a noble paladin to being a chaotic evil jerk in the same conversation is hilarious until the NPC decides to end the conversation and attempt to cut you down for your insolence. The game may have tried a bit too hard in being immersive with voice acting though. See, every time you engage in dialogue with an NPC, a sound bite will play of a voice recording. This sound bite may just be the first several words of the dialogue. Other times, it may be a sound bite of the generic nobleman character telling you that he does not enjoy talking to peasants such as yourself even though his dialogue is very polite towards you. You will have to hear the same voice clip every time you interact with that NPC, which, I must say, is rather annoying. There are no fully-voiced NPCs in this game either. The most voice acting you will hear is perhaps the first paragraph of an NPC‚Äôs dialogue, but outside of that, there is little to be heard. It‚Äôs not a big deal though. Some prefer it that way as they would rather picture what the NPC‚Äôs voice would be like in their head. [...]",1593287944,1593288004,True,6,0,0.568039238452911377,0,True,False,False

228280,71085188,76561198012441941,0,33,877,0,877,1417047864,"The game was made very early in the genre of Western CRPGs, and it has several design decisions that make it difficult to get into.

These may be no problem for you! I have friends who love this game, and more power to them. But I wish I'd known these problems before I bought the game. They affected my enjoyment so much that I have given up and wish I had never spent money on it.

1. The game follows the DnD 2nd ed rules very closely, and you start at level 1. This means you will be very weak, and combats are going to be very dangerous, so save early and save often. Unfortunately, the game design is pretty railroady, which means you won't be able to avoid combats. Some of them will very likely kill you unless you have specific character builds or luck out with the dice rolls.

2. The game, programming wise, follows on from older CRPGs like Strahd's Possession and Eye of the Beholder. So bear that in mind when you consider its rave reviews. They're comparing it to very basic, railroady, ""you can die at any time and we expect you to keep reloading till you solve our arbitrary quest plan"" type of design.

3. There isn't much room for error or deviation from the designer's plan, so don't try to emphasize too much on character roleplaying. Early in the game, two clearly evil NPCs offer to join your party. If you're playing as Good characters, you might quite reasonably turn them down, thinking the game has some alternative plan for your survival if you do so. It doesn't. You're going to need every miserable last advantage you can get, so bring them along as cannon fodder.

4. There is an early unavoidable fight where you're up against a far more powerful NPC who starts the combat by casting Magic Missile (projectiles that never miss and do guaranteed damage). This will kill any ""squishy"" class PC it hits, say, your starting Mage. Bring along an expendable Evil character as your cannon fodder.

5. There is an early unavoidable mine complex where you need to travel and defeat enemies to progress. Without any explanation or workaround, you will not be able to rest in the mine (""you are plagued with nightmares""). This means that spellcasting classes (such as, say, your squishy starting Mage) will not regain spells. Be prepared for a sprint experience to get through alive, not an Indiana-Jones-style spelunking exploration experience.

The game lacks the flexibility of later games - not all classes are equally viable, and not all alignments or character outlook can be properly role played without painting yourself into a corner. This game is historically significant (cool graphics! voice acting! isometric realtime grid based combat!) but it's still an intermediary link between the ugly CRPGs of ""insta-death"" yesteryear, and the polished, flexible, multiple-option CRPGs of today.

Baldur's Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal, by contrast, are much more flexible and survivable with different character types - partially because even though they also are based on DnD 2nd ed, they automatically start you at a higher level so you're less likely to die with unlucky rolls or a mildly disadvantageous choice in character build.

This author has finished BG2 and (almost) finished TOB, though the end boss on TOB is a challenge I haven't passed yet. I have made several attempts to play BG1 and each time I was frankly amazed they ever made a sequel.",1592671137,1592671137,False,2,1,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

Very good game if you never played it and you do not know how to start, an easy and quite useful class, in both, baldurs gate one and two, if you want to continue it is the dwarf type defender, it is not the most powerful but if the most resistant and useful for To start, if you want the most powerful, I read is the warrior/magician or something like that, but if you do not understand anything it is a mess on the subject of being dual class or multiclass, also you have your companions are maximum 6 counting you. So if you played newer rpg games as pillars of eternity, the game mechanics are pretty much the same (then you notice some things take of baldurs gate history and change it ...). The story is quite entertaining and you have lots of optional missions to do very varied, that is, there is fun for a while! ....

It represents a pretty faithful interpretation of the AD&D 2e experience into a computer game format, with compelling characters, a fun story, and what in 1998 was a pretty ingenious use of RTS controls into an RPG. My big issue with the game is that played straight it can feel quite grindy.

I played the original version when I was very young and never finished it because I was too young/stupid to understand how mechanics worked. For people trying to play this game, the initial confusions over AC THAC0 and other outdated rulesets goes away quickly. The Enhanced Edition fixes this with simple interfaces, colour-coded weapon and armour comparisons, etc. If you've ever played a modern RPG or MMO, it's fairly easy to get used to the different ruleset. 
All that being said, the story is decently compelling, but it's the characters and quirkiness of the world that draws you in. A fairly typical RPG quest (you have to investigate, oh no bandits, something bigger going on) doesn't take away from the world and characterization at all.
Gameplay is decent if a bit clunky at times, but that's to be expected of a 2012 remake of a 1998 top-down isometric RPG.

Gameplay: 7/10
Story: 9/10
Graphics: 8/10 (why so high? Because even the remake is 8 yrs old at this point and it still looks decent)
Dollar Per Hour ratio: $0.4  ($22/~55hrs)
     (Haven't finished yet and I'm around 40hours in. The included Tales from the Sword Coast and Black Pits expansions will put average gameplay time at around 50-60 hrs depending on the player)
Bottom Line: 7.5/10 in terms of game, well worth the $ at around 40 cents per hour of game time.",1591539736,1591539736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
228280,3915729,76561198029034048,0,114,1651,0,1632,1621697413,"This is a remake of the role-playing video game Baldur's Gate and its expansion Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast which were both originally released back in 1998 by Bioware. This review will contain minor spoilers.

Graphics definitely shows its age and can be distracting for a newcomer who have not experienced such graphics before. Personally for me, i find it dated, but with a certain nostalgic charm. Environment art are pretty detailed however and are lovingly rendered in pixel art. Character sprites however look very generic and small. 

The music consists of nice sweeping orchestral pieces. Sound effects sound good with the clashes of swords and the swoosh of a magic spell. I did encounter issues where the volume would suddenly crank up for no reason at all during certain events (Eg: when a trap got activated).

The main 25 hours story unfortunately felt rather generic although it has a unique way of presentation with a narrator reciting the script as if like a Dungeon Master in the pen and paper version. As such, I felt that the general feel of the game doesn't feel at all like a video game, but feels more like the pen and paper experience translated into digital form. This may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes.

I liked how organic and natural sidequests were presented. You could have a random NPC walk up to you for a chit chat which may lead to something more sinister or just wander around and help out along the way. I recommend not to slavishly do each and every quest, but rather play thru the game normally and just let your party randomly encounter these side quests. Also, because this game is old-school, do not expect it to hold your hand and show you your exact quest objective. You are expected to read the ingame journal which will give vague hints and you actually have to do some exploring.

The game has quite a high combat difficulty curve at least at the beginning when your initial party is low leveled. It will not hesitate to throw a tough boss or impossible random encounters (a crew of lvl1 characters against 8 higher leveled bandits. Really?!?) relatively early and wipe your party. Remember to always save your game before and after every conversation, and before and after every battle. Proper position and tactics are essential and vital to early combat.

If you persevere however, this difficulty curve will drop very significantly when your party members are around Level 4. At this point, you will find almost all non-boss battles to be a breeze where all you had to do is to select everyone in your party and just zerg rush mobs. Enemies do not scale to your level. I find this sudden drop in difficulty to be very strange and felt very odd considering how hard it was to survive during the early levels.

As for boss battles, its very easy to exploit the game by getting your magic users cast area effect spells before they even see an enemy to soften them up. This is particularly true for the last boss where I just lured his allies out one by one, zerged them, went out to rest and heal and repeat until he is the only one left standing. Needless to say he died in about 25 seconds to my zerg rush.

Overall Rating: 7 / 10
Criticizing this game almost feels like a crime considering that alot of people enjoyed it alot. I enjoyed this game for sure, but I felt it might have been a little too hyped up. My view is that it is a good game, but it could definitely be alot more polished. My main concern was that the story narrative was too overt instead of being subtle. You are literally being told a story instead of experiencing one (if that makes any sense)

For anyone like me who have played the original pen and paper version and also experienced older RPGs before, do give it a try if you haven't already as you might enjoy it. 

For younger players who have never experienced older RPGs and never touched the pen and paper version before, i'd recommend watching some gameplay video previews before committing to it as this game does show its age now.",1373649475,1591480720,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was also the very first successful project for Bioware team, which would later on create a dozen of widely celebrated & classic RPG games of all time. Baldur‚Äôs Gate was one of the games that renewed the flame for this genre back then and even now offers an amazing story and tactical Dungeons and Dragons combat experience, if you can handle the old fashioned look and style of play that has been polished with this Enhanced Edition.

[h1]‚ÄúYour iron or your life. No, your iron AND your life. Yeah that one‚Äôs better.‚Äù[/h1]

Set in the year 1368DR, when all the cities and ports of the Sword Coast were in turmoil due to Iron Crisis, a young daydreamer along with their sister Imoen were living in the peaceful and secluded village of Candlekeep, doing everyday chores oblivious to the storm brewing outside. Gorion was taking care of these two younglings, until fate decided to knock on the door, and change their lives forever.

Before Baldur‚Äôs Gate, Bioware only released one game, a mech simulation called Shattered Steel which, while liked in the MechWarrior community, was rough in many of its aspects. But Bioware was always interested in pushing the limits in games and delivering high level of overall polish. Hence, when developing a game based on beloved D&D license, much of the writing was also handled to the Black Isle Studios, developers that would later on form Obsidian Entertainment, which also spawned many cult favorite RPG. A mix of these two developer studios have created on of the best ‚Äúold-school‚Äù role-playing game series to date. 

Baldur‚Äôs Gate is a high fantasy RPG game, with clearly defined good and bad guys, fantastical realms where magic is commonplace, and a sprawling and straightforward story about the Hero‚Äôs Journey with a couple of clever twists and turns to spotlight the main character‚Äôs unusual history that would influence the balance of powers on the continent of Faer√ªn. 

[h1]‚ÄúHide away that which should not see the sun‚Äôs light‚Äù[/h1] 

Powered by ‚ÄúInfinity Engine‚Äù, the game provides a beautifully detailed 2D isometric background and animated sprites that to this day look endearing to behold. Every area has unique hand-drawn and painted, high-quality graphical presentation, thus making every level look like a pastel painting. Equally captivating is the orchestral soundtrack by the talented composer Michael Hoenig who also created many memorable movie soundtracks, and here most of the tracks deliver emotionally fueled tones that can be enjoyed and listened separately from the game. From renaissance fair-like track of ‚ÄúThe Friendly Arms Inn‚Äù, imposing and mysterious tones of ‚ÄúNight Falls on Baldur‚Äôs Gate‚Äù while exploring the vast city and the Jewel of the Sword Coast, to the exciting and desperate combat music of ‚ÄúGorion‚Äôs Battle‚Äù where every wrong move can cost you everything.

Make no mistake; combat in the Baldur‚Äôs Gate series never was oriented toward casual and action connoisseurs of RPG‚Äôs. Like the rule system it‚Äôs based on ‚Äì Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, it is highly tactical and complex, slow and deadly. The first game especially rewards carefully positioning of your party members, using their unique skills and spells to control the flow of combat and masking their flaws and shortcomings before the enemy AI quickly discovers it and punishes you by constantly striking these weak spots. It is a real time isometric combat system that you can pause whenever you wish to give your fighters commands and then see the results of your planning.  When you start with your character at level 1, every combat is a life or death situation, no matter how trivial some of the enemy encounters might be. By the time you reach level 5, you‚Äôll have a character that can take a beating and can survive a couple of poor combat choices, but your mistakes will always cost a lot, usually ending in party wipe. Speaking of your party, companions that follow you have an AI of its own, but you‚Äôll quickly realize it simply won‚Äôt fight well enough and for them to truly shine, you‚Äôll have to take matters into your own hands.

[h1]‚ÄúOur iron no good! Crumbles like elf bones and make our clan into laughing stock! Ha ha, big joke‚Ä¶ We kill you quick, no pain‚Äù[/h1]

Every character you meet, every companion that joins your cause, and every enemy that promises your quick demise are well developed with consistently high quality writing on the display that is short, expressive, to the point and playful enough. The overall story and most of its quests are simple by today‚Äôs standards, but the confidence of the writing team always manages to pull you into this dynamic world scarred with intrigues, wars, love and betrayals. 

Enhanced version delivered by Beamdog is an optimization and greatly improved coding masterpiece that delivers widescreen resolutions, better 2D sprites, reduces the colossally long loading times the original had, and fixes nearly all limitations and bugs the old engine had. It also delivers a couple of new interesting companions that can join you, new levels and quests that will demand you know combat and tactics exceedingly well.  The only baffling decision in enhancing this game and the only thing that bugs me about this game is the replacement of 3D cutscenes that were lovingly created in now low-polly resolution with lifeless and cheap cartoon cutscenes that look like something out of the early Flash games. Beamdog also created recently a full-scale expansion ‚ÄúSiege of Dragonspear‚Äù that is okay, with the only major minus being subpar and stilted dialogue and writing when compared to the original game and unimaginative and repetitive combat encounters.

[h1]‚ÄúDie, pipsqueaks!‚Äù[/h1]

Do I recommend it? Absolutely, but do keep in mind I‚Äôve been playing this game a dozen of times so far. Should you play it? If you are looking for a tough and no-nonsense RPG similar to D&D tabletop experience with a bit of ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù vibe, then look no further, but if you‚Äôre not ready to commit to nearly 100 hours long epic journey or the highly punishing tactical combat is not something you enjoy, as you mull over your character‚Äôs next move for 10-15 minutes, you might want to skip it since it‚Äôs not for everyone. Baldur‚Äôs Gate has aged well, but it demands a lot out of its players and in return delivers one of the best role-playing experiences out there. It has influenced generations of player and developers, and to this date you can find a bit of Baldur‚Äôs Gate magic in nearly every western RPG.",1589720518,1589819528,True,45,0,0.809178173542022705,11,True,False,False

After a long hiatus from the PC where I spent a couple years playing only console, I'm back and craving some deep RPGs. I'm going to give BGEE another try with a new game from scratch and hope I don't run into the breaking bugs again (6 years later). I played through to chapter 7 with not a single problem (although I'm stuck lol). 

[old review]
This game was mostly unplayable at launch due to bugs. For instance, the quest log--after I got to Chapter 5, it went away, impossible to know what the quests are, what to do, where to go. Just one of the many bugs. The people who give this glowing reviews did not finish the game. And, as you can see, I invested many hours into it. There are areas where if you talk to an NPC before doing something else, the game just about blows up--from talking to an NPC! Your party is stuck, unable to leave the zone. I mean, it's just one thing like that after another with this broken mess. Sure, it is nostalgic, it's FUN, but only if you dabble for a few minutes and then quit, as I suspect 99% of the reviewers out there have done. Play it to win it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I played through most of the game's content but am not able to finish it to see how it ends.

[addendum] Beamdog fixed a lot of bugs during 2014, and I quit playing at one point toward the end without actually finishing. As someone here and on forums has suggested, the game did have corrupted savegame file problems that made a HUGE mess out of the game if you happen to be unlucky enough to have run into it, where the only solution is to reload from an earlier save. My best guess is, I ran into one of those problems, continued playing, and the game was messed up forever after that. Very possible starting a new game with the final patch would clear it all up.

That doesn't change the fact that the game was unplayable for me. And just because *you* played it through 100% without any issues, doesn't mean it didn't have problems last year.",1430092411,1589567181,True,1,0,0.505131959915161133,12,True,False,False

It runs perfectly across all devices, and I love that there's cross-platform support for multiplayer. It also makes creating your own automatically updating cloud save folder a breeze, keeping saves in sync across devices without needing to change any file extensions or other editing for compatibility. It just works.

As for the game itself, Black Isle and WotC created something totally unique with the Baldur's Gate series. I've spent thousands of hours of my life in Faerun, and there are still places, dialogues, items, quests, characters, NPCs, and class combinations I've not played through yet. Beamdog did an excellent job with the Enhanced Edition, keeping the content and graphical style true to the original game with their optimised UI, engine tweaks, bug fixes, new user options and additional content. Definitely feels like it was always meant to be this way, the ""enhancements"" are all subtle, refined and appropriate.

The only complaint I have is the removal of the original Movies. All of the animated cutscenes from the original game (including the Introduction/Prologue at the end of the loading sequence, prior to the game's Main Menu, and the Movies at the start/finish of each Chapter in the game's main storyline) have been replaced with artistic drawings rendering a still image of the same scene. The Intro/Prologue has been particularly barbarised, in my opinion, with a rapidly mashed-together recording of only a part of the original audio, making the dialogue less mysterious, yet more confusing. Truly a step down from the original, awesome, full Intro/Prologue. To be fair, the artwork is excellent, and well in-theme with the game's original style. But I prefer the original animated cutscenes. Also worth noting, while I haven't tried this myself, I believe it should be possible to download the original movie files and put them into the game's directory in place of the Enhanced Edition cutscenes, fixing my complaint with ease.

Overall I'd rate this game a 10/10, for the sheer level of care that went into every aspect of its design. These days, RPGs that have excellent gameplay, multiplayer suppport and also solo replayability are often utterly destroyed by their lack of creative storyline, consistency, and most of all the environment. Baldur's Gate was made to be open-world in an era when that meant something more than just having HUGE amounts of space to explore. This world feels so real, I keep coming back to it. I don't think there's ever been a year that went by in my life where I didn't pick up a new game to try something different. Though that could be influenced by my nostalgia, there are other solid, respectable games from my childhood which I loved and played around the time I started playing Baldur's Gate, and they don't have near the same place in my esteem as this series.",1589518603,1589518603,True,7,0,0.614035129547119141,0,True,False,False

BeamDog, the latest developer, only added a few new characters, and some graphical tweeks  but other than that; that is it. It is  the same game as when it released in the early 2000's. The graphic panel has changed from the original but nothing that can not be worked around. Balder's Gate uses classic 2nd or 3rd addition Dungeon and Dragon rules and monsters. Most of all, the characters are memorable especially Minsc. Minsc brings wonderful humor and personality in game which makes it a the game unique. Very few games has been able to pull it off with charm.  Down below are my thoughts of the experience.
 Graphics: Good but not as defined as today's CRPG
 Story: Awesome Story (no spoilers here!)  just play it
 Learning curve: Can be steep, if unfamiliar with the dungeon and dragons rules
Game play: Strategy type game with a mouse and click

Nevertheless, Baldurs Gate has good storytelling. 

The game rules are all dungeon dragon with isometric style combat that i can compare vaguely to Diablo. A lot more punishing than Diablo though. You start the game has a level 1 scrap. All your roll dices for hitting are made with (20 dice) and doing damage(4hit dice, 6,8,10 hit dice maybe some are 12 hit dice). The real time combat is so fast that you wont even notice the hit dice of each enemy or each playable characters. All you will see are miss miss hot for x damage. You got to hit the pause button each time you want to cast something or move somewhere the game doesnt stop for you. 

This gamee is very hard to manage and understand if you dont know by heart the core rules of dungeon and dragons second edition. You won't understand the Armor Class matemathics. You will not understand the other matemathics of hitting or dodging. These are a must to know imo to love the game for what it is.

It is very easy to see why they updated the rules for D&D, because there is a lot of problems with these - using dispelling mcguffins and spamming generic buffs is not my idea of clever play. Getting blasted to oblivion due to sleeping on the Real time with Pause system is also not great. This is certainly a game that encourages you to save scum. These quirks make Baldur's Gate greatly inaccesible in contrast to modern games - there is an element of needing  to respect the era in which this game was released to enjoy it.

However, if you can get past the quirks of the rules, and power through the early game hell, and respect what it meant to be an of the beaten path RPG video game developer in the 90s (squaresoft this is not) than Baldur's Gate might be the most earnest attempt to create an entire computerized world that I have ever played. More than the Witcher 3, certainly more than later bioware games (which are some of my favorites) and certainly more than it's Black Isle and further Bioware infinity engine sucessors (which I am looking forward to playing). While the focused story isn't too much to write home about, there is  adventure around every corner. If you stick with it, you will see your characters grow into the warriors that they are destined to become. It is truly a thrilling experience, and although I am ready for a break right now, I do anticipate a return to the sword coast for a more in depth playthrough now that I feel I have gained my footing.

In short, Baldur's game is a hard and often cruel game. I'm not even sure that it is works on many of the ways that I have come to expect video games to be proficient at. However it may also be the greatest masterpiece of a role playing campaign that I have ever experienced, and it is amazing to think that it was accomplished in the 90s as well as decently remastered for the modern era.",1588979811,1588979811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Was very interested in the new content that came with the Siege of Dragonspear DLC. It was a good campaign that extended the original story well.
It is a shame that so many characters don't make it into that DLC though, (Ajantis, Alora, Branwen, Coran, Eldoth, Faldorn, Garrick, Kagain, Kivan, Montaron, Quayle, Shar-Teel Dosan, Tiax, Xan, Xzar, Yeslick). So if you were doing a play-through from BG1EE to the DLC, you might find some or all of your party are missing in action. This can be especially annoying for people who were going down the ""Evil"" route, as out of the 10 previously evil characters available, only 4 made it though, and no additional evil characters were added. Where as out of the 10 good characters from the original, 4 return and 2 additional are added.
This can also be especially annoying if you used books for stat increases on them, or in the case of Mages & Bards such as Xan, Garrick, Quayle, Eldoth, Xhar you have have loaded their spellbooks with harder to get spells in your travels, and now not have them available anymore.
Though it is a bit unfortunate that the new characters from SoD don't make it to BB2:EE (some for good reason), but once again having continuation is nice for a party, especially due to some of the above reasons. And once again with the limited number of Evil characters in BG2EE, it can also be difficult, if you don't play neutral/good to find party members who will stay with you.",1588687031,1588687031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At its time of release it was one of the first true epic RPGs on PC. Today it remains a pillar of patient and intelligent RPGs where the story is paramount, the graphics inconsequential and representative of a genre that has arguably only been rehashed with an attempted evolution with the release in recent years of games of the like of Wasteland 2, Divinity or Dragon Age, which in my view improve on mechanics, but significantly rush the story component which is critical for me to actually sink into a game that takes patience  to learn whilst also requiring an epic time investment.

If one has the patience to read the text the characters here are built beautifully with the very select voice acting acquiring a cult following over the years.
""Go for the eyes boo"" 
It is a slog, there is a lot of reading involved for the game to shine.

A must for RPGs fan that value the story, with dated graphics (no surprises) and blunt, aged mechanics,true to god knows what edition of DND.

I want to start this review off by saying this is written from the perspective of someone with no experience in CRPG's. This review is aimed at new players and those unfamiliar with CRPG's

[h1] Character Creation [/h1]

It's important to say upfront that this game is not new player friendly, the mechanics feel quite dated and when you start off it is completely overwhelming. Before you even start the game you're given an in depth character creator where you have to choose a race, class and your stats, there's tons of options to choose from and if you're not familiar with D&D your probably going to struggle to make a good choice. I'd strongly suggest either reading the beefy instruction manual or looking up a guide online, however on the flip side with the amount of options available gives tons of replay value once you're familiar with it.

The only area where i found the character creator lacking was in the visual department, you only get the option to colour swap a couple of pieces of your equipment and also the hair, just know going in you'll get a fleshed out deep stat based character creator which is severely lacking in the visual department.

[h1] Story [/h1]

So I'm going to be very vague about the story here because i don't want to spoil anything but the plot follows your created character who is the adopted child of a man named Gorion, as soon as the game starts you are informed that Gorion, your father wants you to gather your supplies immediately as you must leave in a hurry, you are both in danger and need to act fast, there is no time to waste. I won't give away any more plot details than that but the story moved at a nice pace and the side quests were fleshed out and just as interesting as the main quest.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay consists of three main sections, [b] exploration, combat and dialogue.[/b] All of these elements were fantastic and came together to make an incredibly fun game with a dense and complex world, I'll break down each part individually starting with exploration.

[h1] Exploration[/h1]

The way you move about in Baldur's Gate is between several small areas that are part of a larger open world, these can consist of towns, the wilderness or dungeons. In towns there will usually be Inn's, shops and quests to be found. 
Generally in town's you'll to pick up multiple quests for the surrounding area and stock up on gear. Sometimes these quests will be too high level for you but it encourages you to go back later, all your quests are written in a journal written by the protagonist, so rather then telling you exactly where to go it would say something like ""I need to go collect some wolf pelts, I've heard wolves can be found up north"" and you'll be expected to go find them yourself,

If you're not in a town you'll generally be wandering the wilderness, these are large open areas filled with NPC's, monsters and other surprises to find. All of these areas felt quite dense with content and rewarded you for exploring, I never felt bored since there was plenty of things to find in each area, sometimes you'll stumble upon an enemy or area which is too difficult for you so you can make a note on your map to return later. 

[h1] Dialogue [/h1]

The dialogue is where this game really shines, every conversation has multiple options for you to pick and it lets you role play however you want, you can be a hero a villain, a bit of both or even a mercenary for hire the amount of choice given is something you don't see in modern games. One great aspect of this is that it's possible to talk your way out of combat encounters by choosing the correct dialogue options, for example if you stumble upon a bar fight you can either try and defuse the situation or rile the people up and end up with a huge brawl breaking out.

Almost every conversation you have with characters in game feels is long and interesting, there's plenty of occasions where you'll have to make tough decisions and the choice isn't as simple as being good or evil sometimes you have to make the decision you feel is right at the time and deal with the consequences later. The amount of options you are given for conversations really makes talking to people fun and helps you role play your character, it really lets you choose how you want situations to play out

[h1]Combat[/h1]

Now the combat of this game is really difficult at first, if you've never played D&D before there's a lot to wrap your head around, all characters in your party attack at the same time but there is a pause button which you are going to want to use constantly if you want to survive, when you attack you roll a dice which determines if your attack hits or misses, now this sounds relatively simple but this game really makes you think as it can get quite complex towards the latter half of the game.

Rather than just mashing buttons and trying to spam your way to victory you have to stop and think about how to deal with every encounter, which spells are you going to use, which character is going to try and draw the enemies attention, where are you going to position your party members, long range or close range combat? These are the questions you're going to be asking yourself every single encounter and it makes the combat fun and engaging.

There wasn't a single instance of combat in this game I thought was easy, every single battle i had made me stop and think about how to tackle it, different strategies work on different enemies so sometimes you'll want to rush and kill everything as fast as you can while at other times you'll find yourself trying to lure enemies out one at a time so you don't get overwhelmed. The early game combat starts off pretty basic since you don't have many skills but the longer you play the more skills you get and the more complex and rewarding the fights get. Before you know it you'll be planning multiple steps ahead every single encounter so you can survive with your party in one piece, the game always felt challenging but never unfair, especially the end game dungeons with incredibly tough enemies and bosses which will push you to your limits.

[h1]Issues with the game[/h1]

As far as issues go I had very little to complain about, the only issues i can think of is that at the very start of the game it can be completely overwhelming with the choices given and it's also possible to build your character into a bad build and make it so you'll be unable to finish the game, however if you read the instruction manual or do your research on building a character this shouldn't be an issue. 

Apart from that my only issue was AI path finding, in certain dungeons you'll find your AI partners getting stuck on walls and edges, this is a minor annoyance but wasn't game breaking and only happened now and again.

[H1]Conclusion[/h1]

Overall I can't recommend Baldur's Gate enough, i went in not knowing anything about it and it ended up becoming one of my favourite games of all time. In depth character customisation leads to great replay value and a great role playing experience. The combat was challenging throughout and made me come up with a new strategy for every new encounter, the story is engaging and the side quests are all engaging and fun to complete. Baldur's gate is a masterpiece every fan of RPG's should play, just be aware of the steep learning curve going in, but i promise if yous stick with it you'll have an unforgettable experience.

While attempting to play the game we encountered several problems the two most egregious ones being:
- Constant player disconnections every 5-8 minutes.
- The game crashing randomly when trying to look up at the character screen, inventory or any other essential game menu.
This rendered the game basically unplayable, after several hours of enduring this we hadn't even arrived at the first real quest of the game.

My friends and I bought this game with the intention of playing through the campaign together, this being our first BG game ever. With that in mind, I cannot possibly recommend this game to anyone trying to do a similar thing as It does not provide a fulfilling multiplayer experience.

It's honestly a shame, as after finally giving up the multiplayer I decided to try the single player to experience the game for the first time and I really enjoyed. It's easy to see why this game has become the classic that it is today, the writing is charming, the soundtrack is very good and the combat loops are engaging and fun to experiment with.

However it's shortcomings bring my opinion of this game way down. I'm sure that had my experience with the multiplayer been a positive one, this review would be very different. In the current state of the game I stand by my earlier statement, If you intent to buy this as a multiplayer game, I cannot recommend it, for it does not provide any sort of fulfilling multiplayer experience.
I wish the developer would've taken the time to fix this issue, before releasing this and claiming it to be a multiplayer game.",1588324208,1588324208,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Keep in mind, however, that since this is the first campaign of a multi-part story (the story and character progression continues in Baldur's Gate II) the scope and power creep here is fairly limited, with your characters maxing out at levels 9-11 (or the respective dual/multi class exp equivalence). However, the gameplay remains fun and strategic, with there being a wide array of ways to approach every battle despite this. For those who enjoy the combat more than the other D&D elements, The Black Pits offers a relatively short, canned, arena combat focused side ""adventure"" with a fun story.

Exploration is a huge part of this game and it doesn't disappoint. There are tons of maps to explore and random encounters and side quests to enjoy. Combined with the large number of recruitable characters, each with their own interactions, interpersonal relationships, goals, and personalities, the game can feel different every time we play. It's easy to just get lost in the world  and forget about the main quest. The new Enhanced Edition characters and their respective stories, dialog, interactions, and voice actors are great.

Visually, even the Enhanced Edition gameplay presentation is somewhat dated but it's still enjoyable once you get used to it. The audio, however, is pretty stellar. Solid soundtrack throughout. The voice acting is similarly well done with all dialog being well written.

The game is relatively bug free but there are a few minor ones here and there. Another minor detractor is the pacing: while this is predominately under your control, the main plot tends to lose all sense of urgency when approaching the game with a completionist mindset. This can eventually place side quest plot at odds with the main plot, especially in the case of the Durlag's Tower and Balduran's Voyage end-game quests.

Many people building today's fantasy worlds after BG (and a few others, like the original Fallout and - going further back - Ultima) are standing on the shoulders of giants...and that's not a criticism, it's a compliment.

About the enhanced edition: Downloaded and installed with no issues on Win10. No issues with the gameplay so far; haven't run into any bugs, stutters, or autoclosing...though that might be due to technology improvements made since Win98 or hardware in general. Whatever the reason, definitely smoother and cleaner than the original. There's more characters and classes than I remember - always wanted to play a Monk on the paper-and-dice version back in the day so now I am - and despite having played much more technologically and thematically advanced games, I'm hooked again.

If you really want the details of the enhanced edition, look'em up. Support for higher resolution, non-Win OS, improved code, alignment with BG2, re-done cinematics. Given this revamp and re-release was done in 2012, there's mods available but I'd recommend a vanilla walk-through before changing things up.

The companions are pretty bad all around. Mismatched stats, questionable skills, some you get WAY too late, others you can't keep around because of how much reputation you are forced to gain just through basic questing for the required levels, they all just feel really flat.

Early game is a nightmare because of how limited you are to anything and everything. All combat is completely random because you don't have access to skills that meaningfully add anything, and HP is so low that a bad roll will kill. Some spells like Horror are completely overpowered because at those levels nothing has a high enough save to reliably prevent it, and this game LOVES to throw it at you, and it has a gigantic area of effect.

Enjoy seeing a never ending chain of misses as you require to roll 16+ to hit anything while the enemies only need a 10+ on your front line, because THAC0 is just a really bad system without having the higher level skills to adjust for it.

I want to love this game as much as I remember, but I can't. The magic just isn't there. The maps feel so empty, the characters are fairly boring, and even at the end of the story, it's just meh. Roll with a few mages, Horror/Hold Person, then destroy everything. It's a tactic so useful it's the only thing that you come across in the endgame.

The addition of class kits from BGII is nice, but again, these feel underwhelming until you unlock a lot of their more fun things. A paladin is exactly the same as a fighter with better saves for the most part, which is the same as a default ranger.

Durlag's Tower makes having a high level Thief essential, when having a high level Thief in the base game is completely pointless since you won't come across anything that requires it. Resulting in a character that is a worse archer/fighter that can backstab some things.

Baldur's Gate √© um jogo fruto da sua √©poca. Eu imagino que ele tenha sido revolucion√°rio quando lan√ßado, e, sem d√∫vida, os bons momentos dele s√£o realmente bons. A hist√≥ria √© simples, e no geral satisfat√≥ria. Os personagens ajudantes s√£o muitos, e variados, e em nenhum momento comandam o ritmo da hist√≥ria: nesse jogo, seu personagem √© o foco.

Eu sou jogador experiente de RPG, e conhe√ßo por alto algumas regras do AD&D. Mesmo assim, tive MUITA dificuldade para entender as magias, seus efeitos, e os milhares de pequenos detalhes desnecess√°rios que o jogo te d√° (texto redundante e prolixo), ao mesmo tempo tentando descobrir as informa√ß√µes que o jogo n√£o te d√° (o que diabos √© um turno e uma rodada em um jogo de tempo real?). √â como se o jogo falasse ""voc√™ quer aprender a jogar? vai ler o livro do jogador... e o do mestre... e aproveita e l√™ o guia de monstros enquanto faz isso tudo... depois a gente conversa."" √â um jogo que n√£o se esfor√ßa pra facilitar esse aprendizado, e muito do que usei no jogo veio de fontes externas.

Os momentos bons do jogo s√£o realmente bons e satisfat√≥rios. Acho que vi poucas coisas t√£o excelentes, em termos narrativos e mec√¢nicos, quanto a Torre de Durlag. √â um conte√∫do opcional do jogo para personagens de n√≠vel alto, e o n√≠vel de qualidade desta √°rea √© destoante do resto do jogo, e √© absurdamente bom. Ouso dizer que as horas tediosas que antecederam esta parte do jogo valeram a pena.

Os momentos ruins do jogo s√£o um porre. Di√°logos longos, caminhadas longas, encontros aleat√≥rios que rendem pouca experi√™ncia, e aquele cl√°ssico ""mas o jogo n√£o come√ßa de verdade at√© o quinto n√≠vel"". Seu invent√°rio √© limitado tanto em espa√ßo e em peso, e voc√™ gasta um bom tempo otimizando a coleta de tesouros pra, da metade pra frente do jogo, dinheiro n√£o ser mais um problema.

Eu joguei Baldur's Gate porque queria ver como era o jogo, e ver quais s√£o as expectativas pro 3 que vai sair, e estou feliz de ter jogado. √â um jogo longo, complexo, e profundo, com uma narrativa pass√°vel, e que me divertiu. Se voc√™ n√£o quer se dar ao trabalho de aprender um sistema obtuso de regras (o que diabos √© THAC0? Por que a armadura baixa √© melhor que a alta?), ou se uma hist√≥ria repleta de clich√™s te desagrada, fa√ßa a si mesmo um favor e passe LONGE de Baldur's Gate.",1587673435,1587673435,True,1,0,0.497887730598449707,0,True,False,False

I've played through it more times than I can count, going all the way back to the original incarnation's launch in 2000.  It is the single most influential video game I have ever played.  After beating it the first time, I remember trying to play through BG1 to see if it was anywhere near as good.

It was not.

I quit pretty quickly.  I don't remember how far I got, and, for years, I just dismissed it as boring and one-note.  But, having decided recently to play through BG2 again, for the 3,916th time, I decided to make a proper go of it and start with BG1, thinking maybe it got better with age.  Maybe it got better as my appreciation for BG2 grew.

It did not.

This game suffers from its low level play.  It suffers so badly from it.  Warrior types ineptly flail about, missing almost constantly (not aided by the engine animating the 5 attacks per round maximum even though you'll only ever have 1 or 2).  Pretty much anyone else can be flippantly one-shot by a stray arrow or a slightly lucky single bolt magic missile.  Casters have 1-3 spells to cast before they have to rest, and any offensive disabling magic (horror, hold person, etc) cast against you is practically a guaranteed full wipe.  My strategy very quickly became outfitting everyone with bows and slings, then tagging one character with decent (read, actually double digit) HP to run around in circles, luring all the enemies to endlessly chase him as the rest of the party pelted them slowly to death.  This strategy was basically a necessity until I got to around level 5 (at which point the majority of the game is over).  Anytime I tried standing my ground in the early game, my front line was inevitably slaughtered in short order.

The quest design and storytelling are similarly frustrating.  Nearly every quest apart from the main line is reduced to the form: I was wandering around the woods when <insert monster type here> stole my lucky <insert household/clothing item here>, get it back!  What's worse, each quest is presented as a uniformly imposing wall of text, and after trudging through it, you are always presented with the same two dialog options:

1. An over-exaggerated Medieval Times style acceptance replete with forsooths and anons, or...

2. A refusal written either by a rage courting psychopath or Tom Green who, as he is contractually obligated, just wants to show you how wacky and zany and hilarious he is are you laughing yet come on laugh laugh lauhahahahaugh...

This kind of ""storytelling"" is done practically everywhere in the game.  There's no pacing, no room for anything to breathe or effect.  The actual guts of the main story are interesting enough, to a point.  Investigating the leads in the mines and the woods and building a case against the Iron Throne is pretty cool.  As well, what they're up to in the city, with their competing merchant guilds, was interesting.  But once the big ""plot reveal"" happens, the story just dies.  What should be this massive, earth-shattering moment is delivered in a book.  You read in Sarevok's journal that you're probably a child of Bhaal and the game's just like: ""Cool, okay, I guess this is proof that he's been doing naughty things and shouldn't be a grand duke or whatever.""  And there's no questioning, no impact, no reaction from party members or allies.  It's just dismissed.  The centerpiece for your place in the entire series is introduced with a yawn and then dismissed.  It's incomprehensibly bad storytelling.

Fortunately, the game only limps on a short while longer.  And what fights that do remain are trivial things when pitted against...waaaaaand mouuuuuntain (seriously, I had so many wands by the end).  But the enjoyment of beating the game was limited strictly to enjoyment at the prospect of not needing to play it anymore.  I would have had a better time just starting with BG2 again.  Still boring.  Still one-note.

The wilderness exploration component is the only aspect I wish had carried through into BG2.  It had legitimate potential, even if it was largely wasted on pointless fetch quests.  Avoid.",1587595078,1587595102,False,39,6,0.587398171424865723,2,True,False,False

There is an entire coast of areas to discover, including the city of Baldur's Gate, with lots of random stuff and quests. In addition, while the gameplay system might seem daunting if you are not familiar with tabletop rpg's, expect to spend hours figuring out what works for a character and what doesn't, which spells are effective when, how to approach certain enemies etc. At least half of the fun of the game is in exploring the system as much as the story and areas.

For the experienced: Do yourself a favour, and replay this with the EE, together with the mods BG1 NPC project and Holic's 3.5 remaster of this game, with basic AI enhancements from SCS recommended. This will breathe new life into the game, and boosts a lot of classes and combinations that used to be weak in the original version.

Especially I welcome the 3.5 mod's balanced approach to classes, items and feats. It is a hell of a lot of fun to explore the new feat system, the new abilities and the new spells as well as the new NPC classes. In addition, I feel with its revamped attack-per-round system and the changed stacking of dex bonus with armour the game is much more enjoyable, and a lot of classes that used to be very weak (without a dual class splash of fighter) are now much more effective, notably clerics and thieves. I must warn that the first two levels before you get to lvl 3 are also much more deadly!

I'd recommend for anyone into newer offerings like Divinity Original Sin or the Pillars of Eternity games, or anyone interested in the upcoming BG3 release, with the caveat that the older D&D systems may take some getting used to.

[u]Long Take[/u]
Disclosure - I absolutely love this entire series. And yes, that includes the recent Siege of Dragonspear xpac. A must play for anyone into CRPGs and story-based games, although newcomers to the series will have an adjustment period to the older D&D rule set. But once you figure everything out, boy is this a fun game. Most reviews cover what this game is about, so instead, I'll offer some tips to get the most out of a first foray into the Sword Coast.

[list]
[*]The mechanics, like mentioned, are antiquated. Lower numbers are better when it comes to things like Armor Class (AC), saving throws (resist magic and the like), THACO (your chance to hit). Big numbers are desired for stuff like actual damage and HP pools.
[*]Fighter variants are a safe first choice to play as. Dual/Multi classes are very strong but take some understanding of the rules. Mages begin very weak but become ultra powerful (moreso in BG2) if you understand their spellbooks - control/debilitation spells are quite good. A thief is vital for newbies when it comes to pick locks and find traps, so I'd recommend sticking with Imoen to cover this.
[*]In BG1 especially, take your time and explore some. You have a few companions who rush you towards Nashkel, but they'll shut up the first time you enter that area then you can go do whatever you want. Even moreso than BG2, this game is pretty open to the order of balance between side-questing and main story.
[*]If you're into the RP aspects, the game generally leans into the good approach. This includes the supposed ""canon"" party that is pushed on to you in transitions between BG1/SoD/BG2. However, if you plan a full saga playthrough, I actually think it wraps up quite nicely with an evil/selfish bent. Murder-hobo doesn't work well, but I personally enjoyed a power craving sort the most.
[*]There's some controversy to Siege of Dragonspear, the xpac between BG1 and BG2. I think its worth playing, if nothing else for the tactically interesting fights that are added.
[*]Modding! I actually recommend one mod for a first playthrough: ""BG1 NPC Project"". One of the biggest weaknesses of this game is that your companions are much shallower than in BG2, and this mod does a fantastic job of bringing them to life. It provides them with quite a lot of well written dialog interjections.
[*]Modding pt. 2: for those who want more of a challenge with superior enemy AI, look into Sword Coast Strategems. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for a first playthrough, but its fantastic if you have experience with other CRPGs, are a patient sort who likes tactical challenges, or have played this game before but never with SCS.

There is a large amount of text, talking to NPC's, and wandering about from destination to destination as opposed to the predominantly combat heavy, action-oriented RPGs popular today.  If anything it is the definition of the CRPG genre and for those that enjoy the turn based RPG's of the 90's and prior, I would suggest giving it a shot if this one passed you by.  It somewhat captures the feel of a tabletop experience but is also a very well made game in its own right.  The music, dialogue, and artwork in particular are well done.  The pre-rendered backgrounds still look great and still worth checking out if you're in the latter camp.  If not, do some digging to make sure this would be right for you.

Even based more than 20 years ago, the characters feel much more personalized than systems with sliders and modern graphics. This is the epitome of a role-playing game, you play a role in the world around you. This game uses an older version of D&D which is much more restrictive yet more concrete than 5th edition (which is fantastic but this was the version that I grew up with). These rules make the game challenging and, sometimes, unforgiving. Yet the game is rewarding and easily replayable. 

This game is truly amazing, the characters who you can pick up along the way (yes, Minsc & Boo!) or that you fight have fascinating personas, powers, abilities, and features that make them all unique. The voice acting is truly amazing and the artwork for each character is beautiful. The story is excellent but is a bit simple; but there are many side-quests and monsters to fight that can be done over and over again.

BGEE is a great reboot of a good old game. The classic game is largely left as is and extra content is generally in line with the theme and feel of its predecessor. Yes it can be buggy and yes it is dated but its not a remake of an old game its a porting of an old game to new systems using the updated mechanics of its sequel. I for one am happy with the end results and am on a great nostalgia kick. 

This game gets a bit of flack from some for being dated or not as modern as current fantasy adventure games but that is kind of the point, this game is over 20 years old. Yes there are more modern games using the classic ISO feel like POE or tyranny and they are great games also but if you want a taste of the epic classic that really kicked it all off in a big way this is the game for you. A must play for any fantasy RPG fan.

I for one enjoyed the BG2 mechanics and the opportunity to play that in the original BG with all the gritty graphics of the late 1990's intact is just great. Some interface options feel a little clunkier than the original but most are improvements over what was available in 1998. Perhaps the name enhanced edition is misleading as not a lot has been enhanced, but rather updated for running on modern machines with the classic bugs mostly fixed (although some new ones have been introduced). I appreciate the fact that for the most part the original has been left intact, some lines of dialogue are missing here and there but its really not a game breaker. The new additions by beamdog of a few extra characters to join your party and their associated quests slide well into the game and play as though they have always been part of it so again no complaints. 

This game won't hold your hand or spoon feed you the solution, this is raw good old gaming when you had to figure it out for yourself. God I miss the days when every game didn't start with a 15 min here's how to press the button hand hold tutorial, but I digress.

Multiplayer seems to have the same buggy unreliability of the original 1998 version which can be a pain but again for me it was just classic business as usual, you could expect some stability improvements overall but I have to admit I haven't really had any of the issues in multiplayer that most people complain about. Lucky us I guess. 

I think Beamdog did a great job with the EE series, and am happy to recommend them to others. Get BGEE and BG2EE and when you are done with them get Icewind Dale EE and Planescape Torment EE and get lost in some gritty old school classic fantasy RPG. 

Then go play ultima and diablo and see how great BG really is for its time. (I like them too just BG/IWD are better IMHO, more so now with the EE versions)

The difficulty is refreshing; keeping everyone in your party alive is truly a struggle at times, requiring planning, creativity, and occasionally sheer dumb luck. The battles are hard-won and rewarding because of it. 

To speak on the diversity of character builds, I will start by saying Baldur's Gate offers a breadth of options that put modern games to shame. It does this both by offering a ton of class options AND by making those decisions matter. Your decisions in this regard affect your gaming experience substantially, and BG encourages players to really experiment with their play style in a way that reaches far beyond the knight/rogue/mage idea you may see here and there. 

The game is also superbly written, with deep lore to unravel both on the macro (world) and micro (character) level. The world is alive; factions are breathing down each other's necks, the morality of it all is far from simple black-and-white good and bad, and the characters you end up interacting with fall out with one another based on deeper values and critiques. It's important to consider how you build a party, for instance, because while a balance of skills is key, a similar diversity of perspectives may lead to two party members coming to blows. A lot is happening all the time, and the scale this gives to one's take-away is satisfying to say the least.

Baldur's Gate's graphics have aged decently, they have a date feel, but still hold up well enough for new players to get into the game and get bitten by the rpg bug.
Great replayability. While the main story remains consistent, by choosing a different class and companions, the game feels completely different.
With the ability to export your character and import into Baldur's Gate 2, the story can continue for your favorite protagonist. 
Worth picking up and giving it a play through. Old school style.

Pros
‚Ä¢	Great story.
‚Ä¢	Well written dialogue, memorable and engaging characters.
‚Ä¢	The only series with Miniature giant space hamsters that I know of.
Cons
‚Ä¢	If you are not familiar with D&D there is a bit of a learning curve.
‚Ä¢	Graphics are dated, even with the refresh they got for the enhanced edition.

Don't get me wrong, it has replay value. I still find events and ways of playing that I've never seen before. However, as it is a story heavy role-playing game, playing through the same events over and over can become tiring. The advice I would give is to complete this on your first time through, to ensure that these events don't become repetitive. Additionally, I wouldn't recommend trying to do everything in every zone. It can be useful in the beginning, with some powerful magical items being hidden away, but will become overwhelming once you reach the major cities.

It's slow. Movement speed is slow as heck.  There's no particular reason for it but walking around town or whatever is just so  s l  o   w.  Combat is also slow and tedious.  There's longass pauses between attacks. 

Characters are also super fragile. A wolf will kill you in one hit. There's no in-game solution to this. There's no ""downed"" state to rescue people from. They're just dead. You are expected to reload and roll the dice again.  There's often not even a lot of room for smart tactics.  You micromanage your party to move them around and hope they don't get hit.  It's not fun. It gets a little better when you level up but it's a terrible early game.

Leveling is slow. You killed a wolf (after a few reloads)!  You earned 65 / 2500 xp needed to level. Yay?

The spellcasting system is classic D&D which is trash. You camp a lot to refresh spells. Sometimes you get ambushed and reload. It's not good.

The Positive: I've been playing the infinity engine games since release and as the years wore on, the amount of modding it needed to be playable on a modern system was kind of a chore (widescreen mod, etc.). So from that perspective, the EE versions make it very accessible for people coming at this new, or for people who just don't want to be bothered with the setup.

The Negative: The Beamdog made content (new NPCs, Siege of Dragonspear, Black Pits, etc.) is really uneven or even downright terrible. It's not so much that they tried to put some new NPCs to show off new kits and classes (wild mage, blackguard, monk, etc.) it's that the way they are written and even put in your face doesn't really match the tone of the original companion NPCs. Whatever, it's easy enough to ignore them (or preferably recruit them and get them killed).

The ""I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or a good thing?"" thing: The increased level cap from Siege of Dragonspear and the inclusion of BG2 kits, and BG2 spells. In the first case the increase from 161K to 500K creates a situation where you're character will be about 2 levels higher than they normally would be when you import them to BG2. Certainly you can skip the expansion or disable it to keep the old EXP cap, but it makes for a very different experience if you're planning to follow on with the sequel. Second to that is the inclusion of BG2 spells and kits. The original Baldur's Gate wasn't made with either of these mechanics in mind, and some of them can really trivialize certain encounters and it doesn't appear that Beamdog did much (if anything) to re-balance the game with these changes. On the other hand exporting characters to the next installment is much more streamlined, without having to respec.

All-in-all? Quibbles aside with new content, the addition of all of the quality of life improvements makes this a pretty good remaster/update. I just wish Beamdog had included a toggle to turn off the new companions or had integrated something like an SCS (Sword Coast Strategems) difficulty option so I don't have to do any modding.",1581961465,1581961465,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

However, the game still has a lot of charme. Great NPC and character interaction, tons of lore and good sideqeusts make the game still worth playing even after two decades. Your actions and decisions have some impact on the NPC around you since you may play as one of the goody good guys or as an evel freak and this is what makes rpgs interesting.
D&D fans will like how the ruleset was implemented in the game, making character progression and leveling very complex. Character progression is rather slow and especially at the beginning your characters will have only a limited amount of abilities. Nevertheless, you'll have plenty of options later on leveling up your characters. If you are not familiar with the D&D ruleset you'll have to do some research on what is possible and what might suit your playstyle.
Moreover, it is great to see that a game can tell an exiting story without aiming at saving the world, the galaxy or the universe. It is a simple story but it should still make you curious and you will want to know what is going on at the Sword Coast and you'll want to discover the dark secrets of your main character. 

If you want to have a modern, fast paced game you will hate Baldur's Gate. If you are looking for a rather slow game experience extremely rich in details, with a solid or even good story then this game might be interesting for you.

And Beamdog's quality of life and UI changes make this very much worth playing if you have any interest in the genre. The story is poorly paced with the most exciting moments of it all jammed into the last third of the game. The combat is easily the highlight of the game and after taking a few minutes to learn what the hell THAC 0, it isn't hard to figure out, especially since the game does all the dice rolling and calculations for you. Lower THAC 0 and Armor class is the only stuff you need to know to get started. Save often, the early game can be brutal.

There is a pretty big difficulty spike late in the game once mages start buffing and going nuts with crowd control. Although a lot of this difficulty comes from a lack of knowledge and mages being pushovers for the first half of the game and suddenly being real threats. Magic is where the brilliance and depth of the combat really starts to shine through. Learning what does and doesn't work throughout my play through of the game was a lot of fun, if not sometimes frustrating. There are several difficulty options available to you if you get stuck though.

The only thing I would recommend you do before anything is reading up on stats and probably some first time builds. You don't need to do anything complicated like dual classing. Just make sure you know what stats your class wants and what it can do without, and keep rolling. It's very easy to handicap yourself before the game even starts due to AD&D funkiness.

This version has so many improvements and cut content from the original, just quality of life stuff and stuff that should have been there plus a few new surprises. You don't have to hunt for the best mods or worry if things will get messed up, Beamdog has taken care of everything for you.

Now, moving on to what you want to know...

Baldurs Gate¬†is an isometric rpg that does a good job of hiding the ""holding your hand"" technique, usually the typical process is a mini-map, arrows and markers but here in this game we have a journal and a world map, you're pretty much told wheee to go by name and just search with the clues given to you so technically ot still holds your hand but in a much more mature way than what we're used to getting in an rpg. Arrows and markers wouldn't make much sense in an isometric rpg anyway.

The mechanics are complex.. you know, there are some Jrpg's which use super complex mechanics in crafting, combat and so forth. This game buries anything else in the industry in terms of depth of combat and learning curve for mechanics. You can play this game for 80 hours and still not know all of the systems. Whether you're an experiened D&D player or new, you're still going to be learning the same amount.

Story-wise, it's not very emotional like some games I've played today (Life Is Strange, Transistor, Nier: Automata, I'm looking at you!). It's not going to make you cry but it might make you laugh. Voice acting is partial, there is some, enough to give you some personality to both npc's and playable characters who join your party. You're going to be reading alot, there's alot of dialogue and alot of choice.

As far as interactivity and exploration go, there's alot to explore and alot of side-quests. Random emcounters are a thing, if you set up camp and rest, bandits may come for you and try to kill you, you may wake up to find some of your items stolen. Make a wrong choice that your party disagrees with and they may abandon your party. Bounty hunters will be sent after you if you are murderous, the town will love you or fear you based on how you treat townfolk. There literally isn't a game on the market that matches the depth of the Baldurs Gate series in this regard.

There is alot of freedom in Baldurs Gate. It's thought of by many to be the 2D spiritual predecessor to The Elder Scrolls series but gives you more choice than them. You can be anyone, any class, kill anything or anyone, have a party of six or solo and much more.

""Story-Mode"" difficulty has been added and what a joy it is to play if you find the combat to be an overwhelming joy or if you have better things to do than worry about dying or losing companions and gear. As someone whose work is getting more demanding, I was thankful for this option, I don't want a 60 hour game to be stretched out to 200 just because of deaths when I have to work alot and have other games to play and finish as well (My backlog is large).

Graphically, the sprites are not the best but the 2D backdrops are gorgeous. This is far better looking than the original version of the game. You can actually tell what things are, you can zoom in and see small decales like an inn symbol and so on. Sound is crisp like the original, there really isn't a change there but surround sound and headphones support has been added.

Controls: My only legit and validated compaint is that controller support hasn't been added. The PS4 port of the game proved that controller works better with the game's UI than mouse and keyboard. Who would have thought? I wish that this was an option like it is for Divinity: Original Sin. Alot of pc gamers seem to agree that controller would fit the game better now as we pass through the years. Otherwise, if you are happy with the mouse and keyboard, you won't care too much about this anyway.

Overall, you have an rpg game from 1998, that still gives you more freedom than any rpg today. Now that it's remastered, there's no excuse not to try this amazing rpg. Even moreso because of story-mode difficulty, you can breeze through the game on this setting so there's no reason to be intimated if you're not familiar to the D&D systems.",1580257864,1580257864,True,26,2,0.649826407432556152,0,True,False,False

Needless to say the game presents gobs of content and back in its day it was a gem among games, literally taking gaming into the world of D&D in a very narrative driven way, like pen and paper D&D itself.  Needless to say I readily partook of all the other games: Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate 2, Pools of Radiance (the 2001 game), and even Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2.  These games formed the core of my love for both the novels from D&D and the D&D pen and paper universe.

I'm recommending it with the caution that I'd estimate that 80% of the population doesn't have the patience to slog through this series when other, more cutting-edge products are out there.
For most people, I'd advise just playing Skyrim if you like sword & sorcery stuff, especially if you want a shooter-like experience, but with swords and bows instead of machine guns and rocket launchers.

For those looking for an open world RPG, this is not the game for you. But it is a game that has choices which at times make you wonder which way your moral compass really points. So it's worth playing today when there are more ""sophisticated"" RPG options available.

The enhanced edition adds a lot to the game and I enjoyed finding the new followers and participating in the new quest-lines. 

My only gripe is that the multiplayer has never worked properly for my friend group. We've attempted to play multiplayer several times over the course of the last year or two. It normally disconnects us or bugs out and forces us to reconnect over and over, which can really take you out of the story with how often it occurs. This is with proper port-forwarding plus different hosts and configurations. Nothing stays stable long enough to actually play.

I originally purchased this game many years ago on sale but found the somewhat ""RnG"" based Level 1 DND combat to be off-putting. A few months ago I saw some merit in trying it again and started a inquisitor paladin with good alignment. I got rid of any character that whined about going to Nashkel early on and ended up running mainly a ""good-natured"" party with some neutral characters. After some initial exploring and questing, I found that I was much more confident wandering around the world on my own. By that I mean of course that I had dumped the walkthrough that I was using before to get my bearings. The result of this is that I ended up enjoying the open-ended aspect of the game, where one could go anywhere or do anything provided they are the appropriate level or have the appropriate spells/equipment. I'd say for 75% of the game I was just wandering around doing quests and discovering new locales. As the game is quite old, nothing I discovered along the way was truly ""ground-breaking"" and in fact most of the game world is fairly rudimentary. However it was exciting to trek across the map and get stronger along the way. 

I guess the criticisms I have to level are the fact that after a certain point I didn't really have to change up my combat strategy. Granted, I was playing on normal difficulty and not core rules and perhaps that could've played a part in it. For instance, for the early to mid game one can simply get by with a couple decent tanks/fighter, a mage who has the ""sleep"" spell and perhaps a cleric. During the latter half of the game enemies do get a lot tougher but if you've been doing side quests and gathering equipment then some of those fights can simply be pushed through with force or excessive buffing. I also didn't particularly enjoy anything from Chapter 5 onwards, although Chapter 6 was interesting. I felt that Baldurs Gate as a city was far too convoluted/overwhelming and at that point in the game I was already burnt out on doing side quests, so I just wanted to push on with the main quest. The story gets better but obviously its very straightforward and there are not many twists and turns. A product of its age.

The game may not age too well for new players due to a lack of voice acting. This is old school gaming, and its not forgiving at all. You'll be loading and saving and dying and loading constantly. It takes just a second to do so it isn't going to really slow you down. I don't think the story is very interesting, but the characters are pretty cool, and the middle of the game is great as you're really finding awesome loot that supes up your characters. 

Its interesting to try and form a party that can function and stay together, as many characters won't get along due to moral differences. This is something I'd like to see implemented in more games, but Baldur's Gate still does a great job of it. 

I do think the game overstays its welcome after a bit. It's just...man it's so long. But there are tons of characters to find and try to use and you'll likely have fun doing it. Worth it if you're looking for an old school RPG experience.

The first of my favourite game series of all time. It sets the standard pretty damn high. I‚Äôm a big fan of D&D so already have some reason to be interested in it, but this is good enough to be liked by anyone without that. The story, setting, cast, music, gameplay, customisation and replay value are all brilliant. Sarevok, the main villain, is very memorable and intimidating. There are a few issues, the very low-level start can be frustrating, for some classes more than others. I wish the NPCs that can potentially join your party were more fleshed out. I also think the pacing can be slightly off. However, none of this detracts from my enjoyment of the game. A word of warning though, I haven‚Äôt played Siege of Dragonspear yet, the recently added expansion. When it was released it broke the mods that I enjoy playing with and so didn‚Äôt download it.

This game is easily worth $20 with what is likely 60+ hours of material, and likely 80-100 for first timers into the series. The game is old, over 20 years in fact, and it's not easy by the slightest. This game is hard and is completely unforgiving unless you have quick saved before your party's death. This game is also extremely rewarding in the form of level ups, loot and new spells. For this review I am going to look at the good and the bad of the game and what you should expect going into it for your first time. 

Good:
Story - The game has a fantastic storyline and side quests that will keep you satisfied. Without going into any spoilers, the main story line lasts 7 chapters and you will likely go through 8-9 levels for your characters. The story is long, and excellent at the same time. 
Open World - The game is completely open world and is for the most part balanced to reflect this openness. I found myself completely lost in the many wooded areas and locations on the world map killing enemies that were challenging. You can pretty much approach the main storyline and side quests in different ways which is a good sign of the non-linear gameplay in Baldur‚Äôs Gate. 
Combat - The combat is a pause-based combat based on AD&D 2nd edition rules. It's very different from other CRPGs in recent memory. I suppose the closest example is Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny (both made by Obsidian) with their pause-based mechanics but the rest of the combat is significantly different. The combat is based on THAC0 or To Hit Armor Class 0 for physical damage. For magical spells the damage is calculated by whatever the spell says, typically # of times a dice of #-sided is rolled, EX: 2d8 meaning 2 rolls of an 8-sided die, (16 max damage, 2 minimum). Magical resistances are also a part of this game like other CRPGs. This system is radically different to CRPGs today so it may take some time to getting used to. Rule of thumb however is you want the lowest AC and THAC0 possible. All of this equals a super addicting combat system. Although it may be frustrating at times it's awesome to watch your enemies run in fear around the map after casting your horror ability or watching them burn alive after casting fireball. 
Companions - The older companions from the original game are a little dull, but the enhanced edition companions are fantastic, and some add unique quests and dialogue to the game. Be careful though because depending on your alignment your companions may be tricky to keep in line.
Alignment - This game is one of the few games where your reputations matters. In the game if you murder someone or add someone to your party that is evil your reputation will be hurt. And that has real game consequences. If you walk into town the guards may immediately attack you, and party members may leave depending on their alignment and your reputation. Being evil Is certainly harder than being good and reputation will interfere with some quest lines as well. 
Loading Times/performance - There are none. This game is so old it was made to run on 32-bit computers with floppy disc drives. Modern machines today make the loading times 0 so if you want a game that will run smoothly and never crashes on a potato this game is perfect. 
Character Customization - Boy are there tons of options. There are several classes to choose from and several more sub-classes after that. Choose Cleric, there are 5 priest options. Choose Thief, there are 4 sub-classes to that. While you cannot customize the way, your character looks all too much, you can customize what you want them to be. You do have to play as that class the entire game so choose wisely as you cannot respec or go down a different path like Divinity Original Sins allows you to.

Bad:
Graphics - This game is very old, and the enhanced edition does not improve the graphics that much. According to the devs all the in-game models and backgrounds were lost in a flood saved on disc drives. That is unfortunate if true as this game would look amazing if recreated on another engine like the ones that made Divinity or Pillars of Eternity 2. Though as it stands, the game is not very pretty but personally I don't mind the old graphics. You get use to them after having so much fun in the game. 
Spell indicators - The game lacks any AoE indicator for spells and other abilities. The game says that a spell has a # ft diameter but there is no way to gauge how much that is on the screen as there is no indicator. So, you could on accident shoot your own party with a fireball because you don't know how big the blast is. I suppose in EE they couldn't add that for the same reason they couldn't improve the graphics. Just be weary when firing AoE spells. 
CC - The CC itself is fine. It's just how long they last are the problem. Even when you win a fight the CC effects can last for several seconds to minutes which is annoying because you can't progress without your entire party. The effects last this long because the game is hard and if you are CC'd in a fight that generally means death. I wish the effects canceled after combat was over because then it's just annoying that you can't move. 

Conclusion: The game is great for $20 and has certainly aged well. This game is super fun and probably played best with friends. If you are looking forward to Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 I recommend you play this game in order to fully invest yourself into the Forgotten Realms and the city of Baldur‚Äôs Gate.",1560647862,1575950203,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it was a game which I knew of for most of my teen years and 20's. When the Enhanced Edition came out, I decided to give it a shot.

There are very few story based games which hold my interest. I'm more of a sandbox type gamer personally, but Baldur's Gate had me hooked. This is unlike any RPG made today. It's challenging, rewarding, sprawling, and replayable. 

Most games today are too easy. They hold your hand- treating you like you are mentally handicapped. These types of games quickly become boring because they aren't designed to be played. They are designed to sell copies to everyone and their dog. Baldur's Gate caters to gamers. You will not make it far into the game without trial and error, nor will you solve the puzzles with just a couple of braincells. Everything about Baldur's Gate feels satisfyingly challenging. You won't become a god which steamrolls everything. Often times you will barely survive by the skin of your teeth. Some of the systems are easy to abuse, thus allowing you to cheese certain aspects of the game (rest, I am looking at you!) Despite that, the game is well designed to account for those elements. 

If you want a game with challenging content, that will keep you engaged for hundreds of hours. This is for you.

Few games are quite as rewarding as Baldur's Gate. Some of that is due to the mechanical rewards, such as items, armor, spells etc. There is a very deep itemization system even though it's not obvious. Unlike most games where you'll find a sword with +4346354634535 damage or a chest piece with +43254342 strength, the numbers in Baldur's Gate are small. However, they are vastly more meaningful. You can find items which make you immune to certain effects, give you the strength of 10 men, cause enemies to instantly die every time they hit you, etc. There is a huge array of items.

Part of the reward is finding the items. The other part of the reward is seeing the effects of your actions. The writing sells the weight of your decisions very well. While this game doesn't have some complex world simulation going on, your choices matter not only for how they affect you, but how they affect the people around you. 

Baldur's Gate is a large game, with a lot of content. Don't expect Witcher 3 open world exploration, but be prepared to scour each and every map for the tinest things to get the most out of the game. There's a plethora of optional content and forking paths to keep you busy. This is a game which has a very satisfying density of things to do and places to see. Not too much. Not too little. 

BG is certainly replayable because all of the classes provide different challenges. You can tweak the difficulty, play multiplayer with friends, and pursue different story arcs. Yeah, it's still going to be a linear storyline, so if that's not your thing, then multiple play throughs may not sound enticing. Still, for what it is, this game has a lot of replay value. I hate playing the same storyline twice, or watching the same movie multiple times unless it's really good. That's BG for you. It's so good, that it is worth playing through again, either to see what you missed, pursue a different path, try a different class, or bring your friends along for the ride.

Baldur's Gate was a head of it's time, and the Enhanced edition makes it palatable for the modern audience while preserving everything that makes the game itself great.

There are very few games on steam this magnificent. I highly recommend it to any RPG enthusiast. Make sure to get Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, as well as Icewind Dale. Those three games will easily give you hundreds of hours of fun and challenge.",1574637734,1574637784,True,0,1,0.481117874383926392,0,True,False,False

One of the most Classic RPGs out on the PC.

Only Planescape: Torment beats out my love for these games due to the strength of the story.

The Enhanced Editions are decent additions to the game, even if certain moments within them feel more modern day when compared to the classic feel of the original content. The games are a product of their time, and so the new additions occasionally stick out.

Overall, I can see why people think this is one of the best RPGs out there. Was a bit of a learning curve since I wasn't use to this format but I got use to it.

The main story from the first game is pretty basic but it gets you going. Starting out as this ward, you're forced to leave for safety only to see your former father figure cut down before you. Afterwards, you're on your own to discover what has happened and go exploring.

And that's the main strength of the game: exploring. The main story I thought to be a little too loose and not really rope me into it until maybe around chapter 5 or 6 but that's where you'll be nearing the end. Exploring around though with all the interesting quests and locations are what kept me going. And Durlag's Tower and everything related to that; it's beautiful. Really true to D&D.

Then we have Dragonspear. It's...ok. I know that this gets a lot of flak for being very different (along with the addition of a trans character but is so minor that I won't linger on it, along with not bringing my beliefs), but overall it's a decent expansion. It tries to play out modern Bioware with the old and I guess it works. Kind of felt short and railroad-y for the most part though but with the payoff of a story that actually was keeping me invested. New enemies to fight, alongside one actual dragon, new items to get, it really isn't that bad...until the end. 

After the crusade is finished and you win, you're framed for a characters murder (previous companion in base game) and are basically forced back to Baldur's Gate as a murderer where you escape and then get ambushed afterwards. You have zero control. If you were the most good, honorable person in the land, doesn't matter. You're the child of a god of murder and killed a high officials child. It does tie back in with Durlag's Tower which I will give them that, but it doesn't feel that great to be railroaded/forced into this scenario at all!

But like I said, overall it's a good game. Haven't done the black pits yet but to my understanding it's just combat which is fine but not something I would like to do just for this. Now I got to start up Baldur's Gate 2 so I'm caught up for when 3 comes out.",1574035286,1574035286,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- most of the game is spent doing fun activities but the game can waste your time a bit too much for my liking when you have to move across maps you've already discovered. the fun of this game HEAVILY outweighs its problems. but to a modern player, these problems are still quite annoying.

What I liked: 
-the many choices
-the many side quests and activities: they are fun to play, and companions are numerous and have interesting backgrounds as well.
-the combat is enjoyable once you get the hang of it: uses classic dnd rules (advanced dnd or 2nd edition)

What I disliked: 
-The Slow pacing can be a problem, especially when you have to backtrack across maps it becomes a chore: since it happens over and over again.
-The Alignment system, some may like that system, I don't: if you want to play a paladin in this game have fun only being lawful good.
-If you're a mage you can't see where your aoe spells are going so you have to guess over time and just get used to that. 
-(minor) pathfinding can cause issues sometimes: slowing the game down even more


for newcomers it is slow to play and learn at first, but opens up to be a great classic rpg experience with choices and fun pause and play gameplay. for a game made in 1998, it's really good.

for modern players, who have played games such as pillars 1 or 2, divinity original sin 1 or 2, this is a great addition to any crpg like collection. just be prepared to be patient when making your party travel across individual maps",1573507649,1573594022,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,False

The classics remain as classics, for good reason. The game on offer here is a tough one, especially for those younger folks used to the comforts of modern gaming, where dialog boxes and tutorials pop up every three seconds that tell you ""press x to win"". This is a fairly hardcore rpg, and you won't get much in the way of hand-holding here. From a modern perspective, there absolutely should be more transparency of game mechanics on offer here, but part of the fun is also figuring it out. There are a ton of good guides and forums posts at this point that will help out anyone looking to crack the surface of the rather archaic 2nd edition D&D ruleset that this wonderful game is based off, so you're never going to be totally screwed.

But, what exactly is the appeal of such an old game? Graphically, this one isn't going to please everyone, but for that small subset of people like me who really yearn for the simpler times of computer gaming, you'll find yourself at home here, the character and monster models aren't great but the environments themselves are quite nice. Many indoor and outdoor areas have an awesome amount of details, like little items scattered on tables, shelves of potions and artifacts lining the walls of a wizards lair. The setpieces are very well done and very pleasing to play inside of. The dark caverns feel spooky, the dungeons forboding, and the forests lush. 

Sound wise, the spell effects and some of the music still sounds really great and pack that good old school punch. The voice overs are sometimes a bit distorted here and there but at the time this game was made, it wasn't too common to have a lot of voice acting in RPG's just yet. The voice acting itself is half-decent. The perfect amount of 90's cheesiness and delivery without descending into ""so bad it's good"" territory. 

The actual combat and gameplay is where the game truly shines. Levelling up is a slow process, good gear is rare and hard-earned. Spells are numerous and complex. The entire system is a big puzzle where you're given a ton of different pieces, where each piece could go any number of places. The really tough encounters act as knowledge checks and often you'll need to figure out the right combination of spells and buffs and characters to bring to each fight. Be prepared to abuse your save button, as some encounters will require you to suffer multiple defeats until you come up with good strategies to beat them. Every victory you earn and every new item you get feels incredibly rewarding as a result of how tough of a slog some parts of the game can be, and with the Enhanced Edition; you now have the option of tackling one of the toughest and most fun dungeons of it's era... Durlags Tower. 

If you're frustrated in the early game, I highly advise you to stick with it and maybe look up a character guide or two, once you get the games mechanics down and you're off on your adventure; few games will match how rich of an experience this is.

The best part is: literally everything I've applauded this game for is 3 times as better in the sequel.

I must have played through my original game a gazillion times, and through wear and tear, after nearly 20 years, my discs finally gave out, making them unplayable. So when it was released on Steam, I got it almost right away.

The game is set in the Forgotten realms, if you've ever played DnD, you'll basically recognize 100% of the content. If you haven't, and you have patience, then you're in for one of the better stories told. And patience is what the game requires. You need to figure out what the spells do, how the system works. Because just like DnD, it's basically a tactics game relying heavily on probabilities. What may seem like a great weapon or a great spell, might actually be bad, and what seems like a weak weapon or spell, may actually be somewhat overpowered.

But it has changed. If you have played Baldurs gate before, then you might notice these changes. What Beamdog did right was to fix a lot of the bugs that was never fixed in the original. They deserve kudos for that. But they also deserve a bit of a thumbs down. Their changes basically ruined the final fight. In the original, the final fight was a truly difficult fight. But it was winnable. I won it the first time I fought it. I was a kid back then, and almost all of my party died. But I won. This time around, I had to fail, reload, and fail again a dozen times over before winning. Beamdog changed things. They changed how summons work. They changed how enemies worked. They changed detection. I don't know if they changed the stats and spells of the enemies, but here's the thing:

Unless you know beforehand what goons the final boss brought, and unless you know what spells they will use and what abilities they have, you can never win the fight the first time around. Or rather - the probability of you predicting what spells and tactics you should utilize in order to win is incredibly low. And that's the bad part - because it means that Beamdog made the end fight unnecessarily hard and basically a game of trial and error.

Trial and error, in my opinion, only belongs in games which has expressibly included it in the gameplay. Baldurs gate is not one of those games. So when I finished the game, finally, I didn't have a sense of accomplishment. I just felt I had performed labour in order to win. It sucked.

But that doesn't remove the enjoyment I had during the rest of the game.
Beamdogs one mistake doesn't cloud the rest of the achievement.
