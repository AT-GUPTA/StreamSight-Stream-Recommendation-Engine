Seriously, who can't deny the fact that you'll have fun playing with other people who you don't know, or do know? If you found Half Life 2 fun, but got bored because of no Multiplayer SP campaign support, this obviously solves the problem. With servers in Houston, Texas, this allows American people to have good connection. If you have bad ping, making your own server and playing with friends is another way. There are some bugs for me though, such as when I play so many servers to the point where the game actually has a black screen. I have to hard stop my computer, but the fun factor prevents me from giving this a bad rating. Overall, I give this an 8.5/10. Why the hell are you waiting?
