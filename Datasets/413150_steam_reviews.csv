That being said its personally helped me through some low, and Dark times in my life, Including the current dark patch Ive had to weave around this year in the last 6 months Between my ADHD and Chronic Depression.
The planning that has to go into the ""End Game"" between Buffs, and Food, Gear and many other things, has been a welcome and much needed distraction. I almost forgot how fun the tedium of planning out the next few potential days can be. Every item has a use, and when the items use runs out, theres more than likely another use to be found for it. Like when you run out of coal for smelting. Theres more than one way to get that item than just to find it while mining in the caves for other resources and Minerals.

Enough prattling on, on my end I guess all I have to say is Thanks @ConcernedApe for making this spiritual successor (in a way) to the old school ""Harvest Moons"" from way back in the day. Your work has had an impactful result on the lives of so many people.

There's at least one thing that every kind of player may like to do, whether it be relaxing while farming, battling it out to the death in the mines, or peacefully fishing. The community couldn't be better as well. Not only are the people, artists, mod creators so very nice, but the game creator, concerned ape, is literally one of the best people that I've ever seen. For instance, he uses poles on social media to choose what new marriage candidates should be in the game, and not only does he allow modding, but he encourages it. In fact, in the time that I'm writing this, he's working on a way for it to be easier on modders to create and easier for users to download. This game is so equal, like there's gay marriage, relationships among NPC's whether it be good or bad, you can even have a friend in game and marry them if you like. Whether you're a first person shooter kind of person or a Hollow Knight playing god, you'll definitely love this game. (This game is like neither of those, just saying you'll most likely love it regardless of what you normally play.) If you don't like the game, try out some mods and see if you'd like any of those, then if you don't like those then you obviously have the choice of refunding. Just have fun with it though, don't stress about anything and just relax. If you do get into the game, just know that if you're stuck there's a wiki, and if you play a lot then definitely look out for the nice little secrets in the game. 

Have the most fun you can c:

My only regret is that I took so long to play it. CA put so much love and effort into this project, and along with it has grown the most amazing fan base I have ever seen. The community itself is filled with kindness and respect, really nothing but pure love for a well deserved game. For any level of gamer you might be, I can't recommend this game enough. You can stick to vanilla Stardew, or explore countless mods many talented creators have put out for free. It's an endless adventure full of fun, romance, diverse friendships, many thoughtful challenges, and beautiful scenery. Stardew Valley is much more than just a farming sim, and I can't imagine any gaming topping this for me anytime soon.

For starters, most farm sim allows you to plant anything any time. Stardew Valley takes it further by having selected crops to plant depending on their season. And the best part about it - the crops realistically match the season where they grow in real life. 

Another thing that makes this game better than other farm simulation games is the fact that challenges your personal ethics. Whether you want to support a local business or a big corporation, it is up to you which one to support depending on how you analyze each business. 

And it is not just a cozy game where the low-key gamers can relax. Features like the mines put an exciting twist to this game that would challenge even the hardcore gamers. 

Perhaps what gives the game its unique spin is the richness of each NPC. Each NPCs have unique stories to tell that will definitely pull your heartstrings. Every time you interact with each NPC, you will learn more about them and eventually fall in love with their stories,

Lastly, the versatility of this game lets players pick and choose the difficulty they want. You have the freedom to do whatever you want in your farm. Plus, the availability of modding in this game is wide enough to fulfill your dreams of customizing how your game works.

The game beautifully combines farm simulation with RPG elements, creating an absorbing rural world. It’s not just about farming, it’s about the interconnectedness of the community and the land.

Starting my farm was a slow process, but it was rewarding to see it grow from a few parsnips to a bustling source of income. The game is relaxed and lets you grow at your own pace, but it’s a rich world once you get past the slow first season. The blend of RPG and farm sim feels effortless, and it makes Stardew Valley exciting and compelling without being stressful.

However, the game is not without its flaws. The days in Stardew Valley are short, and there’s always so much to do. Between farming, fishing, mining, and befriending the townsfolk, it can feel like there’s never enough time. It’s also easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of activities and options available.

Despite these challenges, Stardew Valley is a game that keeps me coming back. There’s always something new to discover, a new crop to plant, or a new area to explore. It’s a game that offers endless fun, addictive gameplay, and a sense of accomplishment that’s hard to find elsewhere.

Also, a UI that was better laid out and easier to navigate would make a big difference. I've found myself using keyboard and mouse as well as a controller as using the controller 100% of the time is just chaos when using some of the menus. This really should be looked at! It's amazing the games has come this far and the interface still feels ancient. Considering the game revolves around time, respecting the player's ability to organise would really, really help reduce stress.

An example of how the game forces you to use the wiki's:

Upgrading Watering Can - You go to the Blacksmith to upgrade your tools but it never mentions that you can upgrade your watering can. Now when I leave the house I put my watering can in a chest to save inventory space but keep my Sword, Axe, Pick Axe and Hoe. I'm on Year 3 and at no point did I see a way of upgrading my watering can at the Blacksmiths as the option was never offered. Now I've learnt you only get offered upgrades for what you are holding!! So the game never mentions this at all...no doubt obvious to some but to me I never would have taken my watering can there as it never needs to leave the farm!?!?!

Finishing Off Community Centre? Need animal products? Why is getting the right eggs a mystery?? Where's the explanation on how to get large eggs?? How do you get white eggs if the two chickens you have are brown?? Off to the Wiki...""to get a white chicken just cancel the purchase process when buying a new chicken until you get the chicken you want!!!"" Well game...why not just let the player choose what colour chicken they want when they are buying them?? Would it be that hard...???

As for the GUI, It's like an adult made the game and let their kids make the GUI (graphical user interface)...absolutely ruins any enjoyment when I end up screaming at how unusable every, single menu is! And having a control scheme whereby one button does multiple functions...fine in other games but in this it just makes interacting/using items a risk if you're too quick and are not aware of what you've got selected in your inventory!!!

Losing equipment due to ""Weeds have destroyed parts of your farm"" message sucks especially when there were no weeds around the effected area. In one case for me, two barrels making Starfruit Wine got taken out when they were set next to my house with no weeds, no trees, no grass, no seeds, no wood and no stones around them. Amazing how a weed can take out a wooden barrel overnight!! 

Lightning is also annoying as despite having over a dozen lightning rods installed around the perimeter of my plots I still lose crops in storms...usually Starfruits!! This goes against the relaxing nature of the game as all of a sudden you are questioning your farm setup but yet you have no stats or info to fall back on. Would it not be cool to have an item that shows the effective area of scarecrows and lightning rods???

Harvesting large crops becomes tedious with no offered solution to speed up the process over time. A lot of my frustration with the game comes from it feeling comparable to a mobile game that looks to keep you playing but only really offers a long grind to feel a sense of progress. Want iridium?? Well, that alone has taken me over 1 game year to prep for due to needing 99 stones to make 1 staircase!! In one afternoon I could get around 300 pieces of stone. And when approaching the Skull Cave you'll want to have 99 steps at least. These 99 steps will require you to grab just under 10,000 stones!!! And there is nowhere to farm stones other than the quarry which is basically utter rubbish as it renews too slowly. Next option is mining and when you don't even get a stone from every rock you break I hope you can see that the mid to late game is basically a huge, repetitive grind.

Most of the game mechanics are decent. The time/day cycle really motivates you to prioritise what you need to get done although I still think the game would benefit from extending the length of a day by about 10-15%. Trying to attack everything at once will stress you out. Pick what you want to do and stick to it knowing another year will roll by allowing you to address things that you missed out on the first time round. It rarely feels comfortable though as if you want to get a lot done you'll soon end up rushing around...

Not finding much excitement mid-game...new stuff doesn't really impact you much or offer any new and exciting changes. Machines like the recycler just get boring and pointless after a short while. Would be nice if everything had more purpose and made more impact. I have chests full of ""stuff"" that I've kept as I don't know what use it serves. Looking online at the wiki it does feel like MOST of what's there isn't used for ANYTHING! In most cases they are used for dyes?!?! So few options for a survival game...compared to say...Terraria where everything you collect has a purpose.

Heart's in the right place...just needs someone on the team who can smooth off the rough edges and maybe add a bit more depth to some of the games mechanics...

I think Stardew Valley 2 will be amazing...just as long as the guy making it employs more people to help.

Ideas:

Would love to see more focus on Hops and have more varieties to choose from. Craft Ale is very popular these days and to have access to different hops (Azaca, Citra, Mozaic, Galaxy) and some different brewing solutions to make Porters, Stouts, Lager and Ales would be very do-able. Same for wine and other beverages....

Would love to see better clothing with buffs early/mid game that improve walking speed. Coffee is such a joke and it really shouldn't be so hard to walk a bit faster!

There's a desperate need to make harvesting big plots more enjoyable. Picking each item one by one only serves to extend game time...nothing else!!! Absolute misery at the moment...especially with blue berries!!

Hoses?? Could hoses be implemented to water your beans/hops??

Horse manure? Could we have access (late game) to fertiliser that grows quicker and increases quality AND lasts two seasons???

Starting a new season is never enjoyable with a big farm. There needs to be tools available that allow more ground to be covered quickly. Hoe'ing each tile manually after 6 years farming seems wrong.

Manual switch for sprinklers?? How about letting us turn on the sprinklers manually???

**Pros:**

* Chickens. So many chickens.
* Highly addictive. Seriously, I haven't seen sunlight in days. My crops are thriving, but my vitamin D deficiency is not.
* Finally achieved my lifelong dream of becoming a hat connoisseur.
* Single-handedly revived the local economy by becoming a pumpkin overlord.
* Lewis lowkey creeps me out, but hey, free parsnips.

**Cons:**

* Therapist bills are skyrocketing thanks to my crippling emotional attachment to fictional pixelated characters.
* Crops are more demanding than my actual children.
* Developed an unhealthy obsession with mayonnaise. 
* Sold my soul to Joja Corporation for that sweet, sweet auto-grabber. Deep regrets.
* Still haven't figured out how to talk to Elliot without sounding like a lovesick fool.

**Overall:**

This game is both a blessing and a curse. It's the perfect escape from reality, but be warned: you may lose yourself in the pixelated utopia of Stardew Valley. Just don't blame me when your real-life plants die because you're too busy watering your virtual pumpkins.

**Additional Notes:**

* 100% recommend romancing Penny. Best girl, hands down.
* Beware the dangers of the Skull Cavern. I may or may not have sacrificed several cows to appease the RNG gods.
* ConcernedApe, please add more hat options. I need more hats.

I love this game, it's got it's own charm. When it first came out I saw it was like the harvest moon/story of season games, and honestly I loved this more for many reasons. 

- the mods (eventually) made more game. I had done so much in the OG game that I got tired of it after a while, this year i picked it up and added mods and it added SO much more to do it was nuts. 
- The characters feel more like real people they made sense. I enjoy good character development 
- the story is optional, you don't have to be the nature lover, you can pick jojo, or nither of them. It's interesting. (i'm a never jojo gang) 
- the things you can have and do, the amount of machines, animals, things you can do. It's crazy how much is in this game to do and grind for. 
- the farming, mining, fishing, dungons, festivals and more. 

there's way more to point out but it's a very fun game. I enjoy the pixel art work too, it's something not a lot of people do much anymore but I like the styles of it all. 

This game is STILL getting updates, new content and more love then any game I've played since. I love this game and it's so sweet the guy loves the game too. 

So I would say, please try it if you like calming gaming that let's you just pick some blueberries, forage some mushrooms and get to know all the people because it's nice to just chill out and walk around. 

I could say so much more but, if your looking at my comments your probably already thinking about getting it, i'm telling you you should! It's great, <3 A game I will always go back to.",1708445675,1708445675,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

reader, i have already finished year 1.

in 4 days i have racked up 36 hours of playtime, two chickens (named pompadour and fedour), two cows (named mater and gertrude), a cat named miso, several pixelated friends, a love of fishing, farming, mining, and a man named elliott.

friends, this game is utterly bewitching.

It's very well done and even after being out for quite some time, the dev is still very much involved.  Each time I come back after a longer break there seems to be more content.  Cute story, lots of interpersonal chat with NPCs, and a choice of type of farm so you can have different layouts / challenges / bonuses each time.
Can be a bit grindy before you start getting upgrades but that's true with most of this style game.
I personally find the fishing tough until I get upgraded but there is a training rod you can buy that is pretty forgiving, i only allows basic fish but good to get the skill up.  Mining does involve fighting, but I can manage it and I'm really bad at that sort of thing.
One pet peeve is that if you accidentally click on something in a store you can't reverse it.  
There are some pretty heavy story lines for the NPC's, just a heads up especially if you're thinking of this for young kids.  It's nice to have realism and not all rainbows and butterflies, and this is not a complaint at all, but it caught me a bit off guard.  Nicely handled though.

Planting and nourishing your crops, interracting with the NPC's and engaging in cute events all makes this game the world to me. So many days and nights were spent having an absolute blast, and I felt like this game really touched my heart. I felt genuinely excited when the NPC's liked the gifts I gave them for their birthday. I was intrigued mining further and further down the caves. I was scared when hearing noises in the night, and I felt genuine joy and togetherness during the seasonal events.
I don't think any other game has ever hit home for me in such a way, and I hope everyone at some point gets the pleasure of immersing themselves in this absolute gem of a game.

So man's been grinding in Stardew Valley, and imma be real - it's like running your own ends but with more cows and way less beef.
First, let's talk about the real OGs of Stardew Valley - them chickens. They're like your squad, always backing your beef and dropping those fresh eggs like it's nothing. Big up to the poultry pussios.
Stardew is like that lit rave you stumble upon in the middle of nowhere - unexpected, but bare vibes man, innit. And who knows, maybe one day I'll secure the sweetest ting in Stardew - you know what I mean?

It's a captivating blend of farming, life simulation, and adventure, set in a charming pixel-art world that's as inviting as it is vast.

One thing to note is that Stardew Valley does lean quite a bit on its wiki. But given the game's depth and complexity, this reliance is not just understandable but somewhat necessary. There's a richness in its mechanics, from farming and crafting to relationships and exploration, that makes consulting the wiki feel more like delving into a treasure map than a chore.

What truly makes Stardew Valley stand out is how it balances its various elements. Whether you're tending to your crops, fishing by the lakeside, exploring mysterious caves, or building relationships with the townsfolk, there's a sense of peace and accomplishment in every task. The game's ability to blend simplicity with depth is a rare find.

Overall, I'd give Stardew Valley a well-deserved 9/10. It's a game that offers a delightful escape into a world that feels both nostalgic and new, a world where every day brings a small, new adventure. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a casual player, Stardew Valley has something to offer everyone, making it a must-play title in any library.",1627050086,1707848513,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Quite a relaxing game, no need to rush with most quests and completing the community centre, just doing it at your own pace is fine. Caves can be quite difficult, but it's also something different from the rest of the game which I like.

One of the negatives is getting to other areas; especially in the beginning of the game it can be really frustrating having to walk everywhere. 

Still a 9/10 game I'd say

(Also has some impossible achievements like beating journey of the prairie king.... I'll edit this if I do it someday.)

Игра достаточно однообразная, но в самом однообразии я как-то и нашла свой шарм. Просто сидишь, садишь картошку, ловишь рыбу, и обязательно гладишь свою собаку, и опционально детей. Даже несмотря на повторение геймплея из раза в раз, игра все равно предоставляет разные цели, которые ты можешь поставить сам для себя (например поженится на всех партнерах возможных, накопить миллион или сделать идеальный дом). Я после первого года еще установила модификации на игру, в основном косметические, однако все равно они очень сильно обновили для меня всю игру в целом. Однако, если вы только планируете начать играть, не скачиваете модификации как Stardew Valley Expanded. В начале вам и так будет весьма сложно, так эта модификация добавляет еще очень много других вещей, за которыми надо следить.

The controls are awkward on a keyboard/mouse setup: depending on where you left click, your character will spin around and do actions in places you don't want, so you have to make sure to left click far away from your character to keep them doing actions in front of them (such as swinging a sword), otherwise, they'll swing randomly. No intuitive gameplay: you'll often look up the comprehensive Wiki, because things in the game don't make sense. Way too much grind.

I've come to this title expecting to play a casual farming game, that actually has a soul and a caring indie dev/devs behind it and, to my suprise, it outgrew my expectations exponentially.
Farming is just a small portion of what you can do in this game. There's also mining, foraging, combat and fishing, everything is simple but with at least some depth. We'll get to these later.

There are villagers to which you can talk to and some you can even get married with. They are written suprisingly well and while everything seems peaceful, calm and colorful in this game, there are also mature and not all too family-friendly topics brought up, [spoiler]Shane's alcoholism, Lewis' misuse of tax money or Kent's war PTSD[/spoiler] just to name a few. 

Farming - The main attraction of this game, is of course, the most developed mechanic. There's a lot of crops to choose from, some buyable, some obtainable by other methods. Each has its own purpose, more or less profitable for the player. They grow in different seasons with different speed, some can be harvested multiple times and some stay to the next season. It bugs me off that some crops don't have a good reason to be in the game, aside from [spoiler]dishes for 100% completion[/spoiler] but otherwise, I have nothing to complain about.

Foraging - It's functionality boils down to making farming more profitable via some unlocks that levelling up provides, as foraging itself isn't really profitable and doesn't feel as deep as Farming and Combat but it's there and it helps considerably despite not being that good on its own.

Combat - You wouldn't expect a farming game to have a fairly complex combat system, however Stardew's Combat has much depth to it. There are different types of weapons, armor, knockback, swing speed, buffs, rings and even [spoiler]enchants[/spoiler].

Mining - There are caves and minerals you can mine in them. Mining is a bit more complex than foraging as it allows you to mine in different ways and is necessary to upgrade your tools to progress and/or make some actions easier to do. Gems obtained from mining can also be used to help in farming, combat or mining itself to make insane profit.

Fishing - Isn't that profitable or complex but can aid the player in other activities by providing buffs from some food that needs fish and is just fun.

There are several things I'm not a big fan of but I think they come more from the general premise of the game, as a consequence of of some features generally regarded as good and me as a person. I found myself having SV's gamepedia open all the time while playing because the clock's always ticking and there are things to be done before the next season or some major milestones you want to achieve now because the premise of exploring a new zone or simply because they're really helpful. There's a lot of routine and very little time in the beginning, everything feels so slow and once you reach a certain point in the game with some powerful tools, you'll probably have a hard time coming back to the beginning and replaying the game, especially after [spoiler]reaching perfection and seeing the cutscene[/spoiler]. This game offers replayability but after 100%-ting my first save, it just gives me the vibes that it's time to move on.

So, why did I say Stardew Valley is so close to being the perfect game?
Because it gives you so much freedom in what and how you want to achieve it. It's by no means an ultimate sandbox game but offers many things to do nonetheless, you can even cheat your way to 100% and the game will reassure you that nothing bad happened and you should just have fun. There are monsters to fight, areas to explore, materials and crops to gather. And there's also an alive modding community (not on Steam Workshop) that continues to create content for the players to enjoy.

Thank you for making this game ConcernedApe. I hope for the best for you and for everything you have planned to be as great of a success as Stardew is.",1707607960,1707607960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I have mixed feelings about certain aspects : in multiplayer, the time in a day that continues even during dialogs is really frustrating, because the days are really short : you can spend 2h of an in game day watering crops or talking to a single NPC... Time is counted and you are punished by the game if you go to bed too late, it clashes a lot with the cosy aspect in my opinion, you can feel like you can't take your time
Moreover, the stamina bar is spent really fast especially at the beginning. There are days where you chop 2 trees and water some crops, and it's already 4pm, and you don't even have the stamina anymore to do other things...
Asides these frustrating aspects, the game is really nice and you have a good time, I just wish these things were more balanced for a better experience !",1707600227,1707600227,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game has it's challenges too. It's best to play with friends if you are having difficulties playing alone. That's how I got the hang of it is playing with friends then I branched out to my own farm and it was a lot better. Then it got more difficult as I approached year 3 and had my deluxe barn, coop, greenhouse etc...but now I am ready for that challenge. You can even court and marry one of the town's singles no matter the gender. Once you marry though and if you don't pay attention to your spouse they'll get angry at you. Tip: give your spouse kisses everyday and I would still give them two presents every week. I could go on with this game...but the only negative I could give on this game that's bad is that some ppl have an issue with multiplayer farms. The host is fine but sometimes your friends who are playing can get kicked randomly and then they lose all their progress on your farm. This isn't everyone though and this seems to only happen on PC. If you own this game on another platform and your friends are local with also the same platform...try to make a farm on that. This should not deter anyone from playing this game.

I loved the idea of this game when my sister started playing it on my Switch and i saw like all of the cool stuff she had in the game. So I started playing this and the further i got through the first season the more it made sense to me. The community center feels like a mini-collectathon, and all the rest of the activities like fighting,mining, fishing, foraging, farming & even interacting with the town is a good time. Paying attention to what gifts people like, so you can build stronger relationships and work towards making the town better overall. The progression feels good and the game is super immersive. 8/10 (Can't wait for ConcernedApe's Next Project)",1554434193,1707581247,True,0,0,0.486392557621002197,0,True,False,False

At first I got a little frustrated because I was playing on a Chromebook and using the mousepad for everything including fishing.  Then, once I played the game all the way through and met all the achievements and did all the activities, my husband upgraded my system to a Linux, and I was playing SDV on Steam.  Before I had to sell my gaming computer, I had learned about modding and was running 70 mods and playing co-op with hubby.  Fast forward to now, and we've hit hard times, so for the last 2 years I played on an old Chromebook with 38 mods.  I learned how to mod on my own in about 2 days.  The hardest part was sorting which mods were compatible with Android.  Now, I'm running just SDV on a Dell laptop running Windows 10 Pro, and I'm having to learn everything all over.  I just installed SDV 3 days ago, and I'm still learning Windows since I haven't used it since Windows 7.  It's been a very long time since I've dabbled in Microsoft.  LOL  I wanted to say all this to encourage new people to try this game no matter how much computer experience they have because if I can do it, more than likely they can do it too.  The ability to mod this game makes it insanely more interesting to me and the possibilities are endless, not to mention the fact that Concerned Ape is fantastic and adding buttloads of new content when he updates the original game.

This is what I feel sets Stardew Valley apart. This gesture makes every aspect of the game feel meaningful. 

Stardew Valley is a game that has profoundly impacted my gaming experience. It's a testament to the creativity and dedication of its developer and a shining example of what indie games can achieve. For those who have yet to experience its charm, I cannot recommend it enough. Stardew Valley is not just a game to play; it's a world to live in, a community to be a part of, and an adventure that continues to unfold.

pros.

this is a farm not a factory
3. a lot of content and things to do (even more up and coming content)

Bad:
-Too much community involvement. Sometimes I just want to farm and be left alone
-Either too little stamina or tasks take too much energy. Coupled with how long it takes to get food production online its more annoying than anything. Many days ended at like 2pm
-Items/upgrades insanely expensive in the early game, then way too cheap later on. Money ramp is weird.
-Takes forever to get to a place where you reasonably defend yourself against threats
-Can't move player homes
-Cant customize outside of house or choose design/location at start

Good:
-Farming/Resource gathering mechanics are fun and despite being repetitive don't get too boring
-Progression and sense of achievement when you get upgrades feels nice
-Fun with friends

Overall:
Its alright. Not really dark enough and without the ability to play hermit it doesn't really feel like its for me. Graveyard Keepers (Cemetery version of Stardew Valley) feels more up my alley.

Long version:

Stardew Valley is a great game. I was honestly a little unsure going on, and I waited a while to buy it. But I regret not buying it much sooner.

The game is easy to pick up and approachable, even if you're an expert or a novice with farming sims.
A single playthrough can last a long time, but it never feels dragged out. The game is always at your pace. And the progression in the game is fantastic. On your first in-game day your farm is completely overrun by weeds, rocks, and trees. And your farmhouse is all beat up and small. Day by day you keep working on it and suddenly without realizing you have a massive plot of land with crop fields and a huge house with a kitchen and master bedroom. The progression of the game is amazing. And you can choose how you spend your in-game day. There are lots of sub skills like fishing, mining, and foraging. All of which get easier as you level.

There are in game town events and life-sim aspects like marriage or cooking. All of which breathe life into the world. Most are optional to a degree. NPCs all have schedules, personality, and identities.

And of course, this game still receives free content updates. Some of which are expansion sized. Nowadays, most games will charge $30 or more a DLC for that. But the developer cares about this game and wants it to be it's best.

Stardew is really easy to just pick up and play, get lost in, before you realize you were playing this for hours and had a blast. And you keep playing because this game has such a great gameplay loop. It's also very replayable which makes it fantastic to come back to every couple months.

My main complaints with the game, and these are nitpicks not really ""cons"" are:
- The games leveling/xp system does not say how much xp you need/have which can make leveling a chore
- NPC socializing could be a bit expanded on. It's mostly just give the NPC the right gifts and say hi to them everyday. If you're good at that there isn't much else and you can get the NPC events pretty easy. There isn't any deep choices or decisions for the most part
and lastly
- The game almost requires a wiki. The game has some tools like an in-game calendar. But it's really advised to use a wiki. I wish there was more in-game tools for it rather than just Google-ing it.

Again those are just nitpicks that could be improved in an update or in the developer's next game: Haunted Chocolatier

I cannot recommend this game enough, even full price.",1680023142,1707088431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking",1707011196,1707011196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm currently playing my 8th Farm (5 on Steam, 3 on Switch), with an average of 150 hours each

This type of game is not everyone's cup of tea, I get it. But if you do like slower paced games (or games like Animal Crossing), this is an awesome game to play. 

There is so many ways to ""play"": completionist, min/maxers, focus on farming vs focus on mining, playing the vanilla game vs mods

This game has a great and active online community. Great mods are created for this - quality of life, aesthetic, cheats, expansions. 

You can truly make this game yours

Of note, despite having created this game YEARS ago, Concerned Ape is STILL producing new content - without putting it behind a pay wall.

Yet another ""farming simulator"" that forces you to grind for months if not years in real life on end just to get to a point where you can enjoy the ENTIRE ""intended"" point of the game itself: to relax and enjoy life on the farm. This is arguably amongst the most damning reasons why the average person (or even the average gamer, for that matter) chooses to stick with AAA games despite the apparent controversy and ""facts"" online; the fact that folks only play games like this not to enjoy them, but to ""achieve perfection"" and get to the very end.

Remember: it's not about the destination, it's about the journey as a whole. As always, there is no offense to Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) for his hard work on the game himself, particularly as an individual himself, but clearly, with him describing Stardew Valley as a ""relaxing farming life simulator,"" he doesn't even understand his own term for what the game is supposed to be at all. In fact, the recent updates (including and especially the upcoming 1.6 update) have only added on to the already-excruciating grind that had been present since the very beginning of the game itself, and an average new player in its then-1.6 state would be turned away from the game and refunded before two hours have even been put into this title.

Overall, I'd rather be playing Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life right now than this. Sure, it might not have all, if any, of the bells and whistles of Stardew Valley, with only a linear path to the top, but as I've said many times before: Simple ≠ Easy. Sure, setting up your farm in SV might be simple, but good luck getting it exactly the way you want. Meanwhilst, SoS:AWL may not be all that simple on the surface, but it's sure as sunshine easy for even newbies to figure out for themselves, and thus really get themselves into the game before long, as will later and even older titles in the franchise (and its tough-as-nails spin-off of the original's namesake, literally Harvest Moon) such as Rune Factory and the original Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. In fact, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is in fact a remake of the game I've just mentioned; I'd check it out myself if you have the time. For now, stay well clear of this game right'ere, and everything associated with it. Trust me, you'll be glad you didn't get yourself involved in all this ""farming"" like it's ""the last game you'll ever play"" like it's Dreamworld or somethin' like that. There's never a one-size-fits-all for gaming, and certainly not for this one.",1686043224,1706972093,False,2,0,0.388687551021575928,0,True,False,False

It's now 2am and for the past month I've been in one of my stardew hyperfixation cycles again, so now's a good time. 

And for the record, if the pixelated art style is off-putting to you, it was for me too in the beginning. You learn to love it, you just have to get used to it first :)

I was the biggest harvest moon fan growing up, and it still holds a disproportionately huge place in my heart, so I know I'm probably biased, and the target demographic, but even when i look at this game from an entirely critical perspective, it's still something to marvel at. ConcernedApe is a superhuman, a modern day Michelangelo. It's incredible the difference it makes when a game is designed by a person who understands what people want and listens to feedback. The modders for this game hold an equally special place in my heart. Unlike games like Sims 4, you actually don't need mods in order to play a fun, satisfying game, but the mods in themselves are absolute art and the ones who create them deserve more recognition.

Just everything about this game is just right. It's found an impeccable balance between having direction, and still giving you freedom and an open world to do whatever you want. It gives you things like quests and goals to strive to achieve, an implied direction for you to take your farm in, but there's never any pressure or real consequences if you want to take a little longer or do things differently. You have the freedom to be an absolute menace or just a regular lil farmer pal. I mean, who's to stop you from turning your farm into a coal production facility or something? Not Mayor Lewis, he can barely manage his own affairs...

I won't beat the dead horse of raving about the characters, the depth and the surprising rawness portrayed in this game, since several before me have already done that.

in all honestly I'm currently obsessed, it's been like 3-4 days and i already have 20 hours in game- It seems like there's a wide range of things you can do even if you get bored of one. 

back to that first line it only took like 2-3 in game days to figure out which character would become my fav and now every time i see the character (abigail) I go ""HEY BBG"" as a joke (help im so gay what)

also another fun part is making up nicknames for the characters to refer to them as whenever u see them ""Omg it's the emo boy""(sebastian) or ""Omg it's the actually emo boy""(i forgot the guy who works shane?)

Stardew Valley stands out as an absolute gem, a gaming experience that has captivated me across various consoles. This farming RPG is not just a mere favourite; it has evolved into a delightful distraction, providing countless hours of pure gaming bliss.

The visuals are charming and nostalgically crafted, reminiscent of the golden age of 16-bit graphics. The pixel art's meticulous attention to detail is truly breathtaking, and the vibrant colors breathe life into the Stardew Valley universe.

Now, let's delve into the gameplay – an enthralling journey where you inherit a dilapidated farm and embark on a quest to revive it from its dismal state. The ability to customize your farm, cultivate crops, care for animals, and forge intricate relationships with the townsfolk is incredibly satisfying.

What elevates Stardew Valley far above typical farming simulations is its profound depth and diverse range of activities. It serves as a virtual playground, offering a plethora of options, whether you're mining for valuable resources or peacefully casting a line into serene lakes. Every season introduces new challenges and opportunities, ensuring the gameplay remains a constant source of freshness.

And then there's the soundtrack – a symphony of perfection. The tranquil melodies seamlessly blend with the game's calming atmosphere, transforming routine tasks like tending to crops into euphoric experiences.

In essence, Stardew Valley transcends the typical farming RPG; it stands as a sensational masterpiece that has enchanted me across various gaming platforms. With its enchanting visuals, addictive gameplay, and a plethora of activities, it's a must-play for genre enthusiasts. Whether you're a seasoned farming veteran or a newcomer to the scene, this game promises an immersive and gratifying gameplay experience.",1706864304,1706864304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a wild amount you can do in this game whether it's combat, fishing mini games, romancing characters, or - like the label implies - farming. Every day is spent busy trying out new things and exploring all the fun events and quests.

I would say the romances aren't like super amazing or anything; all of the characters have simple personalities generally but I think it's easy to find favorites and want to shower them with gifts. It's easy to be like ""Ooo, it's X!""

I've played a lot solo and also with friends once multiplayer comes out. Solo is still great but if you can play with friends (and even worse, wrestle with each other over a shared wallet) I highly recommend this game! Being able to play on different kinds of farms, adding dumb ""I wanna woo Jodie"" and ""give everyone big tits!"" mods, divying up tasks to everyone and finding out everyone's wasted their time playing the one arcade machine is a really fun time.

Huge replayability, starting new save files is encouraged and has huge bonuses, a good game to play with the gang, good for wasting time and trying lots of new stuff solo",1706670193,1706670193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It scratches the itch of making beautiful places, ordering chaos, building awesome stuff, resource management, adversity on your own terms (i.e. you can go seek thrills and things that might kill you....or not, up to you!), achievements, and probably one of the best sound tracks in all of gaming, at least in the top 10. The love Concerned Ape put into this game is palpable in everything you touch. The modding community is brilliant.

You can do so much!
And if you want some extra fun, add mods and it's even better!
While there are a few issues here and there, they're so small and minor they're barely noticeable!
Tho I'd love some new places to explore and the ability to have more kids, multiple partners, in plain old vanilla.
Once you ""complete"" the game it kinda feels like there's nothing left? So it'd be nice to properly explore more, perhaps being able to explore some of the places the characters have mentioned, I think it'd add a lot more to the game and would be super fun!
But even without that, I love the game to bits and I'm so happy I've gotten to play and explore it!
And it's SO fun with other people! I love goofing around with my friends on it and breaking the game with mods lol.

I don't play it that often due to my busy schedule but when i have free time, it has me on chokehold that i play for HOURS. I like that you can do anything in this game and it is really up to the player on how they would run or explore it. Players can take their time on playing this game too. They will never run out of quests because the NPCs has so much demands (small quests) that you can accomplish that can earn friendship points. Love the multiplayer mode too so people can play it with their friends. Can i also just say that the four-corner farm layout is so underrated?? saves me more time on dividing my farm to parts tbh.

I remember begging my parents for the $10 or so that it was at the time because it looked that interesting to me. I know, 6 years later, own it on three different platforms (mobile, switch, pc), and do not regret a single purchase. This game is wonderful, and I recommend it to anyone interested in a very sweet game. While the combat system can be frustrating at times (even i'll admit that), everything else blows that out of the water. The farming is fun, the ranching is fun, getting to know each of the villagers is a journey that I enjoy taking. The only two systems in this game that I find flawed are fishing and combat, but with some time and practice, it becomes much easier. There is so much content in this game, and the creator is such a wonderful human being that I can't help but want to support. Even the community is great. If you're on the fence, I totally recommend this game. It has made me smile and feel joy so many times, and has truly made me loose track of time in real life from how engaged I can get in it.

Rating: 5/5

Stardew Valley, the beloved farming simulation game, is often praised for its charming pixel art, relaxing gameplay, and the promise of a peaceful escape from the daily grind. However, my experience with this seemingly innocent game took a dark turn, leaving me divorced and questioning the impact of my digital pursuits on my real-life relationships.

At first glance, Stardew Valley appears harmless, with its vibrant colors and simple farming mechanics. The initial allure of tending to crops, raising animals, and building relationships with virtual characters seemed like an ideal way to unwind. Little did I realize that my obsession with the game would slowly but surely erode the foundations of my marriage.

The game's addictive nature led me to spend countless hours in its virtual world, neglecting my responsibilities and, more importantly, the needs of my spouse. As my virtual farm flourished, my real-life relationship withered. Quality time together was replaced by solitary sessions on my computer, and conversations were drowned out by the soothing sounds of Stardew Valley's soundtrack.

The game's immersive social aspect, where players can form relationships with in-game characters, became a twisted parallel to reality. As my virtual connections deepened, my emotional investment in my marriage dwindled. Stardew Valley's charming townsfolk became more appealing than my own spouse, leading to a growing sense of detachment.

Ultimately, my addiction to Stardew Valley played a significant role in the breakdown of my marriage. The pixelated escape I sought turned into a heartbreaking reality check. The game's seemingly harmless façade hid the potential for real-life consequences, and I found myself divorced, grappling with the consequences of my misplaced priorities.

While Stardew Valley offers a delightful escape for many, my cautionary tale serves as a reminder that moderation is key. The digital realm should never take precedence over genuine human connections, and it's crucial to strike a balance between the virtual and the real. In my case, Stardew Valley became a cautionary tale of how a seemingly innocent game can have profound effects on one's life when taken to extremes.

Some of the interesting things I like about this game are,

First, the story and background of each npc. We are really brought into the story of this game and become one with the villagers. Each npc has a different character so it's very interesting to follow them :D.

Secondly, we are completely given the space to customize the farm the way we want and that's really a fun thing for me. Of course we are also given the freedom to have a family with whom and even have children! Absolutely adorable ><.

Thirdly, the challenges and mysteries of the game itself make me even more curious and I can't help but improve. Honestly, I don't really like mining in this game (because I'm weak in combat T_T), but the achievements and targets in this game make me have to do it. But often I find mining and combat quite exciting as I can find items that are useful for my farm.

There are actually many other things I like about this game that I can't mention one by one. The point is, it's one of the best games I've ever played and I'm really happy I picked it up!",1706054085,1706054085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's made with so much love, so much passion, and it was all done by one guy. It's an incredible accomplishment and clearly a huge success. It is a genre-changer. I have tried to play it on multiple platforms, with mods and without mods, but it all just falls flat. I drop it every single time I try to play it. I simply cannot play it nor can I enjoy it.

I love Harvest Moon, I love Rune Factory, so why don't I like this game? I feel like there's something wrong with me but I just can't stand it for reasons I can't describe. Is it the graphics? Is it the music? Is it the characters? Am I just so horribly jaded that my dopamine receptors aren't working anymore? I don't know...

The closest I can come to articulating it is that the farm progression and building feels like... Factorio? One of those base building simulators where the goal is to automate everything and perfect everything and organize everything just so? It just comes off as impersonal to me, I suppose, for reasons I can't quite explain.

There's no logical reason why I dislike this game. I just do. At this point, I'm sick of it being recommended me. It's a good game. It might even be a great game. I just can't look at it anymore and twist myself into knots trying to justify why I dislike it. I'd even go so far as to say that I hate it.

99% of people will probably like this game. I'm that weird 1%, we who lurk in the dark corners and lurk in desolate alleyways. Ours is a cursed life, a half-life.

word of advice, use the wiki for gifts and fish locations but be cautious of heart event/post game spoilers, that and a certain task is worth it in the end

K here is my actual review

Gameplay-
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Nothing special
☐ Okay
☐ Bad
-----------------------------------
Graphics-
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Will do
☐ Bad
☐ Awful
Pixelated, but very detailed.
----------------------------
Audio
☑ Amazing
☐ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
The music is fireeeeeeeeeeee
------------------------------------
Audience
☐ Kids
☐ Teens
☐ Adults
☑ Everyone
Depends on the age of kids, tho I would say 10-12 years old.
------------------------------------
Story-
☑ Should be an entire book /pos
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Not great
☐ None
honestly so much dialogue, but not too much dialogue options. 
---------------------------------
Difficult-
☐ Just press a bunch of buttons
☑ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Not so easy
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
The only hard part (imo) is the monsters in the cave.
--------------------------------
Grind-
☐ Nothing
☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks
☐  Isnt necessary to progress
☐ A bit grindy sometimes
☐ Average grind level
☑ Too much grind
☐ Insanity
Way to much grind (imo) just to get hearts from characters and such.
---------------------------
Game Time-
☐ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☐ Depends on you
☑ Endless
You can play forever... there is a way to beat it but you can still play after doing so.
--------------------------------
Price
☑ Just buy it
☐ Worth the price
☐ Wait for sale
☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
Price is totally worth it because of the story, audio, graphics and gameplay. The creators put much effort into this.
---------------------------
Summary of game:
4.9 out of 5 b/c of grind.

Chat?: yes

It was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos. So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but it was my first time playing a video game since the 2000s, so I was pretty lost. 

I asked my son for help and we spent a few hours playing together. I loved it, as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife died.

The story is so interesting and can be a challenging game depending on your objectives. It is a game that you get more out of the more you put in. It can be super casual or you can aim for the ending with lots of challenges a long the way.

The amount of secrets and fun ways to interact with items is brilliant. Wonderful replay value and sure it is a game I will come back to forever. I started after the 1.5 update so am unbelievably excited for the next one. Until then I will be making a far more casual farm and watching speed runners compete for how fast they can put a hat on a sea urchin among others things (shout out to SeanieDew).

Stardew Valley, the beloved farming simulation game available on Steam, is a delightful escape into a pixelated haven of rural tranquility and heartwarming simplicity. Developed by ConcernedApe, this indie gem has captured the hearts of players worldwide with its enchanting blend of farming, relationships, and exploration.

At its core, Stardew Valley invites players to step away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and embrace the slower, more fulfilling pace of country living. The game begins with inheriting a run-down farm in the quaint Pelican Town, and from there, players have the freedom to shape their destiny. The diverse activities available, from tending to crops and animals to mining, fishing, and building relationships, provide a sense of purpose and endless possibilities.

The charm of Stardew Valley lies not only in its engaging gameplay but also in its endearing characters and picturesque world. The pixel art style exudes nostalgia, and the changing seasons bring the farm and its surroundings to life with vibrant colors and subtle details. The townspeople each have their unique personalities, stories, and quirks, making them feel like genuine friends in your virtual community.

The game's emphasis on relationships adds an emotional depth that sets Stardew Valley apart. Building friendships and even romancing certain characters feels natural and rewarding, adding a layer of emotional investment to the daily routines of farm life. The events and festivals throughout the year also contribute to a sense of community, making Pelican Town a place players are eager to return to season after season.

Stardew Valley's soundtrack, composed by ConcernedApe himself, is a masterpiece that complements the game's relaxing atmosphere. Each track perfectly captures the mood of different seasons and activities, enhancing the overall immersion and providing a comforting backdrop to the player's virtual life.

One of the game's strengths is its accessibility. Stardew Valley caters to a wide audience, from hardcore farming enthusiasts to casual gamers looking for a tranquil escape. The straightforward controls, intuitive mechanics, and the absence of a strict time limit allow players to enjoy the game at their own pace.

In conclusion, Stardew Valley is a triumph in indie game development, offering a timeless and enchanting experience that transcends its pixelated aesthetic. It is a celebration of the joy found in the simple things, from planting seeds and raising animals to forming connections with the virtual community. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the world of simulation games, Stardew Valley is a heartwarming journey that will leave you with a sense of fulfillment and a genuine appreciation for the beauty of virtual farming life.",1705529789,1705529789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's so much to do in this game. I'm sure most people are aware of that, and although when you first play the game it might be confusing, it grows on you so much as you begin to explore the beautiful story and world this game has to offer.

i played enough of them in the 80/90/00/10 and am tired of them. however

this game is special... i started playing this on my galaxy tab and also bought it on steam and again on iPad years later.

its fun as hell and way more in depth that is immediately apparent

I found this game one summer when I only had my laptop to game on as I was away from my home PC. A lot younger, and bummed out that I cannot play my high res games, I can't even remember how I stumbled upon this game and decided to buy it. Especially since at this time I would be very stingy with online purchases as everything had to go through my parents bank card. Nevertheless, I stumbled upon an absolute gem of a game that will forever remain in my heart.

Whats good about this game you may ask? Everything. It has an amazing balance of grinding, decorating, story, exploring etc. It really just has it all for me. As a kid I was in love with Animal Crossings, and a little later became obsessed with Minecraft. I feel like this is a beautifully crafted mixture of these two games, put into a masterfully artistic 2D world.

I spent many hours on this game and enjoyed it to the point of full completion. I can't wait for any updates that await as these updates will keep bringing me back to a wonderful and new experience with the same feeling of when I first played this game. Everything just feels so authentic and genuine. I would highly recommend this game to absolutely anyone and will rave about how amazing it is.

I'd also like to add how much I specifically loved the Ginger Island update. I love when games continue to update with amazing content such as that and I cannot wait for this upcoming 1.6 update. I will be sinking many more hours into this game when that arrives.

I bought the game when it first came out. I can’t believe it’s been that long. I had a hard time getting into stardew in the very beginning but also I was a little bit younger than. 

I returned back to it in 2021 how much I actually really loved this game is unbelievable...If you were in the simple games or very cozy games this is a knock out!! it’s fun, challenging, chill, cozy story driven just an overall vibe. 
Gameplay is fun building up a farm so much customization so much detail. 
The characters are so unique so relatable. 
You feel like you can actually see yourself living in pelican town even if it’s not even a real place it start to change you and makes you less grumpy.   

It’s so much fun definitely takes you away even if you’re not wanting to give into it Has so much depth so much love went into this game You can really tell And Also did I forget it can be very addicting. 

I have not played stardew since last February It’s been quite some time, but I still think about all the fun memories. I do know when I do return back to Stardew it will be a blast and probably be addicted to that game once more !! 

I recommend giving it a try It is a very fun detailed game and has a special place in my heart that sounds sappy as heck, but I am being dead serious. 
I guess I’ll go. I really don’t know what else to say, but I could, but I won’t anyways.... awesome game.

Chill
Perfect on Steam Deck, holy shit is it good on the Steam Deck

For actual points:
The game is often updated, there will be so much more to experience every time you come back to it
Great with friends / an SO (even one who isn't necessarily a gamer)
There's a variety of things to do, which really suits it well for multiplayer so each person can have a specific hobby they particularly like or in single player it means there's always an option for a change of pace, whether you're doing daily chores on the farm or fishing in one of the 5(?) different biomes to see what you can catch, or exploring a forest to forage mushrooms and wild berries to eat/sell

You can also play like animal crossing, getting to know the villagers and decorating your farm with a wide range of different things as well

It starts out a bit slow and feels boring, but when you get past the begging days it gets more fun and there is more to do. Making money is hard but fun. I would Definitely recommend playing the game with friends but playing solo is also very good.  

While the pixelated art style may not be for everyone it captures the theme of the game really well. The gameplay is made really well and is unique. It is impressive how Unimpressed Ape was able to create this game all by himself.  

One of the things I don't like about this game is the lack of transport at the begging of the game, this issue is later resolved by numerous ways.

If you like the art style and you enjoy playing relaxing games, you will enjoy this game.

when you lose all of your health or energy in sv youll pass out, and youll wake up usually with money and/or items lost. in the mines theres an item recovery service for if that happens (im not sure if it works for outside the mines) and that is really useful. BUT you can only pick one item to get back from that day. (or at least im 95% sure😭)

and sometimes i lose like 10k or stupidly valuable items, and part of me wishes that the chances of losing the valuable items were a bit lower or smt? 

and in the game i married haley, before i did she used to go to the beach n hang out at the fountain, ect, im kinda sad she doesnt do all the activities she used to do sometimes. sometimes shell take her camera out or go see her sister but thats it rlly?

 i also got a kid in it, i was excited to maybe get dialogue with him when he got older and give him gifts, but when he got to the final stage i discovered you are not able to do either. you basically just get another thing that exists not doing anything like the cat or dog LMAO and they dont grow up or anything, they just stay a kid. they wont help out on the farm like your spouse will. 

one more thing, i wish i could play with the dog. like a ball, bone, or something. i think itd be cute, i really like dogs lol and for people who chose the cat maybe some toy mouse, yarn, bell? 

but otherwise i like everything about it!! i would recommend it. its a cute game. and linus is a pretty cool guy!! linus spoiler?> (i wish he could live on the farm with me, but i also like how he chooses his lifestyle:) )",1705217592,1705217592,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First of all, ""Farming RPG"", I sort of thought this game would be boring when I first heard about it because I was like ""Well, just farming? That doesn't really sound that fun."" But, it's nothing like that. Sure, farming is a part of the game but there's so much more to it. There's mining, relationship building, upgrading, customizing and there's so much more to it.

So, I'm originally an Xbox player (Probably like 300+ hours LOL) when it comes to Stardew, I've noticed that It's equally fun between Xbox and PC, at least I think so. When on Xbox, Fishing is a lot easier, I won't lie. But It's still fun regardless to try it on PC because I find that It's more challenging which makes it fun! 

The fact you can build relationships with the NPC's in this game is so cool, I love that you can make friends and relationships with the NPC's, you can marry them or date them, they can send you gifts and you can give them gifts and I think that's really cool. And not to mention, that you can emote and type in the chat when you're playing with your friends but you can also marry your friends that aren't NPC's, haha!

I also really love all of the customization with your character and other characters, I also love that this game is supportive of LGBTQ+ and you can marry/date people of the same gender, it's a really nice feature considering a lot of games aren't like that.

Overall, I would never hesitate to recommend Stardew Valley to anyone, it's seriously amazing.",1643833350,1705198481,True,1,1,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

I decided to buy the game after playing the game for free on the internet and with the updates to the game, the game has really become more beautiful.

1. Crops can only ripen in the current season and there are only 28 days in a season. If this season does not ripen, the crops will all wither in the next season.
2. For crops such as grapes and hops that grow on the shelf, there must be a gap between each row when planting, otherwise the middle will not be taken. The shelf of such plants can be understood to be like a wall.
3. The wooden box on the door is a transport box, not a storage box. If you put things in, they will automatically be sold when you go to bed at night, but you can take out the things you throw away on the same day.
4. Every season, you should buy all the seeds you can buy in the Peier store. You should keep at least one for each crop. It is best to keep 5 for each quality. Then the sacrifice needs to be used.
5. Crops should be watered every day, not when it rains. It is advisable to plant the crops next to the pond to make it more convenient to get water.
6. Only wild seeds can be sown in winter and no other crops can be sown. Beehives do not produce honey in winter.
7. Prioritise building greenhouses so that crops can be grown in greenhouses in winter
8. Do not take tools in your hands when growing and picking vegetables, it is easy to hoe vegetables.
9. You can pick raspberries in the wild in spring and blackberries in autumn. It is worthless, but it is the most cost-effective thing to regain physical strength and health.
10. It is best to take the path of sacrifice to have a sense of achievement. After the sacrifice is slaughtered, everyone will come to celebrate. Joja supermarket will close. After completing a small sacrifice, there will be a movie theatre (but for full success, you need to go the joja supermarket membership route, but you will often complain that the work is not good, and the community centre will become a movie theatre)

Animals：
1. There is a small door between the chicken coop and the barn, and small animals cannot enter or exit when the door is closed.
2. Touching small animals can often increase friendship, so that the quality of the product is improved.
3. Build a chicken coop near the pond, and the ducks will come down to swim
4. Finish cutting the weeds. When the animals are raised, build another barn, and then the weeding will become hay that small animals can eat.
5. The biggest barn can be used to make wine, and the space is very large.
6. When you first discover dinosaur eggs, don't donate them to the museum. Put them in the chicken coop for hatching so you can hatch the little dinosaurs.
7. After going to the joja route, you can buy an automatic stroking machine from the joja supermarket. Only when you get the victim can you go down to the mine to open the treasure chest. There is a possibility that an automatic stroking machine will open. With this you can free your hands and no longer have to touch the small animals by hand.
8. Plant the grass under the fence, the small animals will not be able to finish eating and the grass will continue to grow.
9. Truffles are obtained from pigs. Truffle oil can be produced in an oil-producing machine. Truffle oil is very valuable.

Keeping fish：
1. Water fishing can be done in most places. To be precise, it should be possible to cast a rod.
2. Go to the beach to buy more shells. It is good to make money by selling shells at an early stage. After the bridge on the beach is repaired, corals and sea urchins will often be produced on the other side.
3. Fishing itself is not difficult. There are fish kings in every season. The most difficult is the fish king in spring.
4. Don't lose the joja cocaine you caught, you can give it to Sam.
5. Where Willie often fishes is a good fishing spot. I don't know if there's any basis for it, but it's right to fish with the old fisherman.
6. The crab cage needs to put bait (at first I put the crab cage without bait, but after a long time I found nothing abnormal...)

Mining：
1. First craft a marvellous ring that will emit light and can be used as a small flashlight.
2. Kill enough 1000 slime to unlock the slime ring and when you wear it you will no longer be attacked by slime.
3. The slime can be raised in the square and they will say hello
4. It is advisable to reopen the mine immediately after fainting, or you can find someone to retrieve the dropped items.
5. Usually don't throw away the stones you collect. You can use them as stairs. It will be very useful to go down to the 100th floor of the desert mine at that time.
6. Don't stupidly shoot the stones one by one. Using bombs can save time, but remember to stay away from them.
7. Dwarf scrolls have a fixed number of regeneration layers
8. Do not lose insect meat. You can make bait, but you can also make bait boxes.


NPC Article：
1. Do not go through the rubbish bin in front of the NPC, it will lose its favourability.
2. Each NPC can give gifts only twice a week. On the NPC's birthday the favourability of the gift will greatly increase (you can search Wikipedia to understand everyone's preferences and sending things you don't like will lose favourability)
3. The default CP is Haley + Alex, Abigail + Sebastian, Leah + Elliot, Penny + Sam, Maru + Harvey. Shane and Emily have no CP but Clint the blacksmith has a crush on Emily.
4. At least one NPC will be chosen first. Only NPCs with more than three stars will accept your invitation during the dance, otherwise they can only watch other people dance next to them.
5. If the NPC reaches eight stars, it will no longer rise. For the object with eight stars you need to buy flowers from Piel and ask ta to be your boyfriend/girlfriend.
6. Both male and female npc's can be raiders. This game accepts txl. The opposite sex is to give birth to a child and the same sex is to adopt a child.
7. Each npc has its own story. Although it is very interesting, it is recommended that everyone get 10 stars. They are all very kind.
8. Sewer Xiaohei can also get married and go home, you need to go to the desert to get an empty necklace
9. When entering the mine, there is a large stone on the right that can be smashed with a bomb or pickaxe (if it cannot be smashed, the quality of the pickaxe is not good enough). Dwarf NPCs live in it.
10. If the favourability with each male/female NPC reaches full level, the male shura field (large-scale jealousy scene) will be triggered when entering the tavern and the female shura field will be triggered when going to Haley's house. It can be avoided by bringing a rabbit's feet, so that everyone is in harmony.

other：
1. The three curved points in the ground are worms. You can dig them out with a hoe. Many cultural relics in the museum come from here.
2. Develop a good habit of watching TV every day. Most recipes come from watching cooking programmes.
3. Press shift to buy items 5 times
4. Dressing table can hold clothes
5. In spring, green onions will grow in the open field under Mani's house, where there are bridges and rivers (I only learnt this after playing for a few years...)
6. After a certain earthquake, a hot spring swimming pool will appear above Robin's house. Taking a bath can restore your strength.
7. You can go home at two o'clock, no need to lie in bed.
8. There are two game consoles in the tavern. After clearing two mini-games you can take the game console. You will also get a coke machine when you go to the Joja route.
9. After collecting all kinds of scarecrows you will get a super scarecrow from the Scarecrow Association, which has a wider coverage.

In addition it has more plot and updates on the Steam games PC version.
