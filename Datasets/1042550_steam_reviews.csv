Unfortunately the story is lame, like, really lame, which is disappointing because it has moments of brilliance, but they never shine through for long - and the moments that do shine through are typically the moments that shine through with every iteration of this franchise, meaning you can get those same intriguing story moments from other games or films in the series. Ultimately you're probably not playing this unless you're a fan of Digimon already, in which case, I would assume you're here for the Digimon themselves and not whatever the humans have going on. Despite that however, the battle system is REALLY strong, and there are special animations for every single Digimon, which is amazing because there's over 300 of them. Extremely engaging combat especially for a turn based system. 

FFO: SMT / Persona / Magic Pengel

This game is quite easy. I can recommend this to JRPG fans because it has a lot of strategies that make grinding easy. They thought out an answer for nearly every conceivable form of grinding (money, exp, item farming) and baked an easy way to circumvent this directly into the game mechanics. (Having RNG based collectibles is f******g diabolical though. ) Though, even without grinding, I found it easy. I honestly found this game relaxing.

I've been playing Digimon games my entire life. I've played the original Digimon World on PSX, DW2, DW3, DW DS, Dawn and Dusk, RE:Digitize and Next Order- I even played the fighting games. So when I say this is the worst Digimon game I mean it. I've played it for about 5 hours now, and I honestly don't want to play anymore. That's a very big problem considering most Digimon games take hours upon hours to play properly, and I've always been more than willing to dump countless hours of my time into them in the past.

For starters, the writing is contrived and boring- and that's coming from an anime fan- I can put up with a lot of crappy writing but this is just ridiculous. Even the characters themselves say things like : ""That sure is some luck you have, always being in the right place at the right time and getting all those abilities and being so unique and special all the time!"" It's not luck, it's bad writing. You could make a case that the writing doesn't matter as much because it's a game for young people, but that didn't stop the previous games from having smarter, more reasonable stories to tell. And besides, there are at least two women in the first few hours of the game with their boobs hanging out all over the place. I'm supposed to believe this lady is a detective? She can't even dress herself. That's besides the fact that the Digimon in the game so far have been nothing but tools to further the plot, whereas in the past they were characters in their own right. The writing in the series has moved away from Digimon being partners and friends and into what Digimon can do for you to further your own agenda, which just so happens to be the agenda of everyone you cross paths with because the story happens TO the protagonist, not BECAUSE of the protagonist.

The sentiment of Digimon as lifeless monsters and tools bleeds into the gameplay as well.
Digimon games have always been about training your own personal Digimon to be the strongest and using that Digimon you invested so much time and effort into to fight for your goals. When you lost, or it died, it was a big important moment because you developed some kind of relationship with it. Now? You hit the training button. ""Okay guys, I'll be back in an hour!""  What difference does it make what stat needs to be high enough to digivolve when all their stats will by high enough anyway by the time they reach their level cap? And I'm supposed to believe that the main character is this super virtuous guy that loves Digimon when you can straight-up feed your unwanted Digimon to the others for XP? The whole first part of the game I was converting data of the baby Digimon they make you fight (because you can't go anywhere they don't want you to go) and feeding them to my Kuwagamon for extra XP. I started to wonder if there was a hidden meter somewhere judging my actions against innocent Digimon converted just for personal power. It's even worse when in the past the power was earned by hitting a bag or pushing a boulder or just- you know- fighting.
That's not even getting into the massive amount of hand-holding this game does. Want to spend time in the digital world fighting Digimon and training and unlocking stuff and getting things done? Too bad! Go introduce yourself to everybody in the building, when you're done with that go get me some coffee beans.
There's a line between playing a game and being a high enough level to continue being told a story, and the dev team really dropped the ball because the story isn't even compelling.

The worst part, the absolute worst part of this entire game, the part that could've saved it despite everything else being wrong, is the fact that for the entire 5 hours I played this game the digital world is just a countless amount of blue hallways. What happened to the trees? The lakes? The volcanoes? Where's the WORLD? Is this a joke? You expect me to believe a Digital World, an EDEN, not even a place exclusively for the Digimon (which is it's own massive issue I'm not getting into), but a place created by humans for humans in a completely digital space where you can make anything doesn't have a single forest or park or even an ubran area or anything beautiful to protect or explore with your Digimon? It's all black networks and blue hallways with loitering ""hackers"" that do nothing but wait for you to talk to them? How freaking boring! I'm not even willing to keep playing to see if it gets better because the characters suck, the mechanics suck, the areas suck, and the story sucks.

Also, I should add that this game has a lot of talking, like an annoyingly amount of talking. If that is something you don't like, then do not play this game; even skipping the text doesn't help, as eventually, after you skipped all the dialogue options, you have to go find a specific thing that this person (that you just completely blasted through all the dialogue options) just told you, and now you have no idea what to do. And only after 10–30 minutes of walking around and trying to find what you're looking for, it's just more talking, but instead of a human, it's a Digimon.

When comparing the two, I’ll be abbreviating it to DW3 for simplicity’s sake, even though I’m referring to the EU/AUS version. I will be using (-) for negatives, and (+) for positives. Keep in mind, though, that the games are 15 years apart, but I’ve nonetheless played DW3 to death both on PS and emulator.

Quality of life
+ The Digibank:
You can convert any Digimon you meet enough times - this means there's a pretty huge variety of digimon you can actually use - every single one you meet afaik (I’m currently on chapter 5) - to accomodate this, you have a lot of space to store them
+ You can convert Digimon you don't use to XP for the ones you do
+ Objectives take less time than in DW3 - you easily find out which character you have to talk to, and don't have to travel through an entire open world to stumble upon the right NPC
- In DW3, the Digivolution Chart made it easy to get an overview of the vast of evolution trees in a single branching tree. The equivalent here is the Field Guide, where you manually have to click evolve and digivolve to go through them. Worse solution and takes more work.
- Loading moves from different digivolutions isn’t as much work
- You can't buy revives until chapter 8? Why?
+ You don’t have to go to a gym and manually train your 
- You fucking LOSE progress on a digivolution when you de-digivolve. So you can’t just level the different digivolutions on your Digimon’s tree separately and jump back and forth with high flexibility like in DW3. In return, you obviously get more Digimon to switch between, and a larger party to carry with you, but I really don’t see why you can’t have both. Probably the worst change, especially if you change your mind and have to start from scratch with a different Digimon or sacrifice your current one to give someone else its XP. 
- Boss fights often have a dialogue leading up to them that you can’t skip, so you have to save prior, and then go through the dialogue again then into the battle.

Story (English text w/ Japanese voicing)
- It consistently just feels like you’re playing a visual novel most of the time, with characters doing their speak animations as you’re getting text boxes to click through. 
- The voice acting (in Japanese) is great on some characters and okay on others, but is only there for like 50% of scenes. Apart from that, you’re mostly just reading text boxes with the occasional talking animation.
- The dialogue options you’re given are almost all the same and consequently don’t seem to have much impact on the reactions. 
- The story is very linear, which isn’t a change from DW3, but not really any better either
- No awesome card game as a side thing 
+ For what it’s worth, the story feels very in line with Digimon themes. 
- The world just feels less rich. Idk how to explain it, but NPCs were up to a variety of things in the world of DW3, and had more interesting lines to talk about. In this one, most NPC lines are slice of life in a sort of dull way. 

Battles
- The difference between boss battles and regular battles is too big. You'll be OP against regular enemies then get roflstomped by a boss doing 3x more dmg and having 20x the hp.
-  Bosses feel way too tanky and not engaging from a strategic POV. You're basically just spamming whatever your most powerful move is and throwing heals on your Digimon until the boss finally falls flat. 
+ Your Digimon come with cool passives that affect the whole party 
- The type system is changed to 4 things: Light and Dark are weak to each other, fire>plant>water follow one triangle and air>earth>electricity follow another. A third one is an additional virus>data>vaccine. It’s simpler, but I prefer the old system.
- Fewer equipment options: in this game you have two equipment slots equivalent to the ""accessories"" in DW3. You don't get armors and weapons with cool effects that you swap between, but rather accessories that boost numbers on base stats, resistances or damage.

Environments
It’s a very urban and cyber-focused game, which isn’t in any way out of place for Digimon. 
- One negative consequence is that the environments you’re in as well as battle backgrounds are very samey. 
- Most of the game you will be spending in cyber grids, which gets old quickly.
- Obviously graphics have changed with the years, even if DW3 looked great for its time. I can't say there's anything stunning about Cybersleuth graphics. They are about what you'd expect, with nothing positive to stand out. 

Summary
DW3 was amazing for its time. Visually, it looked comparatively stunning, allowing you to live out your Digimon fantasy by seeing huge, detailed Digimon fighting for you against other enemies in different backgrounds. NPCs seemed equally hyped as you to be there and had all kinds of plans, anything from mischief, to just enjoying themselves. You had powerful and cool-looking cute digimon to start with, including cross-digivolutions and equipment you could buy for them to give them different effects. You had a card-game as a side-thing and the world just felt packed with stuff. With Cyber Sleuth, I expected the game design to have progressed a lot more in 15 years, but find that it’s mostly just quality of life changes. I’ve come to expect more from story, visuals, combat and voicing over the years after seeing what’s possible in other games. I feel there’s a lot more Cyber Sleuth could have done in all of those areas. It almost feels unfinished. If it weren’t for the fact that it’s Digimon, I’d probably disrecommend the franchise itself and not finish the game. As it is, I'll probably slog my way through for a bit longer just because I want to see my Digimon at their strongest.",1703788670,1703797505,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,2,True,False,False

If you feel like reading a little:

Overview: with this purchase, you get two games: Cyber Sleuth (CS) and Hacker's Memory (HM). Both happen in the same timeline in the same universe but have different scopes and characters. HM is younger of the two and has a few additional combat mechanics.

Story: CS is the more classic Digimon tale of a group of kids being bound by fate to make digimon friends and save the digital world from a cosmic threat. HM happens in the shadow of that story and is more focused on your character's friends. Both games are a bit special by mostly taking place in the real world and EDEN (imagine a metaverse actually happened and had Digimon in it). The digital world is mostly alluded to. If you're going to play both games, I recommend playing CS first and HM second. In my opinion at least, HM is better written and it leans on major plot points happening in CS, so you might be confused by some dialogue in HM without context.

Gameplay: both games are classic 3-character party fighting RPGs. You'll take side quests from a job board and do main story quests once you finish the more important errands. Combat happens via tamer fights and random encounters, which will give you enough xp to get through both game with minimal grinding. If you're a completionist, you'll want to look into XP gain boosting mechanics because there are a lot of digimon to collect and they all drop to lvl 1 after each digivolution and dedigivolution. Luckily, you can access a skill to force encounters, so you will never have to run around like a maniac, waiting for a fight to trigger.

There are some things that are just tedious and boring, some things that are engaging and interesting. Kyoko seems to interrupt you too much to act as a plot advancement when it'd be more interesting if they let the MC figure it out instead.

Another complaint I have is some obvious laziness. They don't differentiate between male or female NPCs in some quest areas and I've seen many dialogues where my female character is referred to as a he instead of a she. Not like it's a super big deal but my OCD is annoyed at the obvious laziness.

Finally the combat is way too easy. I'm just button mashing with no real strategy and I'm on chapter 9 right now. If you put it on hard mode you go from too easy to omfgwtf difficulty instead. For me, personally, this is the biggest negative as I really would have liked a challenge of some sort that felt like all my training of my digimon actually matters. All the effort to make them powerful and all you do is steamroll something faster than you would have without the extra effort lol.

But I would certainly say that the ups outweigh the downs and there's more fun to be had in this game than not.

The cast in Cyber Sleuth was memorable and lovable, the gameplay loop kept me on the grind (annoying as it was for some of the Digivolutions, it was still fun and worth it in the end to complete the Field Guide), and on top of it all; while the story wasn't perfect, it had more than enough to keep me hooked. Hacker's Memory however left... a lot to be desired. The side story was tougher than the base game and not in a good way. It all felt like artificial difficulty with how a lot of the Digimon you could potentially use were restricted by how stingy Hacker's Memory was with the Party Memory upgrades and DigiBank upgrades; a large chunk of them you'll only really find roughly 2/3's into the game.

I can't recommend this game enough though, but if you're going to play Hacker's Memory; my advice is to just play through the game to unlock the Hacker's Memory exclusive Digimon and transport them to Cyber Sleuth when you can.

My introduction to the Digimon games was Digimon World 2, after which I played World 3 and Rumble Arena. I always loved the 3-member party system in DW2 and never liked how limited you were with your party and playable Digimon selection for DW3, but I still liked that one regardless. This game managed to do everything right. From the 3-member party to the vast branching paths you can take for the Digivolution trees, and the skill system that lets you accumulate 20 skills to mess around with for your party, and having 8 party reserve slots that all receive the EXP that the main 3-member party gets, and even having online (or offline) tournaments to try out, AND DEAR MERCIFUL HEAVENS DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE OST, it's all just fantastic.

Running around the Tokyo districts and going through missions throughout the chapters in a Persona-like feel also checks a positive mark for me. The story is also much more serious and somewhat darker than the Digimon we're normally exposed to, but it always was a series that pushed beyond the childish, cheerful, ditzy, bubbly, rainbows-and-sunshine feel that something like...I dunno, Pokemon did. Digimon has always done something different for everything in its series, from the games to the show as well, and this game did too and amazingly at that. I don't care how close to Persona it actually is, I'd consider it a very good thing. I don't think I can praise and recommend it more than I already am. I just feel kinda bad that I got it at an extremely low price while on sale and feel like I ripped the devs off. They absolutely deserve my money.

If you're like me and are unsure if you wanna gamble on whether or not this game will be worth it for you, and you like digimon or wanna get more into the franchise, BUY. THIS. GAME. 

Immediately right off the gate, I've played 3 hours of the game and im ALREADY 100x more invested than i was in WNO. And here's the thing, I really like the game, but it plays like it's old as dirt and feels like its at least 4 generations behind the rest of the world. Which...i mean it is but that's besides the point. 

This game dramatically streamlines the whole raising process and removes the most asinine qualities of world (Which, I would absolutely want to remain in a world title) and instead gives you more control over your digivolution routes than probably ever before.

It plays similarly to a world game in that you have a playable character you traverse linear areas with. Im only 3hrs in so that could easily change. It's story is immediately more interesting, engaging and deeper than digimon world: NO is. NO is the most barebones possible when it comes to story. The fact that it charges premium top dollar of a zero effort vita to pc/switch port is honestly a crime when you consider that NORMALLY Cybersleuth is literally half the price world: NO is. It plays better, feels better, looks better and has 10x the plot NO does and it came out a year before it. Talk about embarrassing. But hey, a win is a win right? This game is roughly 10 bucks on special right now. Trust me, You literally cannot go wrong with this game. It even has a new game plus and an entire expansion DLC that lets you have a wholeass other story. World has effectively nothing in terms of post game. Its literally just the same shit you've been doing since the moment you started this game till the moment you end. 

For the price point, You WANT and NEED this to be the first game you play. It's dirt cheap and infinitely more bang for your buck. Will revise once i've gotten more time in I just wanted to say at it's current discounted price, 10000% worth it.

So now that im about 50hrs in and having spoken to a few friends, we all agree the game kinda falls off at about this point. It might be how repetitive everything is, music, combat back tracking, or maybe it's the late game grinding cause...damn does it get bad and even with the numemon trick. But uh.

The Digifarm which could train my digimon were good but it needed a method of training from Digimon World DS from Nintendo DS (You know what I mean).

Keep in mind that there's two stories in this game. The game is relatively long, i'd say about 40 hours PER STORY, but that's on the lower side for JRPGs I'd say. 
Cyber Sleuth story is more a light hearted story about friendship, on the contrary Hacker's Memory has more mature theming to it, and quite a lot darker as well but has some ""anime"" moments to not push the game past its intended rating.
I don't have much to say about the visuals, it is a rerelease of a PSVITA game, to be honest considering the time it was released back in the day, I'd say it makes it a little charming that everything kinda looks like toys.
I'd say the only flaw stands from some boss battles having some annoying skills or status, or having to farm XP quite heavily when you decide to change team members (which will most likely happen because you can devolve and evolve Digimon).

I hope we get news about Cyber Sleuth 2, or just another entry for the Digimon Story entries. I'm glad Bandai Namco has been giving the franchise more care.",1700860474,1700860474,True,19,0,0.722485780715942383,0,True,False,False

This game is essentially what happens if you create SMT games with Digimon instead of demons. The quality of the Digimon is surprisingly excellent. The Digimon roster they included is quite impressive, with not too many recolored Digimon, and around 400 Digimon with 1–2 unique signature skill animations. Just from that alone, the game already has a higher quality than the newest Pokémon games (which is the highest-grossing media franchisees in the world, by the way).

Unfortunately, the dungeon design is terrible and super monotonous, there's too much grinding (even with the extra EXP Digimon), some of the cutscenes are too long, and I feel like the story pacing is not that great. There is very little to no plot progression before the last five chapters of the game. I truly hope they fix this in the sequel.

Also the game does NOT have a wide variety of digievolutions (it roughly has around 400 digis, missing most non-popular Armors, the Holy Beasts, MaloMyotismon, Omegamon Zwart D and a lot more) it's still decent for the duration of the story.

Its worth to mention that a big thumbs up from this ""Complete Edition"" is that you get both games, the Cyber Sleuth (20 chapters) and the Hacker's Memory (18 chapters).

- Story: Totally dull and worse than your generic anime plot, only in the last 2 chapters the story seems to be somewhat decent but thats only because they need to wrap things up so a lot of stuff starts to happens really fast. Worth mentioning theres only 1 side-quest that actually has a decent story in which the plot circles around a digimon named Pete, thats all i gonna say about it.

- Translation: .....holy jesus, i cannot belive this is an actual game from a AAA company like Bandai Namco. Saying that the translation feels like it was translated by Google Translator from 2005 its being generous. Not only the names of most digimons and their signature attacks are wrong... which i can understand if the people behind the translation are not savvy on Digimon lore, but there are WHOLE paragraphs that make no sense at all, making a dull story even more dull!

Also most of the times when you need to choose an answer from 2 or 3 options in different rows the text do not ""respect"" the rows, but instead its a big wall of text taking the space of 3 rows, making any choice you take completely random because you cannot know which row is which answer.

On top of that, some translations CHANGE the dialogue in ways that actually changes the meaning of the story for moments, here are 2 examples i found very disrupting: Yggdrasil, the source/god of all digimons its refered as ""King Drasil"", the second one is the japanese word Bakemono, which means Monster. Said word its translated instead as BAKEMON, the phantom digimon. So in some scenes when characters are interacting with digimons and say stuff like ""Its a monster! get away"" they translated as ""It's Bakemon, get away!"".... both of these happens tru ALL the game, not just a few lines.

This is why you should not hire a random translator but a proper LOCALIZATION team for your games.

On the pros:
- I guess the game runs fine, pretty much no loading screens. it's something.
- The gameplay loop, meaning the battles and how the maps play out its nice too. Tho do not expect anything deep, but more of a fighting/leveling/evolution system that tries to be grindy on the first chapters but rapidly becomes fast and non-deep at all. By chapter 17-18 you can already have digimons with 200 ABI and Level 99 but you won't even need em outside of a few side-content designed specifically for hard grind because you never, ever will get stuck on a fight be it on the main story or on the side quests. Said side-content that can be hard its the last cup of the colosseum and the chapter 19 DLC of the Seven Deadly Digimon, which is the usual ""enemies now have x5 HP and hit twice as hard"".


So, to TL:DR this review: Sadly we dont have many RPG and battle-oriented digimon games out there, so wait for this one to be at discount and grab it to get 2 Digimon games that you can play super-casually to kill some time and fill that need for some digimon action.

It's not the best digimon game out there, but if you can ignore the awful translation and play it as a casual gamer, it's also not the worst one and can be enjoyed.",1700636346,1700636488,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

(Q)does it have fun turn based jrpg gameplay? 
(A) for sure.

(Q) does it have a good story?
(A) yep but there are minor localization errors like typos but nothing too big.

(Q) does it have tons of cool monsters? 
(A) it wouldnt be digimon if it didnt.

(Q) is there character customization?
(A) theres some. you can buy clothes and customize your drip but dont expect a character creation screen besides choosing between premade male and female versions of the protagonist.

(Q) silent protagonist?
(A) yes

(Q) dialogue choices in cutscenes?
(A) yes but very limited. Usually either a serious response or jokey ditzy response.Doesnt effect anything besides the next few lines of banter reacting to what you chose.

(Q) does it have deep evolution mechanics that allow for a ton of varaition and customization to your digimon?
(A) yes yes and yes and its honestly one of my favorite parts of this game. If do the grinding for it then youll be greatly rewarded too.

(Q) do angewomon and ladydevimon dna digivolve by making out?
(A) hell yeah they do.

(Q) Is it better than anything pokemon company has pooped out since the 3ds was new?
(A) you bet your ass it is.

(Q) are you a bad person for buying the newest pokemon but not this? 
(A) maybe.

(Q) will playing this give you your own living breathing irl digimon to go on fun digital world adventures with? 
(A) i wish.

(Q) will it get you laid? 
(A) depends. are you an attractive woman interested in a dashing gamer who likes jrpgs, smells like cheeto dust and shame, leaves steam reviews on digimon games and has more rolls and cake than a bakery? if not then no.

(Q) can you eat it? 
(A) idk. i havent tried but if you get the nintendo switch version the cartidge shouldnt be too hard to swallow so probably.


>>>Final Verdict<<<

>Should you buy this? If you like digimon, cutscene heavy turn based jrpgs and dont mind japanese dubs with subtitles then yes. The game is probably the most polished, fun and easy to get into digimon game yet. If raising customizable teams of fighting monsters, doing detective themed sidequests and saving the world with a fun cast of characters alongside you in a character driven, linear plot, story focused visual novel-esque jrpg adventure sounds good then you'll love this. It also has a surprisingly big modding scene too. Theres lots of custom digimon, changes, reskins, new clothing options and more. Heck you can even have pokemon in it so if you got this as a pokemon alternative youre in luck since you can have pikachu, mewtwo, rayquaza and more help your digimon save the world if you like. youll want to check  gamebanana for mods though since most are there rather than on nexus.

  I'm approaching this from the perspective of someone who wanted to play Pokemon but didn't want to buy a Nintendo.

  If you're actually a Digimon fan already you may have a different perspective.

  The story.  The ..... Story.  The story is completely bat crazy.  Don't expect any degree of  logical coherence - just accept that the story is bat crazy and go with it.  The story (minor spoilers from here on in) suddenly raises the threat level from serious to apocalyptic about half way through.  This is never a good move and the game does a screeching side swerve as you go from facing a world threatening event to helping a Digimon find its lost friend.

  Characterisation ?  Well three of the female characters are explicitly sexual on dress or manner which none of the male characters are.  I didn't form any emotional attachment but they didn't severely irritate me either.

  The plot is reasonably well structured with one of your two main mission givers able to direct you back on the right path if you get lost.  The maps are weird - Ace Phoenix is my only comparator - and sometimes you need to scour them carefully to find what you are seeking - particularly in the optional missions to find lost items for Digimon - virtually like looking for needles in haystacks most of the time.  At twenty chapters the game doesn't over stay its welcome but there are several weaknesses in the plotting.  The game at one point completely stalls unless you look at a pile of boxes in the office - a demand made completely out of the blue with no indicators that's what you have to do..  The penultimate chapter features a couple of mazes around multiple levels in a tower block that are difficult if you don't concentrate.

  The game takes a bit longer to get into its stride than Pokemon Red or Blue.

  So to the Digimon.   There are clear differences with Pokemon.  Firstly there's no equivalent of Pokeballs and no capturing Digimon.  Instead each won battle gives you intel on the Digimon.  Once you are at 100% you can hatch that Digimon at level 1 from an egg but you're better waiting until they reach 200% for a better quality monster.  Once you hatch you go back down to 0% and have to do fight your way back upm again to regain a new Digimon.  This is where the key differences come in.  Digimon evolve upwards into about six different forms and downwards into three or four forms.  If you reach maximum level and can't digivolve upwards you HAVE to digivolve downwards and start over.  There are places with auto training in the game, although the farms are awkward in display and function, and you can take your Digimon out of storage for experience runs.  You can keep your three toughest fighting Digimon and then use the other eight spaces to boost other Digimon.

   There are two key issues.  Firstly your older Digimon never get completely outclassed by newer Digimon because all Digimon start at level 1.  Secondly if you're evolving and devolving you can find your roster ever changing as you swap level 1 Digimon out of your roster and replace them with more powerful Digimon.  Please note you'll need to have more powerful Digimon in your party to unlock the higher level walls.  You have a party size - 11 - and then an increasing maximum total levels.  This does keep the game fresh as you learn each Digimon's new skills.  Always have your front line contain three different types of Digimon so you always have one Digimon to whom your enemies are vulnerable.

  It took me a long way through the game before I learnt how to properly read the stats of Digimon at the farm and how to equip skills and weapons on the Digimon profiles accessible from the menu.

  So lousy plotting,  not the best characterisation.  Odd maps.  But the Digimon are fun even if I'm reserving their SP using attacks for boss battles.  I'd had a bad run with getting persistently beat by one level in a Transformers game, not making progress in Warhammer Total War 2, Fallout 4 was making me do something I didn't want to do to progress, Talisman was being ... Talisman.  It was good to play a game where you could grind out a win.

  I'm off to play the second game included in the package and there's also a new game plus option.

 One tip.  Keep your medicine stocks high.  Most times you won't need them but certain fights - especially the last one - stocks will drain fast.

  Also DO save regularly - it's Game Over if you lose a battle - although the enemy need to take down all 11 of your Pokemon in your team to win the fight.  I had a near handful of battles where it was my second rank that actually landed the finishing blow.

  There's lots of room for improvement here but training your monsters and fighting with them is always good fun.

S.x.

  So I've doubled the playthrough time with Hacker's Revenge, a warped mirror counterpart to the main story taking its protagonist through a similar but not identical journey to the main story through most of the same locations but also some new ones the counterpart story is actually better than the main story.  The plot doesn't do the screeching 180 degree hand brake turns of the main story and there's a couple of new female characters that don't look like Japanese teenage boys ideas for sex dolls.  I liked the second game's generally grungier cast.  The game's more fun because you're instantly aware of the systems instead of negotiating via trial and error - although in both games I accumulated what appeared to be large numbers of gems never accessible or usable from my inventory.  The game is never always the same because the game system means that for the most part you are generally rotating Digimon between your squad and your training farms as the game proceeds.  But effectively this does give you two games for the price of one though.

  One negative however.  The Finale is a multi point with more endings than Peter Jackman's Lord of the Rings and the final, final boss got a full revive three times and four times hit me with attacks that wiped out my entire active Digimon.  Not sure I have the patience to replay that one.",1693015894,1698729586,True,0,0,0.487804889678955078,0,True,False,False

The game is a anime-style RPG with monster collection elements. You battle with a team of three active digimon, creating a custom team based on what you find and how you evolve them. The game feels more like a monster collection game than other Digimon games, especially as you hardly do any digimon raising, the game series' staple. However, this opens you up to explore the great variety of Digimon available, letting you build your ideal move set, Digimon team, playstyle etc. If you sink time into it you can evolve every Digimon into any variety of others, get your favourites, or the ones you're most intrigued by. Yet this combat complexity is almost optional; you CAN go for a simple bruiser strategy too! 

And here is where the game flails and loses points: the story is not all that in-depth all things considered. It is a fun romp, but it feels very... familiar? You can easily guess where the story is headed, but can't progress until you beat side quests spelling out the obvious solutions. You will find yourself screaming at your character to do the obvious, and frustrated that they aren't putting the pieces together fast enough. Some cut scenes also last so long they drag. The challenge level is also weird; you will be bloodied in one battle, farm to not have it happen again, and overlevel so drastically the next one is trivial. So you will stop doing that, and suddenly find yourself bloodied again next fight.

Despite all its flaws, Cyber Sleuth is a pleasant game with great cinematics, fun characters, and a good balance of gameplay depth and breadth. Enjoy all the side quests, or push your way through the main quest, it's up to you Cyber Sleuth!",1697905556,1697905556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played Dusk/Dawn as a child, I was deterred by the prospect of walking in endless mazes and drowning in wordy dialogues. Cyber Sleuth is still those things. But I have got to say the world building and storytelling in this game has more than make up for its flaws. 

The battle system is decent and its online battles scratches my ReArise itch. Many say raising ABI is grindy. It is if you are elitist and can't help but to min-max. Otherwise, manage your farm well, it wasn't that difficult to raise a bunch of megas including the meta ones. [spoiler] For the OP ones you need to put in some training at the farm though. [/spoiler] Here are some EARLY pointers to lessen the grind: [spoiler] platinumsukemon, devolve & evolve, 20 ABI, fixed damage or piercing skills [/spoiler] There are some more for late games which I will leave for you to discover yourself.

I haven't started Hacker's Memory so I'm not gonna comment for now.

For digimon fans, this game is a great purchase especially when it is on sale. For new comer to the digimon franchise, I'd say this is a great entry point.

- Game controls for the PC port that needed further work. Especially true for traveling, where I did not find it fun having to very frequently zig and zag on the keyboard to avoid running into walls (and in some areas it wasn't avoidable).

- Frequent frame rate drops despite running on a Windows 10 desktop with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-core processor. This was even without having any other programs running.

- Requiring extensive use of third-party guides to explain many mechanics, some of which do not even have a tutorial making mention of them despite their importance. (This is why I added the tag, ""Hidden Mechanics"", to the custom tags. And no, JRPG is not a valid reason for bad game design.)

- A narrative mess. The story started out well enough, but around three-quarters into the base game it went off the deep end with no payoff to certain setups. The DLC included fared better in that it was mostly fine up until near the end with a (poorly executed) bad ending.

Now, if you can put up with all of the above, then you probably will have a fine enough experience with DSCS. But for me, personally, I won't be bothering with filling out the collections and whatnot.

P.S. I bought this when it was on sale, and I'm glad that I didn't pay full price for this game.

Still, I cannot quite recommend Cyber Sleuth to everyone. For many of the good things the game does, it feels like it has something flawed about it. Regardless, if one is willing to fight through, there is a whole lot in this game that's worth the trouble.

Maybe the other game in this pack, Hacker's Memory, alleviates some of the problems I will present? For now, I need a break from the experience. Once again, bear in mind that these apply to specifically Cyber Sleuth, not the sequel Hacker's Memory. I haven't gotten to HM yet, but both games are full-length JRPGs that will likely take 60+ hours each. If and when I clear Hacker's Memory, I may update this review.

THE PROS
+ Tells a more mature and heartfelt Digimon story (no pun intended) reflecting modern technology, its good and bad sides. Its tone is similar to Digimon Tamers, if you've seen the anime. The first half of the game mostly revolves around episodic side quests, while painting the picture of the heroes' mysterious predicaments. By the second half when the ""sludge"" hits the fan, I was invested from the slice-of-life adventures and wanted to see the heroes succeed.

+ A wide range of recruitable Digimon, including many fan favorites. It's fairly easy to get the team you want with enough time, and you're... mostly able to play with your favorites and do well. Mostly. We'll get to the fine print soon enough.

+ Being able to have more than the three ""active"" Digimon, and that a defeated active party is immediately swapped out for any backups and the fight continues. I prefer systems like these in JRPGs, where the whole party travels with you and the active team's defeat isn't an instant game over. Looking at you, Final Fantasy 10, where your backups just seem to pick up their Blitzball and go home when your current trio all get taken out.

+ Great soundtrack with various electronica tunes, with wide ranges of tones and emotions. Some of my top faves are the two main boss themes for much of the game: ""Confront The Enemy"" for standard Digimon boss battles, and ""Something Eroding"" against the digital entities known as Eaters. Other beloved tracks of mine include ""Farewell"", ""Spiritual Boy"" and ""Wandering In A Mayohiga"".

+ Character-driven storyline where you're bound to love the main characters. The main cast kinda grows on you, and subverts negative expectations. This is a huge plus for me, and what kept pulling me back into the game even when it frustrated me. The tsundere Nokia is a classic anime style one and a ditz, but not as obnoxious all the time as one might first worry. Arata comes off as an edgelord at first, but is secretly a pretty fun geek and has the skill to back up his mask of a cool and uncaring hacker. Kyoko is certainly the eccentric detective with mythical lore to spare, and isn't quite as she seems herself in a rather intriguing turn of events...

+ All DLC packs for both Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory are built-in, and for free. Fun outfits can be bought and swapped between. :3 ...oh yeah, and chibi versions of the Royal Knights, which can be early-game ringers if you decide to use them. Or good Digifeed.

THE CONS
- ABI is a stupid mechanic. To access some of the most powerful Digimon at later stages, you'll need to devolve and re-evolve your Digimon. Which leads to grinding. Which can be a chore. The problem is that a lot of fan favorites are also locked behind a high ABI prerequisite, though not all are.

- As a friend of mine would put it, the game has a W-shaped difficulty curve. Early battles, even bosses, are laughably easy and a slog at early levels. Certain points of the game, usually unlocking Ultimate and Mega stage Digimon, will have the difficulty suddenly spike before it evens out. The late-to-endgame battles almost require a maxed-out level of 99 as a price of admission, though the game does have build-in grinding assistance available (look into PlatinumSukamon strategies if you need the boost).

- The translation can be really off at times. Grammar problems, incorrect pronoun use, dialogue choices that are actually just a paragraph of dialogue, and just plain weird translation errors. One of them is how Arata uses the term ""Bakemon"", referring to a specific ghost Digimon, to refer to Eaters; I suspect the writers meant calling Eaters phantoms, demons, yokai or ordinary monsters. It reminds me of classic JRPGs, in an odd way.

- WARNING TO THOSE PLAYING BLIND. Around the halfway point, a DLC side quest (purple pin) will be added to your whiteboard, titled ""A Villainous Cinematic Case"". Up till now, it seems a possible mission, though it has a high difficulty? How to handle it? Step one: DON'T. Not for a long while. You must be very high level to bust through the boss fight's brick walls of healing and damage. Even then, you practically need a Virus Digimon to wipe out the healer, or you'll never beat it.

THE ""YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY"" POINTS
~ The story can get convoluted at times. They do explain everything in due time, but that doesn't excuse some plot points being ah, ""creative"" at times.

~ Remember when I said Level 99 is a prerequisite for the endgame? It's natural to reach that in regular play. The battle mechanics seem to reward skill and luck over the avatar strength of high stats by then. This is a double-edged sword. It can work for SMT and Persona fans I'm sure, but it's not for everyone.

~ The game really, really acts like it wants you to always have a Data, Vaccine and Virus Digimon in your team at all times. Different hacker powers for traversal in dungeons requires different Digimon categories like these. After the halfway point, Virus in particular is needed for its own hacker power. And some of the most difficult battles in the game are just unwinnable unless you bring the right categories with you, because a maxed-out level will not save you.

~ The DigiFarm. Unless you really want to break grinding over your knee, and only if you know specifically how to get the EXP-boosting items, I didn't find this feature useful. When I play monster taming games like these, I usually solidify a team I want for the rest of the game before too long. On top of not using extras, the only other utility I found useful were Digimon-related sidequests that you can choose to have your farm Digis investigate and find. At least half of them are irritating, randomized fetch quests. Not worth it, personally.

~ Consumable items are nearly pointless for 2/3rds of the game. As Digimon heal to full HP and SP when they level up, they hardly seem necessary. When items do become useful, however, it becomes possible to do well without a dedicated healer Digimon. Medical Sprays and Revival Capsules (regular and DX) will become your friends by then.",1693882657,1694421248,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My only dislikes for the game is the fact that I cannot collect every single digimon (as of the finalized release of the game), but I completely understand why that couldn't be a reality; the game is slightly annoying to traverse (the running speed is what you would expect of a computer nerd, so I'm not too surprised by that); and that you need a controller to play it comfortably. None of these issues break the game for me, but on the topic of that, there was one set of trees that made framerate go from like 60 to 10 (I just think that it's funny, messing with graphics settings minimizes the issue they provide).

I adore the whole monster collection aspect of the game (this is my first digimon game outside of the p2w mobile games that get shut down after a while; I also play a lot of pokemon), the amazing animations for each digimon's special move, and the characters inside. Character conversations sometimes drag on for like 3 minutes of solid mashing through it (but that's only for boring topics), which is vaguely inconvenient but I also love talking to the quirky characters.

What I don't like is that they sometimes repeat dialogue which make it slow for pacing. 

What I neutral is the character design, some are good for example: little black girl with black and white dress, creepy purple scientist guy with black coat along with white formal outfit and black gloves, and female police officer despite wearing formal skirt while running, she still looks good and accurate for police officer. Some are bad or question to myself why did they look like for example; red-headed girl despite wearing blue dress with pink jacket, she kind reveal her skin on side of her hip even though she wear underneath her dress, and black jacket girl with green hair (friend of blue little monster named Veemon) showing off her bra/swimsuit top even though wearing a jacket which was supposed to cover it yet she still underage. 

What I unsure about this game is being slowed while I was running to cyberspace or fighting against Digimon. whether I download was supposed to be slow, my computer was old, my wifi isn't working properly.

Basically this game is Persona if it had a baby with Digimon and I think it does a good enough job with it. Plenty of gameplay, plot enjoyable not to mention with these ports they actually did a cool thing backporting the digimon from Hacker's memory which is the sequel to the original, so you have access to that.

If you are a fan of JRPG's and like digimon this is pretty good, difficulty is on par with a pokemon game in the sense if you know what you are doing and make sure to do maybe a bit of grinding everytime you digivolve (digivolving reduces level to 1) you should be fine

Now its not perfect by any stretch, but hey what game is. It is however considered by many digimon fans as a gold standard for digimon rpg's, something which I agree too. My only complaint is no english voice acting and if thats really my biggest complaint I think this game is doing fine ^_^

In case you are wondering, favorite digimon is of course the greymon line with good ol War Greymon, Terraforce for the Terra win heh heh

Edit: I would like to add one other thing, there are times where you might get a lot of slowdown out in the field. If this happens, save and restart the game. That usually fixes the slow run glitch, least for me

Edit Edit: So beat Hacker's Memory and got all the achievements of both games. Yeah good games, great value for your money for both games, and as far as completing it. Yeah have a guide out ready, as for Hacker's Memory end game, harder than Cyber Sleuth's almost to an unfair degree.

The dialogues rather silly and watered down in some parts, coming off as toddler friendly while also, at the same time, adding scenes of such depraved depths that it gives me whiplash. 

One minute they're talking about justice and the goodness of others, and then you're watching middle schoolers get forced to commit murder suicide while also telling them they DESERVED it. Amazing. Astounding.

The best Digimon rpg you can play on PC, Cyber Sleuth Complete Edition takes the game-play first introduced in Digimon World DS, and presents it on a 3D plane, similar to what Pokemon Colosseum did for Pokemon Gen 3 back on the GCN. The Complete Edition include's two games: ""Cyber Sleuth"" and it's sequel, ""Hacker's Memories"". 

Game-Play: 
This is a by the book RPG game, where progression is handled episodically. Similar to Pokemon, customization is emphasized on the player's team of Digimon rather than the player themselves. The game's ""safe zones"" are represented by the various areas of Tokyo while dungeons are represented by the various areas of EDEN, a digital world accessible to humans (not to be confused with the digital world inhabited by Digimon).

The battles are turn-based style. Players can have up to 3 Digimon on-screen, though some scenarios will see the player being assisted by 1-2 NPC's. Regardless of how many models are on the battlefield, there is no drop in performance and battle animations can be shortened in the game's settings. All exp is shared equally among all party members, regardless of whether or not they participated in battle. The difficulty of battles can also be adjusted in the game's setting, though this only results in higher money payouts. 
(KNITTY-GRITTY DETAIL: There is a rock-scissor-paper mechanic in the game concerning a Digimon's type and attribute. Exploiting an enemy's type or attribute can deal 2x or 1.5x damage respectively. Exploiting both type and attribute deals 3x damage.) 

The game finds its replayability in the digivolution system. Outside of the anime, Digimon is well-known its non-linear evolution mechanics and the same can be said here. Obtaining stronger Digimon not only means meeting tougher criteria but requires plot progression. Similar to hard drive space, there's a limit to how many Digimon the player can carry in their party. What space is taken up varies from one Digimon to the next. This limit can be increased through an in-game item, acquired by completing certain chapters, dungeons and side quests.

Presentation:
To keep things short, it felt like I was watching an anime but the cut-scenes are lackluster. It does make up for it with mountains of ""mature"" dialogue, Japanese voice acting and the once-in-awhile animated cut-scene but after awhile it just becomes a race to see how fast you can press the A button. I like the ""mature"" themes presented but it would've been nice to skip cut-scenes.
      
Personal thoughts/Summary: 
Though it is a ""2-in-1"", the game feels more like a ""1.5-in-1"". The player is experiencing the same narrative from two different points of view. ""Hacker's Memory"" is the sequel that adds new features and locations but re-uses old locations and other assets. That being said, this is just a nit-pick, given how game development takes time. 
In retrospect, Media.Vision, the developers of both games, handled these two titles better than GameFreak handling the transition from Gen 8 to Gen 9.",1692306622,1692306622,True,6,0,0.595380246639251709,0,True,False,False

That said, it's also extremely good, with a fairly intriguing story, fun and interesting characters, and the greatest digimon evolution trees in the series's history. Most of the games before this (barring the virtual pet style ones, which aren't for everyone) have had fairly limited digimon evolution trees, but this game has them be wide open; you can have a plant digimon who grows to full power as a plant, or shift them over to be more bestial or even angelic as they evolve, and then unevolve them to even even MORE choices. And this is genuinely good for them too, since it gives them a much broader scope of skills to choose from.

Digimon Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory are fundamentally some of the best turn-based RPGs in the series, with a better story, graphics, and gameplay than most that came before; the only real flaws are the unskippable dialogue, some moves being unbalanced, and some minor QOL features, and all but the dialogue is fixed in Hacker's Memory.

You start with little bubble head monsters fighting each other for some fetch missions and at the end you fight against giant monsters with huge cyborg kinghts to protect the multiverse. I would lie if I said the story was good, it was full of silly anime tropes and overconveluted in the worst way. The characters and dialogue were also really bad. I also hated how grindy and slow the game started. The entire evolution system requires you to evolve them back and forward to get the strongest monsters.

What was good? The sound and music were pretty good. The monster design was pretty good for the most part, especially the later ones. The combat animations were really good and felt so satisfying.

Overall I would say the gameplay is good enough, even though the story is lacking.

Time to complete: 91 hours


[h1] Hacker's Memory [/h1]

The negative aspects of the Cyber Sleuth campaign are even worse here. After playing the main story, this side story feels unimportant and not really worth exploring.

The sidequests were optional in Cyber Sleuth and here you have to do them all, which wouldn't be that terrible if the monsters would get any stronger. I've played half way through the story and still was fighting rookie monsters. They made the grind even worse. They should have made it that you can take your monsters from the Cyber Sleuth into this to skip the entire grind.

I've been sitting on this one for months now and can't force myself to complete it, the story and pacing are just terrible and it feels like chores to play this.

[h1] ---{ Warning }--- [/h1]

There is a big red flag warning i must talk about first, if you buy this there is a chance it will not even launch not matter how good your pc might be, cause this game has a big launching problem that has been in the game since launch.


[h1] 08/08/2023 update: [/h1]The community might of very well finally after nearly 5 years since this game has come out found out what might very well be the root of the launching problem. I will still have the old way to fix this problem bellow in cause the new way doesn't work for you. i might update this review one more time if i so see others saying that this new way to fix is working out for them.

How to fix that has been found can be as simple as making a new user on your computer and then running steam though this new user profile and booting the game. This means if this really is working for lot of people it would very much mean something within windows users is the reasoning to the game not launching. Perhaps the game wasn't updated when windows started to have the Microsoft account requirement unlike in windows 7 so it breaks due to the new checks??? perhaps anyways bellow is the old community method info as said in cause the new method is flawed.


Old method of playing this game if have problems.
 
The community has found that just to do a fresh OS install or play through a virtual machine, is the way to get around the launching problems.

I had this problem myself and i can confirm the community is right on how to fix it i did the fresh OS instail option as i don't know how to do a VM, but even tho i had to deal with all that reinstalling from even gpu drivers duh am glad i got to play it.

[h1] ---{ Detail Notes }--- [/h1]

This game is pure made for digimon fans, cause the biggest problem i have with this game is the grind to 100% is horrid. To 100% seems like it demands 450 hours or perhaps even more depending on RNG and your speed of doing stuff in the game, i've already spent 179 hours into both yet i ended on only around 49% of even achieving everything. Still have much to go, why? Cause its the medals mainly, the medals are the worst there is 700 as there is 700 digimon in the game so the grind to 100% is really tough.

So yeah you really got to be dedicated to the grind if you wish to 100% and well get all steam achievements.

You can somewhat remove the grind by following this guild linked here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907917379 
But yes you have to grind to even set this up, but once all setup you be much more happy you went though that effort to set it all up, i know i did.


Anyways other then the grind for this game this game was enjoyable enough to keep me going while having plenty of fun along the way, as the combat isn't too bad, for real it's robust enough that way later in the game it can be challenging to use the right digimon for the job but, other then nearing the end it can be easy enough to not feel like your not progressing, just cause you got the wrong digimon for the task at hand.

The battle system is decent and some aspect of managing your Digimons is fun.

While there are some interesting story elements in this game, they are completely overshadowed by a boring Anime cast.
The gameplay is okay but the mechanics of creating more Digimons to a digital farm by data you gathered from fighting is tedious and it would have been much better if they adapted and mixed the evolution system from Digimon World 3 to this game.

The music is pretty good and there are some iconic sounds/tracks in it but, while it is unique it's definitely not for everyone.
I do think it fits well with Digimon and this game, I personally think they should have made more variety in styles of music.


There's a ""Lab"" system where you create and manage Digimons and with it you have a farm there that you can add your Digimons to, train them and some unnecessary actions will take between 30 minutes to 2 hours real life time - having the game on - while not in a menu.
This is a mechanic that doesn't feel like it fits within the game, and the fact that it fits the franchise does not excuse bad game design that doesn't fit well within the mechanics of the game.
While the ""Lab"" part of the game is unique and kind of interesting, it is repetitive and it gets old quick.
It could have definitely benefited from QoL additions to make the farm and management more streamline and easy so you can focus on the average Anime story, the slow travel and the random fight encounters.

Hard mode just makes it so all enemies have a ton of HP meaning all battles will drag on, I recommend to never attempt it as it just becomes boring beyond belief.
The story is a bunch of good ideas made boring by making it character driven with a cast that I couldn't care for.

If you're a Digimon fan, you might find some redeeming qualities in it.
If not and you're considering this, go watch a playthrough video of it first and see if you're invested.

- The story in both games is pretty good, while Cyber Sleuth focus on a more ""heroical"" history, Hackers Memory focus on a really personal one that does a good job making you care about the characters.

1. Story

This is obvious. This game has an amazing story. This game's story is so incredible that you'll get lost in it, forgetting everything else you had planned. The mysteries of Kamishiro Enterprises and the Eaters, the strange Yuuko Kamishiro, and your two friends, Nokia and Arata. And then Alphamon and Crusadermon... This story is amazing.

2. Gameplay

This game is the best in the Digimon Story games. It's pretty different from Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, yet similar in some ways. The combat is relatively the same, but they got rid of that weird grid thing from those games. Now, attacks that hit more than one target will just hit all foes on the field. And of course, it's in 3D, meaning that every Digimon has animations. And, now what it doesn't have that's similar to Digimon World Dawn and Dusk is.... the maps. Woohoo! The game isn't a maze everywhere you go, and if you get lost in Kowloon Level 1 I am actually scared for the future of humanity. 

3. The Digimon

Over 300 Digimon. And that's without mods. It brings a bunch of mechanics from other Digimon media into it.

4. Mods

Mods. Fucking mods. This game is already great, and the mods you add can only better your experience. Most mods add new Digimon like the X-Antibody Digimon, new mega's, just a bunch of Digimon to the point where they could end up near 500, or more. I can recommend some mods for you to use though. For example, the Tamers Variants pack which adds a multitude of variants and the pre evo's for the Tamer Digimon (Kyubimon, Gargomon, and Growlmon.) You can also use the Ultimate Digimon Pack (Tamer Variants has a compatibility mod for it. 

5. Things I hate.

I'm not going to sit here and lie to you. Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth isn't, in my opinion the greatest game ever made. Something I don't like about it is the fact that you have limited Digimon storage. at the start of the game, you have twenty, which may sustain you until Champion where you may reach max with one or two Digimon still in rookie form. But... you can find Memory UP's which boost your Memory (Storage) up by 5, and Memory UP DX boosting it by 10. And, the limited Digimon storage thing kind of encourages your creativity, forcing you to try and win fights with what you have instead of cheesing it with a Mega Digimon instantly. You'll need to make a strategy so you don't lose a fight. You won't be able to just absolutely destroy everything in your path even if you over level since you don't level up really fast. Of course, the PlatinumNumemon and Tactician USB method but still. Now moving on to something I do hate about this game is the fact that if you lose any fight, you'll be sent back to your last save. You won't consistently lose fights but it can get annoying if your last save was in chapter four and you're over in chapter ten. Now, another thing I hate is the fact the game takes... really long in some parts. Specifically in the prologue. I hate how long it takes to get to the start where you can do whatever the hell you want. Sometimes the game doesn't tell you what to do in the main quest, and they do force you to do some quests. But it's not like in Digimon World Dawn and Dusk where they force you to do some bullshit quests like searching for an item, and the quests they usually want you to do are story specific quests, like the Time Capsule Woman quest where you meet Pete who becomes very important. Sure, your Digimon will find quests like the lost item quests, but those are all optional. I just realized that even the faults in this game are still actually surprisingly making the game better (Especially since I know one of you are gonna cheat and grab yourself that instantly clear game capsule mod that skips everything, or gives you any item in the game.)

[Are you a Digimon fan?]

-If yes, like me, then this is a must buy. Two stories in one package is a steal, especially when its on sale. This is almost certainly the best Digimon game on the market.

-If no, then you do need to keep in mind this is a JRPG that Westerners may struggle to get into, though the gameplay loop is engaging and rewarding, if a bit tedious and obtuse.

-----------------------------------

Now, longer review with no real format, kind of rambling, and light spoilers.

I have been out of the Digimon scene for awhile now, like north of 15, maybe 20 years where I watched the English dubs of Digimon Adventure 01 and 02, the Digimon movie, Digimon Tamers, and then the super confusing Digimon World game for the PSX. Then, as age started addling my mind at the ripe age of 30, nostalgia crept into my brain fold and I saw that I had this game in library and booted it up. 

Its a slow start for both campaigns but it does pick up in both as well. Going forward, CS will stand in for Cyber Sleuth and HM will be for Hacker's Memory). I recommend starting out with CS first (which took me 90 hours to complete) and then going over to HM (which took roughly 80 hours to beat). The gameplay is the same for both so once you have it down, there won't be any more curveballs sent your way once you get to HM. CS in particular feels very Persona-esque, even though I've never really played any of them. Its very slice of life but then you go into a dungeon/mind palace and you do the thing, which means do a fight.

For story, I personally preferred CS. For characters, CS wins there by default since Nokia isn't a central character. I swear she specifically feels like the main, central character narratively. Like, she gets a super big deal Digimon, she has a lot of impact on the story and on characters. She just feels very Mary-Sueish which is not something I can just plaster on any ol' character. If you know, you know.

The music goes from somewhat repetitive, to serviceable, to absolute bangers more towards the end of the games.

The gameplay is genuinely pretty fun. You have to find the perfect balance between function and looking like a badass with your main battle team walking behind you in combat areas. Discovering new Digimon by way of Digivolving is actually exciting as well, and this is coming from an old Digimon fan. My two main criticism of the game come from the poor explanations of the ABI sat and training Digimon to get certain stats. Both of those systems are not explained well in the game but figuring them out really helped define the big RPG mechanic in every RPG: grinding. Boy howdy, will you do a hell of a lot of grinding.

Also, strangely for both games, typos were happening a lot. Eaters were sometimes written as Bakemon (a ghost Digimon with no affiliation to the main antagonist) and Jimiken being switched over to Jimmy KEN in the last 1/10th of CS and then off and on throughout HM. Weird stuff like that that maybe should've been fixed before porting it from console to PC but what do i know...

All in all, this game bundle with both CS and HM are great fun and, in my opinion, the best Digimon game on the market and it seems most of the Digimon community is in agreement.

It has the usual ""save the world"" aspect, either just the Digital World or both that and the Real World. In this case, it has both worlds in mind. But the mature aspect comes from more...creepy content being present. Basically think horror tropes being present in the game. I think this is good, though, as most Digimon fans, I believe, grew up watching the shows and would be more mature by the time they play this game. It definitely has a more Shin Megami Tensei feel to it, which is a positive.
So far, though, there are a number of downsides in regards to translation stuff. Like how some Digimon have a different name in english than their japanese counterparts. ex: Omnimon-Omegamon, Leopardmon-Duftmon, Crusadermon-Lordknightmon. Because of this, the voice acting causes a bit of disconnect in my head when someone calls someone one name, but the dialogue is showing a different name.
And there's one last error where a ""monster"" is referred to, the game uses Bakemon instead of ""Bakemono"" which translates to monster in japanese. And Bakemon are actual Digimon, which can lead to confusion for anyone who isn't aware.",1689232759,1689232759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It combines the 2015 ""Cyber Sleuth"" and the 2017 ""Hacker's Memory"" sequel in one game. The two are more or less the same game, only with a different story, so it makes sense that they were combined. 
It took me 85 hours to complete both halves.

Negatives:
- Too many quests involve nothing but walking around and reading dialogue. 
- Too much walking. You get a movement acceleration skill in ""Hacker's Memory"", but you won't have it in the entirety of the first half of the game (the ""Cyber Sleuth""-part). It's like playing Pokemon without the bicycle.
- The game is too easy, especially in the first half of ""Cyber Sleuth"". It took me 20 hours of play time to encounter a battle for which I needed more than one attempt.
- All the puzzles are either baby-easy, or the game tells you the solution outright and you merely have to assemble the pieces while fighting random encounters. Meaning they're only time sinks.
- The game only has a handful of full scale dungeons. Most areas are short, simple mazes or linear pathways.
- The game makes you walk back and forth through already explored areas over and over again. ""Hacker's Memory"" only introduces a handful of new regions, at least half of Hacker's Memory takes place in areas that you already cleared in Cyber Sleuth. 
- The music becomes repetitive. There are very few unique boss themes. Hacker's Memory and Cyber Sleuth also share the same soundtrack.
- Some max-evolution digimon require so much grinding that it is easier to beat the game than it is to get them.
- It's unintuitive that you have to increase the ""ABI"" stat (in German ""FÄH"") in order to reach Mega-level. To do so, you have to un-evolve your digimon and level it back up again, sometimes repeatedly, which is just as tedious as it sounds. There are methods to mitigate the grind, but setting those up takes work too.
- You get spammed with ""Digiline""-message notifications all game long.
- The ""Xros Combo"" chain attack battle animations take too long, look boring, and can't be turned off.
- Regarding the story, you could play ""anime clichés bingo"" and check all the boxes and it also has a few continuity errors, but I'd call these minor issues.

Positives:
- The turn-based combat system is good. Basically Final Fantasy 10 mixed with Pokemon.
- There is a ton of story content and over 300 digimon to collect.
- Generally speaking, the story and characters are fine and have their charm. 
- There is a decent amount of variety with the side-quest stories. I liked a good portion of them.
- The optional endgame challenge quests are fun (imo the best part of the game combat-wise).
- Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory let you access the same digimon data bank once you've beaten both, which means transferring digimon between both halves.
- The combat animations are neat, even if a bit too long in some cases.
- The couple of fully animated cutscenes look great.
- You have full control over random encounters from mid-game onwards. Like being able to turn them off completely or instantly triggering them when grinding levels.
- There are many checkpoints and fast travel options, so even though you have to walk a lot within dungeons, you never feel ""stuck"".
- There is an online pvp feature if you care about that.

To summarize:
I recommend the game for its decent story and fun turn-based combat. However, it has a high number of flaws. If you can't stand games that drag and feel time inefficient to play, then I advise against it.",1688967663,1689096914,True,1,0,0.49824562668800354,0,True,False,False

* Way too much dialogue, and repetitive.
* There is little to no consideration for QoL. The game's UI and navigation makes it difficult to execute tasks that should be simple or display information that is useful.
* There is a significant amount of grinding.

Specifically, this game also has the following issues:

* Combat is very simple, there's a rock/paper/scissors system and special skills but for the most part that doesn't bring much variety to the combat.
* Enemy AI is terrible. It will take actions at random like healing when full.
* Because of the above, the difficulty in the game comes not from finding strategies to beat the enemies but getting through their overwhelming amount of HP while making sure you don't die from their overpowered attacks.
* There are a lot of scripted fights. Sometimes you'll be stopped in the middle of one, many times you'll face an enemy you can't defeat.
* The story is honestly the dumbest story in any video game ever.
* Unskippable cutscenes.
* Text is full of errors, potentially the result of a bad translation job.

Same conclusion, get the game when its deeply discounted.

Very sad and time wasteful UI design choices: unskippable cutscenes, no fastforward/auto/rereading/skipping in visual novel segments. Poorly implemented text input for character and digimon names. The text does not update as you type in letter so you have no idea if what you are typing in is correct. I had a rare bug in character creation where i was not able to exit name input despite spamming confirm/back so i got soft locked requiring a game restart No the dev don't get a pass for this on the excuse of a HD port of a PS vita game. In fact this screams laziness and low budget crunch considering the MSRP they wanted. I think one of the more glaring issues is that there is a lack of fast travel between hubs and that you can't access the Digimon Care Centre (DigiLab) from the map select screen and vice versa. It's minimum two loading screens to get to either UI section. UI issues burn away like 1/3 of your play time with nonsense. If  you have to redo a boss fight you can't skip the initial visual novel cutscene. 

The combat seems pretty standard for a RPG game. You are allowed three digimon at a time in battle and each one is allowed 6 skills each with a sub pool of 20 where you can modify out of battle. Normal difficulty is somewhat brain dead, this is if you want to enjoy the story with battle on the side. Hard mode though is too difficult at times and ask for alot of level grinding which i do not recommend unless you want to play new game plus or what to waste of lot of time exp grinding. Enemy monster stats are 1.5x the norm. '

Digimon levelling and evolving/de-volving, there is alot of shit with this system that even make's  Pokemon's nonsense look like a child's book. You need external resources to figure out what digimon you want to aim for since evolving has multiple paths and have very different stat growth and skills. Certain digimon, usually the more powerful variants, require stats call Camaraderie (CAM) and ABI( Ability). The former stat only goes up by 1 for every monster in battle the latter requires tediously evolving and de-volving digimon to raise it. Everytime you devolve or evolve you digimon is set back to level 1. This means you have to level it back to the requirements to evolve again; very tedious.  Obtaining exp can be grindy outside of the end game and not using exploits like certain digimon passives with exp gain and digimon equipment that is based off RNG to obtain that also boosts exp gain. 

Party limitation is limited by a stat called memory, this will raise via rare item called ""Memory up (+5) and Memory up DX (+10)"". Usually they are obtained as main story rewards or sometimes in side dungeons. This stat limit's the tier and number of digimon you are allowed in your group and this includes digimon allocation to sidelines. It is fine for difficulty clamping for main story, but is a huge hamper to levelling digimon on the sidelines. By the end of the game if you don't miss any item pick ups then you'll have enough memory for 10 Mega/Ultra type digimon, which means you are short of 11 being the full party. At this point it forces you into new game plus for that last digimon slot if you want it. Overall a negative design, It does not respect you time and forces you to rush through the story if you want to make the most use of side content as digimon on sidelines also get exp if they are in party, but you can't do this due to memory limitations most of the game. 

Graphics settings are less than bare bones; AA, depth of field and resolution options. The only saving grace is that so far I haven't encountered performance issues and the game is locked 60 fps with no dips.

 Audio settings aren't granular enough, they are in 10% increments, at 10% the game volume is too loud still and then you have to dance around with your system volume to get it lower it. This is a problem if you have a voice call going or background music running because now you might have to adjust volume app by app. Audio settings don't kick in until you load your save file, so when the game boots up you are greeted with 100% volume which can blow your ears up if you aren't careful. 

So, is the story good? It's good, nothing amazing. The game has very weird positioning for side content during main story segments. You could be trying to rescue a friend and the game just suddenly tells you that you need to complete non-related side content to progress. It has very awkwardly positioned walls that hamper progress to pad playtime. I played hacker's memory which is one of two story lines you can play. Keep in mind you can't carry over your digimon collection/party to either story lines. Core game play is the same, but you play a different story and perspective. This is kind of like Pokemon red, blue, green and yellow. For some this is a major turn off and that is a case for me. 

So this brings us to issues, if you finished one story with a buffed up digimon crew you aren't necessarily stoked to another story perspective with weak ass digimon and the same start limitations with 100% the same core gameplay mechanics. This is a huge mistep in terms QOL of a game and which is why I can't value this package as two games. It's more like 1.25 games and largely does not justify it's pricing. In case you did play both story lines, you get a couple storyline completion digimon unlocks. 

At this point I would normally have refunded this game. I haven't played a digmon game in over two decades and I want to scratch that itch. Do not buy this game at its MSRP, do what i did and only get the game if you really want a Digimon game at the 75% discount.

One last thing before i forget, the game has cosmetics for your character and digimon, but the content is gated via multiplayer through a currency. The multiplayer is dead so you are essentially gated from content that you paid for.",1685163558,1685902183,False,5,0,0.513115227222442627,3,True,False,False

I'm an avid digimon fan, i played Digimon world 2,3,4 and Data squad and also watched most of the anime, i don't write reviews often but i want to highly recommend this game if you are into anime and monster breeding games in general, here are some strong points in the game:
 

1. Story rich, i don't expect games like  digimon to have top notch writing but this game is an exception which surprised me, story progresses slow, the expansion improves upon the main game in almost every aspect.

2. Many Quality of life options for the genre, you can reduce random encounters at will with abilities or increase them if u want to grind for example and it doesn't cost anything.

3. Not too grindy, you can actually proceed through the story with most monsters, a lot of grinding is required for the strongest digimons in the game though.

4. New game+ is a godsend, since there are more than 300 monsters u can clear the game with vastly different ones each time.

5. The expansion '' hacker's memory'' is almost as big as the main game.


What i didn't like:
1. Uninspired level design, dungeons are all similar.

2. Online features are lacking, takes a long time to find an opponent if at all, wasted potential IMO.

3. There is no real exploring, you just do quests and side quests, i miss the thrill of finding a secret overpowered bosses and secret areas.

4.  Outdated textures.

Overall it's a decent game (+100 hours to finish both stories), though there are definitely some big components that bring the whole experience down. I was bored for half the time playing this.

Story: 4/10. The quality of the storytelling is very inconsistent, mostly due to the heavy focus on solving ""cases"". Some cases are mandatory to continue the story, while others are considered optional. Although this system is similar to the usual Story vs. Side quests in most RPGs, this game doesn't know how to properly classify them... Some mandatory quests will range from solving the mystery of people disappearing, while others request you to help awkward guys to find a girlfriend or scare away stalkers (It's like the story was written by socially awkward teens...)

Characters: 3/10. The main character is essentially mute, with only repeated face reactions to whatever is happening around him. Some side characters can be interesting at times, but mostly annoying and often cliche.
  
Gameplay: 6/10. The progression system is not bad, mostly focused on leveling up your digimon and eventually digivolving them, with plenty of selection to choose from. However, later digivolutions rely heavily on one stat: ABI - which you can only raise through constant evolving and devolving (with each change reverting your digimon to lvl 1). It's a very grindy process that seems completely unnecessary. Without it, the game would be so much better. I think probably half of my play time is repeating this process so I can finally reach the higher evolutions. The battles are cool at first, but then you realize most abilities are the same (apart from their elements) and you end up just using the Auto combat mode to be faster (especially with all the grinding you have to do!)

Graphics: 4/10. Mostly static backgrounds with only the characters moving during conversations... Meh

Overall: 5/10 with a big help of the nostalgia factor. Worth it if you are a Digimon fan and the game is on sale... otherwise you're not missing much",1681144521,1681144521,True,4,0,0.55120009183883667,0,True,False,False

Near end game, might requires to grind some digimon with you, during one playthrough of mine all digimon got clapped, so just ensure you don't follow my path either grind level on main digi and have some backup

Also come information about the game, during the Cyber S storyline, depends your gender chosen at the start you'll able to see them in the Hacker's M during a mission, but just for 3 seconds and you'll never find them again!

This game has the classic JRPG problem of giving you still images of the most imprtant information in the experience it offers, then never presenting it again.

Most of the desirable evolutions require a high ABI stat, which is most easily raised by reverting/de-evolving your units. You also use ABI to raise unit stats in the farm. So for the Digimon fans out there, identify what Digimon you want to use, open up the wiki and trace them back down the line to one of the starters, and repeatedly level that starter up and down between Training and Champion until the ABI is where it needs to be for your build; 80 will cover almost everything but many don't require that much. From the start, you should grow and keep a core combat team with high ABI.

Once you have your party sorted the way you want it, the game's combat encounters can offer a pretty cathartic experience. You can freely swap between any of your 11 Digimon in a fight in order to min/max against the enemy's type and elemental alignment. Early on you will not be able to fill all 11 slots with worthwhile units, but you should have enough room to get though. There are a few multi-phase boss fights at the end of important chapters and in the endgame, so having capable units in reserve can make a big difference.

My opinion on the story would have swung pretty far depending on where I was in the experience when you asked me. Overall it only really started pulling me in at the halfway point; before then it was the novelty of the gameplay loop and the the mystery around the player character that kept me going. On the whole it's a worthwhile mystery intertwined with the franchise's core themes of friendship conquering all. So basically Interstellar for weebs.

One big con: this game lacks a quest log. It's very easy to completely lose what you're supposed to be doing in the story. For some reason, only active side missions (""cases"") get tracked in the Player tab. So if you put the game down for a couple of days after starting a new chapter, and NPCs have disappeared to some corner of Kowloon or Tokyo to wait for you, it can be frustrating to pick it up again. Kyoko and Mirei will give you hints, but they're not consistently helpful.

Ultimately I can recommend this game, just not at its full price. The presentation leaves a lot to be desired and certain design choices are questionable, but fans of turn-based games and buildcrafting will find something to love here, and active or lapsed Digimon fans will come to find that this is the best game in the franchise that you're going to find on Steam as of now.",1679917178,1680415394,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The dialogue feels incredibly rough, like it is in desperate need of localization that no one cared enough to give it.  The characters seem both odd and like cardboard stand ins at the same time, especially the main character. The story, without giving anything away, is about what you'd expect from a digimon game but the execution just feels weak and I kept finding it incredibly hard to feel invested in anything going on because unlike other story based games I've played such as Danganronpa and Persona the characters were in no way 
memorable and the NPCs come across more like AIs than the digimon do. Most cutscene dialogue is voice acted but once again, little care seems to be put into this game due to having no option for english dubbing, furthering my theory that there were little to no actual localization efforts outside of basic translating for quick sales to English audiences (if you watch footage of the dialogue in the game you'll see what I mean. People don't speak the way these characters do and some of the moments are just goofy ""You were definitely drooling! I saw you!"" being said after meeting a character for example being used as a conversation opener in a completely different area from where said act was seen in a professional setting. Another example is  ""keep calm and carry on luggage"". There are even parts that are clearly wrong such as one option where you can choose between ""Hey! That's the ""Labyrinth phenomenon! When you"" and ""formally publish, you should call it that!"" which is clearly supposed to be one sentence but has selection arrows as if it was a dialogue option.

 The one thing I will give it is that with minimal grinding you can get a team of ultimates very early in the game and just one shot everything but I don't view that as a positive. In addition, for the niche group of people who view Frontier as your favorite season, only 2 evolution lines from it are in the game and neither is ""complete"", in fact the digimon selection feels incredibly lacking seeing as how even Malo-Myotismon doesnt make the cut. 

This game has high ratings but unless all that is wanted is to run around with your dream team of digimon (assuming your favorite made the list of available digimon) and grind endless easy battles with them as a time killer I don't understand the appeal. I would definitely not recommend to persona lovers like myself who saw the gameplay premise and drew similarities, anyone who cares about story over gameplay, or really anyone other than a digimon super fan. The longer I play this game the more I don't understand the ratings.

The bad: The characters are flat and boring, the story and dialog are terrible and it's feels like you're playing a first graders stage play. You can spot plot twists from a mile away. Female characters are sometimes needlessly sexualized, without it really fitting their character, which makes it feel like cheap eye candy for horny teens.

My conclusion:
Buy on sale if you're digimon fan and if you can forgive poor writing. I personally enjoyed the game because I liked the grinding aspect of building my optimal digimon team, only to proceed to steamroll the entire story mode, but playing for a second time (Hacker's Memory) makes me facepalm in agony every cutscene.

Digimon are super cool and I'm enjoying the battling, though battles never get quite complex enough to use all the features (at this point). The music is really really good too. My major complaint is about the over-sexualization of the female characters. For a digital monster fighting game, I was not expecting this, and it makes it sort of awkward when my wife wants to see my digimon XD

Thus far, I've basically paid 4$ per hour played (11.3 hrs now). Each hour has been worth it.

It's so nice to have a modern Digimon game with good graphics. It is much simpler than say, Dawn and Dusk from the DS. Although those are fun, they are very grindy. Digi-evolution still requires some effort, but its far easier than older games.

I've been having lots of fun battling digimon, though I do wish it played more of a role. Things are still very easy, and I haven't encountered many varieties of Digimon or locations. I thought this was strange since I'm on chapter 4. However, by looking at the achievements, I can see it goes to 20 for the main story. So I imagine more variety will arise through the next chapters!

Using the digi bank is fun, and it's nice to see my digimon running around on the island. Leveling is quite easy, and allows you to keep many digimon leveling at once, regardless of whether they are in your active party.

The story is pretty simple thus far, and the enemies are extremely easy. I hope they get more difficult with time.

The music is way more awesome than I imagined it to be.

My major complaint about the game is that many of the female story characters are hyper-sexualized. It makes me feel odd when I'm just wanting to battle digital creatures. I haven't seen anything strictly like nudity, but it gets close sometimes. I could do without it, because I'd like to recommend this game to friends but feel odd for doing so.

Overall, it's been a fun ride so far, and I'm excited to keep going.",1679460861,1679460986,True,1,0,0.5,1,True,False,False

	A lot of the game is just busy work and stretching for time. You will be forced to take (uninteresting) sidequests to continue the main story. The main story itself has its share of filler, with content that goes nowhere and is excruciatingly boring (going to eat at restaurants; some ghost hunt). I assume all this was meant to 'build up' the world, but it's just a painful drag on the plot. 

	Even the dialogue stretches for more than necessary. With unnecessarily long explenations about pointless info. I started skipping dialogue and even then it takes a while before they finish.

	The game maps don't fare any better. There aren't many locations here, so they are reused endlessly. You will be a third of the way done with the game and STILL traversing the very first dungeon. Running through the same small and lifeless recreations of Japanese locations to talk to another NPC. 

	The game spends a lot of time forcing you to run from the office to a location and back again for no legitimate reason. Everything before chapter 9 feels like busy work that is stretching for time. It's the equivalent of desperately trying to meet the word requirement on an essay by making sentences much longer than they really need to be or should be just like this sentence right here which is longer than it needed to be to make the point.

	Honestly, if this game condensed chapters 1 through 9 into 3 chapters the game would benefit immensely. There just isn't enough content for 20 chapters. The story itself suffers because the pacing is really bad. Plot threads are introduced and put on hiatus repeatedly. You don't have a solid grasp on just what the main story is until chapter 11 or 12. And even when you do, the game STILL stalls for time during the later chapters. I don't think I've ever seen a game stall its story as much as this game does. 

	The only positive is that raising Digimon is fun. The way they grow into fiercer and larger monsters reminds me of how cool it was seeing what Goku or Frieza/Cell/Majin Buu's next form would be. And it isn't a straight progression either (like Pokemon). Digimon can evolve into various forms, and you'll sometimes need to devolve in order to evolve back again into a stronger form. 

	But the Digimon rearing doesn't save the rest of the experience. Why this game gets so much positive word of mouth I don't understand. Either the bar for Digimon games is extremely low (which speaks bad of the content in the franchise) or people are just glad that the franchise is getting some manner of representation.This whole game felt so cheap and basic.

Some observations
- This is the first game I've seen in a very long time that has gameplay composited over video. Some of it is rather trippy, but unlike Final Fantasy, the play area isn't projected onto it
- Also a very rare game that uses an entropy/energy based Turn-Based combat system
- There's a fair bit of stutter, and it seems to correlate with it loading sounds and audio, such as the dialogue.
- There is no dub, this to me is a massive positive
- The translation is okay; there are some untranslated lines, and some lines have slightly awkward grammar, and some characters have questionable stylistic choices, but there are no gross offences or mistranslations.
- The characters are kind of oblivious to the plots going on, but the game doesn't rub it in your face, and what they're oblivious about doesn't really impact anything
- The story does kind of outstay its welcome, it just keeps going as an excuse to throw more digimon at you.

The gameplay is your standard JRPG fare with a couple of simple rock/paper/scissors systems to make it a bit interesting. It also has a timeline, so you can see when each character will make their move, which is nice, but there are very few ways to manipulate when turns happen so it's just kind of there. On the whole, it's maybe just above par for the genre. The monster raising is the real star, and it's fun to level and de-level the Digimon to get one that you want, even if it can be a bit hard to plan ahead. So, there's two good points.

The story and writing are absolutely horrible. The dialogue goes on and on and it's generally just so pointless and bland that you really can't help but hate every single character. By the end, I was just mashing through it without reading it (and believe me, that's a lot of mashing). It also has that classic lack of subtlety that's so endemic in anime: if a character looks like they're going to wind up being a villain, don't worry, they will be, and the game will play like it's some big dramatic reveal when it's been so obvious. The game is also rife with some of the worst tropes, like characters who are ""the hungry one,"" or women who can't cook and are thus a joke for some reason. On the gameplay side, my only big complaint is how awful the pacing is; you'll steamroll your enemies for 90% of the game up until a point, but then you make the mistake of taking a normal-difficulty case that has enemies you can hardly even touch. Oops! You should have picked that ""Ultra hard"" case where there's nothing but baby monsters to fight!

On the whole, in spite of my many hours sunk into the monster raising aspect of this game, it's really hard to recommend. I'd give it a ""maybe"" if I could, but it's really more bad than good; they just happen to get one part right, and the rest is middling at best.

Edit to note that Hacker's Memory is worse in most regard, especially the writing. The gameplay gets a couple of new mission types, which are nice on occasion, but don't really change the formula too much. The writing, though, is atrocious enough that I'd skip it unless you want to mash through way too much dialogue.",1676169488,1676170007,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However in Hackers Memory I felt a lot more shoe horned into saying things i wouldn't, You're forced to interact with characters and treat them nicely even though they are annoying as anything. Although i understand you're going through a story, however my point still stands.

I really loathe Erika, If i could choose to interact with her less and join Yu, I would have. 

Besides that highly recommend this game. 

Update at 140 hours upon finishing both games.

Right so theres no issues whatsoever with cybersleuth however hackers memory is where most of my issues lie. There was one incredibly dislikeable character in the original game but they went on a large character development arc thats reinforced in hackers memory. However in Hackers Memory the most unlikeable person Erika does not get better throughout the game, if you simp for tsunderes then you'll love her, however i wanted to pull the plug. You will understand if you played. The only two really likeable main characters was Chioste and Yu, they went on arcs which felt like fun rides however Erika was a rude, dislikeable person throughout and you was shoehorned into simping for her. BRUH. Then teasing you with saying ""I love you"" to who deserves it to only turn around and say haha nope not allowed, now back to making you simp for Erika. 

Besides that, plot. gameplay, aesthetic are 10/10

Characters minus Erika and Ryuji 10/10

I was a little nervous since I heard the battle system is similar to SMT and I've never played that type of game before and heard it can be complicated. Got this game on sale for $20. I've completed all the sidequests in both stories including the post game and extra hard dlc fights in cybersleuth. Just beat hackers memory and will do the post game later. Thinking about looking into more digimon games to try out and maybe look into the anime.

TLDR: I enjoyed the game but if you don't like referring to wikis, would like a challenge or prefer a deep and serious story, I would skip this one. If you like digimon, collecting monsters, teambuilding, a mostly light hearted story, have time and don't mind looking stuff up often. I would give it a go when its on sale.

The turn based combat is pretty straightforward and easy to grasp. I played on normal and fights aren't that hard. The story is mostly comedic with plot. It's fairly entertaining if you don't think too hard about it. The story for cybersleuth does take a while to get serious. Kinda like pokemon in that nothing really happens until the end when all the evil team stuff happens except it keeps going and theres a lot more fluff. Exp is shared between your whole party which makes raising new team members fairly easy. The farm also provides xp, items and other stuff over time so you can work on low level stuff in the background to fill out the digipedia.

I think the story for hackers memory is more interesting and better paced with different sorts of gameplay and more different looking dungeons and areas. It also felt harder than cybersleuth. Hackers memory also added increased movement speed in dungeons which is very much appreciated when backtracking through dungeons for treasure. Hackers memory also makes sidequests more bearable in that most tend to warp you where you need to go instead of making you walk there. The sidequest stories were also a bit more interesting even if they are still one off. It was neat to see the characters in the main story show up from time to time. 

While cybersleuth is the mainstory, if you want to play only one storyline, I would honestly go with hackers memory, it has QOL like accelration and more game play variety compared to cybersleuth. The story is better too and while it will make references to the main game, its focused on your story. The only other reason I would play hackers memory first is because a few digimon are locked behind beating it and unless you want to do a third playthough to actually use them instead of just the postgame, do this one first so you can use them in cybersleuth. If you want to play both, I would do cybersleuth first since it is the main story and you might get depressed going through cybersleuth after hackers memory from how slow it feels in comparison at times.

The digimon models all look really nice and its great seeing them follow me around. Seeing them grow bigger and bigger beside me is fun and satisfying. Its kind of funny when they get a bit too big and block the screen at times. You can turn the follow function off in the settings if it annoys you. Each digimon has a unique cut scene that plays for their signature move which is a nice touch. 

The music is nice and there are some real bops but some themes like kowloon and the generic dungeon theme got really repetitvie so I turned the music off and listened to other stuff while playing the game until the end when some new themes happened that were far more interesting to listen to. The story is pretty much fully voice acted which is nice, I skip over them at times since I read fast but they can be fun to listen to when I read something interesting. being able to set the battle animations to short was also great for grinding and nice for certain long fights.

Stuff that annoyed me below:

My main gripes with the game are how poorly explained the abi stat is, the reliance on external sites to determine what to evolve my digimon, difficulty figuring out what to do sometimes and how the translation can be scuffed.

The abi or ability stat determines how many stats you can add to a digimon through training and food at the farm. More importantly, some digimon require high levels of it to digivolve. These requirements don't really become apparent until the stage right before the one you want. When researching what the starters evolved into, I wanted lilithmon but then found out I needed 80 abi to evolve her and realised I was going to have to digivolve between stages. this was really annoying since I had lilamon around lvl 40 and I was going to have relevel her up again when I got enough abi. My other digimon had similar problems but I had a few miracle meats and their abi requirements were lower. Since I understood abi in my second playthrough on hackers memory, I abi farmed and focused more on trying to get specific moves along the way. It was easier to assemble my team and I could focus on story progression and side quests sooner instead of doing late game grinding just to raise levels to farm abi. 

When you start out, all the faces of digimon are blacked out so you have no idea what they could evolve into and even when they do unlock, you don't know what they could evolve into from then on. I liked going on the wiki and grindasaur to decide which digimon I wanted on my team in the end and I enjoyed working towards them. But it is kind of annoying to have to go back and forth all the time to make sure I choose the right form.

The game would have been a lot easier if I knew where to go, at the start I would go all over kowloon to figure out where one thing was or leave the game and come back later to try and remember what I was doing. If there was at least a log or something that you could check from the menu that tells you which location to go, that would make it a lot easier. you can talk to kyoko or mirei but I would rather not have to go between them all the time. There were some parts when I still had to look up where I had to go for the story. 

The translation is pretty decent and I found it amusing and interesting most of the time. I am a simple person. But the solutions to a few puzzles in the game are just displayed wrong and I would have to look up the answers which was really annoying. If a puzzle seems a bit off, just look it up.

I'm happy to move on from this when I'm all done and I think it was a good experience overall. Its not perfect but I did have fun using my favourite digimon.",1675257851,1675259477,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

The visuals are astonishing, the music marvelous and the plot interesting (at least in Cyber Sleuth). As for the battle system, it's pretty fun and does have quite a depth, though not as much as Pokemon. Definitely one of the best games I've played!

A slight downside is the difficulty to form bonds with your Digimon comparing to Pokemon. After a certain point in the game it's possible to change a Digimon back and forward to any form you want. In the end you won't remember what that Digimon was in the first place. In addition to that, the fact that you can customize almost everything in a Digimon makes it feel even more like it is a tool instead of a ""partner"". In short: you can take any Digimon and easily turn it into anything you want, providing you have the resources which you will have near the end of the game.",1594298252,1675113366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

17 minutes until i got my first digimon
2 hours until the game fucking started

it was honestly offensive that i had to sit through two hours of boring ass bullshit story before the dungeon system actually began

not gonna lie, i rarely read the story anymore. it feels like a Japanese series with filler episodes half the time.

WITH THAT BEING SAID,

pretty fun gameplay loop. the idea of de-digivolving your pokemon is really cool; you're not really locked into your evolutions, so you get to try them all out.

aside from the (conviently) two hour wait to start the game, i do enjoy it.

they have some genius QOL things depending on your pokemon composition, namely these abilities such as ones like 'increase / reduce enemy encounters' - perfect for when you're grinding or avoiding battles; there's also a movespeed increase ability if you have the correct pokemon

anyway yeah it's fun, but you really need to understand you won't be playing this game for the first two hours

This double-pack of games is a very standard RPG compared to many other Digimon games, that requires you have no prior knowledge of the series to enjoy. Digimon Cyber Sleuth is very much the Persona of Digimon, taking a lot of aspects from that series and making them it's own, while keeping many of the fan favourite features such as the branching Digivolution tree that turns a small fluffy creature into a dinosaur laden with belts to mecha Jesus, with maybe the occasional poo monster in between. 

If you have ever been remotely curious about Digimon, pick it up and give it a go. I will say though that Hacker's Memory takes a lot of what the first game does and vastly improves on it, making it the better of the two games, but builds off enough of the first game's story, events and characters that you will be lost if you skipped the first half of this two parter game.

The only real negative I will give this game is that it is missing a lot of the quality of life stuff that Persona games are known for, most prominently the fast forward/skip cutscene options that are essential to multiple playthroughs. Thankfully modders have you covered on that one,  with Pherakki's brilliant ""Skip Dialogue Mod"" on Gamebanana.",1674068685,1674068834,True,1,0,0.417325764894485474,0,True,False,False

Sort of a shame though because this is still better than I had expected, but I think it would have been better with like 90% of the story/dialog removed and replaced with nothing. I would have been happier just doing mindless grinding, at least I'd gain XP.

Pros:
- Hacker's Memory main storyline has some good moments
- Lots of Digimon, and they generally look pretty cool

Cons:
- Literally everything in Cyber Sleuth is a waste of time. Lots of mandatory cases that are just hilarious fetch quests. I stopped reading the dialog almost entirely.
- While mashing through dialog, it's super easy to accidentally choice a response accidentally. Not 1 time did this ever feel like it actually mattered.
- Combat system is really boring
- Generally cumbersome to do anything. Oh, you want to equip a farm-enhancing item to someone on your farm, you have to go to the bank and move it from the farm to your team, then equip the item, then move it back. Oh, you have someone on your team that needs 5% more CAM? Have to move them to your farm, then feed them, then move them back.
- Domination Battles are terrible
- Maybe more pedantic, but I'm not playing this game to do human things. Oh wow I go to a restaurant then I get to watch a cutscene of us trying food (jk it's a black screen because they're not animating that).

The plot isn't interesting, the characters are bland, the environments are boring hallways, combat is middling and if you're hoping to complete the pokedex than gameplay is a grind and the grind is OBNOXIOUS!!! Even with the grind strats with 40x Exp, you'll be spending like 75% of your game time grinding for digimon that don't even feel unique in terms of gameplay and have extremely impotent attack animations. The game is also in dire need of SEVERAL quality of life changes, like how you can't look up the stat requirements for evolutions in your pokedex, forcing you to backtrack to the digilab and pull up the evolution menu there. An evolution genealogy to keep track of how I've evolved a digimon would be helpful too. And get rid of CAM. It's just there to force you to waste more of your time grinding. In conclusion, game's bad; don't buy.

-The difficulty is totally unbalanced, it's either way too easy or way too hard
-camera angles can really suck sometimes

Gotta say, I've played pokemon before but wasn't familiar with Digimon coming into this. It was actually pretty cool. I got about 2/3 through one of the games when the game ran into some kind of bug and didn't allow me to progress. It's annoying but also I'm not too sad.

I would not buy this even on sale; it's gameplay is serviceable at best but can be quite fun. However any investment i had in the story was crushed at the ending. it's a journey that is not worth going on in any way, and you cannot skip it. You will need to completel side-quests that do not in any way help the overall story and indeed only serve to harm it more.

Spoilers here.

See the biggest issue i have with the ending is that it basicly throws out everything the entire game was making it. Your Mentor was possed by a Digimon and thanks to the timeline being restructured doesn't remember you at all... which is fair because you're dead.

Your character dies and the version you play in the post game is a reconstruction of your past-self based on the memories of your digimon... and then in a moment that's supposed to be funny and sentimental it just... becomes openly problematic because you make the disgusting coffee that she used to make with you for her....

which, considering your character is a reconstruction and not the original (and there are supernatural elements in Digimon so they didn;t need to do this) this indirectly implies that these memories are faulty and considering your digimon interactions are only over the course of a few days... Yikes. 

And this is a minor problem honestly but it really hurts the games themes and story telling... not to mention making it so the game itself never happened which is always a bad sign. 

So look... play it ifyou want. get it on Sale if you want, but it's utlimately among the worst Digimon Stories i've played and i would not recommend it to anyone. I couldn't get a refund for it either and the game wasted my time for a story and i will never quite have complete trust in a Digimon Game.",1609449385,1672160268,False,2,1,0.451521813869476318,0,True,False,False

Pure fanservice with simple mechanics and methods to get through dungeons without spending hours like some games (*cough* Dawn/Dusk *cough*), a method to devolve Digimon if you made a mistake with your choice (or to increase level cap), a clear indicator of whether your attacks are effective against the target, and you can eventually bring several Digimon with you!

Some criticism though:
- movement speed is inconsistent; in some places I feel like I can zoom around, in others I feel as slow as molasses, and from what I've noticed it might have something to do with how much stuff has to be processed in one area, so it's possible that it's my computer that's the reason
- there's no ""logbook"" for the story missions, only cases, which makes it difficult for me to remember what I'm supposed to do
- relating to the amount of Digimon I can carry, I start out with limited carrying capacity and finding the items to increase this takes a while, being limited to missions, battle and treasure chests
- relating to the above, the non-story missions/cases seem to be limited by the farm, which takes quite a while to do

All in all, I'd give it a 9/10: almost perfect, hopefully the next big game addresses these concerns",1672032591,1672032591,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story and Characters 4/5

All the main characters are fun and engaging and have there own growth throughout. The story is well written and could get emotional at times.
I will say a few side characters and mid-bosses like Date and Jimiken were bad and seemed to be intentionally annoying.

Gameplay 4/5

If you've played a Digimon Story game before like Dusk and Dawn then you more or know what to expect. Make your way through maze like dungeons and scan Digimon to make a copy after you get to at least 100%.
The game is on the easier side and you shouldn't need to grind much if at all.

Graphics 3/5

The graphics are really a mixed bag. Of the main characters, the protagonist is well designed for both genders as are the Kamishiro siblings, Arata looks like a future demon lord which I think is on purpose, Nokia looks like her face was hit with a frying pan, and Kyoko looks more like a lady of the night than a detective.
As for the levels, most of them honestly feel samey.
I will however fully praise the Digimon themselves and their animations. I feel like a lot of work went into them.

- Easy to follow quest, I dont like too much searching and thinking for games, so it got me good!
- That Digimon Lists is great, I can even find and raise Dark Masters, Apocalymon, Royal Knights, Sin Digimons and Digimons I haven't seen before like Examon, Mastemon, Dracmon, etc. Its sooo many.

The games are a bit of a 50/50 mix between Persona and Pokemon. It’s a match made in heaven. 

I’m a massive Pokemon fan, and personally did not really enjoyed the latest ones, but discovered the Digimon games years ago and have found them filling the hole that the better Pokemon games of years gone used to occupy. Getting both versions included in the Complete Edition is a hell of a deal. They’re very very similar games, and there is a great deal more dialogue than Pokemon, but I love the games dearly.

Cybersleuth could arguably be considered the best Digimon game just because it does the simple jrpg formula so well and doesn’t try to experiment much like the earlier games. It’s even been called Persona 4 lite. 

Cyber Sleuth is one of the only bits of Japanese media to continuously make me physically laugh. Loved the characters and the story overall. That said, it did fall into the trap of repeating jokes a few too many times, and the characters interpersonal relationships could have been more in-depth.

Combat is pretty fun and while it's generally pretty easy there are some pretty cool fights in the endgame that force you to think and build a specific team.

I had a lot of fun filling out the field guide and seeing what all the Digimon evolved into. It always felt like a little mini loot box since I was unfamiliar with most of the Digimon added after like the 3rd season of the anime. 

It was easy to maintain a large team and being able to switch out on the fly without needing to grind or reduce your overall strength felt good and kept things fresh. I found the story pretty fun and interesting and a breath of fresh air compared to what you find in the Pokemon games.

The music composed by Masafumi Takada is also worth of note, it's really catchy. To be frank, I didn't notice the translation issues other users mentioned, but I am a non-native English speaker (and not really a proficient user of the language) so I am afraid I cannot spot weirdly translated dialogues. My only real complaint is that the game lacks environmental design and none of the digital areas really stand out. 

In general I have greatly enjoyed my playthrough of Cyber Sleuth and can definitely recommend it.

Besides the recently released Survive, these games manage to be some of the peak examples of how character writing in Digimon games can shine without depending on nostalgia. (Even if there's some hints of it, shout out to Nokia's Omnimon being all over the marketing). These games are also very accessible to players who are not already Digimon fans, but might be hard to get into if you aren't a fan of turn-based RPGs. Many of my friends who like Pokémon and Monster Hunter Stories have really enjoyed this game after being recommended it.

Thanks to being a ported PS Vita game, these games run well even on the most potato of laptops. The only issues I've had on both my PC and laptop is some frame drops while in larger spots of Kowloon, but disabling following Digimon often helps the slow down. There will be some moments that you notice low resolution textures on the environments due to the hardware limitations these games were originally developed on, but often this won't take a player out of the experience. The art direction of this game is fantastic, and a huge breath of fresh air compared to past Digimon titles all taking place around File Island and similar locations.

Like any good monster collection RPG, Digimon makes use of a basic Rock < Paper < Scissors system that's easy to understand but hard to master. There's many difference status ailments, special moves and types that makes some battles pretty difficult. There's also a pretty complicated farming system to raise specific stats in Digimon, but after you figure it out it becomes very easy to buff up your monsters however you'd like. Evolution is not linear, and the game has a whopping 341 unique Digimon to pick and choose from. My only complaint is that too much of this roster is dependent on the past television series (You will find all the main digimon from Adventure, Tamers and Savers), but there is some really obscure Digimon that've managed to wiggle their way into the field guide!

Overall, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is a 2-in-1 dialogue heavy RPG that anyone can dig their teeth into. Whether you're a Digimon fan or someone looking to collect some cute 'n cool monsters, you'll enjoy this experience (as long as you enjoy the characters, haha). Though I will say, if you don't like turnbased RPGs? Maybe try a different game.

I've bought Digimon Survive and wanted to knock this thing out before touching that, but it drags on for hour after hour, a forced death march through poorly translated garbage dialogue where Japan is portrayed as populated by 70% schoolgirls where 10% of those are catgirls carrying baskets. The GAME part of the game is token. You get to fight disgustingly easy 'battles' with your ultimate digimon vs baby/rookie levels for a few minutes at a time between vomited textdumps that go on for a half hour at a time and will leave you feeling exhausted. The digimon farm system feels vaguely like that Sonic DX Chao farm shit that sought to mimic Pokémon's popularity.

Let me make it clear that this is my warning to future devs of Digimon games. I've bought Survive and intend to play it only because I want to encourage the waning Digimon franchise to continue to produce, but I have little hope of it being any better than this dreck and I won't buy Digimon games past that anymore if I find the next one doesn't prioritize the GAME aspect of the GAME I bought because it's a GAME.

Digimon World 1 was the only game that ever did it right, in spite of it's terrible translation and infestations of bugs. Digimon World 2 and Digimon World 2003 moved @ 66% the speed they should have. I know because I experimented by speeding it's animations up once and gravity moved at the correct pace and the action actually felt dramatic, not like dragging through treacle. Digimon World 2003 is the single most padded out drag of a grind I've ever played in any game ever, and I've been gaming hard for over a quarter of a century and once rubbed my face off of every wall in three continents in an MMORPG as part of getting an achievement (and I got 30 such achievements in that grindfest of a game). I mean, you complete a game that's blisteringly grindy and then they palette swap the entire fucking map and tell you ""good now do it again"". I developed depression trying to finish that fucking carrot on a stick nonsense.

In a Digimon game, the ability to train specific stats should be MANDATORY. The ability for your Digimon to die or digivolve a painfully wrong way is MANDATORY. This railroaded shit where you grind to level monodirectionally and your stats are determined by what the Digimon is detracts from the personal experience you get of customizing your own goodboy. The story should exist to enrich the playground you've entered, not become a dominating factor that all else is sacrificed for. If I walked into a carnival and there were no rides but it was the nicest decorated carnival I'd ever seen I wouldn't fucking care how well painted the hobby horses are or how nice your shitty ferns are, it wouldn't be FUN.

Digimon World 1 was an adventure filled with consequence where you fell in love with a little guy knowing he'd die soon and all the big choices in his life were in your hands. This shithouse feels like some fanfiction writer was like 'Oh boy! Finally, I can shove all my doggerel down a captive audience's throat and they HAVE to look at it because it's bundled with the franchise of all their favourite characters from their childhoods!' And so we wind up playing as a garishly dressed stock mute generic anime boy/girl in a world that gets really weird about women. Seriously, it reads like it's been written by some aging neckbeard that's only learned about women through harem manga. Don't get me wrong, it's charming to see the franchise grow up with it's audience, but that'd only be quaint if it didn't feel like giving a child an off brand lego set that he can only play with for five minutes at a time between reading a few chapters of The Dead Sea Scrolls. This shit needs an editor with a flamethrower and the devs of Digimon games need to learn to respect what made their fans love Digimon to begin with: not verbose go-nowhere fetchquest filled visual novel bollocks that drags on a thousand years, but the love of DIGIMON. You know, DIGIMON? Those little buddies that we want to form interactive bonds with who share in our adventure with us? I mean, if I wanted something that I can collect like bloody stamps and will level up linearly to max level with enough grind and have no actual consequence attached to them, give me ONE damn reason I shouldn't play Pokémon instead?

Bottom line is, fix your mechanics. I don't come to a Digimon game to read about your s00per Kule OC that can walk around in computers and has a shock of untamed hair, red like the fires of Hell. I'd go to Deviantart if that was my priority and I'd had all my shots recently.",1665533611,1665533611,False,3,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

+ Colorful cast of likable characters (you need to like animes ofc XD)
+ A Bazillion digimons to collect, evolve, train and fight with
+ Simple but enjoyable JRPG battle system based on Digimon Types and Elements
+ As far as property based on a kids cartoon goes, the story is quite well written and quite full of mistery
+ A lot of value for money, you basically get two games for one and both clocking around 60 hours

Cons:
- Some Sidequest are just lazy (find an item for a digimon with the chance that such item spanwed 3 mt from it)
- As for all JRPGs a lot of grinding is requied to have the most powerful Digimons primed and trained to become gods
- Dungeon maps might be seen as confusing the deeper in the game you go
- Sometimes the game does not do a good job directing the player to the next story bit

I've never watched the Digimon show, i purchased this game while watching a dear friend of mine playing it and boy oh boy am i glad i did, the turn based combat is fun and addicting although it might be seen as a bit easy difficulty wise, the story is incredibly interesting and it almost feels you are playing an entire season of a very good anime show, if you get the patience for some hardcore grinding you will be rewarded with GOD level digimons that will make you feel utterly unstoppable :P

This isn't to say that those things are mandatory, but grinding needs to be more rewarding than just money and experience.  It's not as though Digimon use much equipment, so all you can buy with your money are upgrades to the digimon farm islands and consumables.  Additionally, the ABI stat which increases pitifully slowly demands that you will be leveling *and releveling* your Digimon, as well as Digimon's penchant for having you level from level 1 every time you change forms.

Note 2: Holy karp it's been too long since I last played a Turn-based Digimon game, my last one was Digimon World Dawn on the DS.
Note 3: So far I've only completed Cyber Sleuth on normal difficulty, Clocking at 55 hours and 3 minutes in-game time and completing the [spoiler]Seven Demon Lords Challenge[/spoiler] under prepared.

[h1]So What's this Game About?[/h1]
Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is a Creature Collector Turn-Based JRPG that takes you through a journey alongside creatures from another world called Digimon, unknown to us up until we breached through their world in an experiment to create a VR-based internet paradise known as EDEN. After a fateful encounter with these creatures, sinister things starts to unfold and only you and the Digimon you befriended can piece the puzzle.

[h1]What do you like about this game?[/h1]
- [b]A largely Non-linear evolution route:[/b] Most creature collector games with evolutions tend to have linear evolution lines (For example, you can't evolve your Dragonair to a Gyarados), even Digimon World Dawn's digivolution was pretty linear. In this Digimon game, you can Digivolve your Digimon into things that are [i]completely[/i] non-canon. You can have your Patamon digivolve to ExVeemon or your Silphymon into Varodurumon. This way you can keep a wider variety of inherited moves as well as access Digimon easier.
- [b]The soundtrack:[/b] The soundtrack is phenomenal and really fits the detective theme of the game. Though if you know the composer, it's easy to see why...
- [b]Boss Digimon/Entities have new mechanics:[/b] When you fight a boss, they won't simply be what you see in the ""wild"" with higher level, their HP would be completely altered to achieve boss status and some would even have custom actions that gives you a new layer of challenge. Sure the normal story stuff has nothing insane in terms of these mechanics, but boy oh boy the [spoiler]Seven Demon Lords challenge[/spoiler] is a nightmare for those unprepared.
- [b]Some of the sidequests are just social commentary:[/b] This is a YMMV thing though.
- [b]Some of the cutscenes are outright animated:[/b] This is just. Yes.
- [b]If you're familiar with Digimon like me, you can possibly get your Favorite Mega Level Digimon before ending the game:[/b] Don't be intimidated by the requirements to get some fan favorites like Beelzemon or Imperialdramon Paladin Mode, by the end of the game I feel like I could get Lucemon Satan Mode alongside those two if I wanted.


[h1]What could have been better?[/h1]
- [b]The Story itself:[/b] Okay, to be fair I enjoyed the story but it's a bit on the YMMV side of things, especially since I know a fair bit of Digimon having watched Digimon Adventure briefly and most of Savers. Hacker's Memory's story is better though, fleshing out each of the characters in it.
- [b]Translation:[/b] The dialogue translation conveys enough of the original message (I think), but the quest hint translation is so bad, I'd even say Digimon World Dawn did better, but to be fair this game was originally made in the period where Digimon stopped being localized in English... iirc.
- [b]Balance:[/b] Either the game is not that hard or beating [Spoiler]the Seven Demon Lords[/spoiler] before advancing the main game made the rest of the last Chapter a breeze. Someone please confirm.
- [b]Missing Digimon[/b]: ""You can get Dianamon, but where is Apollomon?"" are among some of the thoughts I have after checking the full field guide online post-game. I get that some like Chibomon were cut out to keep Digivolution lines simple but I sort of wished to see more obscure Digimon like Aegisdramon or previous exclusives like Chronomon, VictoryGreymon or Grimmon.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I love this game, even with its flaws and especially flawed translation. However, seeing as this game is old, I'd say waiting for a sale is wise. Also, Finish Cyber Sleuth first so that Hacker's Memory makes sense.",1609834896,1664278495,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

I mean, it's no Persona or anything like that but it sure scratches that jrpg itch. As with this genre, characters and the story are on the forefront so you get that sense of true friendship (tm) when you reach the end and this was no exception.

That said, it's a little more rough and less refined than most modern (jrpg) games or maybe I just got spoiled by Persona 4/5. The gameloop is satisfying, if a little slow and tedious at times, but the detective cases provide a nice distraction from the main story. Too bad it's mostly just running around and talking/fighting to and with other digimon but it gets your mind off of the plotline for a while. Would've liked to see a bit more variety in there but what are you gonna do.

The battle system and digital environments that you must explore and fight in are the weakest point of this game if you ask me. The real world looks interesting and has enough architecture to be recognizable and eye-catching (just be aware that the graphics are kind of like a ps3 era game), but the digital world (especially early areas) are rather bland and overly simple. It's also too bad the soundtrack is not quite as expansive, so you'll have to learn to live with a bit limited selection of tunes while you go about your tasks in the game.

Sadly, the only difficulty this game knows is buffing the cronk out of your enemies so it's a massive spongefest the more you progress. Sure, it makes picking your digimon by type important but it doesn't really reach the depth that it's trying to go for with its (triple) rock-paper-scissors battle system. If you have at least some sense of how to setup and manage (and adapt) your team of digimon you should be fine. Def-penetrating or raw HP%/DMG attacks are best used in these cases, unless you found a way to just be OP.

All in all it's still a very enjoyable game if you look past these issues. The pacing at least is well executed, provided you're willing to invest some time into completing those detective cases and leveling your digimon. If you do get stuck don't hesitate to look at a wiki or something, because this game isn't really meant to challenge you in any meaningful or fair way. Just use the right digimon for the right task and you're set to enjoy the simple but creative narrative this game has to offer. I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the characters have certainly made this a world to remember (and revisit I'm sure).

Regarding Hacker's Memory (edit):
Having (now) finished both stories, I gotta say it's a very nice addition. The grind is still a prominent part of the game so if you didn't like the main story you probably won't enjoy this much either. If you did, however, you will find Hacker's Memory a very interesting journey. Get ready to spend another 40+ hours on this game and I highly recommend you pull through and finish the story because that's what made it all worth doing.",1661293791,1663507090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there are some things that could be explained better (CAM, ABI, the farm, equipment...) but it's easily playable without those things, and they were all easy enough to look up online. lots of lovely quality of life features so even grinding(which i've done for completionist things rather than it being necessary) hasn't been painful. graphics are lovely (apart from the standard jrpg sexism) and i was able to get all my favorite digimon pretty early on without too much fuss.

JUST MAKE SURE YOU TURN THE VOLUME DOWN TO 10%. volume is WAY high for some reason and can only be controlled once in-game, the menu is ALWAYS loud even after you've changed settings in a save, so turn it down in your task bar.

and i do recommend using a controller. it technically has keyboard support but it's pretty awful.

I really hope future Digimon Story games are like this, with a wide selection of Digimon and many evolution paths.

I'm not much of an RPG player (the only other RPG I played was Pokemon), so I can't comment on how well the systems are in comparison to other RPGs, but I am certainly more than satisfied. In Pokemon, I found myself ignoring lots of content like Battle Frontiers and whatnot. But here, I engaged with every part of the game. Everything has a purpose that can help you through the game and improves your experience.

The game looks nice, every Digimon has its own 1 or 2 special attacks, and the rest of the moveset is up to you (you can put literally any inherited move from any Digivolution). I wouldn't mind if they just reuse the assets to make the next one, as long as they add a few hundred more Digimon (lots missing, especially from Frontier onwards).

My main complaint is that the dialogue is too long and the story is convoluted, so I quickly started just mashing through the dialogue (I'm here for the Digimon). I missed most of the story. I still added it to my list of top favorite video games.
A minor complaint is that the only character customization is the T-shirt. I don't mind limited options, but I just didn't like how most T-shirts didn't go well with the pants.

Some things to note:
-Any Digimon can digivolve into any Digimon, given that you follow the evolution path and satisfy the required conditions.
-Digimon can have 6 moves that they use in battle, and 20 in total, which they can swap outside of battle.
-You don't need to grind as much to get the team you want if you get 3 PlatinumNumemons with 9 Tactician USBs (nets you 40 times the EXP) and full ABI. Look up YouTube videos on how to do that. You can get a Lvl 99 Mega from a baby in mere minutes.
-Piercing moves are the best attacks. Safety Guard is the best defensive option.
-ABI can be easily gained by (de)digivolving back and forth, and it's used the same way as EVs in Pokemon. You distribute them by training in the farm.
-There a few important MISSABLE things you need to look out for, and it's best if you look up GameFAQs guides on them. They are: Memory UPs (team capacity), Farm expansions and plug-ins, bank drive expansions (Digimon storage capacity), and Victory Uchida locations (gives you powerful items if you find him).
-Not to spoil much, but there are DLC (purple) cases near the end, where the bosses are extra strong. Much stronger than what is allowed for them if you had them. 2 of them in particular are unfair if you don't have a plan. So just keep that in mind.

- It's fun and nostaglic to collect your favourite Digimon
- Combat system is simple but enjoyable
- Conditioned me to say ""Moshi Moshi"" whenever the in-game phone rang
- The Visual Novel portions of the game were a nice break from the combat. As the combat is relatively simple it can get stale if you do it for too long. The same goes for the Visual Novel portion. So the Combat & Visual Novel aspects serve as a nice palate cleanser for one another.
- They did a great job of making you feel like you're participating in an anime world

Disliked:
- There are certain fights that are ""Supposed to lose"" but rather than having a cutscene the game has you play it out in combat. How this works is that you can do 0 damage to the enemy, meanwhile the enemy has regular stats. Which for me resulted in a fight where I was doing no damage to the boss, whilst the boss was doing absolutely no damage to my characters because I had overtrained them to the point of being broken. 
TL;DR the ""Supposed to Lose"" fights are a waste of time and should have just been a cutscene

- Over half of the boss fights have bosses that are just health sponges. As mentioned above I overtrained my team (My favourite Digimon are all ultimate and mega so I grinded really early in order to unlock them, putting me ahead of the difficulty curve) and even with being overpowered the bosses still took forever to die whilst they couldn't lay a finger on me.

Story: 8
Both games take place during the same timeline with Cyber Sleuth being the main story focusing on the overarching digimon story while Hackers Memory introduces and focuses on side characters during the Cyber Sleuth story.  I found both games to have entertaining stories and characters but both suffer from similar flaws. These games have very bloated segments with the story being on the back burner for too long and conversations lasting far past any reason. This can cause the first half of both games to have awkward and slow pacing that meanders and may ruin the story for some players. I still found the story and characters interesting overall but some more patience is required than should be needed at times. Now when these stories did occasionally have great moments that were worth it, at least for me. So the story is okay overall but needed to be trimmed down in some areas and pacing reworked a bit.

Graphics: 8
The graphics are okay nothing special. The digimon look nice at the very least and show a good amount of personality in their animations. Dungeons are all very basic and samey but they are short so I was never bothered by this since they never overstay their welcome.

Music/Sound: 8.5
The music was catchy and fitting of the games theme and style, while sound effects were decent in quality with nothing too annoying or feeling out of place.

Gameplay: 8.5
The gameplay is very straightforward turn-based combat that can be easy maybe too easy with random encounters but bosses and optional battles like in the Coliseum having a massive spike in comparison. This meant random encounters up until the late game were underwhelming but also allows you to use weaker digimon you may like as a result. As for the spikes honestly you just need to make sure pay attention to typing on your digimon and move sets.
Collecting digimon is where this game shines, its is incredibly addicting and easy to get into the rhythm of and I would argue is the main selling point here. Collecting, training and evolving digimon is so well tuned and accessible yet still requires a reasonable amount of effort that makes it more satisfying than most creature collectors out there.

Overall: 9 (not an average)
In the end I very much recommend and enjoyed Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition for what it does well and found its weak points while apparent never deterred from my enjoyment. The story and characters had their good moments, the game play was easy to pick up play and the music and graphics were well executed  for what they were. Note the translation could use work.

Edit after completing Cyber Sleuth, detective version:

It's alright lol.
I guess the thing that helps uplift it is the balance of the gameplay, for the vast majority of the fights and areas, I never really struggled or felt that my team wasn't strong enough, so props to the balance team for that.

I have 1 main critique, 2 minor critiques, and 1 praise (cause I have a conscience you know?)

main critique:

The worlds that the game takes place in just, and this may be due to nostalgia, aren't that awesome like the early Digimon World games.

I loved being in a place where its just mainly nature, where you'd expect Digimon to thrive and live in.
Forests, deserts, canyons, jungles, etc...
It felt like a true adventure, into places where you'd think a person's imagination would take them when thinking of some place epic world, not boring modern human era where you're constantly in an environment where you're used to, populated, realistic human cities, with their relatively less diverse range of technology, that in the early digimon games, had a more diverse range which shaped the way their cities looked from every other city.

minor critiques:

environment aesthetic I felt could be improved on
a few maps felt too long to travel from interest point to interest point, the subways for example, not sure it's needed to keep moving from area to area with nothing much changing that's interesting.
also, maps were you had to take gambles on and thus potentially waste time, like some if not all digimon dungeons and the office location, are a bit annoying and unneeded.

praise:

the battle part is pretty polished, camera constantly moving to keep it dynamic, interface was as good as I could see it, and the animations and models looked well done.",1659318400,1659746358,False,4,0,0.472383320331573486,0,True,False,False

As a huge Digimon fan I have to say I love this game. I originally played it on PS4 a couple weeks in a row, binging it hard until I completed it

Took me 69 hours and 44 minutes to beat the game and it was awesome. It has so many of the Digimon and the combat genuinely rocks. And yet my time does not count every side mission, it does not account for the second game (Hacker's Memory) included within

But even the brightest gem has its flaws
- The game is very text heavy. And while the story is awesome it has some of that lengthy anime writing. At least you don't go hungry when it comes to lore!
- Characters are clearly designed for a specific type of audience. A lot of female characters have clothing that can only be described as ""interesting"", further solidifying the franchise's focus on fan service. Meanwhile the males are left with full body suits in most cases. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't get borderline ridiculous at points
- This game is very anime. As in a lot of characters play into stereotypes and sometimes play it out almost forcefully. While the story, again, knocks my socks off some of the characters can be grating at times.
- The voices. Some humans and smaller Digimon have very grating voices. Bigger Digimon get to have the less ear-destroying voices. But my advice is to turn Digimon voices after combat off because otherwise grinding will get even more tedious

Despite the flaws the game is still incredibly fun. It has cool new non-Digimon enemies, a massive evolution tree, some incredibly hard battles, and a story that offers a deeper sense of purpose than other popular monster catching games. The visuals, while dull at times, can be absolutely stunning in some shots.

If you're not a Digimon fan your mileage may vary. Some people like it despite not knowing anything about the franchise, and others find no enjoyment. As for me I really couldn't put it down first playthrough

The final word of caution is that grinding helps in this game a lot. As in if you don't grind at all you will hit a Digimon-shaped wall fairly soon



TL;DR:
Wanna like game? Like Digimon
Battles are fun
Too much booba
Anime game is anime, big surprise
You must grind to win
Lots of monsters

Quality > Quantity. Pls Consider my review before buying this game.

Digimon Story Cybersleuth is a Digimon game that fails to recapture the magic and charm of the Digital World and every aspects of what makes Digimon special, Hacker's Memory is guilty of the same issue regardless of the QoL it offers you.

Lets start with the good part, Cybersleuth offer branching evolutions! Which is great! and a great thing to have in any Digimon game as it is what makes Digimon games Unique. The returning of Digifarm is also great making your Digimon in the farm to still progress while focusing on your main digimon in the field. Digimon animations are great as well, every digimon have their own unique move and animations which is a big plus!

Now with the bad part, immediately you notice how dragging the game pacing is, you are quickly thrown into lollygaggin your way to progress the story unlike the series predecessor including World 1, 2 and Story: Dusk and Dawn where they immediately put you into the action. First impressions are really bad, presentation are lackluster and the game is lacking any sort of charm due to its approach on generic user interface not going further beyond what Digimon aesthetics can be accomplished. Speaking of aesthetics, the map in this game or should I say hallway all look the same and generic coloured blue hallways. Nothing stands out making the place a chore to travel, adding in the fact that there are random encounters making traversal much more frustrating. Sure you can use NO ENCOUNTER skill but then whats the point of playing the game then? Soundtrack lacks the Digital World feel and charm, you cannot hear the song of this game and immediately recognize ""Oh its a Digimon Song"" Soundtrack are often a miss for my part as compared to Digimon Story DS, Dusk, Dawn and World titles the soundtrack always kept track of what makes Digimon soundtrack stands out. Digimon collecting in this game is so boring not because on how they are obtained but as to what their purpose is in the game, unlike in Digimon Story DS you can actually see what your Digimon do in the farm, interacting with the training sets you provided! Huge stepback tbh. Speaking of the farm, there are no ways to change how the farm look unlike in Dawn/Dusk or DS where dragon farm will have volcanoes and more lava, insect farm will have more greenery and etc. NO! this game only have one generic farm you just install whatever training set you have to make it look more decorated.

tldr;
Pros:
+ Branching Evolutions with Stat Requirement
+ DigiFarm is back!
+ Unique Digimon Animations

Cons:
- Hallway simulator where everywhere looks the same
- Presentation is awfully slow, game takes quite a long time to hook you to the fun part
- Random Encounters, its fucking 2015. Digimon World 1 solved this 15 years ago
- User Interface is bland and boring
- Soundtrack is soul-less and lacks the Digimon theme, no excuse as Story Dawn/Dusk and DS have it
- Digimon serve less purpose than weaponizing your team unlike their predecessor where they talk to you in the farm and ask you to play with them
- DigiFarm customization is so limited which the predecessor have more options

After seeing the release of Digimon Survive randomly one day, I thought ""huh I remember playing the old games back in the day, but there has never been any advertising for any new games and its sad to see this series die out"" Boy, was I right AND wrong.

There was for sure a lack of advertising as I never would have found this game, if I had not done my research after seeing the new game hit the front page of Steam. I read a ton of reviews both online, and on steam and saw that the new game was more composed to be a visual novel (which I still enjoy a lot) but could not justify the full game price tag for just nostalgic reasons. So after a bit of searching around I found a suggestion leading to this game, and being the curious person I am I started looking into it. 

Again, with serious doubts of paying the price for nostalgia it was a hard choice, but to my surprise this game was on sale for almost 75% off ! and with it being recommended heavily over the new game, I couldn't resist as I am a hardcore pokemon player and this fit right up my alley. 

Needless to say, 30 hours in at the time of writing this, and I am absolutely addicted. This has passed the nostalgic value and has reached a point that I can see myself aiming to 100% this collection of both games, got me interested in going back to the anime as well but since its still aimed heavily towards kids as opposed to this game.

A while ago, I decided to download this game and give a try, and before I knew it, I had +200 hours in it. That’s when I decided to buy the real thing and support the developers.
This review might be a little biased because of the nostalgia factor, but there are a few things we all can agree with: 

[list]
[*] Pretty much every Digimon ever is in this game, with its digievolutions and everything. You can train them, equip them and add them to your team. If that isn’t enough reason to buy the game, I don’t know what it is. 
[*] Every Digimon has a custom animation for the main attack and another one for the special attack, both visually appealing and loyal to the source media. The attention to detail in the models is fastidious, to the point to when a Digimon gets hit with the “dot” effect, each one has its own miniature to use while still in the fight. 
[*] Getting the Digimon you want is easy, getting its maximum potential is not, which rewards your patience and commitment with your digifriend. 
[*] The game has a story, it isn’t groundbreaking, but it’s there. Also, the dialogue sometimes feels cheesy. 
[*] Some of the scenarios feel “empty” and void of content, like the developers had to rush the game at the end of the development stage. 
[*] You get two stories of the events that take place in the main story, which represents the main game and a huge DLC already included in this version of the game.

I highly advise playing a different RPG if you can. Cyber Sleuth has the same Pokemon flaw that makes the games tedious- ALL you do is walk somewhere, fight a hard digimon, and repeat for 20 chapters. The leveling mechanic is interesting, but the content of the game is about as bland as you can get out. 
Things like a bad guy wanting ""power."" Nothing specific, just power. Or your friend who just ""knows things will work out."" Or the cyber missions that are LITERALLY just running to the same dungeon, finding a missing ""something"" (the game doesn't even try to call it something else) and run back to the entrance.
The plot is as generic as every other JRPG- comedically evil guy wants to do bad thing, wacky scientist with questionable intent, the hypersexualized teenagers, the whole gambit.

Both mainline and sidequest cases are so terrible, repetitive, and uninteresting. The writing is really REALLY bad most of the time. The game overall feels really cheap for whatever reason with copy pasted NPC animations and there only being like 13 total NPC models with generic, uninteresting NPC dialogue that adds nothing to the world or their personality. Everything feels really sterile and lame especially because even on hard the game feels really handholdy and easy. 

but man there's just something really special about this game. It's a nostalgia thing but not just because of digimon. Something about the cheap, archaic RPG elements of the story, the flat characters that have weird, random depth to them at times, and just the sheer amount of content takes me back to a time when things were more simple. Back when you got some weird japanese game as a kind that's such an oddity, but you play through it because it's the only game you have. For me it was custom robo which has the same writing problems of a world as deep as a puddle and characters that flat and outlandishly stupid. Making you do everything because you have MC powers. that game is one of my favorite games of all time and I have some amazing childhood memories in that game that I wouldn't trade for anything. I still remember the super badly written character's names by memory because I was unironically invested in the poorly written story. 

The digimon part of it is really cool, that you have to de-digivolve a couple times over the course of the game to get different moves and to increase the stats in certain ways to get the digimon form you want. The breeding mechanics are hilariously complex and deep to the point where I'm about to be at the first game and I still don't full understand them, mostly just brute forcing things to get the digimon I want. Most of my digimon are terrible due to my own monkey brain but I SOMEHOW have a Slayerdramon and Kuzuhamon that are so hilariously powerful that they solo the entire game. They mean a lot to me legitimately so the game has to be doing something right. 

The experience I've had is ridiculously flawed but I've had so much fun with it. It's really special. For a digimon fan it's a must get but for a new fan that knows next to nothing about digimon but enjoys monster collectors like pokemon I would still give it a try. on sale.",1657772446,1657772689,True,19,1,0.654284060001373291,0,True,False,False

It's nice being able to evolve and revert digimon at any given time you'd feel ready for them to do so, but having certain amount of on-screen combat and a friendship percentage be complete just takes away from the fun of completing the list of digimon and obtaining the ones you really enjoy.",1656264874,1656264874,False,1,0,0.368463486433029175,2,True,False,False

The smallest complaint I would have for this fun game would be that all Digimon in your party have been knocked-out, you instantly lose the game and have to reload a save, the game tries to mitigate this by making sure the enemies are at specific levels of power that is in line with the average players power but sometimes you might make a dumb mistake, the enemy might have a type advantage, or they have annoying strategies which means if you didn't account for the enemy being strong and saving right before, you'll have to regain all the time lost. In my case for losing a match was when I was in Post-Game fighting through some Abyss Floors only to have some annoying moveset boss take up 40 minutes of my time until I ran out of healing items and had to lose the fight, leading to 4 hours of gameplay lost.

- If you're not, but you like to play the game type of collecting monster and train them, then also a YES.
- If you're new to this type of game then prepare to spend most of the time in the game try to digivolve and de-digivolve your digimon many times if you want to play HARD mode or want to max out your digimon stats, get some strongest MEGA Digimion. Sometimes the grind of this circle evolve and de-evolve make the game kinda boring. But you can still clear the game in normal mode without grinding much, just choose about 5 digimons and focus on training them is enough. 
- Still, this system of digivolve and de-digivolve will give you many choices, ways to develope your digimon. This makes cyber sleuth is different from others digimon games before.

Game story is good but not excellent. 
- Side quest is OK except these green quest of finding digimon's lost things/finding bad hackers, it's kinda lame and boring. especially helping digimon find their lost precious things, they just repeat and repeat despite how many time you clear it.

I really enjoyed the way you raise digimon in this game - it's simple but encourages you to try out different combinations in your team while your constantly having to reset your digimon back to level 1 to make them stronger. Combat is very basic JRPG but effective, and with an autobattle option as well.

The story is pretty good and feels like your playing an anime. But it is stuffed with filler content and padding that goes on far too long without really adding much. And this game is already long as is. But when it does get going, it's decent.

The game also reuses a lot of assets - models, locations, even events. Which makes the padding even more annoying when you have to slog through it.

My biggest warning is to not play this game on hard like I did. It just adds a straight up buff to the enemies you fight that equates to you spending more time grinding so you can overcome that buff. Especially the last couple of bosses you fight, I really struggled hard, and didn't find it really added anything to the experience other than taking up even more of my time. (If you are deadset on doing hard mode, my advice is get a PlatinumSukamon as quickly as you can. Then make sure you get a Wisemon and as many ultimate / mega digimon as you can with defense penetrating attacks and speed buffs. Best of luck!!)

Combat plays out as simple turn based rock paper scissors type combat game using the typings vaccine, virus, data, all countering each other along with negligible elemental bonus'. The monster collection aspect is great as well, if a tad bit grindy. It even brings back the beloved digifarm of the world DS series. They even do an nostalgic encounter towards the end where we meet a protagonist from said game in the series. The characters fill out generic anime tropes, and have their charming moments.  Hackers memory in particular greatly builds on their cast, making their characters more alive. 

However the game has several, griping flaws that just get worse the farther in you get with it. Firstly is the cast of cyber sleuth, all of them suffer from the generic tropes. They are nothing new, and more importantly incredibly safe. The devs didn't want to take any risks here, but it left the their cast feeling uninspired. Theirs the Tsundere, the Edgelord, the Hot boss lady, and REAL MC. I'll leave it to my fellow players to decipher who's who. Our character in particular suffers a lot from their cast planning. From start there's a bit of a directional confusion because they allow you, the player, to decide on the characters name, but the character already has a inputted name, ""Takumi."" As we continue to play the game, we will notice that they had three methods of dialogue planned for ""Takumi"" however they weren't sure which one to use, so they used them all, which is as jarring as you'd expect. 

First of the ""dialogues"" are the unwritten protagonist jargon, where we will only understand what our says based on the reaction of the other parties involved, occasionally allowing us to pick between text options like a JRPG. Simple and sweet. But then we see that when he's alone, he actually speaks, using proper dialogue and somewhat breaking the fourth wall in order to talk to us and give us instructions. It gets worse though. During important cutscenes, it'll actually use the options text method, but rather than having 3 choices of dialogue, it'll just make one giant speech using the text options. Each of these methods on their own are fine, however because it will swap between all three methods during a single cutscene, it ruins immersion. 

The plot is another hit or miss, but this time it's due to poorly planned pacing, and likely time constraints. Not including hackers memory, the game narrative is essentially separated into two halves. The first half is just about being a detective, doing detective things, and then the second half without spoiling is about saving the world. The game doesn't transition between these two very well. And this is before getting into the side character plots which end up taking over the game, while at the same time giving us very little reason to feel attached.

Even though pleasant, their turn based gameplay also suffered from their risk fears. Which unfortunately leads to boring gameplay in the long term. All you need is 1 of each type, and then you spam your strongest abilities until they die. You can tell the dev's knew this as well because they actually inserted an autofight button. In hard mode it is somewhat more difficult, but all it really does it prolong the turns.

The general aesthetic of the game- the hacker and cyberspace stuff isn't quite what I look for, but it does not detract at all from the game itself. I used the digimon that I liked and had a lot of fun. I may not be the best at videogames, but being able to grow with my partners made me happy. I spent around 150 hours with this game in order to beat it. To me, it is perfectly challenging. I love the modelling for the digimon and their signature moves. There are a lot of things that I did not do because I felt like my time with the game was enough to enjoy it to the fullest extent. It's a lot of fun and brings me back to simpler times.

It's.. not. I don't know much about the other Digimon games, I haven't watched the animes outside of random Digivolution clips in like 15 years. There's no fun exploration of the Digital World, there's not much of anything to do in the real world. It sort of plays like a bad Persona game.

The game is packed to the gills with mediocre writing and low resolution graphics. The menus are clunky. The overworld is empty and unchanging. Cyberspace is largely the same, largely relying on random encounters to grind up all your various mons.

Battle animations are cool but concise, giving a nice amount of over-the-top RPG fashion without making battles unnecessarily long.

Although Digimon is a franchise from my youth, this game's story is far from childish and instead features an array of complex plots and interesting personalities. Topped off with a diverse range of zones, the player is immersed in a world that is relatable yet bizarre. And, while many modern 3D RPGs opt for a player controlled camera angle, this game's camera angle is fixed. As a result, zones are presented in a precise way, leading to both spectacular views and unique gameplay bits.

- Presentation and experience is bad. The game has a lot of dialogue but you can't control text speed. It takes almost a second for NPC dialogue to pop up and another second to close it.
- They only gave characters set amount of animations and expressions so some dialogue are awkward. This is extremely apparent with the MC when the dialogue calls for a neutral or a concern emotion but you see the MC with a dumb smile.
- Another contributing factor to the game's awkward dialogue is the amateur-quality translations. Side story and a couple of NPC texts are worded and read like machine translations. The only saving grace is that the main story dialogues are decent
- Boring environments, NPCs, and dungeon designs

PROS:
- 300+ Digimon available
- Great and intuitive experience for collecting and breeding Digimon. It scratches the completionist itch of wanting to get all digivolutions of a digimon. The only minor gripe for me is you're limited with the number of Digimons you can bring outside of storage. It's not a dealbreaker though since there are other ways to level your Digimon
- Combat is fun. There are layers and systems that will require you to think and plan out your moves especially on Hard difficulty. It's clear that it's inspired by the combat system of SMT

Overall: This game is recommended if:
- You're a big fan of Digimon
- This game is on sale
- You don't particularly care about story

Positives-A huge range of Digimon. It has MudFrigimon for god's sake. The battle system isn't anything new, but its still enjoyable. I don't care at all about story, but its still somewhat interesting. Lots of side stories that are pretty fun. Overall, a very basic but fun game that will probably give you 40-100 hours of playtime.

Negatives-ABI is such an incredibly bad system that it almost single handedly kills the game. It would take a while to describe in quickly, but it leads to way too much grinding. That 40-100 hours will probably have maybe 3-5 hours of grinding or more depending on what Digimon you want. Just...don't set the standards of your Digimon too high and the game will move by much faster. Another problem, unskippable cutscenes and dialogue. This game was made in 2018 or something, so that is unexcusable at this point. And there is absolutely NO post game to talk about. If you completed all of the cases during the story, you'll end up with some really lame fights and that's it. But if you're playing Hacker's Memory, then you'll get a new dungeon to explore, which will take up to a whole HOUR! Just one hour. There is no post game, alright?

And there is zero replayability. Because ABI is a really bad system, cutscenes are unskippable, and there is no branching paths. Once you've beaten this game once, which will take a while and will be enjoyable, you will probably never come back to this game.

Overall: 6.5 or 7/10. Good for a Digimon fan, good for a normal person with some time on their hands. No matter what though, basically any Pokemon game is better.

You are a half cyber being, waging war in a cyber world with cyber creatures as a cyber sleuth. You actively use DigiLINE instant messaging and you constantly get calls to communicate with your boss and friends. All these handy features and you can only accept and complete one quest at a time from a white board in the 'real' world. This makes zero sense and means you waste so much time traveling back and forth to your office. You'd imagine that using the digital world you've have an online message board you could pull up at any time to accept and clear missions. As you progress in the game eventually some stores will have a warp function item that immediately returns you to your office, but that this is even a mechanic in the first place is ridiculous.

DNA digivolution is poorly handled in this as well because the story line of the game breaks its own rules. When you DNA digivolve you're effectively sacrificing one of your digimon by feeding it to another. However Omnimon/Omegamon repeatedly digivolves/de-digivolves for another character without that restriction.  

As the story progressed my attitude towards the main character turned from ambivalence to actual hatred. There are multiple times where you should do ""something"" as events happen around you and you're effectively allowing them to happen.

Now, in terms of the game itself, there's digivolving which in this game is done by going up and down the possible digivolutions, there's combining monsters (DNA digivolving) but I didn't find it as useful here (it'll be a must if you want to fill your guide with all the available monsters), you can get attacks from each digivolution you go through, and each monster will have a specific attack that only it can perform. You'll need to digivolve a few times to be able to push your monsters to the highest level of digivolution. The story is pretty cool but some of the characters are annoying as hell. While using the main characters you'll be able to use some abilities specific to them, so you'll combine digimon and human skills to go through the game, with some skills having specific requirements as to what kind of digimonster you must have in your party. The fighting system works as usual, virus, vaccine and data digimon work like a kind of rock-paper-scissors system with added depth by taking into consideration if your digimon / attacks are fire, electriciy etc etc. which also works as an additional rock-paper-scissors system. There a bunch of side quests too (the boring kind though fetch this, fight that), so you'll be busy a while if you want to check all of them out.

The game can become as complex as you want. You can play through the game and beat it without going into digivolving and attack selection / combination in depth, or you can go crazy and look up guides and figure out ways of pushing your monsters to their highest potential, digivolving in ways that you have all of your favorite attacks in either all, or some of your monsters.

Digivolution is not explained very well in-game so I recommend looking up some guidelines online.

This is the most Pokemon-like Digimon game I’ve seen: You can raise any digimon you see and the pet sim elements have been removed to focus purely on battling. This makes it very easy to compare with Pokemon, which is useful because it does a number of things differently.

One: All battles are 3v3. This is good for obvious reasons and Pokemon really needs to get with the times at this point.

Two: A “combo” mechanic. Because multiple digimon can battle at once, there is a mechanic for them to boost each others’ abilities: If multiple allied digimon have adjacent turns in the turn order, there’s a random chance based on their “camaraderie” stat that they’ll boost the active digimon when it acts. The actual execution of this is very simple and kinda disappointing; there aren’t any cool combo techniques or anything, they just boost the power of your action a little bit. Still, it’s an interesting idea that, if expanded, could add a lot of personality to the mons. It reminds me a bit of the new “relationship” mechanic in Darkest Dungeon 2.

Three: Instead of catching individual digimon, you automatically scan enemy digimon at the start of battle, and after enough scans you can birth that species in your home base. One particularly interesting result of this is that you don’t even have to complete the fight; fleeing immediately will still get you the scan data, making it significantly less grindy than you may assume. This avoids all the random variation problems with Pokemon’s mons, though I know some people like those. It does mean it can be tedious to hunt for specific digimon because you have to encounter them not just once but many times, but the tangled web of digivolution trees as opposed to the set lines of Pokemon mitigates that problem.

Four: Party size limits are more complex. Though there is a hard upper limit of how many digimon you can hold at once, you can’t just fill it out immediately like you can in Pokemon. Instead, every digimon takes up a certain amount of memory, and you need to upgrade your protagonist’s RAM if you want more. Stronger digimon take up more memory, so you also can’t trivialize the game by powerleveling into advanced forms earlier than you’re supposed to. RAM upgrades are doled out over the course of the main quest, so your party size gradually increases over the course of the whole game instead of maxing out almost immediately and then staying there like in Pokemon. I think all of this is a very good idea.

Five: The aforementioned digivolution webs. If you’re not aware, Digimon’s evolution is way more complicated than Pokemon’s; instead of evolutions being unique, linear lines, digimon often have multiple different digimon that can evolve into them, making their evolution charts tangled, branching webs. I think this actually works well with the format (certainly much better than it did in Digimon World), because it encourages you to raise multiple instances of the same baby species so you can branch them into different evolutions. It creates a similar feeling to a class specialization tree in RPGs — though it would help if we had a better idea of what each evolution [i]did[/i] instead of them being mostly unknowns.

Of course, it wouldn’t be Digimon if they didn’t take this way too far. The total roster comes in at a whopping [b]341[/b], about twice that of the average Pokemon regional dex. This makes individual digimon struggle to find a unique identity, and they end up mostly interchangeable. The game would likely be better if the roster had been slashed in half; sometimes less is more.

Six: You can de-evolve digimon as well as evolve them. This has various gameplay benefits (raises their level/stat cap and keeps any learned skills), as well as making it easier to fill out the whole web by allowing you to explore multiple branches with the same digimon. While this is useful from a “gotta catch ’em all” perspective, it did make me much less attached to my digimon due to their lack of persistent identity. I can’t even remember where my original starter ended up. It would be nice if digimon recorded a record of their past digivolutions to help you keep track.

Seven: You can grind digimon into EXP to strengthen others. This hideously unethical practice is never commented upon in the story, even as you fight “evil” hackers who are “abusing” their digimon unlike you, the noble hero who everyone loves. It makes a lot of sense from a gameplay perspective, as the passive nature of digimon collection means you’re likely to accumulate lots of trash mons, but yikes. Save the horrorshow mechanics for grimdark series like Shin Megami Tensei, guys. Why have so many JRPGs seemingly abandoned the concept of thematic consistency between gameplay and story? (Once again, Yo-Kai Watch is the only mons franchise that seems to care about this…)

Unfortunately, Pokemon’s problem of most battles being won before they begin is still in full effect. The game has not one but two separate rock/paper/scissors systems, both of which stack, and extremely little diversity in abilities beyond elemental affinity, so there is little strategy beyond matching your digimon to your opponents’. All of the usual flaws of JRPGs — tedious, grindy, repetitive battles — are in full force. By the end I was just pretty sick of it all.

Despite the title, storywise the game is nothing to write home about. It’s decent but way too backloaded, to the point I think the dramatic change to the status quo in the second half is where the story should have started. The first half is just a lot of fetch quests and inane wheel-spinning as characters slowly piece together the shocking revelation that digimon exist and do things. Once the story [i]actually[/i] begins it has somewhat interesting things to say about how humans would react to the sudden appearance of mons (I was particularly amused by the tongue-in-cheek NPC dialogue about the world becoming like an RPG) as well as what digimon think of the human world, but since it’s a linear JRPG you don’t get to express any opinion on the topics raised. The plot actually feels like it would be a great setup for a Bioware-style “Your Choices Matter!” RPG, but you’re never allowed to really engage with it. Oh, and the villain wants to make the world a better place, but this is bad, because.

The text was also very rough, with a lot of typos and awkward phrasings I assume are over-literal translations. It had the quality I would expect from a one-man fan translation, not a professional localization.

Additionally, the protagonist is a bizarre combination of a silent protagonist and not. We have to listen to their inane internal narration constantly, but when it comes to audible dialogue they just do the thing where they make mouth movements into the camera and the other character summarizes for us. Why. Silent protagonists serve a specific purpose. Commit to it or don’t use them at all.

Also… I don’t normally complain about this but the graphics are awful, to the point I can’t believe it was made as recently as 2015. Camera angles are completely fixed, the protagonist’s movements look like a parody of deliberately awful retro animation, and battles do the Pokemon Stadium thing of only showing one actor on camera at a time instead of actually showing attacks connecting. Environments are also extremely samey and simplistic cyberspace backdrops, as opposed to the full biomes of [i]Digimon World[/i]. The whole thing looks like it was designed for the PS1, not the Vita. I don’t know how they screwed up this badly, especially when Re:Digitize looked fine despite coming out 3 years earlier on an older console.",1651677421,1651677421,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is filled with a bunch of anime junkies who want a tv show for digimon video-game gone into dog sh*t.

Then there's these weird things. They have someone mis-type/mis-phrase ALL these pointless dialogues instead of just get a few voice actors to read a script for literally a few hours. And they're still charging $50 for the core game. If you want to listen to your digimons ""cries+attacks"" you're gonna have to suffer with the japanese dialogue being loud as well since the voice volume is linked between the two. I have no idea if they're trying to make a ""South Park: The Stick of Truth"" game, but god this is like seeing sonic in the movie before he got remodeled.",1650799567,1650914668,False,0,0,0.397871285676956177,0,True,False,False

Nice soundtrack, voice acting, a storyline that involves a bit more than visiting gyms and talking about how its important to treat your digimon right and an underdeveloped scandal. Yes I am comparing this to pokemon. Has something of a persona vibe to it actually. 

Sometimes the combat difficulty will rise and fall absurdly and you will want to save and possibly read ahead on what to bring to a fight. Sometimes the translation makes me smh and its clear that a nationalist hornbag has written a great deal of the dialogue. You are kind of given the illusion of choice but you will be a goody two shoes really.

I remember playing Digimon tamers in PS2 from morning to morning and wish a similar game will appear again. Back then it was my mother who yelled at me, now its my girlfriend turn. 

Here is the hing to consider;
Pros:
- It is a quite long RPG game
- The graphic is beautiful (Especially Kyoko)
- You can go from OG digimon (Agumon and friends) to the latest.
- It is a complete edition which worth 2 games
- a lot of side quest
- separation between multiplayer battle and colloseum and story.
- it adopt the best things in the older Digimon tamers

Cons:
- The grinding might take a while to get the digimons you wanted ( it can go for weeks to months) and there is nothing to help you but yourself (No instant payment)
- ABI system is quite sucks since its depends on NRG when you digivolve
- Lack of character costumization
- It is hard to get the discount of this game

Pros:
- Less grindy by default, even less grindy with certain setups.
- The story is a lot more fleshed out, therefore it is a lot better.
- This game features many digimon that the aforementioned story games did not.

Cons:
- There are less digimon in total.
- Sunburst/Moonlight has better looking sprites.
- The map design is a lot less diverse and interesting since it is mostly cyberspace. While Sunburst/Moonlight take place in the digital world. Sunburst/Moonlight also have cyberspaces that look a lot like the ones in this game, but feature a lot of other unique areas.

I would be hardpressed to say whether Sunburst/Moonlight or Cybersleuth is better. However, in general this game has received slightly better reviews. Both are excellent, however this is likely the only viable game to play in 2022 anyhow.",1574793078,1647606085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Talking about this game itself instead of the whole series, I think Eden is one version of metaverse.

While I am a huge Digimon Fan/Nerd, even I agree this game isn't perfect.

CONS:
- Long story dialogue/cutscenes. 
Keep in mind, this is a story game so this should be expected, if you're someone who just wants to play then this game isn't really for you.
Or if you are someone who enjoys a story and doesn't mind long dialogue then this shouldn't be a problem for you.

- Unskipable cutscenes.
As mentioned before, the custscenes can be long and since they cannot be skipped, this takes away from it's replay value.

- Localisation?
Now I am not saying the translation in this game is horrible, hell. In a way, you could take this as a pro since some of the characters actually sound humorous.  But I'd say it depends on the person, really. But this shouldn't be a big issue anyway.

- Stats grind.
Unlike Pokemon where you just need a level to evolve, in Digimons you need specific stats, now some aren't too hard to obtain but one of them being ABI which you can only increase by evolving and devolving your digimon, this process can get a bit hectic. Now it's not too horrible since ABI is only required for the last level and plenty of digimons only require 20 ABI which isn't that hard to obtain but some digimons require 40, 80 or more.
Now this isn't a huge issue until late game I would say so don't worry too much about it, by the time you get to about chapter 10 or above, you could look up guides how to level up quicker.

- Objective.
Now this is a big issue I had a problem with, you don't get a marker on where to go and such. You have to pay attention to the dialogue during a cutscene or else you might end up lost. Even worse if you take a break for few days and come back forgetting where you need to go.

- Port.
Keep in mind, this game isn't a brand new title. This game was originally a ps vita game which then got ported to ps4, switch and PC.


Now is this a horrible game? Not entirely, despite the points I made, I still enjoyed this game quite a lot. I would say is, if you don't mind the points I made that much then I'm sure this game won't be an issue for you. Hell, the game is quite fun and unique, every digimon has their own unique animation: Being idle, doing an attack, skill, special move and even their victory screen.",1640630882,1645404037,True,20,0,0.702399551868438721,0,True,False,False

And even with 2 treadmills(item that increases Speed while in the  daycare; which costs 30,000 each btw) his speed at level 58 is only 151.

A game which got praised to heaven by magazines and players alike.

What is this game about?
You play as some clueless ""dense Shonen protagonist"" who tries to be a detective.
You get a boss who is shooing you around the whole game while she is sitting in a comfy chair.
... Oh, and there are digimon.



*The Good*

Special Moves:
Every digimon get's at least one unique move with a unique animation and voice.
My only complaint here, is that some generic physical moves really just should use the default attack animation, but instead use some casting animation.

Digimon variation:
Almost 300 digimon are available in this game.
They look pretty good and at least the few animations they get, look pretty fine.

Inherited Moves:
Up to 20 moves can be taught along all the evolutions a digimon acquired and switched between, out of combat.
Unfortunately the learned moves can only be removed if the limit is exceeded, not sorted in any way and if a digimon knows 2 special moves, 1 additional inherited move have to be forgotten.

Revisiting areas:
Earlier areas, which are only accessible for a single case or story segment, can be revisited via digilab.

Humor:
It has some. Of course not everything hits everyone's taste.
I think some of it just got lost in translation and some is just a Japanese thing...



*The Bad*

""But thou must!"" (Choices):
This game's story is mostly told via wide text boxes with a 3D presentation of the characters left and right, like a visual novel.
Occasionally the player get's to make a choice via a classic text selection. The only problem is: There is no choice.
At best it alters the following response marginally. At worst the player has only one line of text to choose from at all.
~""Ryota!""


The pace:
Cyber sleuth's story just won't set in motion for a very long time period.
The player is constantly either solving plot-mandatory cases (main quests) or doing some plot relevant actions, to drive the story forward - which are both effectively the same.
Plot-relevant cases often feel like optional sidequests with some rare mentions to the main story then and when.
Many cases have a really obvious outcome which could have solved in less than half of the time if the protagonist would have double the brains.

Digimon farm cases (Repeatble Sidequests):
Cyber Sleuth has a very small amount of unique, optional cases (sidequests), which are unlocked as the story goes on.
This could be a problem, if there weren't the option to research your own cases via digimon farm!
There is only one small problem: They are utterly boring and don't even try to hide the fact.
The player gets 2 types of cases: Defeat evil, evil hackers (The better of them) and find a MacGuffin for a random digimon in a random place.
The second one doesn't even try to give the item a name, or make up some background story. The random digimon seldom has some dialogues matching their digimon type.

Digimon over digiline aka ""Personalities"":
It's not as if Digimon World DS or Digimon World Dusk / Dawn was *much* better in this regard, but I will mention it even so.
No matter which kind, type or level of digimon the player happen to have on their farms, messages and responses the digimon will give via digiline
are generic, repeated infinite and most of the time sound like it came from a toddler. I know it's a trait of many Digi-destined / tamer
partner digimon even at higher levels.
But it becomes pretty uncanny when it comes from someone like Apocalymon or Machinedramon.
Some alternative responses for the player character to choose from would be nice as well ""But thou must!"".

Digiline mistranslations:
Now I don't know who translated the digiline, but I am pretty sure Botamon doesn't wear dual-shotguns.
Some of the reponses the player character gives via digiline just ... doesn't ... make ... sense (at least in my language).

Enforced teams:
Now and then there will be ""puzzles"" in the cyberspace, which can only be solved by using the player's ""hacking powers"".
The problem: Many of them require to have X amount of digimon of level Y in the team, a digimon of a certain type or no type at all.
Coupled with the limited capacity and the fact, you can't have extra digimon for exactly this task, you'll see Pokémon HMs return.
At least in some areas the digimon team can be changed.

Your digimon:
The game does its best to undermine the fact the player has digimon at all.
It just doesn't feel like it.
Quite often the player will see NPCs talking to their digimon, or their digimon even talk to the player / other NPCs.
The player's digimon isn't even seen in cutscenes and is never talked about. Not even some generic information is used at all (level, type...).
The player could have a plot relevant digimon (no spoilers here) in their team or an all-virus team and nobody cares.
In stark contrast to games like Pokémon, the player's mons are more device to continue the dull pre made story, than the centre of the name giver.

The level design:
There are no open spaces at all.
All ""dungeons"" are corridors and even city parts of the real world can have multiple sections, no matter how small.
The Eden levels are the worst. I get it: I am in a cyberspace.
But as it's just a visualization in the player's mind, how about having some variation?
I got to exactly one digital area which didn't look glitched or like a cyberspace - and that was a small corridor, leading to a cutscene.

""Hopeless Boss Fight""s:
In a grindy jrpg in which you can have L99 mega level digimon quite early, there is hardly something as annoying and frustrating, as getting bosses which take exactly ""0"" damage from all the players' attacks until the fight ends prematurely, declaring the player as the loser by the script.
This is until the situation resolves by doing something plot relevant or by some NPC digimon suddenly digivolves and come ""to the rescue"" so the player can one shot said boss with their digimon.
This happens countless times over the course of the story.
How about making it difficult but winnable, giving an alternate line and still continue as intended instead?

(Related to the above)
""Cutscene incompetence"" / ""Gameplay and Story Segregation""
Most of the time when things go south, the player character will just stand there, letting bad things happen (like someone I know in another game (an MMO)), staring menacingly or shocked (to obvious plot twists or things which were already explained 2 chapters ago).
And no matter how high the detective rank goes - The player character keeps being a useless moron and is treated like this.

The camera perspective:
All about it.


*Conclusion*
All in all it feels like a pseudo detective story about a cyberspace which happen to have digimon in it.
Even as quite the digimon fan I am, eventually I grew tired of playing the observer of a mediocre story until the game let me continue the fully separated digimon part.
If you are a digimon fan, and can overlook all the games' flaws or just turn your brain off, you may have quite some fun playing it.",1644461651,1644461912,False,6,1,0.479202747344970703,3,True,False,False

Most are minor and in my humble opinion are the consequences of a lower budget rather than dev work. I will list the pros and cons that are the most important in my opinion.
Pros:
- it's digimon, this one is self explanatory. If you have fond memories of the animation and like the franchise this one would be nearly enough to sell you on this game
- it's two games in one package. Yup when you buy the complete edition you get both Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's memory. So that's quite a bargain
- nice looking. Digimon look great and the enivronments are pretty (a bit bland maybe especially in Cyber Sleuth but Hackers memory tries to mix up the Eden portions a bit)
- traditional turn based battles with a rock paper scissors mechanic. Everyone gets their turn (determined be the speed stat) and you get a traditional, easy to understand but very fun battle mechanic

Cons
- translation problems. Mostly found in not the main dialogue but all the other fluff and misc stuff like instant messages from digimon, clients and friends. Some of them are a little iritating like choosing an option when they ask you how you feel about X only to get an answer that does not correspond to what you said. Other times it's mostly minor language differences
- attack animations. The main, flashy signature digimon attacks are quite cool looking but every other abilities are somehow lacking, especially when it comes to the damage effect (enemy digimon just takes a X coloured flash and flips on his back ). I think with a bigger budget (maybe next installment?) this would not be the case
- the grind. Ohhh it's grindy. If you don't like battling enemies over and over to unlock different digivolutions and/or fulfill a digivolution requirement (ABI) you will not like this. The grind can be mitigated somehow with a trick. You need to make a specific digimon that has a bonus to exp and give him to hold 3 copies of an item that gives the same bonus. If you stack 3 of those digimon with the same setup that will immensely lower the grind
- real time mechanics. I was not a fan of this. There is a sort of crafting/training mechanic for your digimon, but the catch is it takes real world time(up to 40 mins? IIRC). But it's not mandatory to do if you only want to finish the story.

All in all I had fun with this game (which dear reader I think is the most important thing to have whilst playing video games) and in the future I think I will replay it (you can unlock additional digimon after finishing).

This game is fine. First of all, I really like the more adult themes, but I guess Digimon always had a more serious plots in their stories when compared to Pokemon. I like how the monsters follow you at a close proximity and theres none of that ""this one is naturally slow"" bullshit and the battles are pretty cool and strategic. The rosters is even made up of some the the more iconic characters. I've saw tones of familiar faces.

This game reminds me a little of pokemon colosseum, not a bad thing. But, I've always thought digimon usually included some sense of it's Virtual-pet toy route, like digimon World, but the V-pet stuff isn't present here. 

I, however, do have some gripes with this game. The dialogue is very skippable. It's just tons and tons of words that is quite a slog to go through and follow through. Sometimes I find myself not paying attention at and getting lost because of it. I really don't care for the Persona-like style they went with (they've done it in a quite uncharming way). You'll spend most of the game inside this blocky-blue ""virtual"" area that isn't particularly exciting of a setting . Building teams can also take litteral hours to get the dream monster you want. Unlike pokemon, evolution is based on a tier tree. You can go backwards and forwards with evolution however, each evolution requires certain requirements. Some of these requirements will ask too much of you while others ask of you to repeatedly go back and forth on the evolution process and that gets both repetitive and time consuming.

The game comes with two stories, more or less two games in one, allowing you to transfer digimon between them when you beat the game. I beat them both on hard mode.

Cyber Sleuth on hard mode is an overall fun and worthwhile game to play. There's a ton of fun to be had in evolving your digimon throughout the story and watching them grow, the story is good if a bit ""anime"" and generic, but it has a little depth, enough to be worth it. The cast are likable with some great recurring gags and arcs.

The gameplay and digimon raising is solid. Every digimon has two types, each of which is super effective and weak to another in two independent but overlapping type systems. Evolving them involves evolving them and raising the right stats in order to get to your desired outcome, which can be a bit annoying when a digimon with low speed needs a lot of speed to evolve into your desired form, but it is rewarding when it finally can evolve it. It's almost like, diet SMT demons, or, if Dragon Quest Monsters and Pokemon had a weird but cool little brother. The combat is also similar to those three, mostly the first two.

Combat is based on a turn order, in which some attacks are ""faster"" than others. It is simple on the surface, but has depth, with each digimon having unique abilities and skills. Sadly, online is dead as a doornail so there isn't much chance to dig into this depth.

Which brings me to my other problem with combat that applies to both stories. 1: Skills that hit all enemies tend to be slower and weak, rendering most of them worthless. 2: By endgame any attack that does not pierce is worthless. 

Late game enemies will have so much defense that any attack that does not pierce will deal around 50, 100 from a strong attacker. A pierce skill can deal upwards of 400, which is the only viable way to attack in hardmode. While the first is mild the second means that unless you seek out such skills you will get walled to death in lategame boss fights.

However, normal mode exists and from my limited time with it, seemed quite easy.

Then there's Hacker's Memory.

Now the basic gameplay is the same so it's a strong foundation. The story is in the background of Cyber Sleuth and makes very clever use of this. Like Cyber Sleuth, it's solid all around with fun characters, a bit of depth but not much, and engaging plot.

And then around chapter 9, it all falls apart.

Not story wise but gameplay wise.

Many bosses in Hacker's Memory heal. Not heal like 200 when you're dealing 500 per turn, more like healing 500 when you're dealing 200 per turn, and even with pierce skills, you are usually getting outhealed. One boss in chapter 16 had a skill that would drain health, but it would charge before using it, so it would often be an insta kill and a full heal rolled into one. 

There are also many bosses that can kill you in one attack, but you can luckily carry backups, so you can recover.

However, so many bosses can outheal you by huge margins, and a couple near the end resist pierce. Which is, again, the sole way to deal any damage. This creates some of the most frustrating bosses I have ever faced in an RPG.

And I've beaten SMT 4, did the fiends (secret superbosses) too, so it's not that I'm THAT bad at JRGs, it's just actually horrible, boiling down to luck and praying they don't heal because it is neigh impossible, even with attack buffs, to out dps them.

What... happened? I can only assume something went horribly horribly wrong when balancing Hacker's Memory, and it doesn't help many of said bosses are walls of HP, and can heal more than you can deal on top of that.

My advice? Don't play Hacker's Memory on hard mode. It's genuinely awful.

Otherwise, this is a fantastic game to tide you over until the next Pokemon game comes out, and will entertain and engage you for countless hours. The characters are fun, plot engaging, (if poorly explained at some points, namely an antagonist in Hacker's memory which I still have no idea what it actually was or where it came from it felt like filler) the monster taming is satisfying, and the price is a steal for what is basically two great games.

 Hacker's Memory just has horrible horrible bosses.",1642056534,1642056534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anything related to digimon fighting is at least a 9/10.

But when people mention it is akin to anything in the Persona series, well... It was very obviously inspired by it, but the story portion of the game is incredibly lacking. I found myself skipping as much dialogue as possible. I would give the story a 1/10. It's a huge disappointment compared to any of the stories in the anime, witch was pretty shocking.

Ultimately, if you are looking for something to take your mind off work at the end of the day while listening to some new or all time favorite albums on your spotify/itunes/youtube in the background after removing most of the sound from the game, or to feel nostalgic about all the digimon you wanted to have growing up, I would recommend it.

The last Pokémon releases made me convert to Digimon and I think it's a better franchise in pretty much all respects.
I'm not sure if I want to ""repeat"" the Gameplay with Hacker's Memory since the EDEN network, where most of the action takes place is just so fkin ugly :D (actually everything besides the Digimon themselves looks bad, but who cares)",1641761895,1641761895,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I can kinda look past this since the main gameplay and Digimon part collecting is a lot of fun. The music is also top notch.

Graphics are good enough, environments decent but often kinda samey. The digital world is pretty much forgettable in this game since you do not really visit it directly. I was hoping to roam the digital world but it takes 99% only place in the real world and the digital EDEN network. Also the digital network dungeons almost all look the same.

It is obvious this game was low budget and they mostly tried to focus on the Digimon aspect itself, which is really well made and high quality. But everything around it, is just there somehow and kinda meh. Also if you are not into story and dialogue heavy JRPGs, skip this, I mean it. The story isn't bad but I wouldn't call it good either. It was good enough but some of these dialogues, especially side missions were just forgettable and some the stuff really odd to a westerner. I mean dancing maid catgirls? To each their own I guess. Not my cup of tea.

Kinda interesting they only show the good main Digimon parts and battles on the Steam store screenshots... Even they know the rest is kinda forgettable and doesn't appeal to westerners. Surprising to see it made the jump to the west at all. It doesn't even have English voice over.

You should also prepare for grinding sometimes such as leveling your Digimon but even just doing all sidequests and such feels like a grind at times. Just isn't that enjoyable to me. Make sure to look up guides to get faster XP or just use CheatEngine to bypass the grind. Surprisingly the playtime is really long with around 100 hours for both main games with all sidequests. But this also partly stems from the grinding and dialogue heavy stuff.

Another thing I noticed, is that that lore wisely, the Digimon names and levels aren't always accurate. Though there is a ""Undub"" mod which fixes that.

Altogether it is a okay game but I only played it for the Digimon itself. All the stuff around it was a bit meh at times. Music definitely stood positively out. I wish we would get a game more like Digimon World that focuses on the Digimon training, battling and collecting part and leaves all this weird visual novel Japan stuff away.

I guess I expected a Pokemon clone, having never seen a Digimon cartoon or played a Digimon game before.
But it was really very different in lots of ways. The Digimon themselves were great.

Plenty of the Digimon were really quite adult and dark in their design. Then there was this super cute dog with boxing gloves (Gaomon, I think). I just fell in love with that little guy

Assuming you've seen digimon before, through the tv show or a different game, I find it really hard to believe you won't enjoy this.

It has some type effectiveness stuff similiar to pokemon, but it dumbs it down pretty heavily with your targeting indicator changing color based on the move's effectiveness. The digivolution system, this game's counterpact to pokemon's evolution, allows you to evolve your digimon towards pretty much whatever looks cool, and a lot of them do. If you do end up buying and getting into it, I would suggest looking up guides on how to farm exp and items quickly, as the grind in this game isn't the most fun thing, and having to get some digimon to lvl 70+ for one evolution, evolving resets their level to 1, will become tedious pretty quickly.",1641288093,1641288093,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story is okay I guess nothing's particularly amazing. It's just that some cut scenes are WAY TOO LONG and even worse UNSKIPABLE. I don't like the occult club part of the story, as a side story I would understand, why is it in the main?

The grind in this game is not that bad thanks to some exploits. Without it, getting all the achievement would be hell. Of all 150+ hours i spent playing the game, 2/3 are spent on the achievements.

There's no marker for what you should do or where to go next. If you actually keep track of what being said during the cutscenes or wall of text, you should be fine. Well there technically a person you could go and talk to in case you are lost, But for me it's too tedious. In the end, I resort to using walkthrough.

Liked:
Collecting Digimon
Taking Cases/Grinding Cases
Battle System/Battling (when you can)

Disliked:
Story is a slog (but enjoyable), frequently you will be taking about 12 steps before a character interrupts you with dialog
Dialog is stilted and overly long (I started counting and characters often say the same thing three different ways, this may be played for comedy but it's annoying when I just want to get back in the game and do more stuff)
Battles are hard to find (you battle in dungeons but higher tier digimon are infrequent outside of cases which take you to some special places, or the arena which once you beat you're done)

My dislikes can be explained away as this being *that kind* of game (a pseudo VN like SMT I guess) and me just needing to get to New Game+ where the grinding gameplay loop is streamlined (I am on Chapter 7 atm) so I do not feel bad recommending this to someone who might be either drawn to the IP, the genre, or to monster-tamers in general.

My feelings are mixed. There are very positive sides and very negative sides. If you decide to play, i recommend playing with a gamepad. (Easier than keyboard in my opinion)

Positive sides:
- Collecting Digimon as much as you want. You can get almost every Digimon you saw in this game.
- Digimon Battle. You can bring many Digimons to battle but maximum 3 of them can fight. Switching Digimons in the battle is available. 
- Farming EXP for Digimons. Every Digimons in the party get same EXP after battle, even if some of them don't fight.

Negative sides:
- Main character can't talk. No voice, no text, just trying to say something with animation. Other characters are asking question to confirm what he/she said to make us understand. I don't care the reason why developers didn't add text for the main character, this is the biggest negative side and annoys me entire game.
- Running in real world. No Digimon battle so waste of time.
- Ridiculous MAIN quests (visiting restaurants to taste foods, helping a friend to get close to person he loves, buying coffee for the boss...). Some of them has no Digimon battle, just keep clicking button to read meaningless conversations. These are main quests so you can't move on until finish them. At least they could be side quests.

This is how i decide if the game is good or bad: Do i want to play again?... I am not sure. 
- Yes, because i want to try different Digivolutions and skill combinations. 
- No, because i don't want to waste my time with pointless conversations and running again.

I didn't recommend because of these negative sides. If they don't bother you or you can ignore them, i recommend for positive sides. I played Digimon World 3 (an old Playstation game) many times. This why i liked positive sides so much.",1639322782,1639477773,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels like discount GameCube title; the story is uninteresting and there's no stakes, and the characters all talk SO MUCH and none of it matters, or is often even unrelated. You even have dialogue options... with yourself. For no reason. And I WANT to explore the digital world, but I can't because I'm just slugging around back and forth on real-world fetch quests. It's like the developers forgot that the fun part is the digimon discovery management/battling; it feels like it's the secondary goal. 

Every story beat is: 
 - get told to go talk to someone
 - go talk to them (likely by wandering through the same empty spaces over and over)
 - get told to go talk to someone...
 - go talk to them... 
 - slog through a digi-cave with encounters with baby digimon 
 - fight a big digimon
 - repeat

There is no ""investigation"". You talk to someone, you get a ""key word"" (this doesn't matter, because you usually only have one at a time so it's unnecessary), and then you talk to another person about your keyword. That's it. 

Seems like there are going to be interesting skills to learn... but there aren't. There are leveled firewalls that you can't get by unless you're a high enough level. OK! That's good. Except I can't get by some of them because even though I'm the right level, there's an NPC there to stop me anyway, so it doesn't matter. Or you gain a hack skill to unlock documents. Cool. But it doesn't matter because the documents just start appearing after that point, one at a time. So it's not really a power, it's just a different type of NPC to go find and talk to. So there's no skills or anything, it's just more linear ways to push you through a boring story.  This is such a poorly designed game. 

And that's too bad, because it's really nice seeing all of these digimon rendered nicely in 3D with unique battle animations. It was clearly a lot of work. I WANT to explore these. I want to evolve them and fight them and see what they turn into. I want to see my old favourites. But I can't because I'm too busy doing fetch quests in the non-digital world. 

So like, am I going to keep playing this after 10 hours? Maybe? I want to grind up enough stats to see some old faves, so maybe. But don't pay money for this kind of crap, folks.",1639441548,1639441548,False,15,3,0.522287309169769287,0,True,False,False

I am a Digimon fan who has played nearly all of the Digimon games. Even though the story in most of those games are not really that great, I must say that this one really takes the cake. 

There were also various issues that ruined the experience for the one hour I played:


On booting the game

1. I was greeted with drawn out, boring and unskippable cutscenes (a google search revealed that all cutscenes were unskippable). They were so boring that I actually lost interest and didn't bother watching them. 

A revolting thought then came up - would I actually have to rewatch all of THAT if I replayed the game?

2. When renaming my character, the screen went totally WHITE with just the textbox for me to type my name (a glitch?). Sounds like a small issue, but a bug this early in the game? Not a good sign.


Audio

1. The music was too loud by default and masked the voice acting. After turning it down, the voices sounded like they were recorded with a bad mic. It was rather muffled and not pleasant to hear.


Graphics

1. One word - the anti-aliasing didn't really do much. Even after turning everything up to max, you can still clearly see the pixelation on character models. I did not expect this from a series with such a long track-record of games.


Controls

1. None of the text instructions were changed to suit PC players. They still tell me to ""press A"" or ""X"" but what they actually meant was ""enter"" and ""C"" on my keyboard. 

At this point, it became clear to me that little effort was put into porting this game to the PC.


Story

1. The story telling is bad - little to not effort was put into it. None of the dialogue had any impact on story-telling. The story was uneventful, and even the scenes which were supposed to involve ""danger"" were flat and lacked any tension. None of the characters were memorable, and they felt like they were just... there to dispense meaningless dialogue.

If anything, I would say the story was more of a ""filler"" to the actual gameplay.

Also, the moment I realised that I was looking out the window admiring the sky instead of paying attention to the story, was the moment I knew that I was deeply uninterested, and was wasting my time and money with this game. 

I received no joy whatsoever with the story, I would even say that this level of story-telling was insulting to Digimon as a franchise.


Gameplay

1. Battles felt mindless and grindy. Just press CTRL and your Digimon will auto-attack. Turn off battle animations and battles will go smoother. You can just win all battles in the first hour by doing this.

Even without doing those, NONE of your input in those battles matter at all. Its just ""attack"", the occasional ""skill"" in whatever order, and you win. Whichever way you pick, the enemy is still going to get a few hits on you regardless, you're going to pop a HP pill, and repeat the process. Your input doesn't matter.


Conclusion

For the above reasons, I felt that little to no love / effort was put into this game. Even if you are a Digimon fan, I don't think this will be a fun game for you.",1638021390,1638021390,False,1,0,0.448979586362838745,0,True,False,False

And then that's it, the rest is trash. The MC, it seemed they couldn't decide between a silent protagonist and one that sometimes talked. In this case, options are useless because they always lead to the same outcome, the changes to the characters face as they react to different situations are a joke. The rest of the cast is childish, so unless your target audience is 10 years old, the game won't hold and even 10 years old would cringe at this.
The dungeons are the same, the story, at least, as far as I went on, led nowhere and there was absolutely no rhyme or reason; and if the story picks up after 10 chapters out of 20, then that's a terrible story.
The combat mechanics are terrible, you can be a champion digimon and trainee ones will still survive your attacks somehow; and opponent's rely on an insenly amount of defense to survive instead of actual mechanics. Hard is just doubling the defence instead of doing something more interesting.
The fact that I took 22 hours to uninstall this game says a lot about my dedication to wasting my time rather than the game itself. Buy it only if it's at 99% discount and you have absolutely no interest in a decent story, characters, dungeons or games in general.

Pros:
- A lot of Digimon to choose from (some of my favorite Digimon are not in the game, but still great selection of Digimon)
- Best storyline for Digimon Story game to date (especially Hacker's Memory)
- Simple yet fascinating turn based battle
- Great graphics and soundtracks
- Can change difficulty in game between Normal and Hard mode.

Cons:
- I don't mind too much since I am not native English speaker, but if this game has English VA options, it will be much better. 
- a little difficult to find opponents in Online Colosseum, and NPCs are ridiculously strong for the applied battle rules.
- Difficulty difference in Normal and Hard mode is way too steep. Normal is very easy that you can almost one shot every opponent, while in hard mode, you will need to grind a lot, and yes, I mean, a lot.

In a time where Digimon, while still alive and with a big fandom, isn't quite as popular as it was, it's great and surprising that the new games are every bit as good and high quality as their predecessors. Cyber Sleuth and Cyber Sleuth: Hacker's Memory manage to both live up to the original RPG games like Digimon World 3, or any of the Story games on the Nintendo DS, while at the same time delivering a fresh and reinvented Digimon story. A story that still reaches the classic old familiar concept of Digimon with the world we are used to but through a pretty thrilling new narrative, filled with subversion. 

At first it might seem completely new and unusual. The way Digimon are portrayed as simple hacking tools, the way the entire game seemingly takes place in a visually unappealing VR social space, but not all is at it seems here. And what the game slowly reveals is legitimately well-written and surprising. 

Through a huge amount of side and main missions as (in the first game) a Cyber Detective and (in the second game) a hacker, you'll slowly unravel a really damn good plot, full of twists and turns, likable characters, and actual emotional impact. This is one of the best stories I've ever seen in a JRPG, especially in the second game. 

These are two games, and it's not just the story that's good. The gameplay is very satisfying as far as these JRPGs go. You'll have quite a bit of control and strategy with the tools you are given. Creating a team of three (main) Digimon from a huge list, playing into their strengths with the different types, certain types are stronger against certain types, like in Pokemon, except here there are two of these, an attribute and a type, so basically double Pokemon. You'll want a balanced team with the right attributes and types, and pick the right 4 moves of theirs to have. However, that's it. Overall, while the gameplay is entirely adequate, and can be quite fun, it's not all that complex. You'll generally have 1 move on every Digimon you spam, until you run out of it, and then settle for a 2nd move. Attack the enemy with the Digimon it is weak to, and that's about it. In a tough battle all you really have to do is decide who to use items on and when, which makes it more complex, but is the only instance in which it is so. 

Lastly, you have the actual Digimon factor. For a fan this will be huge. How many Digimons, are they the right ones, are they well designed. And the answer to all of those is yes, except for the first one where the answer is a lot. I can generally say that your favorite is likely here, your 2nd favorite too, and your favorites weird re-colored version is here too. Those are kinda the issues, they have just a few too many random little re-colors and obscure Digimon that they end up missing out on just a couple of popularish ones. But nothing major. Also every Digimon that is the game has great animations, and best of all, a beautiful ""main"" move with a unique animation just for them, really showing your personalization in every team during combat. 

Overall, this game just gets everything right. If you're a Digimon fan, you've already bought it for the Digimon. If you're not yet a Digimon game and just randomly checking the game out, absolutely get it! The story is something that needs to be experienced, and the gameplay will be enough to easily carry you through it.",1571870442,1635534958,True,14,1,0.599940717220306396,0,True,False,False

Normally I wouldn't make a review of a game before finishing it. Normally. But this game, I had to talk about. I do plan on finishing at least the Cyber-Sleuth half of the game, and I'll update my review if my experience for it changes. 
Let me start off by saying, I love Digimon. Always have. I love it to the point that I get excited any time a new game is announced for the series, including the upcoming Digimon: Survive. I've also played a large majority of games in the series, including obscure ones like Battle Spirit, Rumble Arena, the TCG game on PS1 as well as even the kart racer on GBA.
I've been streaming this game for my friend for my entire ten hour experience thus far. I've been looking forward to starting this game, having good memories of some of the other Digimon RPG titles. At this point? We're just trudging through the game.
My main problem is, this game is trying to be something like Persona. A game that's split with Digimon dungeon crawling, and a story with numerous characters and a main character with their own personal life. While the Digimon dungeon crawling is fine enough, it's the story, characters and 'personal life' aspects that really drag this game down for me. None of the story is engaging, and all of the characters are caricatures with very strange quirks. None of the characters in this game feel like they could ever be real people in a functioning society, and there's so many moments that try to be funny or silly, but just come across as cringe, creepy or in many cases, sexualized really awkwardly. Not all games have great stories or characters, but when you make your game 30% Digimon dungeon crawler, and 70% story based, the 70% better be interesting.
But so far? It's really not. In only the first ten hours, I can think of at least three major plot threads that have been started, and completely abandoned. That's not even talking about plot threads that have just been introduced that seem to have no ties to the other plot points. I know what you're thinking. ""You haven't even beaten the game yet, they'll show up again!"". When you bring up an interesting concept, and then just drop it for the next eight plus hours of game, like it's not even happening? That's frustrating. [spoiler] My main character's psyche has detached from their body, which is comatose and on life support in a guarded floor of a hospital. Why are we over ten hours in, and trying to fix an air conditioner? [/spoiler]
On top of these story pieces being boring, they drag and drag for a long time.
And the Persona like, 'Personal life' portion I said earlier? You have a device called the DigiLine. It's basically a messenger that you can use to receive messages from Digimon or other characters during the adventure. You can sometimes reply to these, but they're all arbitrary and have no effect on the game. I feel like this is only here to remind you that other characters are still in the game, even though you haven't seen them much in the main story. 
Just tonight when I was streaming, I started the game off with nearly an hour of straight character dialogue and cutscene. I then got to dungeon crawl for five minutes before being hit with another half hour of character rambling. How is this supposed to be fun? What's worse is so far, the Digimon and the story are usually separate. Yes, they are part of the story so far. But so rarely are they actually brought up, it begins to feel more like the developers tried to make a story based game, and then tacked Digimon onto it because they remembered that property exists.
Let me say now, my favorite Digimon game is Digimon World DS. The story wasn't a compelling, dark narrative with huge twists and turns. But it didn't need to be. It supplemented the gameplay well enough, while staying interesting enough to keep me interested. The story related portions were usually with Digimon characters rather than humans, so Digimon always felt like a major part of the game rather than a separate piece.
As for the gameplay portion? I do enjoy it, but I wont say it's the best of the Digimon series. Again, that goes to Digimon World DS. Though a lot of the mechanics in this game are similar to that one. Both games are turn based with a turn clock based on Digimon speed, and the ability to have backup Digimon. Both allow you to get new Digimon via scanning, have a Digi farm, etc. Though Digimon World DS feels far more fleshed out. There is more strategy involved in Digimon World DS, down to the placement of your Digimon in your party. The turn based battlefields are made up of five horizontal slots. If you have a Digimon in the far left of the five slots, but there was an opponent on the far right, you may not even be able to hit him.
The Digi Farm was also more personal. You could interact with Digimon on the farm, get them training on equipment, and just do more with them than you can in Cyber Sleuth. Combat in Digimon World DS was also far less convoluted than in this game, even though it arguably gave you more options and strategy to work with.
Lastly, I wanted to mention the game's visual quality. This game was released initially on the PS Vita, and PS4. But it honestly just looks like they took the PS Vita textures and models, and upscaled some of them. A lot of the textures and modelling look like absolute garbage, being mostly noticeable on non essential NPC characters. Important things like main characters, and the Digimon themselves look pretty good. With a little bit of looking though, you can definitely see where corners were cut.
I'm going to play through the rest of this game. But so far, I'm incredibly disappointed, and don't see that changing yet. But even if it does, it's hard to justify it when the first ten hours of your game is a tedious test of your mental endurance. Go get a Nintendo DS, or download Drastic, and play Digimon World DS instead. You can thank me later.",1633250073,1635248870,False,1,0,0.453466564416885376,0,True,False,False

I know reviews are subjective, but holy crap, I expected this game to be nothing short of a masterpiece, based on the reviews. I'm led now to believe the reviews are based primarily on nostalgia over the IP, of which I had none. I've never played a Digimon game, never seen a Digimon TV show... only know that it was ""similar"" to Pokemon. I bought the game hoping it would be like Pokemon, but a bit harder.
Unfortunately, this game left me quite bored. In fact, at least 1/3 of my played time was AFK, letting my Digifarm work for me.
The combat is very basic, which is not necessarily bad, but it is also incredibly easy.
The animations are absolutely terrible; like a gen 1/2 Pokemon game, but in 3D... Your Digimon never interact, in any way, with the opponent's, and most of the spell effects are horrible (or nonexistent). 
I like the character models of all the Digimon, but the entire evolution system is a convoluted mess. I assumed it would be more like every other monster-collector, where you get a baby, he grows up into a big boy. In this game, essentially every Digimon is an amorphous blob that can become anything and everything in the game, which makes ""capturing"" new Digimon pointless.
I also can't develop any attachment to the Digimon themselves, because of the aforementioned evolution system.

Your MC doesnt so much as say a single word for 99% of the game with crappy nod and headshakes as their main interaction value.
Hacker's memory has been purposely displayed as if it has two roles to play, where you are once again saddled up with Male-Only gameplay, Erika shouldn't so much as be on its display, 
The whole investigation board can be chopped up in 3 pieces, Story Neccesary,  Kinda funny, and frankly quests that have absolutely no value for fun or neccesity, and have just as little thought put into them as well.
And let's not even touch the r@pey looking squid monsters and as low as possible immersive value, battles are put on pokémon mechanics with larger teams on the field at once.
Grinding is definitely made to be part of the game, only so you cant play through it fluently.
There is as little interaction as you can possibly have between you and your digimon. You cant get to know them, and the most effort put into them is their models only. 
Battle is either slow or skips over everything you'd actually be able to appreciate if only for nostalgic value, speed up will cut out a good 90% of it.
Overall i dont dislike the game so ill still reccommend it.
But lets not even touch how r@pey, the monster Yukino became looked, nothing about that was remotely tolerable. And it took unneccesarily long to defeat it (Gee, i wonder why), That! I definitely didnt appreciate nor enjoy and speaks volumes about the creators. The fact she wasnt thoroughly scarred by the experience just feels like lazy writing on top of it, and if you got that far, you know EXACTLY what im talking about. 
After that point it was frankly just hard to play it at all and especially enjoy it, i kept being terrified that Yukino would bring it up. And would either turn out to have been oblivious to the physical abuse, which didnt seem to be the case, or would share what it felt like. But that occurrance is definitely not ""friendly"" for the labelled PG. Id be iffy on showing that to an Adult. A 12 year old would be screwed up by it, in a rainbow variety of ways.
There is also an abundant unnecessary amount of cutscenes you cant skip, making replay value low at best, especially if you have no problem remembering the funny moments, but even then you're still mostly stuck with visual novel level interaction. Giving your MC a name even seems like a forced effort, as it really adds nothing and they already have names in the first place, if it came with a level of appearance customization it would make sense, but it doesnt.

Honestly this game is hit or miss to people, but for general people who wants newer TURN BASE digimon games i would recommend this.

For me it's a miss. (I wasnt hoping anything since its Bamco and their 3D games mostly a bit clunky)
Reason:
No ingame confirmation button change form A to B (thank god we have Steam button configuration)
No fast forward for battles (attacks animations are so slow and boring, nothing fancy)
Story delivery is very very slow and cant fast forward the text, cant even skip dialogue/cutscreen
The maps have many invisible walls and a bit small (can we please have something like World 2003 for the maps)
No XEvolution eg Wargreymon X (Heck even Data Squad had them in it)
Digimon voicelines are annoying so I had to turn them off

Probably the best story among Digimon games, with a story more comparable to the anime in quality, with easy-to-like characters too. I found the side quests to be especially interesting and relatable in their dive into internet culture and the people who spend so much of their life involved with the internet, though it also had some questionable ones.
Admittedly, the game is very text heavy.

COMBAT 7/10
While the system is perfectly acceptable, it isn't nearly as refined as Pokemon's own. Still, it's unlikely you will tire of it before finishing the game. Managing three v three battles and the unique way the game handles stat boosts and type match ups takes a while to master. In particular using the BUG Status effect can be very fun. I ran the game on HARD and found the difficulty to be perfect, actually a challenge, but I did have to grind once.

OTHER GAMEPLAY 8/10
The evolution system is unique if not convoluted at times, but luckily not too hard if you care about collecting them all or at least your favorites. There is a nice variety to choose from. Unfortunately the only tutorial on using the Digifarm properly and digivolving the way you should is midway through Hacker's Memory so you're better off just looking things up.
The pacing is great for finding new digimon and reaching new forms just as you were getting bored of what you had. 
Environments and puzzles aren't always stellar, and there is a lot of walking around. A good amount of treasures for your troubles though.

GRAPHICS 8/10
Each Digimon has it's own animation for a special attack in addition to one for physical attacks and one for special. Some cut scenes are rendered very well, and the character designs are almost all unique and likable.

SOUND 7/10
I wouldn't take my word too strongly as I pay less attention to this, but the voice acting (when present) and music never annoyed me and always seemed to fit the mood well. I like the style of the music too.

OVERALL 8/10
Likely the best Digimon game, and a game I loved. I'm happy the people who made this game obviously cared about it and Digimon enough to really let its positive aspects shine.",1632469124,1632469124,True,19,0,0.712399005889892578,0,True,False,False

The worst part about this game is the very boring story, especially since you have to progress it to be able to capture more digimon and to be able to evolve them, you are also forced to do allot of uninteresting side quest to progress the story since if you don't complete a certain amount per chapter you can't progress. Allot of the characters capture certain stereotypes and they hardly ever go outside these stereotypes, especially the protagonist since he/she's a mute that only does sign language making their personality as uninteresting as a plank. There is allot of dialogue in this game and by no surprise its boring and you can't hold down a skip button or key to completely skip it, you have to manually skip every text. I personally didn't find the humor funny, since its pretty similar to the humor in the Pokemon cartoon series, which is mostly aimed at children. One thing that tends to be brought up by the story is some fictional technology that most people don't really care about (which it just boils down to digimon being brought from the cyberspace to their world and explaining how hacking works, but the main issue is that it has to explain allot of stuff in detail).

The puzzles are just bland, you have one ""puzzle"" where you have to help some dude out that's blocking your way by fighting girls to help him know if girls find a guy that has strong digimon attractive, you also have another ""puzzle"" where you just go from one platform to another pressing buttons so other platforms appear, you repeat this twenty times btw.

The areas where you explore and where you fight digimon are also very bland, they mostly have one certain color as a background with white or black cubes streaming down it, with platforms meant to slow you down and block your path instead of trying to entertain the player when their traversing through it.

The music isn't memorable but at least it's kinda good, its pretty similar to Danganronpa. Voice acting was pretty much the same as the music.

The difficulty was either mostly too easy or sometimes there was a difficulty spike.

Conclusion: If you want to play this game only for the digimon then you might enjoy it, but if your expecting a good story, characters, puzzles and/or an actual fun challenging game then I don't recommend it.",1631206637,1631206637,False,14,0,0.509538471698760986,0,True,False,False

This game could have killed Pokemon for sure. The monster taming gameplay and battle mechanics are that good. I can't recommend this game to anyone who isn't either a hardcore digimon fan, a monster taming junkie, or both. There's just too much baggage attached to what makes the game good for the average player.

This game talks WAY too much, and I'm a RPG gamer first and foremost. It doesn't just talk, it says a lot of nothing, and I mean NOTHING. I felt my brain slowly dying as I questioned what was the point of any of the rubbish these people were talking about. An example is, a fictional enemy in-game would remind your boss of an actual real life historical figure, and she would break convo to give you a full mini novel lesson in everything about this person, and it doesn't matter for any reason. I'm not talking 3 or even 5 walls of text, oh no lmao, you can be there for a good 15 to 20 mins just reading mindless drivel (even if you're a fast reader) that has nothing to do with anything, and the translations are pretty rough so a lot of things are just awkward.

It's a shame because the story is actually good, but it's heavily diluted and mixed in with a junkyard's worth of crap. I just beat part 1, and after 23 hours I just started pressing through every dialogue while only glancing at what mattered, and still got the entire plot. I must say, the digimon aspect itself was great but if this is what I have waiting for me in hacker's memory just to raise more digimon, I'm genuinely afraid to boot it.",1630715089,1630715089,False,3,0,0.47579425573348999,0,True,False,False

[h3]Cyber Sleuth[/h3]

Play the game in the perspective of a hero. Don't want to spoil much but basically your soul is separated from your body because of neuralink-like thing and you want to go back and got involved with various stuff in the process. Gameplay reminds me of Digimon World 2 on PS1 but miles better. Collecting Digimon is much more forgiving than Pokemon as you can Digivolve and De-Digivolve to collect them all. 

Can be grindy but they laid out all the stuff for you to lessen the burden (hint: use all Tactician USBs you got). Tamer and bosses can be annoying since they know how to counter abnormal status like sleep etc so you need some tactic against them. Haven't tried Online Colosseum as I'm getting FE Fates network battle (modder infested) but idk, never tried it. Localization seems okay, maybe there are some translatoin error but hardly noticeable. Story is pretty good with its plot twist.

[h3]Hacker's Memories[/h3]

Play the game in the perspective of complete bystander. You don't know anything but you do know what happen eventually. The second game is quite tough, not to mention you don't get bunch of useful equipments even though you've done multiple quest to get those items. Tactician USBs are hard to find so grinding is tedious, so get a Supervisor (hint: not an item) and boost those Tactician USBs. 

Localization took a downhill here from spelling mistakes, missing punctuation as well as forgetting who is your Cyber Sleuth counterpart. Maybe one day I could take a look and fix it. So far Export/Free Gate is kinda broken as it takes you back to lv. 1 in Under Kowloon but works normally in regular Kowloon. Still, the story is pretty great, dare to say it's better than the main one though it has less episodes

[h2]The port[/h2]

I'd say this is an actual port of the Vita game, as in compiling the game source as x86 executable seeing some textures are a bit blurry and how well the game runs on integrated graphics with OpenGL renderer. It's 5GB for 2 games so no complains, not to mention this game runs flawlessly on Vega 8 2500U on battery. No kidding, this game is easy on igp that my Vega 8 2500U sits at 400MHz shader clock as well as 400MHz memory clock. Not sure how well this is on previous intel IGP, but I can assure those who have GPD Win 3 and AYA Neo would be able to run this game easily, though AMD users need to aware that AMD OpenGL driver sucks so you'll probably need Linux if the game struggles 

[h2]Quirks[/h2]

The game might start as 720p windowed on first time launch. You need to start a new game either one and before the game starts, you'll be presented the settings. It sure is strange but at least the next time you can change it easily. Under Steam Proton, you need to disable Steam Input so that gamepad is usable. Should be no problem under Windows though. For some reason my overlay is gone but achievement are still being tracked

[h2]Some Linux tricks[/h2]

For AMD users, given this is OpenGL, running the game under Linux would be worthy although even in Windows it seems pretty good. Props to the porting team for splendid OpenGL performance. For advanced users, you can run this game with zink for that Vulkan goodness with MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink. be sure to grab zink-wip though as mesa hasn't received the latest zink commits. For some reason DXVK_HUD is not present so use GALLIUM_HUD instead

[h2]FInal Thoughts[/h2]

Is the game worth it? If you're skeptical, wait for sale. To me it's worth it for turn-based single player game. Combined with its low resource and performant on igp, I'd say this game is Steam Deck must-have. This is a pretty underrated game from PSVita. I'm glad it's ported to multiplatform as well as PC. Replayability is great  though I'm going to take a rest after grinding 200 hours to complete the entire game.

With 10X the unskippable bullshit dialogue.

This game reads more like a visual novel than a Digimon game.

The hours I have spent in, thus far (at least 6), has been skipping through dialogue boxes as, at this point, I could care less, and just want to play the game. I still have yet to be through more than 10 miniscule battles, and that was only because I HAD to grind early areas to cure my boredom.

Do not pay full price for this game. The start is enough to turn off anyone who wants to play a game. If you want a movie or visual novel, you can probably do better.

The main game screen will say it's from 2019, that's a lie. This game was made in 2016 for the PS Vita and it shows. It's actually a good port.

[h1]The Good:[/h1]

- Interesting story for a digimon game.
- An evolution and training system that will look simple at first, but then hit you in the gut if you're not careful. (it's a mix between Pokemon and Final Fantasy Job system, the digimon can be evolved and devolved, but they retain the skills they learn).
- Logical paper-rock-scissor mechanic in THREE different levels
- Nice character animations.
- Not that much grinding, especially if you know what you're doing (hint for newbies, look for the combo tactical usb + specific digimon and you can get a whole group at level 99 with VERY few battles)
- Not one, but TWO games in a bundle, with nearly all DLC and several nuisances removed (you won't need to beat all the game to unlock the knights)
- You can switch between Normal and Hard difficulties at any time without detriment to the game. There aren't any achievements related to difficulty.
- Really good music.
- The Hacker's Memory Sequel/interquel improves several aspects of the original with new modes and transformations.
- If you get lost in the game, you can ask for the digilab woman for help, or your boss.
- You can fight online pvp and gain points to give hats to your digimon.
-This game was made as a stand-alone, so if you're new to the series or missed some of the seasons, you won't lose much.
- The digimon data entry allows you to see a lot about your digimon, including skills that they will learn and the stats they will get at specific levels. This is REALLY handy considering that some evolutions will need help from training in the farms.

[h1]The Bad:[/h1]

- The game shows that it's a port: There aren't many locations to explore fully, they get repetitive fast, sadly.
- Since its a port, you need to manually save. Not really a problem unless you forget about it.
- The translation gets downright awful at certain spots, luckily minor (messages received, one or two side-dialogue options, two digimon names).
- The difficulty of the game isn't well balanced. On normal it's easy, on hard you'll NEED to grind and make an optimized squad. The DLC tosses some curveballs through puzzle-bosses that come out of nowhere.
- The game doesn't explain well some of its resources and needs, such as ABI and how it really affects your digimon.
- [spoiler] The story of both games kinda take a hit in the middle and don't recover much from there. More on the first game. Not enough to be bad, but doesn't even scratch the potential. [/spoiler]
- You'll either hate or love some characters, no in between.
- It's easy to get lost, and some parts of the game require pixel hunting for spots that aren't properly signalled (for example finding a restaurant in a mall, you'll have to grind your character's nose on the walls and keep hitting the buttons or waiting for a sign to pop up). Or suddenly they require a nonsensical back-and-forth (you need to find someone who will talk something to you about a quest... but you have to go back to your base and then accept the quest)
- Online pvp is basically dead. If you want to give your digimon hats, you'll have to fight a cheating A.I.
- This can be a completionist's nightmare, since you'll have to find 700 scattered medals, and 90% are in gacha machines.

[h1]The TLDR:[/h1]
It's quite worth it, especially in a sale. You'll end up scratching your head at some points and sadly finding a guide may become a necessity. But out of all the digimon games, this one has the simplest and most straightforward evolution system (which, as someone who played the Digimon World in Playstation, I can tell you it's [b]a VAST improvement[/b]) the premise is interesting, some points are surprisingly deep and/or serious, and see your squad become a force to be reckoned with and steamroll a cheating computer is really good.",1629090455,1629090695,True,14,1,0.61945033073425293,0,True,False,False

Although the game clearly was made with a budget, it still features some good soundtracks and the occasional animated cutscene which do a good job of hyping up Digimon like you would see in the anime. The battle system is simple but works well in this sort of game. If I had to compare the gameplay in and out of battle to any other game I would say the Persona series is a decent comparison.

The main pain points for me here were a messy UI and menus, clearly incorrect translations for some of the (less important) messages, some very annoying characters, a confusing levelling system and sometimes the game feels a bit repetitive in terms of case (quest) structure. I feel a lot of the game could have been trimmed to make for a shorter but more focused overall experience, especially since there are some story arcs that are not interesting at all in my opinion.

The plot is good? No, it isn't. After one hour playing it I started skiping every single dialog. Really, nothing here is worth mentioning.

The gameplay is good? Well is a collection type of game, where you will find enjoyment in getting your favorite digimons, which might take a while. The missions are very boring and the battle system is so bad that it's a autoplay feature, that you will, almost always, be using. If you want to collect all your favorite digimons this will become pretty much a semi iddle game. The system of advantages and weakenesses in battle is also very boring and has almost no depth.

So, do I think it is worth it? Yes, I found enjoyment and I don't regret investing the time I invested on it, so I will gave a positive rating, but... I really don't think I would play this game at all if it hasn't the Digimon IP.
In the last few days I realized that it's about time to hold those games from gigantic franchises, published by gigantic publishers for the standarts of what they are producing.
Indie games sometimes have poor plot, or poorly designed game mechanics, or unpolished visuals, but they often bring something new to the table. Maybe a new IP, maybe a new mechanics, maybe new visual styles. 
Games like Digimon Cyber Sleuth are playing as safe as they can, while their publisher hold exclusivity over an IP that's pretty much the only thing driving a lot of people to play this mediocre game.

I would not blame anybody for indulging in this kind of game, but I don't think it's worth being bought outside a sale.",1628465435,1628465435,True,1,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

You have the 1st story Cyber Sleuth and the 2nd story Hacker's Memory. Chronologically, they run concurrent to one another BUT you are expected to start with brain-numbingly dull Cyber Sleuth, and progress into the actual game Hacker's Memory.

In Hacker's Memory, theres a lot of reused assets (and call-backs) that references Cyber Sleuth. It's a little fan service-y and kinda lazy BUT by piggybacking off Cyber Sleuth, the devs actually managed to allocate their resources into developing an actually interesting plot and cast. They even managed to develop some of the characters from part 1. Very cool.

Thus, Hacker's Memory is definitely the superior game, yet it can only be truly enjoyed after you slog through the Cyber Sleuth. Think of Cyber Sleuth as on overly long prologue tutorial, rather than an actual enjoyable experience.

Pros+
1. Alot of Ultra and Mega Digimon included (Sure to cure some nostalgia)

2. Some battles get tactical near the end, digimons have support skills, and their main skills require planning.

3. Story on Cybersleuth isn't that bad, light hearted, with some surprises. But generally, feels like a copy of any digmon anime to a game. Some may like it, I am alright with it, though I felt it could have done with more creativity.

Cons
1. Dialogue is unmemorable

2. Directions in the game can be very lacking, and you can struggle to figure out what to do next, until you finally figure out that Mirei will remind you if you talk to her.  The lack of in-game diary really hurts the game. This is a modern game, not a Ps1 or Ps2 game. A diary is totally basic for any RPG. Which brings us to the next point.

3. Too many modern conveniences are missing. This is a 2016 game i think? There should be things like speed up combat (though thankfully there is auto combat, so that I can at least look away from the game during an otherwise slow animated and boring turn based combat). Atelier series is in the same time era, and they already had 2x speed on turn based combat on all games, because turn based combat is slow and boring. There is also no fast travel other than home teleport and dungeon instant exit, and to access digimon bank and digimon services, you have to run and go to a specific place. The game is extremely grindy, and if you do not create platinum numemons, your digimons will level up very slowly. You cant even skip events or fast forward. Each dialogue require you to press the next button or it would not advance. All these clunky gameplay adds up, though u will get more used to it as time passes.

4. This fourth point is the main reason why i gave a negative review. After 90 hours of grinding top tier digimons on cybersleuth's story track, I attempted to start a new Hacker's memory game, they say that there is NO NEW GAME+ for it, until you complete it the first time after cybersleuth. Meaning you have to start from scratch, grinding out digimons from scratch in this playthrough. You only access New game+ on your third playthrough, thus only when you complete both stories, then can you use digimons you grinded out previously. This is utter nonsense. Have you ever heard of any game that only gives you new game+ on the 3rd playthrough? This reflects really poor game design, wasting of gamers' time, making this game much too grindy, much too tedious, based on mediocre writing, riding mainly on a Digimon Nostalgia, albeit good strategic and tactical gameplay. At 90hrs in, this game is now a chore to play.

Therefore, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, with its boring combat and overly tedious game design. Get this game only if you really like digimon, and if it is on a steep price discount, and you have alot of time to spare. If not, there are plenty of better games out there instead.

-- Hacker's memory --
1. The poor difficulty pacing makes it worse. The game expects you to grind heavily. Out of a sudden in Chapter 4, an ultimate digimon is pitted against your rookie and champion digmons. (Mind you, you only have 25 memory at that time) - and they made it even more tedious with boring puzzles. This game made me doze off in the day multiple times, while playing it.

2. I have never seen as much padding in terms of content and quests in any other game.

3. Poor difficult spikes, and enemy digimon has infinite SP, while yours are finite, so you will see like multi heal to full HP when you do not take out the digimon in one shot.

4. Clunky controls and non-intuitive menu designs will make you try to press a in game button multiple times to get something done. Why do you need to shift your digimon to the farm to feed them food? Even in digimon 1 you can just feed them anywhere. This game is worse than a PS1 game. Why cant we fast travel from menu to the digital world, instead u hv to login to pc to go somewhere, logout, then go to PC again to login to somewhere else. Clunky AF.

Verdict:
If you like digimon, you are better off playing Digimon world on an emulator or something. This game though fresh in terms of gameplay, is far too tedious for any persons to even consider playing. By the 100th hour, you will be dreading this game already, and it will be a chore to complete it. This game is mired by some serious poor game design issues.",1625903056,1628272344,False,28,0,0.568395614624023438,1,True,False,False

[u] Plot[/u]
The game starts agonisingly slow. There is so much dialogue and lots of it is just pointless filler. The characters are annoying and shallow. You get some Digimon early but you barely get to fight - you are forced to run around talking to people constantly. Motivations of many of the characters is unclear.

After a few hours the plot picked up and I actually found [b]some[/b] parts of the main storyline interesting. However at this point you also unlock side quests and they are very lazy. E.g. As part of the main story, the air conditioning was very cold and it turned out a Digimon was stuck in there. We went through a dungeon and defeated the Digimon. I immediately got a side quest after saying that the air conditioning was too hot. This quest sends you back through that exact same dungeon to defeat another Digimon standing exactly where the other one was.

[u]Gameplay[/u] 
There are lots of Digimon you can get and they all have branching digivolution trees. Nurturing your own team of Digimon and getting them up to ultimate or mega is quite appealing. However, the battling is very boring. After 10 hour of play my Digimon had only learnt basic damaging moves or extremely weak support moves, so every fight was simply ""attack"" over and over until the enemy is dead. Grinding is beneficial - you can find lots of people talking about the best way to grind on the forums - but I can't bring myself to do it because combat is so bland.

Difficulty is also all over the place. 'Normal' mode was incredibly easy and made combat seem pointless. 'Hard' gives enemies much more health so combat lasts several more rounds, but this didn't feel much better because it's still simple and boring - you just have to press 'attack' a few more times. Additionally Digimon have one of three types with a rock-paper-scissors system where you do twice as much damage to the type you are better than, and half as much to the type you are weaker to. As you can only have 3 Digimon in your party, this forces you to have one Digimon from each type. When I came up against a Digimon of a certain type and I didn't have a counter type, fights took [b]so[/b] long. Then when I had a Digimon of each type, enemies would frequently one-shot my Digimon if they hit the one they were 'good' against with nothing I could do to counter it. It also meant I was forced to use Digimon I didn't want to use to ensure I had type coverage - sometimes I had to bench a Digimon after digivolving because it changed type. 

I quit the game when I got to a certain point where I had to fight a boss. I had been beating everything easily up to that point due to some unintentional grinding, and easily beat the boss minions in one round. Then the boss absolutely destroyed me. I actually thought I was supposed to lose this battle because of how ridiculously strong he was. Now, losing to a boss is totally fine, but it came out of nowhere, [b]and the game doesn't have autosave[/b]. So if you lose a fight, or your PC crashes or something, you potentially have to re-do hours of gameplay.

[u]Graphics[/u]
The graphics of the game are decent, with good character and Digimon models. I don't know why the female designs are so inappropriate, some of them literally have their tits out and you can see the shape of their body [i]through[/i] their clothes. It's meant to be a children's game.

The Japan environments are really cool and detailed, I enjoyed walking around them.

I'm indifferent to Urban Fantasy games and this looked like one of them, but I'm a Digimon fan since forever so I gave it a try.
I came with no expectations, neither bad nor good expectations.
In the end, I'm more than satisfied. 

Pros:
-The battle system is really fun. It especially shines during a boss fight. Status effects, buffs and debuffs aren't in this game just for show! *To the record, I've played this game on hard mode so I don't know if that still applies on normal
-The branching evolution system for the Digimon.
-The story is not afraid of addressing tragedy. (A particular mission in the game sent shivers down my spine at the end. Anyone who played it just knows what I'm talking about. Pure nightmare fuel.)
-Story gets really good on the later half, some twists caught me offguard.
-Characters in the game were surprisingly entertaining. At the beginning, I thought they would annoy me.
-The OST is a really good match with the game and it is used pretty well too.
-The models in this game are on point, especially the Digimon models. The attacks have nice animations too, especially the special ones.
-The grinding is manageable enough, for the most part. There are ingame systems to deal with grinding. It really only starts to get a bit bad towards the end with the Mega levels.

Cons:
-THE TRANSLATION! (I don't read Japanese, but even I can tell there is something wrong with the translation. It did not detract from my enjoyment of the game, but you've been warned. Some parts of the game have self-evident mistranslations.)
-The game could use more places to go.
-The design of dungeons and puzzles were a bit too simplistic, although I suspect it is this way to not shift focus from the battle system itself.
-The ABI system. As said, the grinding is usually manageable but the Mega levels will put a really annoying ABI point requirement that will most likely force you to De-Digivolve your mon just to Digivolve it again! Really boring, please replace it in future games.
-A shame the choices you make in this game don't actually matter.
-While I put many hours into it, this is the kind of game I wouldn't feel like playing again. There isn't a big incentive for replayability.

Overall, a solid good game. I give it a 8/10.  Still not a masterpiece like Digimon World 1, but still pretty good!
By the way, if you like mainline SMT then chances are you might like this game too. It really felt like a SMT game at times, even without an actual alignment system.",1627262772,1627262772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game doesn't suffer from that problem, as it's very easy to find your way to the important information about your Digimon you're looking for. As for fun, the story is interesting and entertaining, but the excessive use of mini-cutscenes with two characters talking can get annoying at times.

Gameplay: Tends to grow tedious

I wouldn't consider myself much of a Digimon fan, but I've looked into a few Digimon games and this was a solid entry for the franchise, albeit a dumbing-down of the series' core mechanics. Complete Edition is technically two games in one, but it's mostly just two stories with the same gameplay mechanics. Each story is roughly 30 hours and maybe some extra for sidequesting/grinding, so if you're going to play only one I'd recommend Hacker's Memory as it has some quality of life over Cyber Sleuth and is generally a more substantial experience. Both stories' plots aren't super complex, but they've got a good number of interesting twists and amusing moments in my opinion.

Gonna be honest, the combat system is terribly bland. The one interesting aspect is team-building in that you can plan evolution paths for your Digimon to get pretty much whichever moves you want on them. However, there are few moves that aren't just ""deal X physical/magic damage of Y element to either one enemy or all enemies"". The elements of your moves barely even matter compared to the Digimon's inherent data type; the data type triangle overpowers elemental weaknesses by a landslide and heavily simplifies type matchups compared to something like Pokemon's type system. There are a fair number of utility moves, but only a couple such as Safety Guard (a pre-revive spell that's overpowered) and AoE buffs/heals are more useful than just dealing damage. The only solace is that each Digimon gets one or two signature moves which tend to be good for the high-rank Digimon and have unique effects.

In tandem with the mediocre combat system, there's a fair amount of backtracking that adds to the tedium of the gameplay. Hacker's Memory isn't as much of a culprit of this, but there are still those moments where the story shows its padding.

In spite of its shortcomings, I recommend this as a game that's flawed but isn't half bad. Whether it's good is up to you. The things that kept me playing were the intriguing environments and complex digivolution trees. Teambuilding was fun for a while, and the sights and sounds of the game world are very unique and effective at drawing the player in.",1627016186,1627016556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u] Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth [/u] is definitely an RPG that happened. The premise is really cool and it starts off interestingly enough. Gameplay isn't really varied, but creating and evolving your party is definitely really fun. Except the ABI mechanic. I absolutely hate that toward the middle/end of the game it really felt like the main plot just really dragged its feet to pad the runtime. The side cases were really shallow and I wish they developed them some more because that's really where some of the most interesting things happen. Some of it was really dark. Overall, the game is solid. Really hit me with the nostalgia as I realized how much Digimon I watched as a kid. I give this one a 5.5/10

[u] Digimon Hacker's Memory [/u] is the exact same thing as Cyber Sleuth with some slight (very slight) improvements. I was kind of hoping they would actually do some more with the ""sequel"". I liked the story better this time around since you actually spent some time with the characters. Gameplay was exactly the same with some balance tweeks, I think it was a lot easier despite playing on the hardest difficulty. Not much to say honestly. If you liked Cyber Sleuth, this is just more of the same. But like I said earlier, it's really not worth spending the time on both. 5.5/10",1626387042,1626387042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is an obvious nod to Pokemon in the addition of personality types for each Digimon which affect their stats, something I personally could have done without. Here's hoping that the next game will be a vast improvement on this hot mess.",1625576999,1625576999,False,4,0,0.500465750694274902,0,True,False,False

- no dash option to move faster in any dungeon/areas
- the graphic style isn't completely refined, still a lot of unrefined texture on some parts

Long story short, if you are a Digimon fan, these are a pretty easy recommend. Really the only flaw for a fan would be that the second game is kinda ""more of the same"" because it happens in parrallel to the first game and so its a lot of shared locations and large scale events. If you put some space between playing the two, that probably wont be too big of an issue. Regardless, the story of both is enough to carry the second game as well. 

For a non-fan who maybe has some interest in a monster catcher style RPG, this game is very good. It is not at the level of polish that you would see out of a modern Persona game, but you can tell this game drew from some of those elements and ideas without simply doing the Persona formula (Not an easy formula to emulate in the first place...).

Honestly, I enjoyed this game more than the modern Pokemon games. There are aspects of it that make it feel like the game wants me to get what I want out of it at my pace. There are digimon that can speed up how fast you get XP, Gold, and other things and it makes it a real joy. Granted, it can trivialize a lot of the story fights if you choose to be OP, but I appreciate that that game is more interested in you getting the Digimon you want for your perfect team than unnecessarily gating you or creating a grind to prevent that. The end game is still there for a challenge, and of course you can choose to simply not be OP lol.

Pros:
Great stories and characters
Game gives you the tools to get what you want
Game has an attractive art style
Fun, straight forward mechanics
Relaxing to play

Cons:
A lot of the digital environments are pretty uninspired/repetitive
Overlap between two games can give feeling of ""more of the same"" if played back to back.",1625536066,1625536066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My opinion growing up has always been Digimon is way cooler than Pokemon. This game further proves it. The game puts you into a story-driven adventure whereby along the way you collect and train Digimon. No generic ""become the world's best trainer and collect them all, here's a pokemon, pat you on the back, and go on your way"" this game instead thrusts you into an actual story which is interesting different.

Along the way you collect and train Digimon, and focus on Digivolving and De-Digivolving them to min/max attributes and put together the perfect team. If you are a fan of Digimon, you might not know the names of the baby forms, so another interesting sub game emerges where you are shown a silhouette of what a Digimon can turn into and you can try and guess to get your favorites. Combat takes turn much like Pokemon with turn-based combat, but the similarities end there. Instead of 1v1 all the time, the game can put you against 1-3 enemies, and your team can consist of 1-3 active Digimon as well. There is a turn order gauge and combat relies on extorting the gauge to get the most hits in. The only thing I will say negative about combat is that there are a ton of types and elements to worry about and no visual cues to help you along the way. You'll suddenly find you are doing half damage and then discover you don't have the right ""type"" to help you.

The story is interesting, the characters are kind of interesting which leads me into my one big gripe. The translation is ATROCIOUS. Like so bad you can have no idea what is going on. A major event just occurred in game, avoiding spoilers, but someone was abusing a Digimon, and due to the translation I was sucked right out of the game. The characters were spouting gibberish and switching up from super sad to super happy from one message box to the next. It made no sense at all. Then everyone just dispersed like nothing had happened and one of the characters was flirting with me? It made no sense. And it has happened a few times. At times you won't even know if the game is hinting at something or if its an error with the translation. And then the character will say something off the wall and you'll be even more confused.

Within dialogue, you will find untranslated Japanese words. Sometimes the game seems to even realize this and says something like ""that means, xxx"" but this doesn't help at all. Why not just replace the word to begin with? There's also a problem as in any Japanese game where the characters still have Japanese names making it hard to remember and decipher who is who and who they are talking about at time. Kumiko, Kurama, Kuragano. These are all great Japanese names, but if you aren't Japanese, they seem to blend together making it hard to know what they're blabbering about.

Overall I wish Steam had a middle of the road button. The GAMEPLAY here is amazing, so much better than any Pokemon game I've played before, the story is also really good, but the dialogue is just so out there due to translation issues, I don't know if I'd recommend it.",1625524680,1625524680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cyber Sleuth had SOUL.  Sword & Shield was SOULESS.  Digimon was two games for the price of one, Pokemon was one game for the price of two.  BUY DIGIMON, IT IS THE GOOD GAME AND HAS NO FLAWS.  And I must admit, I fell for those hollerings.

Sad part is, Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory fall into a lot of the same traps as SWSH.  Convoluted story that takes away from the gameplay rather than adds to it.  Reused animations and recycled models.  Same-y dungeons.  Weird music.  A proportionately low amount of mons to pick from.  Worst thing is the lack of autosave, which can and probably will screw you over at the worst times.  And the darnedest thing is, even with a lot of the same flaws as SWSH...these two games are really good.  I'd almost say they're some of the best monster-RPGs on the market.  But what makes the game so good?

It has a very janky charm to it.  The story is poorly-translated edgy cyberpunk to the point of being ridiculous, but its still engaging.  The animations are kind of bland, except for the signature moves: those are fantastic.  The mon choice is low, but the options available are golden and it never feels like you're stuck with something you don't want (and even uglier mons have their uses, like PlantinumSukamon's money-farming tricks).  You can not only have a Digimon following you, but you can have three of them at once.  There's no point to that, it's just fun.  And the farming/digivolving loops have no business being as satisfying as they are.  This may be one of the only RPGs I am more than happy to grind in, simply because I want to digivolve and de-digivolve my team until they are the best they can be.  The fact that it's a multi-platform release is a big bonus as well.

Maybe there's something to that SOUL/SOULESS meme after all.  Because, in spite of all its flaws, this game definitely feels soulful.  Like it was made for the love of it, rather than for big money.  And that's hard to find in this competitive AAA market these days.

I just completed Cyber Sleuth at 47 hours and have not started Hacker's Memory (the other story) yet.

For fans of creature capturing games, this is an excellent Digimon game. The only other turn based Digimon game I've played is Digimon World Dawn back on the DS and Digimon Cyber Sleuth is just 100% better.

If you are interested in similar RPG games that raises and trains monsters to fight alongside you then you should definitely give Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth a try! and if you are are a Digimon fan then playing this is a must! or else you are losing out on a lot! 

Game has solid writing, memorable characters and one of its best feature is the humor! flat out hilarious at times. The Blend of humor and the dark nature of the game compliments perfectly with the storyline. I have some mixed feelings to the story itself but nonetheless, one of my best Digimon experiences ever. Visually amazing! The cutscenes are well made too! brings out the hype like straight out of an anime. The sound tracks are awesome as well.

Now on to the Gameplay! The game plays like a typical turned based JRPG. The visuals of special moves are kinda cool and you can carry like 11 digimon with you (3 active and 8 as backup) Experiencing and getting the different digivolutions seems to be the best part in Digimon games and this game has offered so many of em! But it can also be really tedious to hunt all digivolutions, It will involve quite a bit of grinding. The fascinating thing about this game is they included functions to make every frustrating part of the game more easy, manageable and efficient. Your digimon backups gains experience exactly the same as the 3 you are using to battle with, You will also have access to a Digimon Farm that can incorporate up to 50 digimons to continue progress and experience among them. 

The Sidequests are the weakest part of the game, most of them are boring and repetitive. It includes wading through the same dungeons again and again with almost the same objectives, thankfully as the game progresses you will be able to get some useful functions to avoid random enemy encounters and items to escape from dungeons completely. There is also a ""force enemy encounter"" to help with the leveling up. 

Digimon story Cybersleuth is like a combination of the old Digimon games- the training farm, the battle style, etc. but sadly It lacks the part where you can go on like an adventure within the Digital world like the previous ones.This one has fixed locations on where to go and its more like adventuring in cities than a digi world paradise. Good thing is they did still manage to capture the real essence of the old digimon games and even the anime. 

One more thing is this game is a compilation of 2 games that has side by side storylines - Cyber Sleuth and Hackers memory. It takes place at the same time but from the perspective of different people. You can choose whichever you want to play first, but I recommend playing Cyber Sleuth first to get most out of the story.

A great experience to relive the awesome memories of my childhood! Digimon is for everyone! You don't really need the nostalgia to enjoy the masterpiece. A beautiful creation that portrayed Courage, Resilience, Hope and the value of Friendship. Everytime I think of Digimon I always hear the hype music of the soundtracks ""Butterfly"" and ""Brave Heart"" inside of my head.

I really enjoyed the actual gameplay though. Exactly what you'd want from a digimon game.

☑ Good

Graphics-
☑ Will do
Port as far as I know, what can you expect.

Audio
☑ Decent
I can live with it but its still mostly muted.

Audience
☑ Teens
☑ Digimon Nerds
☑ People who dont mind mashing ""A"" through dialogue 

Story-
☑ Not great
I would prefer no story or honestly just less talking.

Difficult-
☑ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
Optional Normal/Hard mode

Grind-
☑ A bit grindy sometimes
☑ Too much grind (If you refuse to use PlatinumNuemon/Platinumsukamon)
If you hate grinding grab the aforementioned Digimon and you'll FLY through levels.

Game Time-
☑ Depends on you
Half of the game is mashing ""A"" through text. The other half an enjoyable monster collecting game. 

Price-
☑ Wait for sale
This being said, I did buy it on sale (15$) and would consider buying it at full price given how much time Ive enjoyed this game.

Overall-
4/5
If youre tired of hand holding Pokemon'esk games and are looking for a new creature collector this is one of the best out. Buyer beware of the walls of text though. It genuinely takes up more time than most other activities, the game really shines when you are fighting bosses/grinding new Digimon for your team or for an evolution

I can honestly recommend it. Digimon has always had a great track record with complicated stories that have deep meaning, and both games do that hear. I just don't recommend playing them both back-to-back. Hacker's Memory clearly is just an asset-flip with some original characters, but it gives a good idea of everything that was going on behind the scenes with the main game. You can play them in any order, which is good news.

The complete collection does some nice things, mostly having both games in one location, and access to both games Digimons. It does feel like they tweeked the AI a little, because normal actually presents a challenge here, and Hard can be outright unforgiving at times. I was hoping for some QoL changes like being able to skip/speed-through dialog because if you heard it before you just wanna get to the core part of the game.

One of my biggest complaints, and this hasn't changed since the ps4/vita days, the environments can feel extremely samey, and the Grind is Real. The character models are great, but can feel a bit doll-like, granted these were designed for hand-held devices and not home-console and PC.",1624486185,1624486185,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Digimon was always a far more interesting franchise to me than Pokemon, but Digimon games are more hit or miss and not as frequent as Pokemon. So getting a great entry, aswell as more content and a PC release is fantastic.

Cyber Sleuth plays like any other generic JRPG. Attack randomly occurring enemies, use spells to exploit weaknesses, build a team of Digimon to best suit your next fight. Standard fare for the genre, but the theme is what gets me, think of every cliche you can for hackers and you'll most likely see atleast half of them here. 

Story and dialogue are a mixed bag here. Although i do love the world and lore, the writing is BAD sometimes. Cyber Sleuth also has this weird knack of making you feel like you missed a conversation between characters at some point. Characters are introduced like you show know them already, or characters act like nothing happened or act very nonchalant about meeting someone in the real world when they shouldn't even know where they are at all. Its not cringe worthy, but expect some confusion trying to wrap your head around some of these moments.

One last thing to note here is what game you should play first. Cyber Sleuth lets you pick from Hacker's Memory or Cyber Sleuth from the start, and you can play both in tandem if you really wanted to.

The gameplay battle is a real good RPG, were you can get your digimons learn more skills from digivolutions.
Also that you can train em to get em more powerfull.

The story isnt that great at all, some moments are great and all but its a few (mostly at ending ) some even dosnt make sense.... Thats why in my opinion i give 2 stars since they could actually worked better on the story, but since this game is old, well, cant expect more.

Cause this review has nothing to do with GTA and “how can anyone not like GTA?” It has something to do with promise. GTA promises a world of unlimited possibilities. To do what you want. However, something will hold you back, for reasons entirely contrarian to the game’s promise. Therefore, the promise is not fulfilled and I am bummed out. [i]Cybersleuth[/i] (I’m not going to write the whole name) promises Digimon. And it delivers. And that is why I like it. 

Digimon is Pokémon’s cooler, less popular elementary school friend who went to do something for itself while Pokémon sold out and got stupidly rich. Digimon just entered a niche. Where it is still a very narrative driven property with a very big cast of characters. I have only seen Adventure, Adventure 2.0 and Tri, so my knowledge on all the other series is very limited, but [i]Cybersleuth[/i] allows me to play what I want to play; with the Digimon from those series and any news ones I discover along the way are a welcome addition. In [i]Cybersleuth[/i] you play a young kid who one day ventures into a part of the internet he/she shouldn’t have been and is eaten by some horrid digital entity. Your body and digital soul rent apart, you now exist as a proxy in the real world; able to ride phone and internet signals to visit a digital realm under siege. You end up working at a detective agency and try to solve one mystery after the other and eventually discover the truth behind the digital invasion. You’re accompanied by Digimon you find and raise along the way. And because you’re given the means and assets to raise these Digimon, even when they’re not on your party, you get play with a very broad number of them. Pokémon tends to funnel you into a team that you stick with, but [i]Cybersleuth[/i] just lets you swap with impunity. It’s wonderful. It does require a bit of a grind from time to time, but nothing that can’t be managed in minimal time. Whatever you want is within reach. Do you want to play the original eight? That can be done easily. You want a squad of talking technicolor turds? Also within the realm of possibilities. You want a team of reality bending eldritch abominations? It’s got you covered. 

As a result, it is a game that requires some commitment. Not mobile game level of commitment; but it isn’t baby’s first JRPG material either. It’s a balance, and that makes it pleasant to play. If anything, I found playing Digimon very relaxing. It’s not too hard; nor extremely easy. It’s fanservice all the way and that’s ok. Level design is pathetic though. Isometric prerendered environments are kind of last century. Digimon models look like their cartoon counterparts. Music is a very basic. It’s always a loss when they don’t include the anime soundtrack.

Overall, [i]Cybersleuth[/i] is very enjoyable for a light JRPG experience and strong Digimon adventure. If you like Digimon, be sure to check it out.

However hackers memory more than makes up for its predecessor's faults by not only slamming down nearly a dozen new hacker teams with their own styles and goals, but it also adds a slew of new features including a new gameplay style that varies up combat into almost an entirely new game. Domination battles fuse your solo player party with other friendly npc's parties to take part in a chess/pokemon mash up thats so weird and refreshing that it puts it at the top of the monster battler genre. Add in a bunch of Quality of Life improvements like a speed boost ability as well as telling a more personal and kind of grittier story, it transcends the original in every way. My suggestion is to zoom through Cybersleuth first because the stories happen concurrently and the context it adds to HM makes that game all the better, but do all of the grindy, monster collecting on HM because unfortunately the original Cybersleuth feels more like a concept piece than the masterclass of a game that follows it up.

If you, like me, have been bored of the last couple of pokemon games in a row, this will be a nice change, and should hold your attention. You have a lot of digimon in this game and getting them all will take you a bit of effort before the game is over.

I believe this game was originally a psvita title, but I feel that this game does a lot more with a lot less compared to the latest 3d outings of Pokemon.

I played it on the hard difficulty, which was pretty good until really close to the end. I think it was the 4th last boss and onward that was super annoying.

---[b]Pros[/b]:
* [b]Lots of digimon[/b]
If you are a fan of the oldschool digimon, most of them are here. Personally I went with terriormon and am very happy.

* [b]Battle system is good[/b]
If you are looking for Shin Megami Tensei levels of depth, this game misses the mark, though it is more complex than Pokemon. The battle system is simple, but not as simple as say, the standard RPGmaker template that you see a lot.

The game encourages you to mix up your party and have a wide variety of digimon in order to deal with different enemy combinations and bosses, which is something that pokemon doesn't really do. You will not be able to take your level 60 Rapidmon and steamroll through the entire game. Several bosses through me for a loop the first time, and it was nice when I was prepared. Especially on hard, this was a nice change of pace using my pinch hitters instead of just using Gargomon all the time until the end of the game (though he was around for that).

* [b]The Story is somewhat interesting without getting too crazy until the end[/b]
You've played this kind of story before, it's very shonen, but I would say there are no annoying main or voiced characters that ruined playing through the story. 

* [b]Graphics and animations are ok/decent[/b]
The graphics look good, and it performs well on my PC with modest specs (RX 480, AMD 2700x, 32gb of ram). I believe this was a psvita game at some point, and while at many times it shows, the graphics and animations still look great. I will say the models don't look as good as the ones in pokemon, but they really do make the most of them, especially with the animations.

* [b]The leveling system makes grinding a little more enjoyable[/b]
I know grinding isn't for everybody, but you don't really have to do to if you don't want to (until really late in the game on hard, when it's really easy. Or maybe I just suck, who knows). When you hit a certain level and some other requirements, you can digivolve. When you digivolve, you start at level 1, but have much better stats, and it's easy to get back to where you were. It's really nice to see my level 1 digmon getting 13 levels off one encounter, and there are ways to speed up your leveling if that's your thing. Don't be afraid to de-digivolve.

---Cons:
* [b]Translation is a bit wonkey[/b]
Lots of grammar mistakes, weird phrasing, and the localization is a bit on the nose, especially in Akihabara. If you miss the PS1 era of translations this game is right up your ally, but otherwise it can be distracting. I like this kind of thing; I find it funny, as long as I can still understand what is going on, and I would say that the game is more than competent, but you will notice the shortcomings of the translation, especially when talking to your digimon.

* [b]You cannot skip cutscenes or speed up text by holding down a button[/b]
While it's not as bad as Final Fantasy X was, there are many boss fights you would prefer to get to without mashing the [X] button for 15 sec or more. You can do a new game+ after you beat the game, but not being able to skip the cutscenes has made me not want to bother. Maybe next year.

* [b]The hard difficulty has some bullshit bosses towards the end of the game(Starting with chapter 16 I think)[/b]
You know what is extremely obnoxious? A boss nuking your entire team of level 70-80s digimon in one shot and then healing 1/4 of his health each time. The final boss is extremely easy in comparison. I will say there are other weird spikes in difficulty early in the game but those didn't make me angry like these did, just tense. Another knock to not being able to skip or speed up cutscenes.

* [b]Filler[/b]
There is some filler in between the main story, that is to say you need to do some faffing about to get back to the the actual story, but it's treated as if these things are integral to the plot. I'm not talking about the optional missions you can go on, those are fine, I'm talking about the occult club and their several slogging scenarios. The story could have cut these out, but we would be short like 5 chapters, and you gotta make it a nice even 20. This also leads into my next point, which is...

* [b]Lots of reused assets and areas[/b]: You will be going to a lot of the same copy/paste levels that have been repurposed, and scaled with different digimon. There are many interesting places but only about half of the game is unique looking, with different layouts. This is not a deal breaker for me. There is enough uniqueness around, and when you see it, it looks great, but I noticed the recuse of assets often being used at about the half way point of the game a lot, because...

* [b]Lots of back tracking[/b]: Now, thankfully there isn't a lot of ground to cover as the areas are very small, and you walk relatively fast, buuuuut, There are a lot of little small ""walk here and then walk back"" scenarios that happen way to often, sometimes happening more than once. Here is an example:
		1. Go to case board, start case
		2. walk upstairs to click on computer
		3. get a phone call from your boss about the case; Get teleported to the office.
		4. Talk to your boss, then Walk back to computer
		5. Finally enter the dungeon for the case
What I don't understand is that some of these cases have the decency to teleport you to them without wasting your time walking back and forth. It adds up a lot, and the middle of the game can be a real slog if you are doing all the extra content as it becomes available.

* [b]It doesn't have Charizard in it.[/b]

--------------- Final thoughts -----------------
Overall I really enjoyed (at least 1 half of) this game, and would recommend it, especially if you are looking for something a little more stimulating than pokemon. The developers did a lot more with a lot less when it comes to Cyber Sleuth, so I hope you can enjoy it as much as I did.

I hear Hackers memory improves on a lot of this, but I am too tired to play another 60 hour game. I'm looking forward to it.

The game has some nice cutscenes but the amount of time you have to wait for cut scenes for about 1/4 of the game. Some of the digimon battles you can get away with not worry about type advantage but when on hard mode you are forced to play rock paper scissors using Vaccine, Virus, Data since they are either half or double the damage. Some digimons are not as great so you end up just letting them farm. I sit away from the computer sometimes and get other things to get some stuff for waiting. 

Pro:
I like the variety but you cannot hold all the digimon you want till later levels. I love the animations and the boss fights because on hard difficulty there is not always type advantage and feels like a challenge other than I had to prepare for these fights rather than just switch my lineup, 

Con:
Definitely the long cut scenes, most games give you an option to have cutscenes play out over without  any interaction. This can drag out scenes because you will have to wait for the dialogue to finish. Another problem I have is sometimes I dont have time to play and you will not know where to go because story missions do not count as quests, and the hints you get to the next part are unclear.

First of all, you are a Cyber Sleuth/ Cyber Detective, this is not a puzzle game not even a detective game, its an RPG game where you are a Cyber Sleuth.
There is Cases to solve but you dont need to use your brain, this is just the plot of the game.

[h1] 2 games in One [/h1]
This game is a port of 2 games: [b] Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth [/b] and [b] Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth Hacker's Memory [/b]

Cyber sleuth was the first game with less digimons and Hacker's Memory had new digimons but in this PC Version all the new digimons from Hacker's Memory are present in Cyber Sleuth also.

DLC's digimons from the console are present here too for free.

[h1] Idle Game [/h1]
This game incentives you to leave your game open to idle levelup your digimons in the farm.

[h1] Dead Online [/h1]
You can grind levels, farm skills and create the Perfect Digimon, but you dont need it for the campaing and the online mode is Dead.

The online mode was dead from the start because of the high price of the game and because no one knew about this game, digimon games have been exclusive to consoles and japan for a long time and lost its popularity in the west.

[h1] Censorship [/h1]
In this port Sistermon Noir was censored due to religious sensitivities, in place of Sistermon Noir they created a white/blue version named Sistermon Ciel wich digievolves from Sistermon Blanc just like Noir, but you dont have Noir in the game anymore, she was redesigned into Ciel.

[h1] Digimons / Deluxe [/h1]
Yes, all the new digimons from Hacker's Memory are available in Cyber Sleuth too.
Yes, the digimons from the Cyber Sleuth Deluxe are present at the Cyber Sleuth story because they are present in hacker's memory and how i said above, the digimons from hacker's memory are present in Cyber Sleuth too.

Okay I'm done with Cyber Sleuth. The narrative and characters are pretty crappy save for a few but it's got decent enough fun in the digimon raising aspect that I'm willing to overlook the crappiness.

Hacker's Memory is much more improved than the base game, much better cast, narrative and difficulty curves. The addition of some new mechanics like ability for faster movement and Domination battle is also quite welcome. If you want the full experience of Digimon Story formula and can't stand the base Cyber Sleuth game, you can just jump into Hacker's Memory straight away. You won't miss much reading or watching CS plot to understand the gist of it in Hacker's Memory as it tells another side to the story in the main game (in a much more cohesive way).",1620826264,1621072983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLD: if you are a digimon fan you will probably overlook a lot of the bad things, and will end up enjoying the game.
However if you are not a fan or are ""on the fence"" with the game please check the things I like and dislike, to have a more informed decision

Things I like:
- Good graphics;
- Awesome roster of digimons (almost 400);
- Digivolving is simpler than other games of the franchise, so its easier to track the requirements and fix mistakes;
- Well made attack animations;
- Inherited skills makes so you can have your favourite digimon with the attack you like;
- You can see your full party following you at dungeons and the digital world;

Things I don't like:
- No auto-save;
- You need to close the game if you want to load a save game;
- Fixed Camera, even tho it was made for psvita / ps4, that both have twin-stick joysticks; 
- Can you customise your character? Only the t-shirt;
- No custom size windows, only 1080p / 720p
- Only anti-aliasing enable / disable
- No ultra-wide support;
- Weird keybindings choices;
- Unnecessary amount of cringe dialog that doesn't move the plot forward, and OH boy there is allot of useless dialog in this game.
- Auto-Battle doesn't speed up battles, so there is no advantage in using it on meaningless encounters.
- Unskippable cut-scenes, in a second playtrought you are going to need to endure all of the cut-scenes again.

Even tho I have a lot to complain, I like this game allot because I'm a digimon fan, however I find it pretty hard to recommend to someone who doesn't have the patience to endure all the dialog and cut-scenes.",1620348271,1621052535,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have already completed both titles on the PlayStation and being able to replay them once again on the PC in this neat double pack is making the experience all the more fun.

The story is really entertaining and will keep you second guessing even all the way up to the final acts and playing through both stories in succession will allow you to see the neat and intricate little tie ins that made the second title just as if not as fun as the original.

The selection of Digimon you can choose from and use through the evolution trees and such is so vast you will end up spending hours and hours trying out all the different combinations with little thought on how much grind is being put into doing so.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Digimon franchise, enjoys turn-based JRPGs, has any interest in wacky detective capers or just someone looking to explore a story that'll play with your emotions in a good way rather than a negative one.

I have to open up a menu to get to a different menu. This game also makes you run around A LOT for nothing.

1. The characters and story:
The characters in this are little more than walking anime tropes with little to no actual character to speak of. The story is convoluted and terrible paced, I played for about 30 hours and felt like the story told up to that point could have taken maybe 5 in a decently paced game, and what was told was a badly written mess of nonsense and hand waves, the characters literally bring up issues with the story and then say things like ""don't worry about it"", this happens regularly.

2. The models and Animation:
The character models are mediocre to bad, the same as you can find in a low budget anime type game, However the low amount of them is very noticeable as you'll see the same model used multiple times nearly every screen. The actual digimon models look okay  though I've read those assets were reused from previous digimon titles though am unsure if this is true. The animation for all models is very limited with humans using the same animations and expressions nearly every conversation and the digimon have an attack and cast animation and 1 (rarely 2) special moves with a unique animation that vary in quality.

3. The level and quest design:
This is genuinely some of the worst quest and level design I've ever seen, the majority of quests are obviously time wasting filler to pad out the mentioned terrible pacing, Most quests are either ""Go here then walk back and forth for 5 minutes"" or that again but there's a fight in between. This is made even worse by the terrible dungeons that are literally just hallways that all have the same look and aesthetic, ""blue hallway with floating squares"". The aesthetic for most locations is identical with all of Eden (The virtual space) looking identical with white floors and could make another point about the terrible aesthetic but don't want to go for much longer.

Like I said I really wanted to like this and am a fan of the series. The actual design of most digimon are great but those were made over 2 decades ago. I genuinely don't understand the praise that things like the story are getting, and feel like it's just over zealous fans grasping at straws. I also have to ask where any of the budget or effort actually went, as it certainly didn't go to any point I mentioned.",1620692661,1620692661,False,1,0,0.477707028388977051,0,True,False,False

I can't review this without comparing it to Pokemon, as I really like that franchise and I never played a Digimon game before this one, so...

1. Hard Mode actually give some semblance of challenge on boss fights. I had to use consumible items, for example. Grinding would also be an option. That's already more engagement than the entire PvE aspect of any Pokemon game.

2. The entire evolution/de-evolution tree aspect is really fun to play around with. Having any Digimon being able to turn on any other Digimon, while keeping their learned moves, gives it a bit of a Final Fantasy's ""Job System"" aspect to it, and I quite like those systems. It [i]is[/i] grindy, though.

3. The battle formulas and mechanics are straight-forward and the game is pretty clear on what each ability does, their power value and such. Pokemon has always been great in this regard, and it's good that this Digimon game also is.

4. Battles defaulting to trios and being able to swap multiple mons at once is interesting and makes thing more dynamic too. The Support Skills that affect the whole party are a nice touch and kinda make up for the lack of interesting weird abilities like Trick Room, Substitute and stuff like that from Pokemon.

5. The story and setting are more interesting than what I expected. It also has a cool ""90's / Early 00's Futurism"" style, from back when we imagined that the future would be all ""Virtual Reality"".",1620402372,1620402372,True,22,0,0.748457372188568115,0,True,False,False

TLDR: I bought this game on sale, but this game was still hard to enjoy. Lackluster world-building, surplus of meaningless dialogue, and limited functionality for raising Digimon. Recommended only if you love Digimon, like seriously love.

The game feels more like one big chore rather than a fantasy adventure. Each environment is extremely shallow with little interactivity besides the occasional shop-keeper. There is A LOT of dialogue. I like a good story, but half of the game is meaningless dialogue. I think I spent more time clicking through dialogue than raising Digimon. To whit, the DigiFarm is a joke. I enjoyed the DigiFarm much more in the Nintendo DS Digimon games. In this, there is very little customization and functionality. You basically just stick all your Digimon in a farm and walk away. The combat system, and branching evolution lines are a Digimon staple and I enjoy it, but it still doesn't make up for all the bad stuff (at least in my mind.)

Digimon Cyber Sleuth is a turn based RPG monster battler with a detective story thrown into the mix.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

[b] A lot of Digimon! [/b]

With over 300 Digimon, there's plenty of Digimon for you to use and to enjoy!

[b] The battle system [/b]

It's a basic turn based system like with Pokemon, Xcom, the Persona games and others, it's my favourite battle system in RPGs, and I'm happy that this game has this system.

[b] The Digivolve system [/b]

Digimon can Digivolve into new Digimon, like how Pokemon can evolve, however the Digivolve system is complex and very fun to understand, Digimon can Digivolve into numerous types of Digimon and even Digivolve BACK into a weaker form, to Digivolve into a new Digimon you never encountered, this increases it's ability to level up and Digivolve into more powerful Digimon down the line, and can learn attacks and keep them so a Digimon it Digivolves to can use them despite not being able to learn them normally, seriously this system is cool, but it does help with an issue I will talk about in the cons.

[b] The graphics and loading times [/b]

This game was for the PS VITA and PS4 originally, but looks amazing and loads really quickly, there's only one time I can think of where the graphics look bad, and that's with a cutscene near the start of the game where you're picked up in a car, but that's about it, rest looks amazing from here.


[b] The Writing [/b]

There's a lot of cutscenes in this game, and some of the writing gave me a good chuckle, like how a running gag is a friend of yours is being sniffed by some Digimon, and they like the smell as it smells familiar, later in the game she mentions this again, and you have the choice to smell her and tell her what she smells like, I chose the ""smells nice"" option, and she worryingly started to move back with an uncomfortable look, which I didn't expect and gave me a good laugh, I was expecting a different reaction has she was a bit flirty at the start with another character and with you a bit, but still, I loved that moment, also this game talks about issues I did not expect at all from this game, from a woman being stalked and you need to help her, some characters swearing, death, kidnappings and more, honestly I'm shocked and glad they did this, there's too many RPGs who ignore these type of things and gives everyone the same blank canvas and pretends nothing bad happens in the world 99% of the time (looking at you Pokemon).

[h1] Mixed [/h1]

[b] The Story and Cutscenes [/b]

The story is... ok, but the game takes the story as it's highest priority, so you're stuck watching a lot of cutscenes a lot of the time, so if you don't care for story much, you might get annoyed on how much the game throws at you and you're forced to watch, even if you skip a bit like I did, you're still stuck in cutscenes for a while.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[b] The Grind [/b]

This game is grindy as hell, Digimon can only evolve with certain stats from either leveling them up further, training at a farm, or Digivolving into a younger Digimon to raise a special stat, and some Digimon have multiple forms to evolve into AND some even require you own a certain Digimon with perfect stats to Digivolve into it's final form!

The game is a diamond in the rough.
The pacing overall is brisk and comfortable. The script is filled with references to mythology and supernatural phenomena in a way that shows the dev team was passionate about the subject, and it's great to see these animistic beliefs merged with our digital world in fun and creative ways.
The characters deserve a special mention here, since they evolve as a group and truly become they're own person. (Nokia steals the show IMO)
The voice cast is pretty good, having talent such as Maaya Sakamoto, Megumi Han, Kanae Itou and Norio Wakamoto.
The music is functional, made by Masafumi Takada of Danganronpa fame, however, it didn't grab my attention for long; your millage may vary.
The gameplay is a turn-based jrpg with you taking control of three Digimon at a time, with other Digimon waiting in reserve. You are able to switch your active party Digimon at any time during your turn, but this will end that specific creature's turn.
Evolving your Digimon is a mostly straightforward process, but you can take advantage of items To raise stats.
Difficulty-wise, it's really well balanced, and as long you keep your party well leveled, and have Digimon of each of the main three types, you shouldn't run into any problems.
As for minor complaints, the lack of a large map on screen is sorely missed, and combined with the (sometimes obnoxiously) high encounter rate, it can lead to some degree of tedium.
Also, the narrative slows down  considerably (IMO) at some point in chapter 15, which made the game feel needlessly padded, when it's agile pacing actually worked in it's favor previously.
Also, quest tracking can be a bit of a pain, but, luckily, side quests are optional in most cases.
Despite these issues, this is an excellent game and a good entry point for any new fans of the franchise or for those who only had a passing interest, such as myself.
The themes of friendship, personal growth and learning important life lessons are at the core of Digimon, and I'm happy that these themes resonated as deeply as they did; the characters are likable and all of them grow stronger and overcome their flaws, and the story really takes you places.

Me and my good buddy both last weekend purchased the cyber sleuth bundle we are both huge digmon fans.

I played the Digimon World Series for the DS long time ago and I actually ADORED those games. If you are into RPG-based games and remember some digimon names, this is for you. 

Pros:
- A lot of digimons (LIKE A LOT)
- All the dlc, both games.
- About 120+ hours of two games, not even maxing out everything (I haven't event finished the second game)
- One of the only Digimon games in a while for Pc
- TOYAGUMON. I love that smol boy.
- You get two flagship mid-late 2010's games with full DLC for a single price
- Angewomon. Periodt.

Cons:
- SO. MANY. DIGIMONS. If you haven't played any other games on playstation you might get confused the first battles on the mechanics. (Don't ask me how Xros combo works, I just simply don't).
- SO GRINDY. You really gotta get some rpg-elbow-grease in there.
- Graphics are subpar. But also they are PS ports and this is probably a switch-to-pc-port. 
- Sometimes the story and the gameplay feels repetitive. But you do get to a stage where your digimons just blast off everyone on the other's team.

The places you end up fighting are just boring floating panels with a digital theme.

The combat itself is fine.  And I do like how they try to give you some (pointless) interactions with your digimon getting xp on the farm.  But it feels lifeless.

It's amazing that after playing monster catching games my whole life, this game shows up using the same formula but makes every single aspect of breeding, evolving and training so much fun. The game definetely has its issues, most of them related to aesthetics and translation in my opinion, but the core gameplay is just so pleasant and engaging that, if you like Digimon and/or catching lots of cool creatures, just buy this game already.

That first paragraph was my, hm, standalone opinion. I also have a few comparisons to the games of the Pokémon series, but I think the first paragraph is enough as a review. Continue at your own risk for my ranty-pokémon-comparing review.

First things first: this game is a bundle of two games in the Digimon Cyber Sleuth Series. Although they share assets and parts of their story, they are definetely a lot more different than pokémon ""versions"". DCS: Hacker's Memory adds new battle modes, a side story that happens during the first game, lots of new mons (that were retroactively added in the first game in this bundle) and new overworld mechanics, along with quality of life changes. This is something that, so far, the Pokémon series never even dared to do. They're more concerned with selling two separate games with the minimal possible amount of differences.

Second of all, this game - unlike any pokémon game I have ever played - makes me want to ""catch'em all"". Having lots of Digimon and having them be actually good and as a useful member of your party is SO EASY and I LOVE IT. I never felt that feeling of ""oh I caught this new mon and it's cool! But I already have a party and I have to grind for hours just to make it barely usable and equally leveled"" while playing DCS. Managing your mons' in the bank and the farms, changing their 'personality', grinding with mons in the back of the party and exploring digi-evolution routes - everything is made simple enough so that you can play with most amount of digimon possible. While in pokémon I need to force myself to choose different mons for a new adventure, in DCS I suddenly see that my party is completely different from what I had planned in the last hour or so. It never tells you ""go fill your field guide"", but you end up doing it from just experimenting and trying to build an optimal team for your next boss fight.

Finally, DCS has side-quests. Some of them are weak fetch quests, some are just a few battles and some of them have an actual little and charming side-story behind them, which is awesome. In pokémon, you get the main story, which is mostly the same every game and if you're lucky, a few post-game content. This has had free DLC, New Game+ and a story which, even though it can get a bit ""hackerman-cringy"" sometimes, has good moments and sometimes even touches on interesting/uncommon topics.

I love Pokémon, I love Digimon, I love monster catching games. But if I need to choose a franchise - or a game - to influence the future of the genre, this is the one.",1616446132,1616446132,True,24,1,0.752622425556182861,0,True,False,False

It was even one of the few games I can recall where I actually wanted to grind, in this case getting the particular digimon I liked and assembling a star team.

But for all my praise and enjoyment, I have to be perfectly honest that this localization is absolute dogshit. To start us off, the writing assumes you picked the male avatar when you start which changes a lot of the contexts of various scenes. There are plenty of typo's that were not caught and passed into the finished release. There are plenty of text selections that are absolutely broken as well, and I have ran into an uncomfortable amount of time where quests give the player incorrect information.

----( CYBERSLEUTH GAME REVIEW )---

Cybersleuth is a relatively by-the-books JRPG. If you can't stand sitting through a lot of cutscenes, don't bother as this game is riddled with them. Additionally, there is no voiced english dialogue, so you're going to have to be doing a lot of reading.

If you don't know what Digimon is, it's a series with origins going back to the advent of tamagotchis. Bandai wanted a line of tamagotchis for boys, thus the Digimon was born. From there, it would transition into a multi-media franchise, taking some inspiration from pokemon here and there but never really copying it like kids in the schoolyard would've lead you to believe in the 90s. It has had some really great games, and some really mediocre ones. The closest games in the series to the cybersleuth experience are probably the DS games (Digimon world DS, Digimon Dawn and Dusk), so if you ever played those you may have a vague idea of what's here.

A core mechanic of the game that sets it apart from your average 'pokemon rip-off' is that Digimon don't have a defined 'line' they follow linearly. You can digivolve your digimon into a multitude of different potential forms based on the stats they have, and in order to increase your digimon's potential, you're encouraged to 'de-digivolve' them back into their weaker forms and raise them back up again. For that reason, if you hate grinding, you may not like the cybersleuth formula very much (Or, you could be like me, and stack platinum numemon or platinum sukamon to grind exp- look it up.).

Combat works on a timeline based system, with a linear line showing portraits to represent the order of each battle participant's next move. The more speed you have, the more times you'll appear in the timeline. Some bosses get multiple turns, and the interface does a good job of making it clear who's going and when they're going for multiple turns in advance. 

Every digimon has two types that influence their weaknesses, an elemental type, and an attribute. The attributes (Virus, Vaccine, Data) work in a sort of rock paper scissors system and grant the greatest advantages, whereas attributes do the same but to a much lesser extent. Think if you fused the Fire Emblem weapon triangle and pokemon type advantages into one game. As such, you're encouraged to diversify your team to make up for this. This can cheapen some boss fights however, as you'll be much better off if you go in with a full team that resists the boss's attribute. 

The story is... Okay. It's not something spectacular, but it has some fun moments. The characters aren't bad as well, but none make me exactly froth at the mouth over how much I love them.

All in all, the most fun you can get from cybersleuth is by raising up a team of your favorite digital monsters and watching them grow VIA turn based shenanigans. If that sounds like something you can get behind, maybe the game will be for you.



----( HOW IS THE PORT? )---

I've beaten both games on PS4 already, and as far as ports go, this is as 1:1 as it gets.

The default control scheme takes a bit of getting used to, and all button prompts (at least from what I've seen) still mention their controller counterparts. Playing Cybersleuth on PC doesn't feel like playing a pc game, it feels like playing a console game on a pretty good emulator. It's 60 FPS locked, runs well enough, ETC. 

Graphics options are next to nonexistent, so don't go in expecting any. On the control front, you're greeted with this baffling interface that has you trying to match keybinds based on their controller counterparts. Instead of seeing what you bound to ""Use"", you're seeing what you bind to ""X, B, START"" etc. It's strange, the mouse functions as both the 'confirm' button, but it also can be used (smartly) to click on icons for the digi-line and to use the map during normal gameplay. For SOME REASON however, it cant be used to navigate menus. The rules for when the mouse can be used aren't consistent.


----( 'COMPLETE EDITION' VS NORMAL EDITIONS. )----

Now for my thoughts on the 'completeness' of the Complete edition. Fans of the original release and first time players rejoice- all digimon added in Hacker's memory are available in base Cybersleuth. I was very pleasantly surprised by that. It's cybersleuth- but, well, complete. 

As I haven't beaten the game on PC yet, I can't confirm/deny if you're able to skip cutscenes in Newgame+. 

----( ON THE NOTE OF THE PRICEPOINT... )----

The price seems to be a bit of a sticking point for some, however. In my opinion, it's worth the tag. It's a two-in-one game package; and they aren't really short games either. They're JRPGs with a lot to see, collect, and complete. You won't spend 10 hours in the game and call it done, yet a lot of people will sink $60 into some games to do exactly that, so I can't really see the issue. Is it because it's a digimon game? Maybe because it released on the PSVita back in the day, it's seen as a lower value? Is it because its an 'older game', re-released? To counter these points, I'd argue the following: Cybersleuth was a hard game to get your hands on depending on where you lived when it came out; same with hackers memory. They're not easy to find to this day, especially base cybersleuth. Also, the game is enhanced from its original releases graphically (if only marginally, it never was a bad looking game), along with having some of HM's features added to the basegame. If you like digimon, you'll probably think this is worth it. Want a nice monster-collecting JRPG distraction on PC? May be worth it for you. Don't like either? Then it's probably not worth it for you. Consider looking up some gameplay online if you're still doubting your purchase, that's the best advice I can give.

The translation is still pretty awful at times though. As I feared, there's still points where Eaters are referred to as 'Bakemon', because instead of reading the context the editors though ""Bakemono"" (monster) was supposed to be a digimon's name. There's small things like this all over the game, and depending on how easily that stuff irks you may hinder your enjoyment of the product.

Also, footnote for those of you new to the game: It's pretty cutscene heavy, especially up to chapter 2. Patience IS a virtue--- and this IS a JRPG, so expect exposition.",1571363236,1616107854,True,164,8,0.879824936389923096,15,True,False,False

So far, this is a game I love. Digimon to me is my childhood, and this feels like a more mature take on the IP. A lot of people call this game: Pokemon meets Persona. For the Pokemon part, yes this initially does feel like Pokemon. I can't speak for the Persona half though (I haven't played the Persona games). This game actually got me to be invested into the Digimon community, and at the moment I am going back and watching the anime series again. Hopefully the success of this game lets Bandai Namco know that we would love more Digimon games, especially on PC. I would love to see a lot of the older games from Digimon World on Steam as well as the upcoming Digimon Survive. 

Of course this is still an early review, so my opinions could change. Some major pros go out to the story, and the game's mechanics. I love the side quests as they are cute and the main story so far is quite the mystery. Some cons though are the graphics, which they look a little dated.

When deciding whether or not to get this game, I remember back to the old DS game, and while it was enjoyable its gameplay was ultimately very shallow and the story was very basic. 
Cyber Sleuth, at least the original game, was such a drastic improvement that I was initially blown away, and was very happy with overall game and satisfied by the end. The gameplay is actually deep enough that paying attention to types and attributes is extremely important, especially on hard difficulty. The more mature story was also a welcome change, though it takes a bit to get going. But I did like the characters at the start and they were charming enough that I was invested into the story through these characters. The 3D and graphics were also really good and every digimon has their own unique animation for the actions they can take, including a signature move, which often has a homage in that the digimon would use it in the way shown in the anime, which was a very nice touch.
There were a few disappointments however. The farm island system, while it has more useful options, lost its element of customisation. You can't name islands anymore and they can't be unique in any themes from one another. There are also a lot of translation errors at which I was very confused at multiple points at what they just said. However, this didn't detract too much as the important stuff was translated alright, but this was quite sloppy and could have used more effort into the translation. Exploration is not as fun as basically all dungeons look like some version of Cyberspace, with no connection to the region and the kind of digimon you find there like in the older games. I should also mention that there is no english dub but since I've played a lot of JRPGs this didn't bother me.
Hacker's Memory, however, left me with very mixed feelings. While I'm playing it right after the first game, so I don't feel like it needed to make any huge changes or improvements, the story just left me very disappointed. There are a lot of welcome gameplay changes, such as speeding up hacking animations, domination battles and a far better side quest interface. Since the game took place at the same time as the original, all I wanted from the story was for it to not get too ambitious and break the setting and its characters. Which unfornately it did. There's a certain plot element that feels so forced and like the writers wanted to make the conflict large scale even though this would inherently detract from the overall setting and story. Not to mention they make the mistake of contradicting its ""digimon are alive"" message through this plot element and characters' failing to react properly. This bothers me because digimon has already had this problem ruin its anime for me, and the attempt to make the story more mature just makes it more juvenile in this game.
Ultimately I was very happy with the original Cyber Sleuth on its own even with its sloppy translation, and I'm hoping they continue making games in that direction, with more mature story but more importantly a well written story. Hacker's Memory had decent characters and could have had as good a story had they dropped the plot element that breaks the setting.
Overall I'd say this is a good competitor to pokemon now that GameFreak seem to have made no real attempts at innovation or effort into their franchise while Digimon has made substantial improvements for the most part. Looking forward to the next game, and hopefully the writing improves on Cyber Sleuth's foundation.",1613945600,1613945848,True,4,0,0.575835466384887695,0,True,False,False

The game has a few negatives in my eyes - the amount of unskippable pieces of filler dialogue, the framerate chugs during dialogue and transitions, sparse variety of locations/environments, lack of character customization for the first game(seriously, the male character is so ugly!!) as well as disappointing translation continuity/no english dub.

Pros
1. Gameplay isn't bad, can be challenging on hard
2. Story isn't bad, just simple
3. Digivolving can be done somewhat easily, just takes some time to map out the evolution tree for enough Digimon to know where to go
4. Game runs well and looks great for the most part

Cons

1. My biggest complaint about the game is the localization team for this game is garbage, they missed clear place holder text for items, they wrote the English dialogue in a very bland way that makes what would be a good story terrible and worst of all they added dialogue in that screams to the heavens ""I see you play games for fun, well, EFF YOUR ESCAPISM""

2. Gameplay is grindy and can be repetitive on top of it not always being intuitive, while they have tutorials in game they don't explain things like how to raise certain stats like ABI until well after you would have wanted to be grinding it, exp is low and can be a pain to grind without a certain exp boosting Digimon or the right items on your farms and lastly the combat system isn't bad, just is not rewarding enough to incentive you to ""master"" it and lastly you can easily miss where they tell you to go and may end up wandering around for a bit before figuring it out.

3. The side missions are boring for the most part, I had fun with a few of them, but as a whole they could have been better, they are mostly split between go to ""ZONE - X"" and beat ""CHARACTER/S"" or go to ""ZONE - X"" and find ""LOST ITEM FOR DIGIMON Y""

4. Lastly game is fucking loud even playing on 10% volume for every sound option is still really loud and most annoying is there is no way to turn down the volume on the main menu making it obnoxiously loud and annoying

Final Thoughts

Overall not the worst game I have ever played for Digimon, just not one of the better ones, can't recommend it at full price, but would say grab it when it is on sale if you have the chance, but might be worth for the nostalgia I had the most fun when I, while picking Digivlolutions at random, would stumble upon a Digimon that remind me of something from the shows. Some flaws may be to big for some players to enjoy so if you are on the fence about getting the game I would highly recommend watching gameplay to see if you can stomach them, otherwise save your cash.",1613794905,1613794905,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is riddled with many, many and I truly mean MANY, translation errors and overall sloppiness in regards to them. I can't recommend this game because it became so mind-numbingly BORING and so tedious very quickly.

When I first started the game, I was greeted with two options on my screen. On the left was Hackers Memory and on the right was Cyber Sleuth. Coming into this game blind, not knowing anything about it (I didn't even realise it was two games in one), I had no clue what one to pick first. The description didn't really do a good enough job to tell me what to pick first.

So being English, I assumed the one of the left was probably the safe choice since that's how things usually go. I was wrong. I should've picked Cyber Sleuth on the right, but before I realised this, I was several hours into Hackers Memory and didn't want to stop. So I decided to soldier on.

At first I was really enjoying it, the story in the beginning was actually pretty interesting and I enjoyed the characters. However all of the side quests and ""important"" quests you're forced to complete on the message board got very boring and tedious super quick. After each chapter, you're forced to basically complete several dull, mostly uninteresting quests before the main story actually advances.

It just became such a pain to progress the game after a few hours into it. At first it looked like the game took some inspiration from the Persona series, but their implementation of its similar formula is an empty, hollow experience in comparison.

The different areas in the real world you can go to are mostly empty with uninteresting NPCs to interact with. They mostly serve as filler for you to walk through during side quests to get from A to B to talk to someone.

The in-game phone texting system was the absolute worst. The translations for all of the messages and the choices you are able to select from are ridiculously inaccurate and most of the time nothing makes sense. If they weren't so terrible, I probably would've tolerated and enjoyed this game more by being more immersed in the world. But instead, I kept being brought out of it by being so confused from some of the responses I got that had no relation to what I said in the texts.

This was the sequel I played first. If the sequel was this bad, I can't imagine how Cyber Sleuth will be.

The cutscenes were so very boring and uninspired. They played more like a visual novel but somehow worse. The cutscenes in this game literally consist of a few seconds cinematic shot of characters walking into a room or area, and then freezing the scene as a still image while all of the character models are floating in front of you screen, using repetitive animations as they talk.

There are some cutscenes in the game, but they're few and far between, and only usually lasts several seconds. This game just screams laziness to my eyes.

Also, despite Digimon being able to talk, and some having voiced lines, the majority of Digimon never talk or say anything outside of perhaps a grunt or something during one of their ultimate attack moves. When they do talk, it's always either one important Digimon to the main story, or several Digimon talking during one of the boring side quests that are unvoiced.

Even after beating the main story in Hackers Memory, I felt that it was very lackluster in the end. It was not worth the 67 hours it took me to beat it. I don't know if I'll play Cyber Sleuth, if I do, I think I need to take a break first because this one ended up becoming too much of a chore and pain to beat in the end.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game for its story. It was all very boring.",1612745557,1612745557,False,5,0,0.494305789470672607,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros:[/b][list]
[*]Contains Waifus
[*]Value (2 games + all DLC & preorder bonuses)
[*]Traditional turn-based combat system (think Pokémon/Final Fantasy)
[*]Digimon 3D models look great!
[*]Huge roster of 341 Digimon including familiar original characters
[*]Each Digimon has their own signature move
[*]Non-linear Digivolution system which allows the player to obtain the Digimon they want
[*]Requires strategy in the form of team building in order to use certain hacking skills & defeat bosses
[*]Certain mature elements in the story show how Digimon has aged with its original audience
[*]Playing in 4K is a nice touch considering this is a PlayStation Vita/PS4 port

[b]Cons:[/b][list]
[*]No autosave function so save often
[*]Extremely lengthy sections of IRRELEVANT UNSKIPPABLE DIALOGUE
[*]Instances of poor translation within the aforementioned IRRELEVANT UNSKIPPABLE DIALOGUE
[*]Grinding segments (unnecessary after obtaining a certain experience-boosting Digimon)
[*]Extremely linear dungeons with minimal puzzles to solve
[*]The setting of Hacker’s Memory is almost identical to Cyber Sleuth & adds hardly any new environments for the player to explore which is boring
[*]A few grindy & missable achievements which may irritate the completionist

[b]Review:[/b]
I'm a Pokémon fan (new to Digimon) and these games were recommended to me around the release of Pokémon: Sword & Shield on the basis of GameFreak sh****** the bed by severely cutting the roster of available Pokémon and the incredibly underwhelming graphics which is frankly unacceptable from the world's highest grossing multimedia franchise.

Comparatively developer h.a.n.d., Inc. went above and beyond my expectations with Digimon Cyber Sleuth/Hacker’s Memory, the core gameplay is there and it's fun, so much so that after playing these games I would consider myself a fan of this franchise. I can tell that a lot of attention to detail has gone into these games, from the 3D models to the fantastic combat animations and Digivolution as a whole.

Which leads me to the story, which was easy to follow, had an acceptable level of depth but never took itself too seriously, throwing in amusing lines where you might expect them. It was interesting seeing how the events of each game tied in with each other over the course of my respective playthroughs.

HOWEVER this game is let down needlessly by the sheer volume of IRRELEVANT UNSKIPPABLE DIALOGUE, no matter how you try and spin it mashing through walls of text is NOT FUN. I understand that the developers are trying to tell a story, I suppose that if I’m comparing these games to Pokémon I’d say that's where this game is seriously flawed. Pokémon also follows a story but it's more like going on a Journey with your monster pals and you have a certain level of freedom to explore the world on your own terms. In this game F*** YOU you’re going to read until you like it, which ends up being never because you’re just tolerating it to get to the actual gameplay.

In my opinion there was some wasted potential here, maybe the devs were misguided trying to push the uncompromising story down the players throat? Instead they could’ve eased up and let the combat system carry its weight some more, anyway you can decide if you play this game for yourself. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed these games and they are definitely worth picking up for the price, if you’re looking to scratch that monster collecting itch then look no further.

Also the main menu scene omg my ears hurt. IT'S SO FREAKING LOUD.

I do actually feel like I need to plan my next move, which is good for a turn-based game. Party comp actually feels like it matters, and that I should explore my options more than just picking a random team and clearing the game with it, like I did in the DS games. When compared to the DS games or Digimon World 3, this game feels like it took what both of those games did right and experimented with that.

While I will recommand this game, I will give here one of the biggest problem I have with this game. To put it simply, this game fucked up the digivolution system and progression system compared to previous turn based digimon games (World DS, dawn and dusk)

Bandai, you are supposed to update and overhaul the system each time, keep what work and remove what didn't, not modify it to stupidity:

1) Digivolution are not trees anymore, instead, they are interconnected train tracks. Exemple : Botamon -> Koromon -> Agumon -> Tyrannomon, then while devolving -> Agumon black -> Tsumemon -> Kuramon.
This system mean that technically, any digimon can end up as any other digimon with enough time. Which coupled with the fact you can't place a fixed pseudo to the digimon (it change each form change), you can only evolve or devolve one level at a time without seeing the whole tree and there is no indication of a form that was already reached previously by one digimon make very hard to follow one growth specifically.
Its even stupider because there is exactly 5 baby forms and 12 in-training forms exclusives to babies, why didn't make an exclusive tree by this point adding three more form each level?

2.1) But while there is this whole possibility system, the fact almost nothing is kept between forms make the whole system useless. In previous games, you could keep active and passive skills, in this game, only actives one, which is BS as you can only keep fives, each early active skill have a better alternatives at high level (Ultimate to Ultra) and usually a Mega form already have 5 skills to learn already perfect for it. There is some exception, yes, but it usually concern digimon you keep for their passive skill.

2.2) Devolving only matter for one statistic (Abi) which in previous game determined the maximum level a digimon could reach, which was important because next forms would have a level prerequisite to digivolve to it. In this game, Abi is independant and only matter because the form you want to reach require an certain Abi number

2.3) Neither stats nor growth are conserved when devolving. In previous game, you would keep 10% of the growth in stats when devolving and more, the new growth would be better. It is not the case in this game where each form have fixed statistics to their level, meaning level is almost more important than form, a level 1 Mega would lose to a level 30 champion, while the farm become the only way to augment stats individualy.

All these problems mean you are not encouraged to devolving and think your growth path and instead rush the form you want, which isn't possible anyway because there is a limitation to party size while requiring you to have always 4 digimons in the team to progress in the story (hack skills that are story needed are dependant of your team composition)

3) You can't digivolve from the main menu. You need to go back to the farm each time you want to. Which is completely assanine. It completely kill the scenario timings, how can I keep a serious investment in the story when I need to backtrack in the middle of chapters each time I want to change the form of one of my team member, which need to be done when you encounter a new hack obstacle? That they limit it to mons left in the farm, ok, but all of them ? And you can only change one level to another? why ?

4) the main menu isn't ergonomic, intuitive or even explained enough. I didn't count the number of times I had to do a google search to find how to do basic things like change a mon name or add equipment to them. heck, the simple fact they had to separate changing the team order and modifing a digimon menu (name, skills and equipments) in two different menus BEFORE selecting a digimon should show that.",1611300620,1611300620,True,3,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

So what this comes down to ultimately - for me - is price. At the time if my writing this, the game is $50 on the steam store. In my opinion, paying $50 for this game is far too steep for a JRPG that has such a bad story that I feel actively punished for trying to pay attention to it.

A Semi-Open World game where you can travel to various place trough location selection menu. The turn-based gameplay is enjoyable with some strategy required to defeat some specific enemy boss. The graphic is Okay because this game is only a ported version of PS-Vita game so the character texture is already upgraded but some background texture are blurry in this version because they don't get upgraded. The Story is GREAT but be warned that before you get to actually play the game sometimes the dialogues takes a long time. You get to experience the Main Story as a Cybersleuth (from the protagonist point of view) and the story of what happened in another point of view (hacker's memory). The Level design is not bad even though it is not great. Because this is a semi-open world game you only able to go to specific area trough location selection which in My Opinion decrease more than half of the fun of playing Digimon games. Don't expect world exploration experience like you had experienced in older digimon games i.e. DIgimon World 3 (Digimon World 2003), Digimon Dusk & Dawn. There are NO Minigames in this game.
There are 350 of digimons you can get with each unique technique animation and walking animation (the digimon you use walk behind you), some evolution have a very specific requirement to evolve and some can be easily evolved. You can only collect Digimon medals to complete the achievements. The PVP arena is dead you can only play against NPC to get the Online PVP Achievements. The side quest is mainly looking for objects or fight a digimon so it is not that fun, there are only a few of very specific side quest that I think really great.

Overall, this game is Great but not the greatest. I rate it 7.8/10 but IF you are a digimon fan then this game is easily a 8.5/10 for you!",1590451821,1610378255,True,39,1,0.79408186674118042,1,True,False,False

The game is long enough, if that counts for anything, and there are actually two games in one, so you get ""value"", if that's what you care about. The high points of the game more or less stop there, though.

* The translation is a mess. Whether they are in casual conversations, talking about plot points, or even naming locations, you can count on there being at least one awkward, out of place line.

* A lot of iconic Digimon are relegated to post-game for a normal player due to their high ""ABI"" requirements, which you can only get by digivolving and de-digivolving.

* The gameplay consists of you one-shotting every random encounter in the game. On normal mode, you will continue to steamroll the boss, but on hard mode, your entire team will get OHKO'd by an AOE attack.

* The Digimon don't learn enough moves to have interesting movesets. Technically, any digimon can learn any move, but, like the ABI requirements, this is achieved by going through hoops and grinding to find a path of evolutions and de-volutions that will get you to the goal. If you're playing the game normally, you'll end up with one or two usable attacks, and then a bunch of terrible support skills or attacks with base power so low it isn't even worth using if you're hitting for the 1.5x weakness.

I like Digimon, and have fond memories of playing Dawn/Dusk (and some others) on the DS.

As a final note, I will say the animated cutscenes in this game look great. I honestly wish this game was just a 13 or 26-episode anime. It'd be much better.",1610181257,1610181257,False,9,0,0.481388300657272339,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Good battles
-Solid turn based combat
-Lots of Digimon to evolve and collect
-Some good character designs
-Two games for the price of one
-Includes all DLC and preorder DLC that was released for both games

Cons:
-Mashing both games together sounds cool until you realize its a hassle to switch between them
-Some Digimon require you to beat either one of the games in order to unlock their evolutions which sounds cool on paper, letting you get some more replayability, but feels more like an unnecessary gate towards progress
-No new functionality (as far as I've seen) for full camera movement was added in the re-release

It was an exciting prospect to be sure, but with no actual pre-release build-up before the game mysteriously dropped seemingly out of nowhere on release day, there were some worrying warning signs present as well.  So how does this first foray into the PC market for this franchise measure up?

I guess I might as well start off with the rough parts. The first strike against it is rather subjective, but the game is by far and away too easy on the default difficulty. Granted, It's not really an issue since you can just turn it up to hard, However, one thing I noticed when I did temporarily turn down the difficulty for a few of the bonus bosses is that there really is no middle ground. Hard can be gruelingly tough at the end-game, yet turning the difficulty down will immediately return the game to a state where you can throw all caution to the wind and still win effortlessly. I feel like there really should be some sort of level between normal and hard.

Aside from that, the localization keeps flip-flopping from being solid to devolving into a mish-mash of incoherently mistranslated lines that show up even at plot-important moments and completely takes you out of things, The characters will sometimes refer to your MC with the wrong gendered pronouns. Then they'll occasionally refer to Digimon by using their Japanese names. And then there's the times where multi-choice answers will bleed into each other, creating total confusion over what you're even supposed to pick. My favorite part is the repeated occasions where characters will refer to the eldritch horrors you fight as if they're the digimon ""Bakemon"" because they used the term ""Bakemono"" (""monster"") in the original script. Granted, this doesn't take away from some really effective moments and plot-twists that occur over the course of the story, but it is a blemish on what is otherwise a surprisingly well-handled mature take on the franchise.

In terms of gameplay, I only really have two gripes: one is that I feel that the tutorials aren't quite as thorough as I would've liked (the ABI stat is literally the most important stat, yet the game completely fails to emphasize its existence beyond a cryptic line about how ""de-evolving a mon will change its abilities""). Lastly, there's the literally endless supply of generic fetch-quests, though they're entirely optional, so it's hardly worth mentioning.

At any rate, none of this takes away from the fun of unraveling the vast branches of the evolution tree to discover new creatures or the enjoyment factor of creating a team with support skills and affinities that allow them to cover and strengthen each other. Nor does it take away from the quirky, yet often shocking and poignant story. The gameplay may feel a bit too centered around tradition JRPG-style combat compared to the more unique monster-raising gimmick that defined the earlier games in this long-running franchise for some, but the multi-layered weakness system that allows you to stack damage bonuses when targeting several weaknesses with one attack gives the combat a fun and unique twist that allows it to stand on its own among similar games like the Shin Megami Tensei series.

In short: whether you're in the mood for a traditional RPG or a monster collection adventure, you can do far worse than Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth.",1608383649,1609608540,True,2,0,0.516924858093261719,0,True,False,False

While it is possible that Hacker's Memory could be better, I believe most of issues as far as gameplay itself would remain as it is the same game under the hood, just with a different coat of paint***

I'm a fan of the old Digimon Adventure anime (01 and 02). I grabbed this on sale really hoping for something I could sink my teeth into, and unfortunately, I'm not happy with what I've playing.

First the positives. The Digimon models look amazing. The game supports 4K resolution (maybe higher on better systems, but I don't have a monitor nor graphics card capable of any better, nor do most people). It shows. The Digievolution mechanics are what you would expect from a Digimon Story game. This was the part that enticed me and what made me somewhat interested in buying on sale.

Now the negatives. Keep in mind, this game has alot of positive steam reviews, so this may be more of a warning to people like me than to tell people not to buy this game at all. 

The graphics out side of the Digimon models leave alot to be desired. I'd say if you like the anime art style, maybe it'll work for you, but it's not a good execution of the art style in a video game. The enviroments you move through are lackluster at best. Combined with problems I'll bring up later in the review, it just really has become the reason I end up putting the controller down when I get down on the rest of the game.

Gameplay is... classic, but not in a good way. The battles are good enough, the variety of Digimon that you have and are out in the field keep things interesting for it, with a few in training Digimon at the bottom before fanning out into alot of rookie and higher rank digimon. However, where Pokemon kind of hides it's rock paper scissor mechanic of weakness behind a 19X19 (or whatever it's at now), Digimon Story works on essentially 3 RPS rings, with one for type (data pwns vaccine, which pwns virus, which pwns data) and two for attributes(fire pwns plant, which pwns water, which pwns fire) (ground pwns electric, which pwns wind, which pwns ground), with light and dark attributes pwning each other. Each Digimon's basic attack uses whatever attribute it is for damage, but most of the time you're using skills which can vary and use attributes for defence. Digivolutions either become a exercise in plotting out your evolution line in advance (not my preferred way of playing a RPG) or just evolving into what type/attribute combination you need at the time to fill holes in your travelling party. 

The next big glaring issue for me is the overworld travel. It feels like someone copy pasted the layout from generic 8 or 16 bit RPG and thought that if you pretty it up and set the camera at awkward isometric angles that noone would notice. Add in that it's scene based locations rather than a open world map, and it gets old very quickly. This may appeal to some, but I'd rather see someone downgrade this game into a 16-bit top down rpg if that's the route they are going to take.

The story so far is reallllllllly lackluster. The initial hook is neat, and part of me wants to know where it goes, but you very quickly end up out side of it dealing with cringey storylines and translations mixed into the slice of life genre anime that seems to be popular as of late. Digimon Adventure this is not. Expect overly sexualized girls constantly posed for the most amount of exposure. If it wasn't EVERY FEMALE CHARACTER you run into posed like this in dialog, I probably wouldn't care. Unfortunately, reading the dialog and listening to the Japanese voices, I'd say it was an unfortunate intentional choice that they made. 

TL;DR: I wouldn't call it a horrible game. Lackluster and mediocre however would sum it up nicely. 

Graphics 6/10 - Generally okay, it looked good enough to fool me on the rest of the content. Also Anime titties.

Gameplay 4/10 - I wanted to like this gameplay, but it's gets boring at the 6 hour mark, I pushed through thinking it would get better, but it's just not that fun :/

Story so far 3/10 - It could have had me, but I spent this morning trying to get to a hook that I would care about, but I'm done. I just don't care enough to be bothered to find out what happens to the main character or their friends. But I just spent the last 8 hrs on this game playing because I bought it on sale after being on my wishlist for a while and thought if I just power through it may be worth it. 

Overall 5/10 - It's just a mediocre monster collecting JRPG. A pretty looking one, but not a good one. Don't buy at full price.",1609467066,1609467066,False,0,0,0.412063449621200562,0,True,False,False

Cyber Sleuth feels like a substantial upgrade, but at its core feels very much the same. Soundtrack is great, and while there aren't quiet as many digimon as I had hoped (only 249 according to google), the models are faithful to the digimon that are represented. Combat is typical for a JRPG, with two different Rock-Paper-Scissors wheels based on a Digimon's attribute and what type of Digimon it is, which can make or break a boss battle if you run from enemy encounters too much. The characters themselves are decent, but I wouldn't go as far as to say stellar. The dialogue is VERY long winded at times, but if you speed through it you will miss details like where you are supposed to go.

While I enjoyed this game, there is one caveat: Whoever was responsible for the English Translation of the text did a half-assed job. While most of the text is fine, there are parts, especially in the the Digiline feature, where it feels like the people talking are having different conversations.

The party and evolution systems are alright, although the evolution system would've been better if it had maybe fewer digimon and more linear evolution to keep it somewhat canonical to the series instead of countless branches.
DNA-evolution depends solely on the stats of one digimon and the friendship% of both (stats don't combine) which if your ABIlity stat isn't maxed, you just made yourself more work to be able to use that 'mon and will likely have to de-digievolve and grind another fodder. So be careful not to feed a good mon.
The story is alright. Would have been cheaper to make an anime out of it though.
Play through Cybersleuth first, then start Hacker's memory, you'll get some extra items, your registered mons, medaille collection carry through and you'll already know the ""main"" stroy since HM is a side story that takes places at the same time as the first game.

Took me 135 hours to compleate the game 100% doing every Side quest and main story events including the Avalon server end-game dungeon in hackers memory , Got all 341 digimon but did not finnish the medals cus i can't be assed.

Now for the classic pros and cons 

Pros: 

1 : Its a GOOD digimon game, and they are rare, the last digimon game i considerd good ended in the Play station 1 era,

2: The game has lovable charcters with a above avrage story ( for the most parts) to enojoy as a rpg fan. 

3: Both the 2 diffrent storys CyberSleuth and Hackers Memory are good stories and can be enjoyed speretly but the 2 stories make the most sense when both are finnished.

4: Most of once favorite digimon from any of the seasons of the show even up to Digimon XrosWars/ Fusions are in the game.

5: The OST is a bit forgetable i can't name songs by name but there are a few hidden bangers in the game 

6: Some cutsceens or even special moves from some digimon look absolutly amazing, The Animation is way beyond avrage some exampels beaing ""Insert charcter name"" Memory server, and The Under Koowolon flying around in a ""abounded part of a server "" with neon blue theme is quit appealing.

7: Some side quests ( sadly veary Few) are extreamly intresting or leave a lasting dent on the game  one beaing a quest where you have to decided to either leave a market alone and keep using there servics or take it down compleatly for a moral victory but lose accses to it 

Cons: 

1: All Digimon are ""viable"" up until the late game quests/Bosses where you have a ""INT or DEF Penetration squad or you will be doing 0 fucking damage"" And sadly only a few of the 300+ digmon have them and are mega lvl so most peoples teams look the same.

2: Even tho the 2 stories are seprated and have diffrent missions they both go in the same areas and almost 90% of the assets for Hackers memory are copy pasted from cybersleuth , so after finnishing either of the storymodes its a Drag to play the same game again all over with small changes exluding story 

3: 90% of the side quests are exactly the same on either playthrough , Go to person , Somthing happening , Bad person or bad digimon somtimes both are att fault , Beat them up , Finnish mission, 

4: The ""late game "" for hackers Memory IS A FUCKING JOKE, you are hard locked behind having to money grind to get stat boosting items that are extreamly over priced to fight a ""gaurding of the last area"" that is 10x harder then the final boss of said area.   And the area that leads up to the boss in said area is a fucking joke cus by that point in the game you can just turn of Random encounters and run to the end for a anti climatic boss. 
Im so fucking dissapoionted by the "" hard Final area"" after i beat it i verbaly out loud said on discord "" the fuck that can't be the end right ?  noooo way that was the final boss of the ""end game ""

5: This game in the late game is GRIND HEAVY There are 2 digimons : Platinum numamon and King Namemon , 1 gives boosted exp and 1 gives boosted money, If you get a party ( 3 of them) of both and slap usb drives ( equip items) you can grind a full team of 11 mega digimon that are lvl 99 with above avrage skills in a few hours,  But the money grind you need for hackers memory to beat the ""gaurdian"" IS INSANE, 

The most money you can get before you beat him is around 37000 per fight, And you need a minimum of 4 fights to buy 1 Stat boosting item ,you need around 15 / 18 diffrent stat boosting items to get 1 digimon to ""good stats"" now . After 4 fights with max money gear net you generaly around 148k. 
1 stat boosting item is 100k , So you need 1 milion 800k for 1 digimon , That X 11 is 11 mil 800k, 

you need to grind over 120 fights to just get the stats just to accses the late game, Even more money is needed if you want to speed it up by giving your "" farmers"" stat boosts so they kill stuff faster.

BUT EVEN WITH ALL THE THINGS i mention there are small nitpicks i have with the game , Unskipable cutsceens, Some digimon not beaing able to reach there ""intended"" evolution line even at lvl 99 ( max lvl) and needs stat boosting items to just get them , etc etc 

I still love this game, It was a blast playing , and thanks to 2 monitors i was able to get past the annoying grind tho i am used to long grinding sessions cus i used to play Black Dessert Online (don't play that fucking game ever ) 

So i do recomend it if you like or even love digimon , 

If you don't love digimon get it on sale and give it a try , but don't expect it to be the greatest rpg or even digimon rpg out there,

So many reviews here on Steam said that this is better than Pokemon. That's just not true by any stretch. The Pokemon franchise has been stale lately, but they are still much more playable that this game.

Unlike Pokemons, Digimons feel very detached from the world. They have cool shapes and forms but why? Pikachu has that tail to defend itself in the bug-infested forests. Why does this Digimon look like a mecha dragon if it is just a computer program? Other than to justify a monster collecting game. I feel like they should have stuck with the digital idea, rather than go off into this parallel universe nonsense. For a game about digital monster, Digimon is less sci-fi and more of a fantasy story that just involve computers. Hacking in this game has no resemblance to actual hacking, but is portrayed more like digital magic. 

For the most part, collecting and evolving Digimon are still kinda fun. What kills the game for me is the excessive amount of what I call ""Walking and Talking simulator"" in this game. Seriously, you are forced to do sooooooo much of walking around ugly maps and talk to people. In one mission, I counted that I had to talk to 19 people in 7 different locations just to get to a dungeon that lasted 10 minutes. To make this worse, the game is extremely bad at telling you where to go. There is no function that reminds you of where you need to go. The game also has a fixed POV so sometimes things are difficult to see. Sometimes you are required to talk to certain people for other people to show up but the game never tells you that.

What makes the Pokemon game special is that it creates a world full of interesting creatures that you want to explore and let you loose to do your own exploring and capturing. Digimon, on the other hand, keeps getting in the way of the monster-collecting and raising part with these corny conversations. The game thinks their writing is so witty and funny so they keep interrupting you with these corny conversation. I finally quit the game after something like this. I just finished a dungeon and was super eager to get back to the lab to mold my team. But the conversations keep going on and on and on. This Kyoko chick would not shut up even though all she ever says is just recapping recent events. And voila, I get to chase down a few more 2D sprites and read their crap.

Yes, it's that good.


[spoiler] I've  actually always liked Digimon a little more  than pokemon, ( i used to watch the cartoon every morning before going to school i still have my digimon cards from since when i was little) the problem is, for some reason, japan didn't bothered pushing them alot oversea until now ( maybe cause pokemon had more success by being a simpler "" little baby preschool time"" franchise and  Digimons are more adultish/complex lean towards more adult themes so they sold less? Perhaps? tbch though,don't get me wrong, jokes aside i actually love both franchises almost equally, i just think it's a  shame they didn't have a good chance to have a clean competition in the west giving us little to no franchise variety).

They are both super simple systems but if you ignore them you might hit a grind wall for an hour or two while you rebuild your Digimon. 

Building teams is also really fun and the Advantage Triangle (RPS) is simple but effective and Digimon abilities can REALLY turn a battle around for you if you pay attention to who you are putting on your team.

This game is actually two games in one, in which an event is seen from two different perspectives. It's very likable, though when playing the second game it does get a bit bothersome that certain locations are reused. However, I just love this game. The story, the animation, the characters and most importantly: the Digimon.
A downside of this game is the fact that your choice in avatars is very limited, as is your choice in the customization of your avatar.

I remembered that there were a lot of mentions of this game as one of the best Digimon games, but does it really true? More on the review.

Note that this game contains two games: [b]Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth[/b] (which I'll refer to as [i]original game[/i]), and [b]Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Hacker's Memory[/b] (which I'll refer to as [i]Hacker's Memory[/i]), an extension of the original game from another perspective in the same timeline.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- 2 different stories to play with minor story branching
- 341 Digimons to ""collect""
- 2 difficulties
- Proper team building is required to beat some bosses

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Fixed camera
- Reused map on optional cases
- Sometimes progression isn't clear enough
- Poor translation

[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]
[b]Yes.[/b]
[i]If you like ""monster collecting"" games and turn-based RPGs that require team building, you'll have a blast with this game. The game also has a hard mode if you are looking for some challenge.[/i]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game uses 3D models with anime-looking style. Expressions are shown clearly as characters are moving around and changing their expressions whenever they are talking. Some cutscenes are also shown in 2D animations, giving more anime feels.

Unlike other Digimon games, this game mostly takes place in the real world and man-made systems. The ""real world"" takes place in several regions in Japan and I could recognize some sceneries based on the real thing. However, all man-made system maps look similar to each other with a slight change in color at some locations. Some maps are also reused despite them being referred to as different locations, giving more redundancy to the area.

[h1]Story[/h1]
If you have watched any Digimon animes before, the story is similar to those. The story will start slow to unravel more of the game's background and add more screentime to the character's relationships. The main story will proceed at some point and things will become more serious from there.

It might be due to the poor translation, but sometimes I found it difficult to understand some of the complex concepts. The game also has a lot of typos and strange word choices in some places. Luckily, the mistakes are still tolerable and you'll still be able to understand the story despite all that.

[h1]The Game[/h1]
[b]Mechanics[/b]
This game is a bit overwhelming at first since you need to learn a lot to understand the game. Luckily, some of them are explained at the beginning of the game although you still need to figure out how to do some things by yourself. The controls which are geared more towards controller users are also not helpful as you have to read the instructions based on the controller input. Luckily, it doesn't take long to understand everything and a simple google search will help you to understand the complicated things that are semi-hidden from the game.

[b]Collecting Digimons[/b]
This game has a similar ""capturing"" mechanic as [b]Digimon World: Dawn[/b], [b]Digimon World: Dusk[/b], and [b]Digimon World DS[/b]. You'll gain a certain percentage of a Digimon whenever you encounter them and you can convert them whenever it reaches 100% or higher. Your Digimon will have a low maximum level at first, which can be increased by either digivolving or devolving them.

Since Digimon has no linear digivolution path, you can digivolve and devolve them to whatever you want. You also can use one Digimon to unlock every entry in the [i]Field Guide[/i], which is equal to [i]Pokédex[/i] in Pokémon games, if you want although that will be pointless since you can take up to 11 Digimons with you, with up to 3 active Digimons in battle. The best part? Inactive party members will gain the same amount of EXP as the active ones.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2322795295

It didn't take long before I got obsessed to complete the [i]Field Guide[/i]. Leveling up isn't that difficult if you know what to do that I almost completed the [i]Field Guide[/i] when I finished the original game. Most of my playtime was spent in going back and forth between [i]Digilab[/i], a place where you can digivolve and devolve your Digimons, and other places with random encounters.

[b]Combat[/b]
Combat might be a bit difficult at the beginning since healing is expensive and enemies deal a lot of damage. Luckily, it doesn't take long before you gain more party members, turning down the difficulty. You can even defeat most bosses with PlatinumNumemons, a weak Digimon whose sole purpose is only to increase EXP gains, although some optional bosses will require some strategy to beat. The same can't be said for [i]Hacker's Memory[/i] though, since you need more planning to beat some bosses, especially near the end game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2322805348

The game also has an interesting combat mechanic where you can keep up to 20 skill sets and use 6 of them in battle. Some skills can give status ailments to your opponents and although your opponent has the type advantage, you can reverse it with a certain skill, turning the tide of the battle.

The encounter rate is a bit weird though. You'll hardly get any random encounter at some places while some places will give you a random encounter after every few steps. Luckily, you can change the encounter rate with a certain skill if you bring a certain Digimon with you.

[b]Difficulty[/b]
The game has 2 difficulties: normal and hard. The difficulty is just right for me in the normal difficulty although there were times where I had a problem in beating some bosses, resulting in me using items and/or changing party members. Team building is important in this game that you need to use a specific Digimon with a certain skill set to beat some fights, especially for the end game contents.

[b]Problems[/b]
Sometimes, the game gives vague hints on where to go next. Sure, you can get some hints by talking to a certain person or opening the menu, but there are times where those are still not clear enough. Some optional quests also list the wrong location in their description that I had to double-check it with a guide to make sure that I didn't go to the wrong location.

[h1]Specs[/h1]
Intel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Although it's not as amazing as I thought, it's still a great monster collecting game. It was fun completing the [i]Field Guide[/i], especially since some digivolution lines have absurd requirements that you need to pay attention to your Digimon's stats to get them.

The combat mechanic is also well thought with a lot, yet easy to understand mechanics. Sadly, the poor translations, reused maps, and repetitive quests make the game boring from time to time. It's still a great game though, especially with the huge amount of playtime it offers.",1608123041,1608173795,True,155,0,0.921616196632385254,14,True,False,False

Now, you don't need the strongest Digimon to beat either of the games, however it is first nature to work to get the strongest Digimon. The issue comes when you want to get those strong digimon. There's a specific statistic called ABI. And for a lot of these big-name strong digimon (Omnimon, Gallantmon, etc) you need an ABI of 80. It wouldn't be an issue if the only way to get more ABI is to evolve and de-evolve, which can be a HUGE grind. At the current moment of writing this, I have ~141 hours, and a solid 9 of them have been spent grinding the ABI stat for FOUR digimon. It is a really intense and hard grind.

Another issue are some wonky translations. In the Digi-Line (In-game testing for you and your digimon / friends) you can choose responses to prompts given to you by your digimon and friends. Your digimon could be talking about working out in the training islands, just for the response to be about something totally unrelated like food or something. It really can take you out of the mood.

Otherwise, I really love this game! The story captivated me right away, especially with the cute relationships you see develop and the interesting story the main character goes through. I've completed Cyber sleuth and am about half way through Hacker's Memory, And I'm really excited to see the rest of the story through. Note that Hacker's memory is NOT a sequel to CS, but the same story from an outsider's view.

A thing I would like to geek out about is possibly the impact on the franchise these games have had. The models and animations were recycled for the Digimon ReArise phone game (which you should also check out if you liked this game). As well as this, the new 2020 anime has a strangely similar cyber space to the one we see in CSHM, with blue cuboid structures, strange floating buildings and structures, and digimon roaming the area. Of course, it is not exact, but a lot of similar elements can be found if you look hard enough. Which I find very interesting!",1606006723,1606006723,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

That might not sound positive, but this has probably become more so of the childhood dream in a single game, than even Pokemon has over the years.

The game is akin to some very standard RPG games from the past, and for those who are a fan of the playstyle, this hits home almost immediately.  Its easy to understand combat system, and a variety of Digimon at your disposal that can rival the Pokemon games by FAR makes this a game that I wouldn't put any lower on my Top 5 Game's list of my life. 

Fan Favorites like Ophanimon and Omnimon, and even some lesser known or low screen time favorites like SkullMeramon and Neptunemon show and give this alot to choose from, and keep the game from falling short on itself.  A story that, while repetitious with it's quests, manages to throw you a lot of curveballs and keep you guessing amkes it overall a story that hooks you and brings you back for more.  

With the first one, the game seems simple and overall a very calm, silly story line, making it a nice ease in into the games.  With Hacker's Memory, however, it hits home immediately, and brings the entire story to a close, tugging at heart strings and making you question the very fiber of your being and you're led through action after action, watching the story unfold.  

- Is it for everyone?  Young and old, new to the franchise or a long-time fan of the series as a whole, the game brings forth a lot to the table that keeps you entertained and thrilled for hours.  
- Is it recommended?  If i could rate this out of 10 for recommendations, id give it a 12.  Having been a fan of both the franchise, and this style of game, its a definite game to play for ANYONE interested with either aspect.

It’s early 2000’s, imagine waking up every saturday morning, turning your tv on and while eating your breakfast you are watching Digimon’s adventure, that’s what comes to my mind when talking about Digimon. When it comes to this saga, my experience is limited to the first three TV shows and the tamagotchi Digidevices because in terms of video games Pokemon was more popular than anything else, that doesn’t mean I didn’t know there were Digimon games out there, but I played them much later and even then I still thought Pokemon was more consistent, that hasn’t changed, One follows a very specific formula and the other is a hit and miss most of the time, however, Cyber Sleuth is the proof that when done right, Digimon is big and can be really impressive. 

When we talk about cyber sleuth we must keep in mind that it’s a mix of a few formulas, it has resemblances to the original Digimon structure, which I will comment later on this review, a bit of Shin Megami Tensei, because there’s some sort of social link (but not really deep) and of course a big chunk of Pokemon when it comes to catch, training and battle with your team. 

The world now depends a lot on EDEN, a digital world representation in which people can not only spend their free time but also work freely, we are Takumi, an EDEN user who, while chatting with some friends in this social network, receives an invitation to the lowest levels of this digital world, there we will meet Nokia and Arata, two friends from the chat room that also got invited and accepted going to Kowloon, this area is well known for being crowded by hackers and other perils, in this incursion the team get in contact with a mysterious entity that give them control over the Digimon (which are considered programs inside this digital world and not living beings) but something else attacked them, resulting in a very rare condition for Takumi.

After being attacked, Takumi now possesses a half-digital body that lets him jump between the real world and the digital world when he wants, thanks to this he knows Kyoko, a detective that will open our perspective and show us that there’s something much bigger behind Takumi’s condition, EDEN and Kamishiro, the company behind this service. 

The world is not ready for what it’s about to happen. 

This stories are, well, very unique in the sense that  they go from 0 to 100 in a blink, to put it into perspective, it goes from “repair my air conditioner” to “attack and dethrone god” and it’s not even a joke, you will understand the further you go in this story.
Characters are well defined, each one has a very particular personality and while you might not like the anime mood, they are not bad at all, every arc is well connected and while there are some twists here and there that are not well introduced, the final result is a very competent story with well defined characters, in a sense it’s a very classic Digimon story in which things start in a very little scale but then everything will get much much bigger and deep than anyone saw coming. 

The story introduces a lot of the concepts explored in other media such as the Tamers, the digi-universe and everything is all canonical, thanks to the Digimon structure, most of the content created is canonical and works in balance with the rest of the contect, that means what happens in Cyber Sleuth and Hacker’s Memory happened. 

I think I just talked enough about the story, it’s time to jump into more parts of the game starting with the visuals.

Let’s keep in mind this is a game that originally came out on the PSVita so visually it’s not a juggernaut, however, due to the art direction it’s very appealing to the eye, on PC the resolution is much higher and while some details of the map, mostly backgrounds, might look pixelated, the models, the vfx and most of the scenery looks really great.

Digimon models in particular are very well done and detailed and that’s something stunning considering the game features around 340 creatures if we take into consideration Hacker’s Memory that introduces a good number of new creatures, to this is important to add that you can see the three members of your battle team going behind you while walking so it’s a nice touch to being able to see any digimon you want walking alongside you. 

VFX are also a good aspect to take into consideration as every attack is well represented in the game, visually are 1:1 like the shows or movies, nailed them.

The maps are self-contained areas where the action happens, in the real world a few streets and shops will be available in each district, in the digital world a number of dungeons will be available to explore, each area has a very particular style so it doesn’t get specially tiring. 

About gameplay, this game has a few gameplay loops, the simpler ones are the social links, in which we will move our relation with other characters at a very thin level, not so relevant and it’s, in my opinion, a missed opportunity to make something much deeper that could have affected in a good way to other systems, and the other system is detective stuff in which we will have to investigate cases and sometimes we will have to hack and use keywords to find the correct narrative, unfortunately both are, once again, very thin integration of a system that could have been much more interesting at so many levels. 

However what doesn’t disappoint is the combat system and the evolution lines, let me explain this last one, in the shows the digimon can only evolve into one single line, very similar to pokemon, however, originally this wasn’t like that and every digimon had multiple evolution lines so it can become almost every evolution, this is how it works on Cyber Sleuth and let me tell you that it’s an strategic point to manage your own team. 

It makes the experience more dynamic as you might want to digivolve and digi-devolve your team from time to time in order to enhance their stats (trust me, you will have to do this if you want to get some of the most powerful digimon), I recommend you to learn how the farms and the stats work because there’s a lot of data and while it looks complicated, it’s simpler than you might think. 

The other system that works absolutely fantastic is combat, it’s a turn based system in which you will be able to use up to 3 digimon from your team against up to 3 opponents, like every other game of this style, each Digimon has an element that will make it more or less effective against an opponent, it’s your moment to make an strategic team to be balanced for every situation. 

In terms of difficulty I wouldn’t say it’s a difficult game aside from the special challenges (completely optional) but really intense, completely recommended. 

I think it’s a good moment to talk about length, well, the main story is around 40 hours if you want an specific team but it can me shorter if you don’t really care what companions go with you to the battle, in that case you will have still an extensive story but if you are one of those who wants an specific team, you will find the evolution lines process a bit tricky at first but quick once you get how to grind some EXP efficiently using farms and combat zones.

Digimon Cyber Sleuth is a wonderful game, probably the best Digimon game up to date, I consider this one of the games I have enjoyed the most this generation as I really like the saga and because of that I can forgive some things, but if I need to be honest with all of you, this game lacks of depth and you can see it comes from Vita in terms of visuals, is that bad? Absolutely no, but there’s a lot of non-explored potential that hurts a lot, yet I think the final result is an amazing story with great systems and the best representations of the Digimon in a video game (models, movements, evolutionary lines, etc) and because of that I absolutely recommend you to check this game out, play it and hopefully enjoy it.",1605519235,1605519235,True,29,0,0.778842329978942871,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
The protagonist has some fun facial expressions. 
Nostalgia.

Cons: 
Balance - it doesn't exist. The non-boss battles are super easy while boss battles are downright scummy at times. 

Story - It's long, it's linear and while it's interesting enough to keep you engaged it's also pretty cliche and seems to change direction pretty frequently. Whoever you think the final boss might be, they're not. In fact you probably won't meet them until the last chapter. (I wouldn't know. Doubt I'll get there.) 

Variety - The digimon are basically almost all the same. You've got your 'rock paper scissors' types and some elemental types (that really actually just don't matter). As for main stats there's Attack, Defence, Intelligence and Speed. The variation is only really with the stats. Some have attack and defence, some have Int, some have attack and speed. Etc. Otherwise the elemental moves will just have different names but the same effects. Which are 3 levels of physical moves, 3 magic moves then 3 levels of very weak (not at all worth using) AOE moves. Oh, right, each digimon has their own 'signature move' which is usually a powered up version of the standard moves, sometimes with an extra effect (rarely), that costs about 2-3 times as much SP to use.

Progression - Not really any progression systems here. You level up your digimon. Advance them to the next tier. Level them up again. Sometimes you have to demote them to the previous tier to build up an arbitrary counter that unlocks the late game tiers. You can kinda craft your own move-set by advancing and demoting a digimon into a variety of other digimon and learning their moves. (Not the signature moves, just the normal ones so it's not really worth it.) 

Status Effects - I feel I need an extra section, even though I've said a lot about moves already. See, some of them are just straight up useless. Like they don't work, useless. The first one to go is anything that causes the 'sleep' status effect. Bosses become straight up immune to it pretty early on. At the point in the game where I'm at I just don't use status effects any more because they rarely work, and even if they do it's the crap ones like paralysis or stun. Paralysis only actually causes them to miss their turn once every 3-4 rounds and stun bumps them down the timeline by a single slot (which is so worthless that you'd be better of just attacking). Status effects will still work on normal encounter enemies but, like I said, they're already severely under-powered and super easy to beat because the balance in this game is non-existent. 

Boss Design - It's terrible. Absolutely awful. Bosses take far far less damage than anything else in the game, deal far far more damage than anything else in the game and usually have some bullshit special attack that they'll spam. 
Early game boss 'Eater' - Has an attack that will deal heavy damage to your whole group and leaves them asleep afterwards too. Will spam it repeatedly. 
Midgame boss 'Rosemon' - Has a healing move that heals their entire group for more than their max health. They will spam it and enemy digimon have infinite SP, so they can just spam healing forever. 
Mid-late game boss 'bancholeomon' - This is the one that made me put the game down. He has an attack that will straight up immediately kill whoever it hits. The attack also gives him an additional turn. This basically translates to him wiping out your party in a single turn. He's 'less' likely to use it when you've only got one digimon left, but at that point you're just hoping and praying he doesn't use it, which is not the way you want to play a strategy game!

Conclusion: 
This game looks good but really it's very very bad. It has a lot of potential and a lot of systems that could be fun if the developers didn't throw it all in the bin with downright terrible design and balance choices. Honestly, I'm more sad than angry that the game has these issues. I really wanted to enjoy this game. 

Recommendation: Don't buy this game. Go buy digimon Dawn or Dusk for the DS instead. I remember that being a really good game.",1605050169,1605050169,False,3,1,0.396771043539047241,1,True,False,False

The gameplay may remind you a bit of Pokemon on the surface, but that's about it.
While there are mechnics similar (With the X type is strong against the Y type and weak against Z type) the way you manage your Digimon is way different, you can give them equipment to upgrade their stats, so you can specialize a digimon or reduce their weaknesses. As for the battle, it's similar to pokemon, but you have to carefully chose your action based you which digimon's turn it is.
THe digivolution is also one VERY important mechanics as you can digivolve but also regress them to an anterior state, to raise more their base stats and make them digivolve using another path to get different digivolution.
As for the story, they have some interesting plot, some of the characters may be annoying as hell (Looking at you Nokia) but overall, they are ok and somethime gives a good chuckle.

If you enjoyed Digimon as a kid, these games will be right up your alley to kick your nostalgia. Never been into Digimon before? Don't worry! You don't need any prior knowledge of the Digimon universe to play these games - they're both self contained in their own universe with their own characters. 

Battle system is excellent and very reminiscent of Final Fantasy X. Plenty of Digimon to build your party from and lots of experimentation you can do with party combinations. Hard difficulty is challenging without being unfair, and Normal is easy for those who just want to experience the story.

Music is great, characters are relatable (although Hacker's Memory has much better development than Cyber Sleuth). 

One important negative to note is that there is no English dub - both games are with Japanese VO and English text. Unfortunately the translation is a bit spotty at points, particularly in Cyber Sleuth, but not enough to detract from the overall experience.

The Good: Entertaining story with a relatively diverse set of character personalities, and a reasonably large roster of Digimon with some tie-ins to other Digimon games and shows. 
Simplistic mechanics and control scheme that let the game, in the words of Todd Howard, Just Work, with practically zero room for glitches.
No autosave, qucksave,  and it's game over if you loose even a random encounter, so you'd better be up on your manual saves.
The main campaign offers a reasonable difficulty curve and largely abides by the rules it sets up, breaking them only once or twice for specific story purposes(EG: to create a scenario that allows for one of those Anime-cliche ""Inner Strength"" moments)

The Bad: Part of the story does draw from other Digimon games, specifically for the main story Digimon RE: Digitize which was a Japan-only release for the PSP and got a Japan-only rerelease on the 3DS. On the bright side, there is a group out there that has been working on an english translation ISO of RE: Digitize, so that negative will ideally be gone in the near future.
With probably a couple hundred quests, there are a couple that didn't get enough attention and end up leaving the player lost, mainly due to overly brief descriptions in the log.
The grind is real with power leveling practically mandatory if you want to complete the Field Guide or get certain move sets. If you want to power level, get yourself a trio of Platinum Numemon and as many of the XP boost accessories as you can. 
Both sides of the game are opposites in terms of theming for menus and the like, with the difference being akin to Light Theme VS Dark Theme in most apps. Wouldn't be as much of a problem except I'm normally a night owl so playing Cybersleuth was close to staring into a car's high-beams.
Left at default settings, this is probably the loudest game I've played and the volume sliders sadly don't affect the main menu, so I'd advise turning the volume on your audio device down about halfway until you load into your save and the audio settings take effect.
They integrated the free DLC from console into this package. Normally that would be a good thing except the Boss Rush DLC, the Seven Deadly Digimon, break the rules of the game to create a broken, agrivating slog of a boss rush DLC. For example, Lucemon is a 3-phase fight where the only phase that can really be countered is Phase-1. Phase 2 seemingly has a full roster of power-amped version of your standard leveled attacks as well as plenty of status-inflicting attacks, making it a pretty unpredictable fight. Phase 3 is just a survival round where you can't damage it yourself and just have to wait out the clock with specific damage-negation moves.",1603399503,1603399503,True,3,0,0.540765047073364258,0,True,False,False

Pros
- Really large variety of monsters to fight and add to your team
- In-depth evolution system for monsters
- Digimon have at least one signature move with unique animations (mostly, as there are pallete swaps with similiar/same moves)
- Able to customise Digimon further through a shared pool of ‘inherited skills’
- Employs weakness/strength system similar to the weapon triangle that Fire Emblem is famous for. Along with traditional elemental weaknesses/strengths, Digimon also have inherent types which add another layer of depth in combat that players have to take into account
- Lots of small little touches that really add life to the character of the game, such as Digimon having their own methods of movement (running, flying, trotting, riding on a bike, etc.) and victory poses. Certain basic functions are stealthily disabled when it makes sense for them not to be accessible too.
- Has many functions that add to the convenience of playing the game – There’s a notification system that informs you of important events, and there’s an NPC that reminds you of what you need to do just in case you’ve forgotten after not playing the game for awhile
- Characters are brimming with personality
- Interesting story premise supplemented with solid world-building for the most part
- Sleek and unique UI, especially the combat menus. Feels intuitive and smooth after a brief amount of time getting used to it too

Cons
- Flow of combat feels very clunky and unsatisfying due to the way it is structured – attacks involve camera cutting to the attacking Digimon, the Digimon performing and attacking something offscreen, camera cutting to the target, followed by small weak hit sparks appearing along with the target taking damage. You don’t actually see the attacker and the target on the screen at the same time, the attacks lack impact as you technically don’t see them connect, and the choppiness also makes pacing feel awkward.
- ‘Inherited skills’ don’t vary in function a lot, most of them are just formulaic elemental variations of damage skills
- Quite a significant amount of filler quests – some do add to the world-building, but a lot of them just feel like they’re there to pad out the story
- Little bits of translation mistakes and poor localisation choices here and there
- Very little variety in environment types, resulting in mostly unsatisfying exploration

Ultimately, even with all the shortcomings, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is still a decent game. Here’s hoping that future installments in the Digimon video game library will build on the success of this game and continue to improve.",1603361954,1603361954,True,22,0,0.739239871501922607,0,True,False,False

[u] story [/u] overall has a slow start in both games which helps you getting familiar with the real world / hacker scenario.
after the slow start, the story-telling ramps up rapidly and can leave you a bit confused at times but other than that it feels like a really good cohesive story.
main characters see some really good character development most of the time (some can be a bit cliché but oh well jrpg).
the story of hackers memory (side story to main game) ties in nicely with the main game with several intersections of events and story progression.

[u] gameplay [/u] felt above average with turn based combat and the different types/elements.
there is a clear gap between some of the stronger digimon with their better skill sets and stat distribution but if you're just going for a normal playthrough and not hardmode post-game content you're gonna be fine.

some [u] other [/u] things I really liked were the soundtrack and side characters.
some of the OST tracks fit really well, even if some (*cough* battle music *cough*) can get a bit repetitive.
for the side characters I really liked that even in a jrpg setting ,which usually focuses on main character development, some side characters have distinct characteristics and development.

all in all I really enjoyed this game, as a digimon game and a jrpg!

If you liked the previous games then you'll like this one, I just find it a little dialogue heavy which I guess comes with the whole detective genre.

EDITL: 20+ hours in, the writing does seem a bit off at times, or maybe it's bad editing/translation? Then there's the artificial inflation of content by dragging out the missions or ""Cases"" where you might have 3 that are in the same location, but you can only have one active at a time so after you finish one you have to leave and then come back with the next active case.

The biggest issue I think being that you have to come back to your HQ to take/switch between cases, it just comes off as lazy with an express purpose of stretching your playtime instead of making more missions or adding more things to do.

Definitely not a 10/10 for me, but still a good game.

2nd EDIT: I know now a part that rubs me the wrong way, all the running around the human world parts feel a little too much like an imitation of a Persona game, in particular there's a mission at one point that is literally going to different restaurants with pointless and weird dialogue between the silent MC and his ""friends"" that just screamed ""see, we can Persona too!""...

3rd EDIT: By the time I finished the Cyber Sleuth side of the game I had about 82 hours logged, now with 98 hours and into the Hackers Memories side I feel like I can already say that HM just feels more polished than CS did, I'm not noticing as many weird translations for starters, there's been more animation in scenes, and the enemy balance seems better.
That might change as I play more of it, but as long as it's not as bad as CS I'm fine with that.

By the end of CS I was getting frustrated with both random enemy encounters and scripted ""boss"" fights where a f**king Champion or god forbid Rookie somehow puts up a fight against my team of all max level Mega digimon, also the shear number of fights where you can't even deal damage because of plot armour but then f**king In Training's can still deal at least 5 or 10 damage to your level 99 Mega when you inevitably have to backtrack into a low level area for a quest...

The game's got problems is what I'm saying, but the fun parts do thankfully shine through.

Also, I won't say where in the game but there's a point where you're expected to run through an area, with no encounters aside from pre-scripted enemies (who despite being clones of each other all seem to somehow be tougher than the previous?) that literally took me 20 minutes to run through start to end... That's just bad game design, plain and simple.
Once again cementing the feeling that they were trying to artificially extend the play time.

And before I forget, I hate, hate, HATE the bullsh*t that every god d*mn boss be they story critical or from a f**king side quest, ALWAYS go before you when battle starts, no exception.
It doesn't matter if they have a level 20 Champion while you have a level 99 Mega, they will go first, and they will be absurdly strong despite they're level and stage making it worse.",1601443770,1602821135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every digimon has its own ""special"" skill which comes with a unique animation for it, which is a really nice flavor to the game.  There's an extremely large roster, which adds a lot to your team building.  It has similar elements to the Digimon World DS games, so if you liked those then this will feel very similar.

The core gameplay revolves around taking up ""investigations"" where you and your digi partners go around solving mysteries in the world of cyber crime.  There's a charm to the game and in spite of the rather large grinds I found myself still enjoying the variety it offered.  You can spend time raising your digimon on your farm, or take them onto the field and balance your team between high memory cost digimon or more amounts of lower costs.  The more powerful a digimon, the higher its cost, and you have to strike the right balance with your allocated party memory.

Now, with that being said there are some things I didn't enjoy.  I would still recommend the game because it's a fun ride, but it's not something I would really invest myself in, like I would a more dedicated RPG.

Story- Really nothing to write home about here.  The characters are bland and the translation seems...questionable.  Many of the responses you're permitted in the dialogues just don't really make much sense.  It's not a terrible experience, but if you're looking for something with an in depth narrative this isn't your game.

Music- The tunes are simple and catchy, but they do get a bit repetitive at times.  It's passable, in my opinion.

Gameplay- This is where my biggest complaints come in.  Digimon games, in my opinion, have the potential to be far far better than they currently are, more specifically better than Pokemon.  The amount you're able to branch your digimon's evolution paths is great, and extremely flexible.  But there are a few hiccups.  First and foremost, unlike the DS games, there is a set limit on the stats of Digimon, which can only be somewhat improved by the digifarm.  Normally, with enough work, you could make any digimon of any evolution somewhat viable.  In this game, you're pretty much only going to want to settle for the Mega evolutions or higher.  Pokemon does this too, but I do think it's a lot of essentially wasted assets on monsters that you never come back to once you unlock the stronger stuff.  I would have liked to have the flexibility from the DS games, so I could have, say, a Guilmon be just as strong as a Gallantmon with enough effort.
While I like the flexibility of evolutions, I do think that there should be some restrictions on the digivolving trees.  Essentially, you can turn any digimon into any other digimon if you do enough progressing through the evolution trees.  This bottles down to losing a sense of identity with your digimon, especially because (as far as I'm aware) there is no way to name them.  I can't really identify one of my digimon from the other, because they can all criss cross into each other's pathways.  Having a lot of options is great, but I do think at the very least the digimon should be restricted to their ""baby"" digimon trees, so that you're never able to change it into a completely different tree.
I would like to see Digimon games really embrace the idea of ""raising"" your digimon, expanding it a lot more than just stats.  I think there should be many avenues of activities your digimon can do with you, and various ways to improve their ability to perform them.  It bottles down to: I would like to have a more personal connection to my Digimon, which is somewhat Pokemon really can't ever handle.

With that being said, this is by no means a bad game.  Quite the opposite.  It has its charming impression and you'll at least get some hours of entertainment out of it.  But with that said, I would like to see the Digimon games really ""digivolve"" into the Pokemon killer it has the potential to be.",1602458580,1602458580,True,24,2,0.746876955032348633,2,True,False,False

Cons:
-Some story boss battles have a random spike in difficulty only for the next story bosses to be extremely easy.
-Some conversations take a while to get through.

There are gross amounts of backtracking through simple and needless mazes of levels that offer nothing new to see or do despite repeatedly being forced to traverse them.
Digimon battles are simplistic and unchanging turn-based affairs that occur in the exact same manner endless times due to insane levels of grinding.
I feel like many elements of this game were intentionally designed to waste the players time, from terrible fetch quests, pointless smaller quests that are, for whatever reason, necessary to progress, and grinding. My god, the grinding.

I'd rate this a thumbs up if it was easier and simpler to get around, you didn't need to backtrack so much, the story was more engaging with choices that made any impact, the characters weren't the quality of cardboard cliches, and if the literal digimon were a bigger focus.

As is, it's a tremendous slog, and I regret purchasing this game completely. I'd only reccommend if you're a big fan of digimon, ridiculously over the top anime cliche characters, and if you're willing to suffer through huge exposition dumps that make your eyes glaze over.

Great things about the game:
- It's biggest and most appealing feature is to complete the ""pokedex"". Crafting new digimons is fun and addictive.
- Battle system is a turn-based JRPG classic with 3 monsters on the field at once. Although it is very easy to get over-leveled and sweep through the game there's generally a few challenging battle if you reset your party at a bad time through digivolving.

There is a few things to look out for such as:
- The story is interesting with a remotely charming cast,but it becomes heavy and relentless at moments, sending you on a ""press A to advance dialog"" quest for 20+mins at a time. Several times throughout the game. If you like story telling it's fine, but I cared more about catching and training more digimons. 
- The dungeon and locations are VERY limited. You have a handful of them and you will go back and forth through multiple fetch quests all through out the 20 chapters long game. This being originally a PS Vita game kind of show in the lack of dungeon and puzzles to do.

Overall I do recommend the game if you like ""catch them all"" type of game or classical JRPG elements with a rather convoluted story. However do keep in mind it can get rather repetitive at times which is either a good or bad thing depending on your preference of gameplay.",1599661397,1599661397,True,7,0,0.59059596061706543,0,True,False,False

The stories are very good, I found both of them engaging and the characters very well made. The graphics are decent. Thre's a huge collection of digimons for you to acquire.
The downside of theses games lies in the fact that it gets boring if you plan on completing everything in it, achievements and all that, you will get discouraged. That's because the side quests and digifarm quests are too repetitive and dull, except just a few. In Hacker's Memory, the domination battles that appear as digifarm quests, they are the same throughout the entire game.
So, if you're a fan of jrpg and specially a fan of Digimon, I do recommend these games, but focus on the story, otherwise be warned that they will get boring. Buy them when they're on sale.",1574806209,1599533845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros[/b]:
* Pretty fun experimenting around with digimon: digivolving and de-digivolving digimons and playing around with their movesets,  making an in-training digimon with powerful moves from their inherited moves.
* Good digimon models.
* Good story.
* Nice UI.

[b]Cons[/b]:
* Boring game scenery and music, most of the story revolves around the same 5 or so maps, and the digital shift maps all have the same music. The digital space and  Digimon Dusk/Dawn had much better music and scenery despite being 2D and being in the DS.
* The digimon roster is pretty limited.
* Not enough move variation besides the special moves.
* Sometimes it's confusing on what you have to do. Sure, there's Kyoko and Mirae, but sometimes even they aren't helpful and you have to figure it out yourself until you come across an exclamation mark on top of a character to progress.
* The story is a bit all over the place at times. Somtimes, I have no idea what is happening, but I eventually get it, then something else happens that confuses me.
* The final boss fight in hard difficulty made me want to flip a table... On the other hand everything in normal difficulty, including the final boss is too easy, I played at hard mode up from the beginning up to the final boss.

[b]Personal gripes[/b]:
* Some of the translation is pretty iffy.
* Cutscenes are a bit cringy at times, but that's just me.

[b]Overall[/b]: I still really like this game despite its faults... I'll be looking forward to play hacker's memory when I'm less busy in life.",1595171797,1598814472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise, it's close to Shin Megami Tensei, but with notable differences, such as:
Buffs suck and are useless except for like one that straight out doubles your damage output (and even then, it's a waste of a turn unless you have type advantage.), a big problem of a lot of RPG games, really. They are somewhat useful on the hard mode however, but I am genuinely not sure if i can even reccomend hard mode.

Basically, hard mode is nearly the same as normal, except boss battles become cancer. Not only they are bullet spongy, but you also have to rely a LOT on digimon with piercing skills, otherwise it's going to take a long bloody time. I basically cheesed hacker's memory's hard mode with Hisyaryumon since he is more or less the ultimate counter to the main big bad in the game.

Anyhows. Which game you should play first and on which difficulty? Honestly, you might just pick one game and roll with it. Seriously.

Either will work fine as a first time experience, BUT. Either will ruin the other game's experience for you for a bit. Why? Each story spoils each other. A lot. If you've played the og cyber sleuth before hacker's memory, it's not that big of a deal, but if you choose to play hacker's memory first (which is arguably a little bit... better?) then you'll get spoiled on the og story.

Here's a weird idea for you. 

Try to play them both at the same time. Yeah, weird, right? 

But do it like this: Beat one chapter of main story, then one chapter of hacker's memory, and rinse and repeat until the end. 

This way, the climax of the story will feel a lot more powerful than separate. Yes, it will feel more grindy because the games share a lot of the same locations, but by far that feels like the only way to play without each story spoiling each other.

Either way, all and all, a great game. Lots of likeable characters (even though they feel like walking stereotypes at first in the original, but get better, And hacker's memory's characters are just mighty fine.)

Do I reccomend it? Yep. Do I think that you should finish one story before playing another? Hell no. Play them both at the same time if you want to follow the story and not be instantly spoiled by one.

Alternatively, if you don't have the time or patience, just beat one and call it a day. But keep in mind, it's a JRPG. It will always take a lot of time to beat. I know I was trying to rush to the end of it because i've been so, so tired by the awful encounter rate at some areas. (High security skill helps a bit, but even then sometimes it's just too much. Wish they'd go with SMT4's way of random encounters, when it's not truly random...) 

But anyways. Give it a shot if you want to get into digimon, I don't think there's a better introduction to the series than this. And yes, it doesn't have the gameplay of the original games, but who cares? Spin offs are spin offs. Let them experiment and have fun.

Oh yeah, and soundtrack is pretty damn good too. (Really loved that certain 

A small edit: Oh yeah. SAVE MANUALLY OFTEN IF YOU DO decide to play hard mode, games never really tell you when you will have a boss fight, and since they are so annoying... this is the best you can do. Just trust me on that.

Before starting my review, let me clarify something: I absolutely love reading, visual novels and JRPGS. I just finished playing Persona 4 Golden, and every time I picked it up I played for the whole day. Literally, since the moment I got up to the moment I couldn't resist sleep anymore.

The best thing about this game is that the Digimon look cute. That's it. And I can't even praise the whole graphic department, since the MC's hair has the same quality as that of the trainers in Pokémon Sword/Shield while the detective's hair looks like Lusamine's hair in Pokémon Sun/Moon. The 3D graphics are that inconsistent. And don't get me started on the sprite animations during convos...

Regarding the music, Masafumi Takada produces masterpieces. Like the OST for Danganronpa. So I would like the soundtrack of this game... IF IT WASN'T BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN BITS OF SOME SONGS THAT ARE TOTAL RIP-OFFS FROM THE DANGANRONPA SOUNDTRACK. 

If the game is called ""Digimon Story"", it's safe to assume the game will have a good story and that said story will be mostly about Digimon... BUT NO, YOU'RE WRONG! The pacing of the story is absolutely horrendous, introducing a lot of stuff during the first two hours (that have no connection whatsoever between them) and then turning into the most repetitive, inconsistent and sleep-inducing script ever. I'm not joking, I was falling asleep while playing, and I can't remember the names of most characters because the game doesn't make me care for them at all! You meet Nokia and this blue-haired guy at the very beginning and they look like these characters who will be with you for the rest of the game. Well, I've played for 10 hours and I've seen them just once each. For a completely irrelevant dialogue. 

I've read some comments saying that the story is a slowburner and that the final chapters are the best. I shouldn't have to play such a boring and repetitive game for 20+ hours in order to get to the interesting part??? I want a game that catches my attention from the very beginning! Also, the writing is really weird??? Some lines sound like they were literally translated from Japanese without any edition or adaptation at all...

Don't expect anything good in the gameplay department either, because you will be running around the same dungeons with the same layout over and over again. Seriously, between the minimum amount of dungeons/areas and the astonishing amount of invisible walls in this game, I felt like I was playing Resident Evil 1 instead of a PS Vita game from 2016... And you can't talk to most  of the NPCs you find around the city! That's a complete waste of resources...  

Last but not least, I wanted to save a paragraph to talk about the nonsense that is the DigiLine. All the messages from your friends (if that is even the right word to describe these people) and family appear in the same thread of conversation, and apart from the fact that they don't have any impact in the story, they don't even make sense?????? Like, the school friends you meet on the street message you saying that they want to hang out, you can answer ""Yes, of course"" AND THAT'S ALL??? YOU DON'T ACTUALLY MEET UP WITH THEM???? This is like the IM function from Persona 5 done insanely wrong!!!!

With regards to storyline, I felt like there was more at stake in Hacker's Memory and definitely grew more attached to the characters then. I felt like there was just a lot of philosophical discourse in the former (esp from Kyoko & Suedo) that just flew over my head. An interesting attempt, but it felt better executed in Hacker's Memory. The latter also explored a wider range of deep topics, including bullying, ""animal"" ethics and deeper discussion on identity, as opposed to the main Cyber Sleuth game which still felt more like a friendship is great and you-need-to-save-the-world-or-else kind of narrative.

For gameplay, both games pretty much use the same turn-based fighting system. But again, I think Hacker's memory was definitely superior her. They had added new game mechanics like the Visualiser (which allows you to see traps), Acceleration (increase movement speed) and Free Escape Gate (which teleports you to the entrance of the level). And there was a greater variety of game modes as well, namely Domination and another control points type game mode.

The other DLC stuff have also been interesting (albeit tough) and should only be tackled in the late game.

Other than that, loved the art style, music and character dynamics! Definitely a game that will take up lots of time, but ultimately is time worth spending ~",1596531399,1596531399,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off the gameplay is fine, not very challenging just a basic RPS system. there are some bad cases though where the game wastes your time by having scripted fights that you ""can't win"" eventhough your team would have 0 problems handling the fight or are those special fights in hackers memory that are also super easy but take way to long to finish.

But the fighting won't be something you will do much, instead you are going to mostly just walk around and read alot of mostly broken english, to the point that I belive that I actually lost some grasp on the english language myself. 

It is not a big problem in the first game though. It's a nice and simple Story that doesn't try to be too deep and instead focuses on a fun storie with a somber but happy ending and with mostly 1 dimansional characters that are still very likable. There isn't much to criticize or talk.

The same can't be said though about hackers memory. Hackers memory tries to have a deeper, somewhat more ""down to earth"" with more personal tragedes but fails at it. I don't want to spoil too much but there is both a very obvious side villian and the fate of a certain character was pretty early on very obvious and many other plot points that require that characters are either frankly too stupid or overly emotional to happen in the first place. 

Hackers memories story does not add anything nor does it answer anything that was necessery or important, it tries badly being 
 a megaten game but fails at it.

So this leaves me in a weird place where I can't recommend Hackers memory, but I do recommend cyber sleuth.

- Great characters with a great story to go with it.
- There is essentially 2 games for the price of 1 with 150+ hrs of gameplay.
- The Digimon Field Guide is really useful and gives a ton of information like Digivolutions, moves it learns, stat gain etc. I was expecting to have to use online guides for this like in Persona 4 and was pleasantly surprised.
- Your Digimons and NPCs will occasionally message you, making the world feel more alive. I just wish there was more variety in the Digimon messages because they start repeating after a while.
- The digimon look really cool and I like how they start out cute and cuddly and eventually turn into huge mechanical monstrosities. 
- The second game, Hacker's Memory, fixes a lot of the issues with the first game. You can now increase your movement speed and there is more information provided on the next quest triggers so I rarely found myself lost.

Cons:
- Online multiplayer is buggy with the game crashing everytime I tried to access the leaderboards not to mention I could never find anyone to battle using their matchmaking.
- Some of the ""villein"" characters have really annoying voices.
- Unskippable end credits.
- The first game has several parts where the information on the next quest trigger is not properly conveyed and I found myself lost several times and had to google solutions.

The story is nothing great but it isn't bad either. The slow pace is what bores me in the beginning but when it comes to the Digimon part, I was more involved and more interested. Since I am interested in the Digimon aspect and not really the human's story aspect. The story picks up the pace after a threat is realized and is on its way to achieve that said threat.

Quick Review: It can get pretty grindy but not because of difficulty, It's just addicting to farm Digimon until you can hit all the digivolutions and obtain the Digimon you want.  There are 20 chapters and I didn't find myself engaged in the story until roughly chapter 14 or 15. 

If you really like Digimon it's worth playing. It has Digimon from at least the first 4 generations of the anime and I think some go even further.

The story is fun, not super deep but there's more to it than I imagined at first. The main character doesn't really talk much (similar to Persona series) and that limits the story in some ways in my opinion. The story is linear and you don't make any decisions that change the outcome at all. It is longer than I thought going in, but I probably could have cleared the story in half the hours or less if I wanted to.

Dungeon crawling is a decent chunk of the gameplay. That said, most of the dungeons are pretty straightforward and I didn't mind that. In the last 3 chapters there were some trickier dungeons that I found to be more fun. I only got lost in one dungeon throughout the entire game so if you're not really into dungeon crawlers, I don't think that should stop you from enjoying the game.

Boss battles were a lot of fun, but only toward the very end did I encounter bosses that took more than a couple tries (playing on Hard). You will need to train up and make sure you understand the Digimon type/attribute system to succeed, though. Another tip is to get Digimon with Def and Int penetrating moves, although once the Digimon is strong enough, these moves can demolish enemies so quickly that it may not be as enjoyable. You will really want these moves for certain boss fights though, so be warned.

Most of my hours came from training up Digimon, Digivolving them back and forth to fill out the field guide. I was really happy with how many different Digimon were available in the game. Unlike Pokemon, a single Digimon has the potential to become any other Digimon, if you're patient enough to grind. I didn't mind grinding at all once I was about a quarter of the way through the game and had a Platinum Sukemon and the Tactician USB item.

All in all, the game is flexible enough to be very casual or slightly challenging, depending on the time you want to put into it. Perfect for fans of Digimon, the old Digimon World games (although this is definitely a totally different game), or JRPG fans in general.

The Complete Edition contains two games:
- Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth
- Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory

The timeframe is the same for both games, but the story is completely different. In the first game, you play as a kid whose very existence is at risk after an accident happening in the virtual reality whilst the second game will lead you through the story of a young hacker boy whose online account was stolen.

Pros:
- Great story for both games
- Relatable characters
- Chill music
- Collecting and evolving Digimon are super fun

Cons:
- A controller is recommended, but not necessary
- There is some mandatory grind but it can easily be overcome with some unique Digimon
- Some say that there is too much talking but if you're interested in the story, it's not a problem
- No English dub so you have to read everything

Gameplay is not that different from previous turn based Digimon games, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; but expect to be grinding a whole lot, especially if you want to do the end-game challenges and get into PVP. I mean, this game even has Digimon specifically made to make grinding faster, so they're not really being shy about it.

Graphics and animations are decent. The Digimon themselves look great in 3d despite having pretty simple textures. They also don't have much varied animations, but they're good enough, even arguably better than how Pokemon S&S handled animations.

You can not skip the Dialog at all, you can tap A to ""Cycle"" through it but they will finish whatever dialog before you can ""skip"" it.
You Will NOT see a Digimon for the first 20 min of the game. The game Named Digimon takes more than 20 minutes to show a Digimon.
The game also has no Attack animations that I could see in the early parts of this game but this hour that I have played has turned me off that I am just going to get a refund before it is too late.
This, To Me is a knock off Pokemon game without any of the BASIC animations that Pokemon has for combat.

Before getting into the review, I first must explain that [i]Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition[/i] contains 2 games: 
[list]
[*]Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth originally released in 2015
[*]Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker's Memory a sequel released in 2017
[/list]
While the core mechanics are mostly the same, there will be some instances in the review where I will compare each other’s aspects.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
The core gameplay of [i]Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition[/i] involves the player collecting digimons, raising and leveling up while experiencing the story. Cyber Sleuth has some balance issues, but mostly fixed in Hacker’s Memory that makes other digimons more viable. Both games have decent story, but for Cyber Sleuth it is held back by awful translation quality, especially early game and side content have straight up incomprehensible english. Overall the games provide a more story focused [i]Pokemon[/i] experience with more in-depth and enjoyable mechanics.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[list]
[*] Tons of digimons to obtain, level up and evolve. The system that allows players to build and optimize their team is very versatile. 
[*] Enjoyable story 
[*] The combat system is fun.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[list]
[*] Held back by terrible localization, especially for [i]Cyber Sleuth[/i]
[*] Creating a super optimized team can be very grindy, but not required and can be made much faster with specific items. 
[/list]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game follows a traditional JRPG gameplay loop where players fight enemies inside dungeons, then progress through the story. The main course for this game is collecting digimons, and building a team. The enemies encounters are done randomly although this isn’t too much of a problem because the game allows you to increase or decrease encounter rates. 

[b]Obtaining and raising digimons[/b]

Each encounter with a digimon, a scan meter will activate. When the scanner reaches 100% you can “summon” said digimons from the base. This process is very prominent in the early game, and becomes less relevant later as the numbers of digimons you can get increases. In the end players will pick a main team of 9 digimons they can carry. 3 being the active combatant that can be switched anytime in battle with the other 6 in reserve. Digimons in the main party will get EXP even if they aren’t fighting. 

The main progression of digimons’ strength is through digivolution. Each digimon has extensive evolution trees all with different types, and abilities. To Digivolve, a digimon has to meet certain criterias like level or certain points in specific stat such as STR or INT. Basically the main loop of raising digimons is level up, then digivolve into stronger tier, and repeat. Each digivolution reset the level back to 1 but with much higher stats than their predecessors. 

Stat progression is different and static with each digimons. The game’s Encyclopedia has a neat system where you can see monsters’ stats on which level they are on. This allows for further planning in the team-building progress. Tthe system can be grindy (if you really want all the legendary monsters), it is overall more fun than it is frustrating. Getting the team stronger and seeing what kind of cool-looking monsters they evolve to is rewarding. 

[b]Digifarm [/b]

Digifarm is the place to train further digimons’ stats. Farms can be upgraded for better training results by finding upgrades from dungeons or quest reward. The limit of stat growth is determined by a number called ABI. digimons gain ABI by evolving and devolving. This is where the grindiest part in the game is. If you really want max stat growth (which isn’t necessary at all even in hard difficulty) you have to evolve and devolve the digimons multiple times to get max ABI to increase the maximum amount of stat.

Digifarm also allows you to craft random items in exchange for money. These items range from healing items to support items like tactician USB that have EXP multipliers. Most of these items can’t be obtained in stores and can be very helpful.

[b]Combat[/b] 

Combat is done through a turn based system where players pick a move during certain digimon’s turn and they will act on it. The battle system is similar to most JRPG with type and elemental weaknesses and resistances having damage multipliers. It’s not the most sophisticated system, but it is still satisfying and offers decent flexibility and team build tactics. 
[i] Hacker’s Memory[/i] fixed some balance issues regarding certain overpowered type of moves in the prequel. 

My only gripe with the battle system is the enemy AI don’t utilize the rock-paper-scissors mechanics well, and they mostly just attack randomly. This happens on hard difficulty as well as normal so as long as you have decent variety in the team. The combat is mostly one sided except for some bosses. 

Overall, the games aren’t in the forefront of innovation in any part of the gameplay, but most aspects of the games are executed well. They are quite enjoyable in both story and monster raising aspects. 

[h1]Technical Issues and Bugs[/h1]
[u][b] Specs: GTX 1080, Ryzen 3700x, 1440p Monitor, 16 GB RAM[/b][/u]
No problems at all in my 100 hours of gameplay between both games. It ran perfectly but cutscenes are rendered in 30 FPS. 

The biggest problem with the games are the humongous amount of localization issues. Broken sentences, barely comprehensible text that look like it was translated with early 2010’s google translate. Typos, misspelling, mistranslation are too common of an issue especially in [i] Cyber Sleuth[/i]. [i]Hacker’s memory[/i] has much better localization effort and the problems in the previous game are mostly gone. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
[i]Cyber Sleuth[/i] follows a more traditional shonen anime trope and story structure. It is nothing really special on its own, but it does explore some interesting themes and concepts. Both fantasy and science fiction elements are decently done. The characters are a bit cliche but still likeable and overall the story of cyber sleuth is decent and made me want to continue finishing the game. 

[i]Hacker’s Memory[/i] used a different approach compared to its prequel. While the previous game follows typical “teenagers save the world”, this game scales it back to a more personal story of the main cast. The game follows a different protagonist in the same time frame as [i]Cyber Sleuth[/i]. It’s more about the characters overcoming their personal conflicts that is caused by the world around them. This resulted in a much down to earth, multi-dimensional characters that have their own motivations and issues. [i]Hacker’s Memory[/i] also expands the world in more meaningful ways. 

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
As a game ported from PS Vita the graphics are nothing special. What stands out is the games contain more than 300 digimons and they all have unique models and each one has special attack animation for their special moves. 

[h1]Music and audio[/h1]
The soundtrack is very standard. It isn’t bad, but nothing except maybe 1 or 2 songs that are memorable. The sound effects especially from the digimon’s attacks are pretty good and varied. One thing that might turn off some players is that the voiced lines aren’t dubbed so they are all in japanese. The voice acting itself isn’t bad, but they are far from excellent. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition[/i] is a big package of decently made games. While they suffer from some issues, the core gameplay and story are engaging enough to ignore most of the flaws. If you are already a fan of the franchise or like JRPGs in general, it is worth checking out. if you can't tolerate JRPG tropes and mechanics, safely look elsewhere.

I never thought that this game will blow my mind and pump my excitement to Digimon franchise so high. This game successfully makes me excited again about Digimon. One of my best buy on Steam.

I watched Digimon since childhood but stopped watching Digimon anime like 15 years ago (Savers era) and the last Digimon game I played is Re:digitize on PSP. And seeing so many new Digimon that I have never seen before in this game really makes me excited like a kid again, like a second fall in love moment to Digimon franchise.

PROS:
+ will get 2 games inside
+ so many Digimon awaits us inside the game, like 300++ digimon
+ good gameplay, easy to learn and not overly complicated, perfect for this kind of game
+ really good storyline and well-crafted dialogue, this game writing probably one of the above average JRPG writing in recent years
+ being a port, this run very well optimized

CONS:
- I wish there is an option to fast forward or increase the battle speed for cutscene/animation instead of skipping the digimon battle cutscene option that's already in the game.

Graphics-wise, this is pretty good. Probably one of the best looking digimon games I've played so far.

Music-wise, not bad, repetitive but there are some good tracks.

Voices are mostly in Japanese and there are no dubs, so I hope you like reading subtitles. :)

Difficulty can be adjusted, but I played on normal and did not struggle very much.

However, the online / Multiplayer scene is rather dead, so if you wish to obtain all achievements, you will need to fight Bots, and they are a little harder than storyline mobs.

A note on achievements. There is currently a bug regarding the 100% achievements. Some have acquired it, but I managed to obtain everything except the respective achievements for both games and they did not pop for me. I am apparently not the only one with this issue, so take care.

The story was good, but I felt that Hacker's Memory (the sidestory) was more engaging. Perhaps given the Quality of Life improvements from Cyber Sleuth too.

There is a decent selection of Digimons, up to 341 in total for you to play with, so you shouldn't get bored too fast.

What else, what else... Overall, this is a good game, and since it's basically 2 games in one (Cyber Sleuth + Hacker's Memory.. Ah, but you can only transfer your digis between the two games when you've completed both!), it's not such a bad deal. :) Price might be a bit high though, so I recommend you grab it when there's a sale.

Now, let’s get down to business: this is not Pokémon. Even though you do collect monsters and evolve them, it is not Pokémon. Instead, I’d compare it more to a Shin Megami Tensei game, like Persona. The focus is on storytelling and dungeon crawling more than anything else, and the combat feels more SMT-like in nature. Moreover, you’re not exploring a world Pokémon-style. Instead, you’re zipping around Tokyo and in-and-out of a virtual reality cyberspace (EDEN) via loading screens. Also, rather than being 20-ish hours long like the average Pokémon story, each game is dozens of hours long. Content fiends look no further.

Though the story itself may not be winning any awards anytime soon, it is still quite enjoyable and extremely competent. I find it very hard to argue against this collection. For less than a full-priced game you are getting not one, but two great and substantial RPGs. Cyber Sleuth is easily among the best Digimon games and stories, while Hacker’s Memory might have its downsides compared to the base game but still is an good game on its own. If you ever enjoyed Digimon but haven’t played either of these games, then this is the way to experience modern Digimon at its best. Even those who haven’t heard of Digimon can have a good time since they’re great RPGs, and those who already played them can even go back to the original Cyber Sleuth and enjoy its improvements taken from Hacker’s Memory.

All voices can be turned off


Cons -
Forgettable story - often I am hitting enter to skip all the text and feels like a Persona game more than a digimon game. The game does a huge uturn from the first chapter and feels generic afterwards.
Forgettable characters - some characters feel like an anime filler character like Nokia and are forced into the story
A lot of walking around (grab a lot of Home Gates trust me)
Boring hub worlds
Some NPCS look generic but are actually important ex - medal guy who sits on the 4th floor wearing glasses and a sweater vest
(!) bubbles to help identify objectives since the NPCs more or less look the same
You cannot skip cutscenes
You cannot turn off the character voices without turning off the digimons as well in the volume settings
No english dub - not a deal breaker but the option to change it would of been nice
NG+ you cannot skip cutscenes you already saw
Collecting medals is extremely tedious 
There is a misson in the game that tells you to find 3 resturants and they do not have ANY distinction from other buildings in the area. Two are by the escalator right across from each other and the last one is up the stairs on the second floor.",1593835769,1593932975,False,3,1,0.422751486301422119,0,True,False,False

training your mons is very important and the typing system keeps you messing with reserves all the time. nice challenge compared to how pokemon normally is.

the story is also fantastic, great jrpg cyberpunk-ish story about hackers and cyberspace taking over the world to converge the digital and real worlds so evil digimon can rule over everything. pretty fun stuff, highly recommend.

- Story is so boring...
- They doesn't bring the full potential of the switch
- Nothing new
- No good animations
- Same formula
- The grass is the most important thing in the game
- Game Freak lazy af
- They don't listen to us
- DLC now hehe

- Interesting story
- Brings the full potential of the switch
- They innovate
- Really good animations for each Digimon. Each one has their own animation.
- They put so much love in this game <3
- The most important thing here are the Digimons
- WE LOVE YOU

A must play game for Digimon fans... and Pokemon fans. Look... THIS IS HOW A GAME IN SWITCH SHOULD LOOK LIKE!. This is great, this is a masterpiece.

You don't believe me? Just play this game, do yourself a favor.

*While I do recommend this game for strategy/ monster catcher lovers, it's not for everyone.

Pros:
-Deep customization and strategy reminiscent of the SMT games
-Hard mode is somewhat challenging
-Surprisingly solid world building and animation

Not for Everyone:
-Can be quite grindy on hard mode or for PvP
-Anime style

Cons:
-Ridiculous anime npc designs, particularly for female characters (if you are 12 or an incel you might like this)
-Hours of truly terrible dialogue and cut scenes that for some reason cannot be skipped... As someone who hates anime tropes but loves monster catching games, this was particularly frustrating to me, but let's be honest, there aren't many decent games in the genre so we'll take what we can get. If you are in the same boat, just bear in mind that you will have to patiently click through garbage tier dialogue between playing.

Fair warning. The American esrb rating is wrong. In Japan this game was rated Cero C which is a soft M. This game has simulated suicide, the equivalent of simulated school shootings, many sexual references and few scenes making you take part in street harrassment. Many character's die and there is a end of the world plot. This game also takes place in many real life Japanese locations. Content wise, this gsne is very comparable to persona 4 or shin megami tensei 4, M rated game's. That being said, I do personally believe this game is suitable for mature teenager's but I feel like you should have an accurate content warning.

This game provides the entire backstory of Digimon, within your scenario, and makes it an incredibly fun place to be. They are still just as cute as you remember <27 years old me>

It's overly simple. There is lots of focus on the dialog, your situation, the digimon, hackers, Key words that unlock locations/further dialog, scanning, 
The technological terms used in this make everything feel like it's any day that this could become reality.

Each digimon can have up to 20! Skills/Abilities. Once you reach 20 you start deleting moves you don't require anymore.

It's an amazing game that plays like a live anime. You're in control of most things in the game.

In the beginning you choose to play as the hacker, or normal mode where the children are all scared of the hacker myths, and get moulded into this. You have two choice.

Digimon Cyber Sleuth: 7/10
As far as JRPG's go it is kind of a bread and butter one, the story is fairly simple but fun, and the battling is classic JRPG style. The biggest gripes with the game as a whole is that some fan favorite Digimon are held behind post game quests, and the lack of different areas in the game to explore. Outside of that side quests, and the main quests are all fun to do and each feel different from the last. So overall I give it a 7/10.

Digimon Cyber Sleuth: Hacker's Memory: 9/10
This game is definitely the better of the two, although it is technically just a side story to the main game, it definitely upgrades everything about the last, including new dungeons, better quests, a much more in depth story, more digimon, a new battle mode, and overall more polished gameplay. However one of the draw backs is, you do need to play the first game to understand some of the references made in this one, it still also has that issue of not a ton of original dungeons, but makes up for it with some really, really cool ones! The games other biggest flaw is it is kind of difficult in the beginning (same can be said about the first game) but once you grind a little bit and get the hang of things it becomes easier.

The game is a bit pricey, but it's worth it. There's *so much* to do, and most of the side quests, or side cases, are actually fun.

It's a great game, period. 
It's rare to have a great digimon game on PC (you aren't a great digimon game, Digimon Masters Online) since they develop it rarely and most of them are in console.

Probably because I’ve played more pokemon games compared to Digimon games. I mean the last Digimon game I played was back on PS2 Digimon world 4 and yea it was load of fun. 

Anyways after giving this game a go, I instantly got hooked and kept playing it for hours and that for me is a sign that this game is really good. So yes, I now consider myself a Digimon fan as well haha. Now here are the breakdown for the game:

[h1] The Pros [/h1]
(+) [b] Story is superb [/b] 
Cybersleuth’s story is more on the cliché side but still really enjoyable, while the hacker’s memory is themed around questioning your existence, whether you are actually you. It’s really interesting and wholesome. Cybersleuth’s story is great but Hacker’s Memory is even better for me.

(+) [b] Gameplay [/b] 
Solid turn-based combat, and the hacker skills is a really nice touch. Can be a bit grindy at the beginning but later there’s an item and certain Digimon that would make grinding a bit easier so don’t worry.

The DigiLab also provide tons of feature, like for example revisiting past dungeons, Digifarm for leveling digimons outside of your current party, and online colosseum if you want to try your line up against other players.

(+) [b] Cutscene animation is beautifully done [/b]
(+) [b] Graphics are pretty decent [/b]
(+) [b] Sountrack really fits with each scene of the game [/b]

[h1] The Cons [/h1]
(-) [b] Game tend to crash during online colosseum [/b]
Yeap you heard it right, the game sometime freezes and force you to reload the game. So make sure you save every time you win or lose an online session, unless you don’t mind losing your progress.

On a side note, it is kinda hard to find anyone for online matches, which is kinda disappointing. Where I live probably is one of the reasons, but still….

(-) [b] Very long dialogues [/b]
This part is quite annoying during certain chapter and since there’s no skip button you’ll have to bear with it.

(-) [b] No autosave feature [/b]
Make sure you save a lot……

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
All in all Digimon Cybersleuth: Complete Edition is totally recommended especially if you enjoy a good story. Plus this is basically 2 game for the price of 1, so I can’t really see why you shouldn’t give it a try. It’s that good.",1591727077,1591727456,True,115,1,0.888647079467773438,0,True,False,False

Although I'm generally having a good time and I can recommend this game if you enjoy monster collecting RPGs, it does have some significant flaws that I feel need to be addressed.

The good:
- Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory both have an engaging and interesting story that is significantly more mature than most other sources of Digimon media. 
- The gameplay starts off simple with the expected rock-paper-scissors system one would expect, though as you begin to encounter stronger Digimon it gradually becomes more important to rely on proper strategy and team structure rather than brute force.
- There is a large roster of Digimon to choose from, many of which feature their own special attack and ability.
- There are many ways to customize your team through the branched pathways of digivolution, and the game encourages you to build up a big and flexible roster with the Digimon Farms, which both serves to make your back-up Digimon not fall too far behind in levels and allow them to train up specific stats to make them more suitable to your preferences.
- There is a lot of game to play through. On Hard Mode, Cyber Sleuth took me more than 80 hours to beat, and Hacker's Memory can easily add another 60 hours.

The bad:
- Hard Mode. It relies way too much on artificial difficulty, primarily by jacking up your opponent's stats to unattainably high levels and skewing many RNG factors in its own favor. This is especially noticable on boss fights, and it may force you to rely on a small group of crutch Digimon with fixed damage or DEF/INT-piercing attacks for a sizable portion of the game. Also notable is the fact that some bosses in Cyber Sleuth have incredibly high Speed values, allowing them to take many more turns than you. This issue is fixed in Hacker's Memory, though in return some bosses will have incredibly high HP and dodge many of your attacks. I recommend avoiding Hard Mode unless you have the patience to deal with unfair gameplay.
- Dialogue and cutscenes cannot be skipped through any means, and they will take up a significant portion of your playtime.
- The main storyline contains a sizable amount of unskippable filler missions and fetch quests that don't involve any battling.
- The translation is very wonky, ranging from erroniously translating the Japanese term for ""monster"" (bakemono) into ""Bakemon"" to making entire conversations in Digiline uncomprehensible.
- Hacker's Memory introduces a new 3v3 battle mechanic called Domination Battles. These battles feature primarily in sidequests, but they are very slow-paced and incredibly unforgiving in the earlier chapters of the game. I recommend avoiding these until you're carrying Ultimate level Digimon.
- Despite how easy she looks, Nokia will not put out.

All in all, I'd say this game has its ups and downs, but overall it's well worth the price if you're an avid fan of monster collecting RPG's. Hard Mode is well worth the price for those seeking a challenge. However, if you're a casual fan who would rather skip out on Hard Mode, I recommend buying this game at a discount.",1591702214,1591702214,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The problem is the story and the pletera of annoying characters that plague the experience (Cough! Nokia! COUGH! COUGH!). Its boring, forgetable, and annoying to the point that it LEGIT made me scream ""OH MY GOD! JUST LET ME PLAY THE GOD DAMN GAME!!!"". The hacker's memory campaign is a bit better on that regard, but not by a lot, trust me.
Don't get me wrong, though! I wouldn't feel this way about it if 1. the characters were actually somewat likeable and 2. if the writers hadn't shoved so much unecessary dialogue in the mix. Most of which, unsurprisingly, doesn't even effect the narrative itself, thus, like I said, it feels extremelly forced in for no reason other than to stretch the already boring story line. 
As if all of this wasn't bad enough already, the gameplay itself can also get boring and repetitive sometimes, too. How boring and repetitive you may ask? Well, here's an example... In order for you to digivolve certain mons, you need to increase their ABI points. There's not that many ways for you to increase that particular stat without resorting to digivolving and DE divivolging your mons over and over and over the fuck again until you get the exact amount you need for a particular digimon you may want... ""Well, that doesn't seem too bad. I just need to grind a bit."". Yeah, no. Replace ""a bit"" with A LOT if you don't have a Platinum Munemon in your team (a digimon that increases the amount of Exp gained in battles, something the game doesn't take the time to tell you.). Its as annoying as it sounds, trust me. Also, just a heads up, if you're able to ignore ""Fetching item"" side missions, PLEASE DO! They are the worst attempt of the word ""fun"" that I've seen in a long while.
In conclusion, I see this game as nothing but ""wasted potential"". You guys can give it try for yourselves, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1590869849,1590869849,False,8,1,0.410313457250595093,0,True,False,False

This is the TOP. There are a lot of things to say about this game (or bundle) but I'm going to keep it simple by talking about both games in each section.

[u][b]Story[/b][/u]
I won't go too much in-depth with the story. The story in both games are well written. Although there are some subplots that aren't related to Digimon + funny moments, it's just so awesome how the mysteries unfold as you progress through the game. You play as two protagonists: Takumi/Ami Aiba in Cyber Sleuth and Keisuke Amasawa in Hacker's Memory, however you can change their first names however you like and even customize them throughout the game. There are a total of 20 chapters in Cyber Sleuth and 18 chapters in Hacker's Memory (some chapters are long XD). The game mostly takes place in Tokyo, as well as the virtual EDEN cyberspace, in contrast to other Digimon media, though you still visit the Digital World and whatnot. There are a lot of expansive text-based dialogue that almost look similar to visual novels (but not quite). There are some legit anime cutscenes too. A shame they are unskippable if you're ever bored of them. There are also a bunch of side quests and post-game content with great challenges ahead (which are mostly about beating up Digimon and searching for lost items). 

[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u]
The gameplay itself is amazing! Like other RPG games, you explore in third-person around various cities and dungeons whilst collecting items and encountering battles with Digimon. It is made very similar to Pokemon and probably the Shin Megami Tensei's Persona games too. The combat system is pretty neat in a Pokemon-esque fashion. You battle with up to 3 Digimon with up to 8 others in reserve. You attack and use skill points and items to defeat your enemies and support your allies. Hacker's Memory also added more gameplay features, such as a Domination battle of 3v3 and Territory Battles (which are awesome in its own ways). There are NO minigames, but the game itself is pretty handy getting you occupied. There are over 300 Digimon and about 700 medals to collect so have fun with that :D
In addition, there's a DigiLab set up for you which you very much need because it's very essential in taking care of your Digimon friends. You have yourself a DigiFarm where you raise Digimon by feeding them and training them. You can also ask them to develop items and investigate for more cases. You can sort out your Digimon by putting them in your farm or in your party. Let alone Digivolve/De-Digivolve them to make them stronger/weaker, as long as you meet their requirements. There is also an online pvp network battle where you can fight other players and NPCs to earn coins to buy cool accessories and avatars. [strike]Don't worry too much about them though because the playerbase is dead. How sad :( [/strike]
Once you're done clearing both stories, you are allowed to transfer Digimon from one to another or you can start ""New Game +"" for another round.

[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u]
The graphics are decent. Good enough to run the game. That's it.

[u][b]Music[/b][/u]
EPIC soundtrack. Can't believe how every each and one of them are unique in its own way and fits the atmosphere perfectly. I just can't stop listening to them :)

[h1][u]OVERALL REVIEW[/u][/h1]
Okay, I know I said a lot even though I was going to keep it very simple, but I really can't help it. This game is too awesome and in my opinion, the best JRPG I have ever played! Although I rate the story of Cyber Sleuth 9/10 and Hacker's Memory 10/10, the personal overall rating for the completed edition is 10/10!!! This game is very immersive and endlessly addicting. Recommending this to RPG fans + diehard Digimon fans. I'm seriously enjoying this game! I think you will feel the same too :DDD

The story would be good if it wasn't for the poorly written dialogue that comes with many errors and typos that should have been fixed before the game even launched, let alone found and fixed with patches to the game after launch (especially since they have made a DLC for this game to expand into a different story altogether). I am unsure if this is in part due to a terrible translation team or the fact that this is all because of direct translations from japanese to english without changing the words to actually make sense. There are hundreds of instances like this in the game, just play it for an hour and you'll see several errors and conversational holes that can confuse the average gamer from understanding what is going on. One such example is a side lore like function called the digiline. It's essentially a texting function between you, your friends and family and the digimon you obtain. It's meant to add a little flair and also provide some background to characters and develop their relationships to you. One example that is horrid in it's conception is the conversation with your own mother. 

Yukino(mom): Whatever you do, give it all ya got! That is how I became a journalist y'see.
Takumi(you): When did my mom start thinking she wanted to become a journalist?
Yukino:  Yeah... I guess they're about your age. I'll tell you about it next time.

This example is pretty bad. Not only does she not acknowledge the reply choice you selected, but goes completely off topic. Who is she referring to? Was this an accidental dialogue switch made by the developers? Is there a conversation in which you ask about her co-workers or something that would make her reply make sense? Another thing, most conversation dialogues are like this if you have a choice in the matter. Most, not all, don't respond any differently to the choice you make, even if it's a completely different and non-similar choice to the other choices you can make. The conversation in which you don't have a choice are fine for the most part, but there are times in which you character explains to others what happened (currently or in the past) and if the player of the game already knows it, it skips the majority of the conversation with the cliche ""..."" responses. This gives you no idea about the personality or word choices of the protagonist, along with confusing the players. On occasion, when this occurs, the NPCs react or say things that make no sense given the context which might have been clarified if they went through the trouble of giving your main character more dialogue. Either that, or actually proof-reading the damn game before release.

Even if you could ignore all of this, skip the dialogue completely and just focus on the gameplay, there isn't much to that department either. The gameplay is very repetitive like Pokemon or other similar collect and level type games. The cases add a little flair to the game, but aren't any better than poorly written side-quests from an MMORPG game. I would not suggest buying this game for anything more that $10. Nothing else in this game makes up the difference in the pricing. At most, I'd give this game a 2.5/5 stars due to the story being ""good"" for the parts that aren't riddled with dialogue inconsistencies and poor choices and the gameplay being fun for this style of game this is.

As a side note, this review is based solely off of the original storyline and does not include the DLC at all since it is in essence a separate game in which you play as a new character with his own story line. Hopefully the developers did better on the DLC than the main game.",1589815967,1589815967,False,2,1,0.422983407974243164,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Simple and intuitive battle system with plenty of room for experimenting. I haven't tried online battles yet but considering they'll be teams of level 99 Megas and Ultras things could get crazy. The offline coliseum battles get harder and harder and the one with Shakkoumon (who is a freaking tank), Silphymon (spams heals) and Paildramon took me quite a few tries.
Story. It's like Persona minus school life, with plenty of WTF moments, and plenty of ""WTF"" moments if you know what I mean. I spoiled myself by accident but I'm still having an absolute blast.

Cons:
Mistranslation issues that everyone else points out.
Having a log that you can use to rewind conversations if you miss something might be nice... Visual novels and a goodly amount of dialog heavy RPGs tend to have this feature.

The pros:
- a massive roster of Digimon. Literally every single character from the first five seasons is present, along with individual attack animations and their signature moves.
- the turn-based 3v3 JRPG gameplay is competently built and works fine.
- many opportunities to build and customize your squad, with bunches of leveling paths for each Digimon.
- lots of main and side quest content. Roughly, you get the equivalent of a full 50-episode Digimon season. 

The cons:
- in many ways, the gameplay feels archaic. Turn-based combat has come a long way since the early JRPG days. With some modern innovations, e.g. along the lines of XCOM, this game could have been a triumph. Instead, it feels more like a nostalgic throwback.
- the turn-based combat, while enjoyable, is slow. Many of the more difficult battles feel like slogfests, with the objective of grinding down a massive health bar rather than thinking on your feet.
- lackluster balancing. The game alternates a lot between ""very easy"" and ""very grindy"", rarely striking a comfortable middle ground.
- many technical shortcomings, mostly inherited from the game's PS Vita origins. Low-polygon models, simplistic 3D world navigation with no camera movement, zero mouse and limited keyboard functionality, cutscenes locked to 30 fps... the list goes on. As far as ports go, Cyber Sleuth feels incredibly shoddy.
- subpar writing and storytelling. Tonal consistency is out the window - child-friendly anime stereotypes are jumbled with attempts at Black Mirror-esque body horror, and the two mix like oil and water. Considering the amount of dialogue in the game, as well as the unskippable cutscenes, this adds to the overall grindy impression. 

TLDR: if you don't mind an old-school, somewhat grindy experience, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is a decent timesink. Whether or not it is worth the €40 purchase price, though, is debatable, considering how far titles like XCOM 2 or The Witcher 3 have pushed the envelope at similar price points.

While flawed and clearly restrained by its budget, it's a very good game (or pair of games) that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys monster-raising RPGs.

Positives:
+Great value and longevity for the price, it is two games in one after all but even on their own each game has plenty of content. Each story took me about 40-50 hours to complete (albeit taking my time), and then another 20-30 to 100%. Multiply those numbers by two and you're looking at around 150 hours of gameplay.
+The combat system is fairly enjoyable and balanced, if a bit on the simple side. It's more engaging than Pokemon's though, that's for sure. The PvP also seems easier to get into, though it doesn't appear very active.
+The difficulty is well-made, such that you can use more or less whatever Digimon you want, but it still presents a good challenge. There's also a hard mode that can be toggled at any time for even more challenge or a new game plus. You don't really have to grind, either, at least on normal mode. Completing your field guide and getting your Digimon to peak performance will require some grinding, though.
+While most of the music is just decent, there are multiple bangers. Several boss themes got stuck in my head for days after hearing them and are now part of my regular playlist.
+The first Cyber Sleuth's story is okay, kind of cliche but still enjoyable, however Hacker's Memory has a great story. I recommend playing Cyber Sleuth first since it gives some context to Hacker's Memory, but both can stand on their own.
+Erika is super cute. Would be hit by Memetan again.

Negatives:
-The translation, while good in most places, has numerous glaring errors that can be very distracting or even confusing. I think the most egregious of these is when characters in Cyber Sleuth sometimes refer to Eaters as ""Bakemon,"" which is the name of a Digimon, but in this case is actually a mistranslation of the word ""bakemono"" meaning ""monster."" Very confusing the first time. Apparently this and other errors were in the original release as well, and were not fixed at all for this edition. Most of the errors are specific to the first Cyber Sleuth, though, while Hacker's Memory is much better in that department.
-The graphics are okay for the most part, but clearly low-budget, and there are numerous small flaws like models clipping through themselves. Overall not too distracting and some of the animations are quite good, but could definitely do with some improvements.
-The in-game locations are kind of bland and often have questionable level design. Lots of pointless dead ends and mazes for the sake of mazes.
-Some content is missable, particularly in Hacker's Memory, but most important stuff is super obvious and you can do a new game plus if you really want to go back for it. The only thing I missed on my first (blind) playthrough was the achievement for trying all the drinks in Hudie Cafe, but that literally doesn't matter except for completionists.
-You can battle other people online, but there's no trading. Luckily you can get every Digimon pretty easily in every copy, but still disappointing.
-Cutscenes are not skippable. Particularly annoying on new game plus, since there are a lot of them.

Overall the positives far outweigh the negatives, and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a monster-collecting RPG besides Pokemon. You can tell that the devs really put a lot into this game, both of them, and most of the flaws are simply due to lack of budget. Hopefully, if enough people play it, then future games (such as Digimon Survive this fall!) will get a bigger budget and we'll get to see what the Digimon team is really capable of.",1588907701,1588907701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The bad: This is where the review starts.
This game has a lot of the typical problems of the JRPG genre. The combat is almost always easy, The plot drags its feet, you are required to do boring tasks, and the leveling/digivolution system breaks any kind of interest I could have.

From the beginning, during every fight, I would press ""Auto-attack"", not in old underleveled dungeons, but in every actual dungeon. All the time. You need to go out of your way to be underpowered, and even then, your HP and MP gets restored every time you level up... and you normally level up after every fight.

What's stopping me from looking for a challenge? there are none. There is ONE Big-ass dungeon for most of the game that you return to every once in a while (Kowloon). Kowloon will always have the exact same soundtrack, and will never diverge from its all blue look. with flat corridors and random NPCs to talk to... not great.

I could go in the tougher stages of Kowloon, but there's an NPC blocking the path for no reason at every floor. The guy will go away when you reach the chapter where it's allowed to go there; no other reason. This is stupid.

One thing you can do as a detective is to ask your digimon to look for sidequests. cool idea. But the sidequest they find are ALWAYS the same: go to the old floors of Kowloon you've already seen, find an item, turn in. Sometimes it's even worse: more than once, the item was right next to the questgiver. There is also the often-repeated ""talk to that npc on Kowloon lvl2"". You never solve mysteries, it's not L.A Noire or Wolf Among Us, you never have to deduce anything.

I just didn't care about the story. It starts by saying the protagonist has a disease and he must find a cure... But it diverges into one B-plot after another. They are not connected, they don't introduce returning characters with their own arc, and they don't help you with the main plot. It's just shit.

Now, The thing about digimon is the Digivolution system. It allows you to turn you magic pet into a bigger one. You can also turn your big cat into a small pink blob, and that blob can become a rabbit with machine-gun hands. So everything can become everything, none are special. It doesn't matter what your starter is. And it's hard to care for your creatures because you can't give them a name, and you have to keep changing them up to make them stronger. So you'll never stick with the same digimon for long. You'll never get attached to any of them.

And since anything can turn into anything, none of them are special. One is not more rare than the other, they all get +1 at every stat when they level up, they passive ability can always be ignored. It doesn't put constraint, to there is no strategy to establish to get an optimal team.

So yeah, I don't recommend it",1588896973,1588896973,False,2,1,0.415077567100524902,4,True,False,False

Lots of complaints about all the ""clicking"" through the dialogue, but I don't really mind as I love the occult aspects of the storyline and I'm really invested in everything the dialogue has to offer. Side quests are annoying and repetitive, but some are necessary to discover new Digimon and the main quests are fantastic, so it's passable. I recommend playing on hard difficulty for an actual challenge that will incentivize you to grind, but be aware that early game will be kind of rough until you have your first team of 3.

First of all, don't buy this if you hate visual novels and/or detective games.
This is a detective visual novel with a twist of Digimon gameplay. Not what I expected but I still like the game.

Pros:
-Digimon (duh)
-Great graphics
- Battle and Menu UI are easy to use
- digivolve system is a lot more user-friendly than in the past games
- lots of gameplay

Cons:
- some characters are very sexualised.
- dungeons are bland and feel copy-pasted.
- If you don't really care about the story you are screwed because you can't skip the cutscenes.
- Quest tracking is horrible and the internet is your best friend when you lose track because the  quest objectives and tracking is horrible or not even present.
- Personal dialogue options don't have an impact in the conversions. At all.",1588820966,1588820966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The normal Digimon leveling and evolving grind is fine as usual, but manages to feel a lot less satisfying than in other Digimon games I've played.

always loved the digimon series games, from digimon world 3 on the playstation 1, GBA Battle Spirit and ps2 rumble arena..ect ect

Most games get shit the more a company re-releases games.
Although i was pleasantly surprised, to find a NEW story not used in any previous games 

Very well polished evolution farm. they have finally masted the evolution trees and fixes that previous digimon games struggled with

However, the story is absofuckinglutely terribad. I was ready to pull my hair out halfway into chapter 9. Why not just have the game play in the Digiworld? This whole [spoiler] VR Digimon-are-hacks-thing [/spoiler] is pretty fucking stupid. The story makes no sense and is extremely convoluted. [spoiler] The pseudo-paranormal/spiritual bullshit can fuck right off too.[/spoiler]
The pacing is terrible, sometimes it feels like the world or you yourself are in grave danger, but then you have to solve 17 side missions that have nothing to do with the huge plot point you just uncovered. The writing often feels like it's aimed at 10 year-olds. Pretty sure people who watched Digimon back in the day are now at least in their late twenties. So at least some maturity would be nice. Almost all the problems you solve for NPCs in the game are a freaking joke. A mother is worried about her son getting catfished online. You have to ask a girl for her number for some random dork. These are just some examples for the quality content that awaits you story-wise.

The characters are mostly tolerable, but often one-dimensional and stereotypical. Especially the non-important characters are often just walking parodies. Which gets old kinda fast.

The gameplay is good, but some content gets reused a bit too much. There is quite some backtracking and you often have to clear a level multiple times for different quests/cases. Did I mention that the story is terrible and doesn't exactly make you feel any better about reclearing a level for the third time because somebody lost their fucking shoelaces deep inside one of the areas?

Overall I enjoyed training my Digimon, but there are some very specific party and item setups you have to follow for the grind to be bearable. The battle system feels like Pokemon with some slight differences. I wish there was a little bit of innovation here, but it's pretty good.

Since there aren't many Digimon games on PC I would still definitely recommend this if you are a fan.

The worst thing is that the game often asks you to choose a dialogue option, but then all your choices are variations of the same answer, and if there seems to be 2 different options, fear not, the character you're talking to will find a way to twist it around so that they both actually meant the same thing. I played over 70 hours and I could count on one hand the number of times I had to make a choice that mattered, and I think I'm generous here.

Otherwise, yeah the way the digimon battle and evolve is well done, it's just too bad that it represents such a small part of the game overall.

Digimon story: Cyber sleuth is … a strange game. There are many things that the game got right, and things that it got entirely way too wrong. Personally, I think it's a good game, but I understand if someone doesn't like it. There are just so many conflicting and confusing things about the entire experience.

The positive:
1. Plenty of good Digimon to choose from. If it exists in the game, you can unlock it (some through some crazy means).
2. Intuitive controls that don't frustrate newcomers to turn-based RPGs.
3. A nice experience for a turn-based RPG (a genre I don't personally like).
4. Very Digimon-esque story.

The so-so-s:
1. Graphics are good at times, terrible on occasions. Some places belong to an early PS2 game.
2. Repeated dungeons. They're not entirely repeated, just very similar looking, which makes them feel repeated.
3. Presentable OST.
4. Very anime dialogue.
5. Decent SFX.
6. Your character. It's either cardboard protagonist #1 or cardboard protagonist #2. There's no character development whatsoever on your part. The other characters to develop though, in a very anime way.

The ugly:
1. The elephant in the cutscenes. They can not be skipped, sped up, require prompts to proceed, at times decisions are made (a good portion of the conversation will be repeated if you make the wrong decision), make up the bulk of the game.
2. Backtracking is a necessity.
3. The grind will eventually get to you.

Overall:
This is a pretty easy game, the only real challenge I could find was at the end, certain ""Great Challenges"" and the seven great demon lords. Aside from that, nothing. The final boss is fairly easy if you have mega Digimon from all classes. Take three of the main classes, and two free types, and you'd do fine in just about any battle.
This is a REALLY fun game. It's highly addictive though, especially on your first playthrough. Don't play on a busy week.
Another major positive of the game is that it doesn't rush to reveal the story to you. It takes around 40-60 hours on your first run. It took me around 90 hours since I wanted to unlock certain Digimon for the final boss.
All its negatives considered, it's still a solid game and a fun experience, and I recommend it to all Digimon fans out there. If you can get it on sale, even better.",1585645657,1585645657,True,32,2,0.772786855697631836,0,True,False,False

If you are not a digimon fan this review is delivered for your entertainment.

Lets start from the top, with the important aspects of gameplay, then work our way down into the bottom of the abyss.

Combat plays similar to digimon world 2 on the ps1, you can carry up to 11 digimons with you(although each digimon occupies memory based on how strong they are so depending on your rooster you will only be able to carry a few until you get more memory as you progress through the game), sending 3 to fight and swapping them during it at will or as they get knocked out. If all your digimon get knocked out its game over.

Outside combat you can save at any point(which can potentially lead to a softlock and ruining your save file on a specific quest if you are extremely careless and unprepared).

You get new digimon by scanning a % of the enemy's whenever a fight starts and converting it in the digilab when it reaches 100%. You can them move your inactive digimon to a farm where they get exp over time while they train, produce a item or search for side quests.

Digivolution is completely in the player's control, the game displays what options are avaliable and the requirements but wont tell you which digimon it is if you havent met it yet. You can also de-digivolve back to previous forms. Whenever any of that happens your digimon goes back to level 1, which may sound harsh but it really isnt.

Im not gonna enter in detail about types and elements in this game, its your typical rock/paper/scissor. Your rooster gets the full experience of every fight, letting so even the digimon in the bench get to level up equally.

When you take everything into account, it means that you will play through the game with a big, ever changing variety of digimon between the ones in the farm and in your rooster as they digivolve.

The graphics are pretty good. The digimon looks pretty alive with their signature moves.

Now lets start our descend into madness...

Outside of boss fights, combat in this game is utterly trivial, so you would think bosses is where the real strategy is applied, but no, bosses are immune to all effects in the game except stun, which delays their turn slighly, and attacks that ignore defense, which completely obliterates some of them. Also abilities like reviving are disabled for whatever reason but you can just use a item which is better anyways.

Changing to quests, in the cyber sleuth campaign, you play as a detective and you progress through the game solving cases while ulfolding the main plot of the game.

...Oh boy, here we go.

You never do any actual detective work, every quest has a starting location that you walk or get auto teleported to that will then tell you to go talk to somebody else or throw you into some dungeon to fight someone or something. Its handheld, its linear and you have no choice in the matter.

This game doesnt know the difference between main and side quests. For instance, one of your main quests is to go to a variety of restaurants to eat food, just that, no exploring, no battles, no plot related stuff, just going from restaurant to restaurant eating food, and they couldnt even bother to show you a SINGLE PICTURE of food, instead you are treated to a nice black screen as you read text of your character describing the food.

...you have to do this quest twice. Also you can only pick one Quest at a time, so theres no saving time and completing quests as you find their goals along the way, you will be going back a forth and revisiting places a lot, which doesnt really matter because the internet in this game just looks like a web designer's limbo. Its repetitive and uninteresting.

And this gets me to the worse this game has to offer: the plot.

This game plays out like a season of your least favorite anime. Doesnt even feel like a digimon anime. Its a combination of the worst flaws you find in anime such as: stereotype characters, misplaced fan service(if you can even call it that), japanese history and cultural references to the point where your own freaking digimon will ask you japanese trivia questions.

I dont even know where to begin with all this so lets start with world building. You see, in this universe digimon are considered programs used by hackers to do whatever they want. Hackers who are mostly composed by teenagers. It is so silly that you cant think at all about it. Also internet is so advanced that your entire body is transported into it. The game never tries to make sense of it and it assumes you also wont(to give you an example, there is a quest that you have to go talk to nanimon, so he can send you to the real world to buy a newspaper, so yeah, you go into the real world, buy a newspaper and then delivers it to him, on the internet).

One of the main problems with the history of this game is that it happens mostly, if not entirely in the real world. Your quests are the equivalent of reading reddit. Theres a kid who doesnt go out and keeps chatting online, theres someone messing up wiki- i mean digipedia, a mobile game not working, a website having login problems, etc. With the twist that the culprit was a digimon.

I dont even think the problem with the story of the game is how mundane it is, its more that the game doesnt make a attempt to explain or show anything, making you simply not care about it either. Digimon are invading the human world to destroy it but you still see npcs standing around doing nothing next to a digimon next to the military next to a spatial vortex in the streets.

I think there was one moment that highlights every problem with this game and was what propelled me to write this review. At some point, in order to get the help of a certain digimon, you have to create a portal to a alternative reality. Yeah the game Just casually throws a multiverse in the middle of it. No make things worse, the npc responsible for it straight up lies to yo. She tells you its gonna take time and that you should go do other quests in the meantime. So i did, every single optional quest until one of them made me go where you are actually supposed to go to advance the plot and unlock the next main quest.

So after watching deviwoman and angewoman nearly kiss, thus completely destroying your childhood, you make it to the alternative reality to find the most annoying character in the entire game. This girl is super energetic! And dumb!

You see, the main problem with characters in this game is that they think mood and intelligence are personality traits, so the more intelligent someone is the more serious they get. So then you meet this dumb girl, and shes unbareable, and she decides to do a bunch of flips and kick one of the digimon bosses in the face. Thats comedy, right?

Thanks to a plot device, your character is capable of doing all sorts of things that would be impossible even in this game's universe but that still doesnt help the fact that your character doesnt feel human. All because this takes place in the real world. Your character looks like a young adult who has a adult job but is actually a teenager that goes to school. The very few text messages you get from 2 of your school friends and mother doesnt help sell that idea at all. This game doesnt even have a regular school map to visit which is even more surprising. So why make this character a student? This character doesnt have anything someone could relate to unless that person doesnt have a lif- oh...

So grab this game if you are up to the task of raising a large variety of digimon to their multiple final forms and building a party with your favorites. Otherwise, run for your life!",1583527076,1583527076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can easily sink 100 hours in just one of the games, and this bundle offers 2 for a price that was below that of AAA release, at least it was for me when I bought it during its Steam launch (40 euros).

Very solid game, addictive, Cyber Sleuth comes with all the updated mechanics and nerfs implemented in HM (no more UlforceVdramon cheese, PlatinumNumemon now has crap INT so disregard all the exp farming guides when they tell you it must have Nightmare III lol, it now has instead 999 def stat from lvl1, slightly below average att for a mega, and very mediocre INT stat though you can fix it to work decently for exp farm still with powerful moves or ABI training if you have that much patience and time to sink).

Minor negatives are that like every other Digimon game so far there's still no inclusion of X-Antibody system and digimon, something that, imo, is already due late to feature in a franchise game, with the exception of the mobile ones which are somewhat fun, but not as close to being quite real game.

Cyber Sleuth
With a large quantity of Digimon with a unique digivolution system and loads of customization, it is a truly enjoyable experience. While a bit overwhelming at first it starts to slow down as you take things one step at a time. The amount of statistical and ability based customization is particularly impressive. While it has enjoyable gameplay and great motivation for participating in it, the actual story is generally not that good. A large part of this may be do to the fact that there are CLEAR translation issues with the subtitles. On a fairly regular basis you will be scratching your head a little because a conversation was worded very oddly and once in a while a conversation completely breaks down temporarily. Some examples include options where characters will clearly shake their head ""no"" but, text will say ""yes"", being given three options to respond but, the options arent actually different, they are just one long single thought that you pick one of three lines of to get a 33% chance of the result making sense, and finally there are clear problems with how they present honorifics and portray meaning thus. With the translation issues aside, some of the characters werent the most likable and seem forced on you as the MC. Despite this lacking story, I do still recommend the game to digimon lovers or general monster tamer genre players. Finally, its important to know that when you reach a point of no return, a ton of quests become available. So even if you had already cleaned up, upon having the conversation and pop up warning, new things are unlocked so, for a full playthrough you gotta go back. 
6/10

Hackers Memory
Gameplay is not too much different then Cyber Sleuth other then the introduction of two new styles of combat which, mostly are easy and bland. However, the base gameplay was already plenty good so it isnt a problem in the long run. While it does suffer from the same translation issues as Cyber Sleuth the characters are much more enjoyable and deep making the story more interesting in general. [spoiler] However there is one moment in particular that had me fuming from a ""player choice was fake"" standpoint. [/spoiler] Additionally, its enjoyable to see Cyber Sleuth's story get developed a little more as you view it from the outside.

What really puts Digimon above most monster collection games is that evolution isn't final. You can revert it as many times as you want and even benefit from doing it. Evolve into a ton of different things ! You can carry up to 11 Digimon in your party. 3 come out to battle. 

I play using an Xbox generic controller, I didn't have to set anything up. Runs great !",1582533380,1582533380,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]PROS:[/b]
• DIGIMON!
• Battle system can be all right
• Potentially lots of content and hours to play (if that’s important to you)

[b]CONS:[/b]
• Abysmal writing. Only about 40% of the main quests feed into the plot. The rest is filler!
• Lots of leaps in logic, plot holes and dropped storylines
• Awful quest design: most of the time you have to talk to someone, return to the office to accept the quest and then return to the original quest giver to start a quest. You can only accept one quest at a time. Side Quests are an unbearable waste of time!
• pandering towards immature teen boys (yes, I know that’s the main demographic – but it’s really heavy handed)
• No nostalgic sounds (at least nothing from the seasons I’m familiar with)
• Instead: generic forgettable music
• Boring levels
• Digivolving and De-Digivolving can mess with the balancing and it’s easy to become over or underpowered

[b]NOTE:[/b]
I completed the main game, but played Hacker’s Memory only up to chapter 5. From what I can tell, it’s slightly better and even continues some of the dropped storylines. Unfortunately, it only makes sense if you’ve completed the other game first.

I have played Digimon Story (Cyber Sleuth + Hacker's Memory) before on PS4 and have thoroughly enjoyed both of them and now I'm re-buying both games (i.e. the ""Complete Edition"") again on PC because I LOVE the Digimon franchise (more so than Pokemon IMO) and want to support the franchise in the west as much as possible. In short:

[b] Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth [/b] -> Excels at providing [b] awesome and intense boss battles [/b] with more focus on the [b] Digimon [/b] side of the story.

[b] Digimon Story: Hacker's Memory [/b] -> Excels at providing [b] deep story-telling [/b] with more focus on the [b] human [/b] side of the story.

All in all, if you are a Pokemon fan (or a ""turn-based/monster-raising"" genre fan in general), I highly recommend getting this  complete edition which features two games for the price of one game. Additionally, should you want to experience or try out other Digimon games, here are all my top favorite ""turn-based"" Digimon games that I would recommend along with the appropriate rating for each game:

Positives: 2 stories or games for the price of one. Both can be very lengthy. Depending on your playthrough. Both also have a few different added types of content than the other. A very large variety of Digimon that span out from the franchise over the years. From old favorites, to new you may have not remembered. Balanced out mechanics for a turned based JRPG. A lot of flexibility on how you want your Digimon to digevolve into discovering a new form and/or to make them powerful than before. So a lot of experimentation. The Digifarm inside the DigiLab  helps out leveling your monsters faster and provide added stats while continuing the story. Which can also be used to to have your monsters make items for you, or find cases for you in the game to solve for me rewards. You can have when possible, up to 11 Digimon in your party and have 3 in battle at a time! The more, the better. The game also features PVP battles you can go up against a random person on the internet. So hope you have a strong party of Digimon for the fight. After beating one story or the other, New Game+ is unlocked for a 2nd run with everything that can carry over to replaying the game of that story. If you complete both games however, you will be able to transfer Digimon from one game to the other like an in game trading system for Digimon that are only available in one side of the story exclusively towards that story. So there's a lot of replay ability. If you plan on filling out the encyclopedia of all the Digimon as a completionist, you can. Not to mention, a lot of side quests, and quests that can be discovered by your Digimon from the Digifarm to earn more rewards in the game.

Negative: The characters of the story and their personalities can be a bit one note and stereotypical. Which they might end up being a bit forgettable after playing the game. Although, some characters stick out more than others and can be from likable to slightly annoying. Even some of the Digimon themselves have personalities. The game's story telling can feel a bit of a visual novel. From the lack of creative cutscenes. So expect a lot of reading. There is also no English dubbing or any language dubbing other than Japanese voice overs. So subtitles for this game will only be your friend here. But the Japanese voice overs do put in emotional effort to the characters. So it's something I can deal with. The game can be a bit of a halt when level grinding happens way too much. Especially, when trying to digivolve into a stronger form and meeting requirements to reach it. So it can be pretty tedious. The dungeon layouts of the game feel non creative and generic and bland at times. So there was more focus on the Digimon themselves than just the world layouts of the game. So it can feel like drawling a line in a maze from going to point A to B.

Digimon Stories: Cyber Sleuth Complete Edition is a must own JRPG for fans of the franchise who've been around for over two decades. The game combines elements if you had Pokemon and Persona by combining the two together. Like the title of the game, it is a mystery and more to be solved on what is going on with the Real World and the Digital World. Not only you can play the main story, but can play the side story as well. Both with the same or different ways of gameplay. Depending on which story you would play first. If you want a slow build up for both games and their stories that happen at the same times and place, I recommend you play each game after beating each a chapter of one and then the other. And alternate on both stories. You have the option to connect both stories at once and can play each story by alternating on both. You do have the option to play the main game and then play Hacker's Memory side story if you wish. But since I did that, I recommend alternating in between the two for more suspenseful build up for both stories. And you can do that.  All and all, for the price of this game, there's a lot this game has to offer and then some. If you think normal difficulty isn't enough, try hard mode. Which makes the battles harder, but in return, higher item drops. Of course, the music in the game is decent to listen in the background too. It's also neat even your Digimon will talk to you. Via their own social media on your Digivice. Giving you that superficial feeling they are alive and even care for you. There's just so much more in this game, it's hard for me to write down everything. If you're a fan of Digimon or someone who enjoys the thrill of collecting monsters and to use them into battles for whatever the cause, this is the game for you. And you won't regret it. I haven't. The only thing that makes me enjoy the game more than ever is the welcoming of familiar Digimon of the franchise. Whether from the shows, movies, or the previous games, puts a smile to my face. For this is what we all have grown up to what a franchise that first started a type of Tamagotchi toy that was made in Japan in 1997, to this.

This is a Visual Novel. Like hours upon hours of dialogue with very little gameplay? Well then you'll enjoy this game.

This is NOT Story Rich. I'm eleven hours into the game and I'm not sure what I'm even doing anymore. The story jumps wildly from topic to topic.

The story isn't even about anything Digimon. Every case is about some real world phenomena, mythical creature, or some folk lore. What the fuck is this game even? How did people enjoy this game?!?!?!

The missions send you to the same dungeon every time. Have fun in Kowloon. You'll be there every mission fighting baby Digimon way under your level. In all fairness there is a good reason the missions all send you there. It's because it is literally the only dungeon. No themed dungeons like Digimon World DS. Just a dead, empty, blue dungeon. Talk about sensory deprivation. Makes me want to commit suicide out of boredom. What a depressing disappointment and waste of money and time.

Actually you don't really need to worry about dungeons to much because the majority of your time will be running around in some city in Japan chasing down childish Scooby-Doo like mysteries that only a child would ever think would be a case that an agency would see fit to investigate. An example would be fixing the air conditioning. (Twice) Another is investigating a child hacking a grown woman's phone and talking about seducing her. (I'm dead fucking serious) Another is performing a ritual in the middle of the street to summon a dead girl. (Has nothing to do with Digimon at all)

Pros:
Evolving Digimon is more involved than just a straight upgrade you have multiple branching options to get the moves and digimon you want
Multiple ways to shorten the need of grinding encounters through use of the farm feature and items to increase drop and xp rates
Difficulty settings normal is very easy, but hard has some tough parts in it
Combat is more than just spamming nukes using support moves is actually effective during the campaign and some battle mechanics liven it up a bit
Sidequests with some stories to them not just a bunch of fetch quests.
Cyber Slueth's story is pretty solid
Using 3 digimon at once and seeing turn orders makes the encounters more engaging
Con:
It's a PS Vita port so options are limited
Some dialogue options aren't actually options but are one large line that is split into the three options (They all get the same result)
Some areas trap you in them which can cause you to get in a bad spot if you found out you aren't ready for it.
Some bosses just gimmick you on hard, While others can get gimmicked to death
Hacker's Memory's plot is rather weak and uninteresting
There are some quests that you need to find through the farm which requires searched using Real Time(1hr-20min depending on whos in the farm)

I, like all self-important millennials, loved Pokemon as a child. My parents bought me all of the toys, anime episodes, cards, and video games. Thankfully, I only had to use a gun for the first year or so before they got the picture. I was in love and the franchise could do no wrong. Eventually, interest in the franchise died and was replaced with less demonic activities and the love was buried for these little cartoon critters in drugs and unwed sex. When I finally got out of the Bible Camp in 2015, the love was revitalized by a cheap 3DS and a copy of Alpha Sapphire after being amazed and then promptly disappointed by Pokemon GO. An opportunity was taken by my friends and I to bond over anime cockfighting and we had a great time, but trouble was brewing in the ol' mush brain. I was being disillusioned and asking questions that I'd never really thought about before. Why are there always two versions at launch with almost zero differences? What the hell is a ""friend code""? Why is there always a third version released a year later that's objectively better than the games from last year?

Then they announced Sword and Shield and I was incredibly underwhelmed. You've heard all the bitching so I'm not going to repeat it but it was difficult to find a justification to spend $60 on what was brought forward. I felt a little burnt by a franchise that I had loved so I went looking elsewhere.

Digimon scratched every single itch I had for Pokemon in a way that I found both vaguely familiar and surprising. The overworld is incredibly mundane and and serves as only a vessel to get to some dialogue and a battle, just like Pokemon. Most of the critters look incredibly dumb but some are clever and interesting, just like Pokemon. Incredibly Japanese melodrama in a scale that can only be described as ludicrous, just like Pokemon. 

So that's all the bad stuff but what about the good? The battling is MUCH easier to participate in. Instead of having 26 types with individual effects on the others, it's refreshing to have a simple ""rock-paper-scissors"" dynamic. No more memorizing a bunch of combinations that sometimes make sense. Each battle being a 3v3 means that you probably won't be able to play through the whole game with just your starter, Evolving Digimon is MUCH more involved than evolving Pokemon. Instead of murdering other people's pets until you reach level 16 and then doing it again until you're level 32, you level your little buddy up and you're presented with options. Instead of linear evolution, there is a vast web of connections between each of your potential companions, each with different moves and capabilities. You can also bring them back to a previous form while retaining all learned abilities. This means that you can take one Digimon and evolve in different ways to craft it exactly how you want. One or two attacks may be intrinsic to that species but everything else is bespoke. There are more in depth stats beyond the traditional ""Attack/Defense"" stats that are similar to the EV system in Pokemon but you can target this growth in a way that the alternate franchise has spent years intentionally obfuscating and hiding in the background, allowing greater control of individual growth of these characters. And the melodrama is actually pretty good! Expect pretty much anime tropes that you'd find in any T-rated anime game but the way that the characters are examined lend the all more interest in general.

Lemme guess, you like me have played a handful of digimon games and fondly remember some DS or handheld one that had all sorts of goodness in it. Well unfortunately you have found yourself in the same boat as people who have their Metroid experience punctuated by metroid fusion.

I will be absolutely honest THIS GAME IS STRICTLY WORSE THAN THAT GOODTASTIC DS GAME WITH THE CHILL FARM AND DEEP TERTIARY MECHANICS.

It's not a shit game But it is strictly worse. Not just in a less than way, but in a fun-antagonistic way. Let me break it down for you.

Story: 6/10
Some nonsense that makes it so most of the games aesthetics is blue science-code jangle instead of a meaningful world. Main character chan-kun-sama-sempai-dono is the chosen one blessed by the digi-ghost of mystery and half deleted semi-digital spirit being destined to save us all. But what that amounts to is you having 15% more teleport powers than an average boy and nothing else.

Gameplay: 5/10
Imagine pokemon but with two seperate type sections. You may be thinking ""that could be good!"" You're wrong.
Both type arrangements do the same thing, multiplying or dividing damage. So your level 99 God Divinemon fighting a level one shrimp small-peepee mon might do .25 damage and take 4x damage from it. If you thought type advantage trivialized gameplay in pokemon try more than doubling it.

Further, the average level up gives 1 of each stat, and the base level one stat pool of each creature is 50 in each area.
Yknow what that means? It means autist grinding a boi to 99 is a power increase of like 75%. A far cry away from the  scaling of any other game that bothers to consume this much time. This is made further ridiculous by the expectation that you make each digi max its level multiple times to reach its best evolution.

The rpg mechanics are strictly incorrect on their own terms. To understand what it is to motivate gameplay and to still make a game of this kind is to sin. Each level should give 6 times the stats it does, and the tools to get to each further digivolution should be available from a standard position barring a few exceptional cases.

Imagine turning pikachu into raichu into pickachu into raichu 4 times just to get rairichu who has only a 10% stat advantage. No organization of RPG mechanics for collectible monsters has ever been worse. This is a unique shitshow.

Furthermore, the map and quest system is cancerous. You WILL require a wiki to play this game. Only dungeon maps ping your location, and all other ones don't even orient the map to your perspective. That plus the glut of story mandatory quests that have no in game display means the game is strictly broken in terms of quest progression.

The only way to progress is to consistently check each and every instance you have ever been in over and over again. This number grows constantly and is untenable. I don't give a shit about your anecdotal evidence otherwise, this part of the game is sin and needs correction. You cannot play this game's story naked, it doesn't make sense to pursue, and thinking otherwise is a sign of mental illness.

Bugs: 8/10
The game lagging makes you walk slower. Furthermore, hacking the game to speed it up cannot speed up walk speed, only animation speed. YOU CANNOT CONQUER THE SPIRITCRUNCH OF THE GAMES NONSENSE. It will work at normal speed if your comp can handle it and 60% speed if it can't. I pity you if it is 60%.

Music: 9/10
Hot damn the music is good. I don't even like the genre and my fancy is tickled. Imagine Phantasy star online, mixed with the few good songs from Lisa, mixed with Persona 5.

It's like 70% techno 20% funk 10% unique jank. Listen to I Can Clown Around Anytime, But I'll Dance from the ost and you'll know if it's worth your time.

It's not my type of music, but it is a perfect execution of what it's going for and I can't deny its excellence. Please look into it on these grounds at least.

Overall: 7/10

I wish I could say its as good as the DS one, I wish I could even be a misleading buyer's biased idiot and pretend it is to encourage people who have had the same experience. But it isn't, and what's more its worse in meaningful ways.

This game is worth no more than 25 bucks. If you buy it for more you will regret it if you have any taste for the genre. Wait for a sale and be pleasantly disappointed like the rest of us.",1579091622,1579091622,True,2,1,0.475392043590545654,0,True,True,False

GAME MECHANICS: 

I've yet to see the DigiFarm in detail, but the rest of the game is similar to Digimon DS Dusk/Dawn entries: you get scan data for each encounter with digimon with the scan cap apparently lowered to 200%, your digimon's stats automatically increase a bit at each level up and influence possible digivolutions with the ""friendship"" stat being replaced by ""CAM"" (short for ""camaraderie""), you can only digivolve digimon at the DigiLab (you can travel to it via access points in cyberspace or the ingame ""real world"").  

There is a new mechanic of limited memory for your party's digimon: each stage has an amount (a digimon in baby stage takes 1 unit of memory and a rookie takes 3) and even when digivolving you need to mind the memory cap - you can have many digimon in low stages with you or few in later stages and if you exceed the cap, you will be prompted to lower it. 
E.g. you can digivolve a digimon even if that goes over the memory cap, but to balance it out you'll need to revert another digimon to a prior form or move a digimon back to the DigiBank or to the farm. 
There are items to increase the memory cap, though.  

While you are shown silhuetes of a digimon's previous and next forms, you can only see their names after you aquire that digimon either through scanning its data and converting it or by digivolving the digimon to that form.  

Reverting a digimon's form is especially beneficial in the beginning when you're eager to  check out as many forms and scanned digimon as possible, as it lowers the digimon's memory and increases their max level and stats.  

Any digimon in your party will gain experience after a battle regardless of its placement. 
However you are limited to using 3 digimon in battle and 8 in the reserve.  

SOUND, SAVE AND EXIT MECHANICS, CONTROLLS, OTHER: 

The graphics are in full 3D and great as well as cute, the music is nice, but loud - you can adjust the volume in the option menu in main menu, at the start of the game after selecting which game/storyline you want to play (Hacker's Memory is second) and later whenever you are not in a cutscene during gameplay - there is voice acting, but it's in Japanese only, if like me you don't like the sound you can turn the voices volume to zero. The subtitles are in English.  
The controls are only displayed for a PS3 controller, so you'll have to test them or look them up in the options menu, they are intuitive on the keyboard: enter to confirm/select, Ecs to cancel or to the previous screen, WASD to move. 

You can save anytime when you're not in a cutscene via the ingame menu - you can access it via the V key.
But there's no conventional way to return to the main menu and exit the game. 
I figured I'll switch to the window view to exit the game via closing the program with the X in the top right and have it in fullscreen while playing. 

The focus of the game is the single player content and you can play it start to finish, but there is an online multiplayer component there as well - so far I haven't tested it, but by the looks of it you battle other players and get rewards for participating in events.  

As far as system requirements go, the game will run well even on low end PCs. 

FINAL VERDICT: 

So far I'm enjoying the game a lot and it doesn't seem to require previous knowledge of the DS series to play (though having played those helps a lot in not finding the different stats overwhelming), so I can give a full hearted reccomendation to Digimon veterans and newcomers alike. 
Though I'd advise you to still try Digimon DS first, so you get a better understanding of the stats and you'll be able to appreciate the leap in graphics more that way, far from being a hardcore requirement, though.

the only problem in this game is dialog, they are unskipable, unecessary and some is boring.

kyoko : ""talk to mirei she will give you hack tool""
you : ""hello give me my tool""
mirei : *telling you her unecessary life story for 5 minutes without reason*

there are dialog choices, no matter which you pick, their respond looks same, it makes you feels like wasting your time thinking which choices you will choose, also all choices looks similiar to each other.

this is story and detective in rpg game, should add more interesting feature than just a dialog and choices, some or literally all quest have more dialog than gameplay, 5 minutes dialog, 1 mintute gameplay(walk and battle).

pros :

300+ digimons, actually this is very good, but somehow it gave me anxiety and depression. don't get me wrong, dying is awesome.

good graphic, 3d model and animation, work on potato computer.

i said some part of story is boring but mostly good, especially hacker memory and middle part of cyber sleuth.

It is set in its own cannon, so anyone can jump in, but you'll get more out of it If you know a little about the franchise. Game play is based around a rock-paper-scissor mechanic like another franchise, but here every battle you send out three monsters and it is unusual to fight just one type of enemy at once. It ends up feeling more like Final Fantasy than Pokemon. Outside of battle digivolving is the main time spender. There is one big master tree, which means any Digimon can turn into any other. Each mon learns different moves that stay after digivolving them. To make your perfect team I suggest the use of an outside source, like digidb. The more a mon digivolves the more ABI it gets. ABI lets a mon increase its stats and certain mons have an ABI requirement to get.

I am an avid Pokemon fan and fan of similar RPGs but given how this is a remaster essentially I was not sure if I wanted to invest the time in it but let me say it's damn worth it.

The package includes two games that are similar in style and gameplay. They are essentially two versions of the same game that you can share some progress between. To do side content and stuff, each game is about 60 hours in playtime. The story is surprisingly good for the genre, not something we expect from games like these and it can be a very good intro to the world of Digimon, which I am sure many people like me have memories of from childhood cartoons but never really delved into it.

Gameplay wise, it plays very similar to the Persona/Shin Megami Tensei series. There is a wide variety of creatures you can interact with, you can branch them with many varied evolutions and manage their stats to create the perfect team. Especially for bonus content there is a need to optimize your team building since some bosses require certain strategies to beat. It does keep the best parts of the series I mentioned though, and with a certain team combination, you can reduce grinding to a bare minimum and be able to create whatever combinations you want in a matter of minutes.

I would definitely recommend this game for the price tag it has, and especially if you can get it on a sale, it is certain to pay back its money in many hours of gameplay.",1574810885,1574810885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyway, I'll start by saying that you don't have to know the franchise to get into this game. The only thing you would need knowledge from the past for is building a team of Digimon you already liked, so welcome to the game, newcomers.

The game isn't very hard, which is great for people that like to play casually. For people that like a challenge, a number of the optional things you can do toward the end of the game can provide. And finally, for the masochists out there, you can do that same late-game stuff on a higher difficulty. Hard mode is fun :)

The last point I'm gonna get into is the multiplayer. At the time I'm writing this, there isn't much going on. You can get a team together and fight a random NPC for a smaller cut of the multiplayer rewards, in case you don't feel ready to take on other people. In fact, that's most of what you can do. Not a lot of people to go around in matchmaking. If you've got a friend to play with, there are few settings you can play with, so that's nice.

That's about all I have to say. I don't write reviews much, but Steam put the option on the game's page in my library. If you feel like I missed important points (which I definitely did), you're free to pop 'em in the comments.",1572748690,1574800330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first review, so i wanna keep it short :D
Pro:
- Nice and many digi
- Good evolving system
- digi will follow behind you

Con:
- Very much text
- ""boss fights"" are kinda weird because you fight rookie/champions with stats of mega

Conclusion:

It is worth to buy with a little to much ""story-telling"" but it has really a lot of digimon, where you can pick up to 9 with you (so you dont have to make a hard selection execpt early in the game)

Overall I enjoyed Digimon Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition which is 2 rpg games in one with Cyber Sleuth as the main game and Hacker's Memory as a side story sequel seeing the main story play out through the eyes of a different cast of characters.

Now for the in depth review :D
Gameplay
The combat system on both games are same. It's a turn base combat with 2 different core components effecting damage output with digimon having 4 types of attributes and 8 elements including neutral for both attribute and element that has no weakness or advantage.
Your character gets Hacking Skills which they can use in dungeons to do various things from removing roadblocks, solving puzzles, and adjusting enemy encounters. They added more features in Hacker's Memory like to make the character run faster and an entrance warp that's very useful and wasn't in Cyber Sleuth.

Digimon
There are over 300 digimon in the roster to collect. Digital monsters require memory space to be put in your digivice so the amount of digimon you can carry and how strong they are at first are very limited because the further they are in their evolution they eat up more memory space.
You have a max capacity to carry 11 digimon at once as long as you have enough memory and a fighting party of 3 that will be shown running around following you in dungeons while the others are in reserve.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1895905321
Every single digimon has a special move with special animation movements with some Mega digimon having 2 special animated moves. Digievolution is more of a branching tree that you control than a single evolution line. In order to digivolve you need the digimon to be at a certain level and meet certain stat requirements, you can also revert an evolution for vaious reason like increasing max lvl capacity to get stats up or to increase ABI to get special rare storing digimon.

Story
Cyber Sleuth: To be honest, as epic as the overall plot is I feel like the structure was poorly paced and executed. While there are a lot of strong quirky characters their bonds feel forced by the plot because they don't even know each other that well or even interact that much unless they need us to do something for them or we got involved with something serious. It's still a decent story but it's just messy in getting to the point and most of the fluff story that aren't serious barely gives any character development for anyone and are just basically whacky adventures.

Hacker's Memory: This was more character driven than plot driven and because this is a side story happening at the same time as the main plot it heavily referances Cyber Sleuth events and many side characters reappear here and we even see what some of them do behind the scene while the MC in Cyber Sleuth was doing their thing. Since it's character driven the stakes feel less grand but more personal, with the MC having his own motives and thoughts most of the time even while still being a silent protag. Being in a team make the characters feel like they have a real bond that grows over time. So basically it's kind of like a look of the world of Cyber Sleuth through a completely different prespective of people that aren't in the center of serious incidents.

If it isn't obvious I'm personally bias and love Hacker's Memory more overall. It reminds me a lot of Durarara in many ways from the doubtful but determined MC to the base of operations being in Ikebukuro and seeing how many characters that seem unrelated are all somehow connected.
Anyway I recommend this game for JRPG fans.",1574227647,1574227647,True,37,3,0.76389765739440918,0,True,False,False

Review: Having a blast so far! The graphics are amazing and the gameplay takes me back to the days of Digimon World: Dawn and Dusk. The story so far is also quite interesting and I'm enjoying the detective spin in Cyber Sleuth, as well as how the stories intersect in Hacker's Memory. The controls are slightly confusing to begin with, but they're easy enough to adapt to and the English translation isn't great, but it's far from the worst I've seen.

The localization is well past the point of a trainwreck--it would be more appropriate to compare it to one of those mods for GTA that makes the cars fly all over the place and crash into each other. We are gifted with such lines as ""What kinda to-do ya think all this is for? Maybe they're making one of them vidya games."" and ""ZOMG! *tremble*"". Characters with Osakan dialects are given the thickest possible rural texan accents in the english subtitles. Other characters that are supposed to have accents will eb and flow from various english-speaking accents with no degree of consistency. This is on top of the litany of typos, such as ""Take a rest a get better.""

If you know even the slightest bit of japanese you will begin to realize that quite a lot of the translated dialogue is not even remotely close to what is actually said, and sometimes, the original script is actually even *more* nonsensical! The characters absolutely love slipping into weird self-conscious meta rants about what their character is supposed to do, or spouting off bizarre english phrases like ""No Digimon, No Life"" at the strangest of times. The chatspeak is something that exists in both the original japanese subtitles and the english subtitles, but is almost never indicated in the actual spoken dialogue. Some of the dialogue--mostly the IM messages--are somehow stilted and a non-sequitur at the same time. [url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/769480185028549287/84AB639228B4E205F392F6C733C2A5714C603A0A/]Human beings aren't supposed to talk like this.[/url]

The pacing of the story is all over the place and the pacing of the gameplay is even weirder. Sometimes you're given a case, immediately teleported to the person commissioning the case, and then immediately teleported to the investigation area. Other times you'll be expected to walk to both places, with no degree of consistency for which method is used. For some baffling reason, most of the main story events aren't considered ""official cases"" so they don't appear in your quest log, which means that the quests you're most likely to get lost on are the ones [I]required for progress[/I]. You can ask two specific NPCs for help if you get lost, but sometimes, neither of them will bother telling you anything and just say ""hey shouldn't you be able to figure this out yourself ;)"". Or they'll tell you something unimaginably vague. 

The quest log itself hardly functions--I mean [url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/768353651046398094/E5069B3B2CD9E63B77C057D6AAE136F988DAC323/]LOOK at THIS.[/url] Do you have the slightest clue what this quest was about or how to proceed? I can't even list the number of things that are wrong or inconsistent here!

The story bounces back and forth. Sometimes Digimon are hardly relevant at all, other times the game is overwhelmingly about Digimon with little concern for the kids. The narrative puts such little emphasis on how much the common people know about or care about Digimon or the main character's cyber powers that it's actually hilarious. You can connect jump into a wire system in the middle of a crowded hospital and not one person will notice or care that someone in plain sight just vanished. There's one especially bizarre section where the main character is unable to connect jump, continues trying the same thing for [i]untold hours[/i], and eventually just ends up succeeding on a whim. When you ask your boss, Kyoko, what the heck was happening, her response is that sometimes things just end up working or not working in a completely arbitrary sense.

All of this is to say that Cyber Sleuth is WILD. It cares so little about taking itself seriously that it somehow manages to find consistency [i]in it's inconsistency[/i]. Most of the time, when you succeed on a case, Kyoko will nonsensically equate what you saw to japanese myth or folklore--these explanations really encapsulate the whole game for me. You're on some sort of whimsical rollercoaster with no real rhyme or reason for what's going on, and then the game will stop to correct itself by saying ""uh, oh yeah, Digimon.""

The first of only two significant issues I have with the game is that the battle system is a bit too ""average JRPG"" for me. The boss battles on hard mode have way too much HP and do too little damage, which means items trivialize almost every fight because you can heal your whole party during one of your turns and always end up winning even the most pronounced war of attrition. Battles are just far too long for their own good and have not enough going on in them. It definitely adds to the  feeling of Digimon being an ancillary part of the experience.

The second, much more pressing issue with the game is that there is absolutely no ability to skip cutscenes. There's quite a lot of cutscenes in this game. There's an entire chapter that's just a series of cutscenes. I only need to see them once. Why can't I skip cutscenes.

The focal point here is definitely the digimon, and designs are varied and interesting enough.
-Not much of a story here - the fun is in evolving the digimon, in my opinion. Since it's so grindy, you'll be doing a lot of combat, which uses a rock-paper-scissors model and isn't terribly engrossing.

The best part about Pokemon is grinding and seeing your dudes evolve into an even more awesome dude, like a cute turtle turning into a giant with tank cannons in their shell. Well, this game lets you evolve AS MUCH AS YOU WANT due to the necessity of de-evolving. 

This is the ultimate mindless grinding game as you are constantly required to evolve and devolve, thanks to an evolution TREE. So you grind, evolve, see that the creature is ugly, reset back down, evolve, see that the next tier is locked by evolution points that you get from evolving and devolving, and the cycle continues. Grinding is aided by some ""hacks"" (basically spells the protagonist can use on the field) - one hack instantly causes combat, so you don't need to run around in a circle to find a random encounter. 

Monster designs are usually a hit for me, but I do love armored dudes. Since this is a JRPG, armored dudes do tend to lean towards Gundam more than medieval knight, but there's some variation there.

Story is pretty average, and feels like the more recent Shin Megami Tensei devil survivor games - OK but nothing amazing. Translation is not great, with some dialogue responses seeming to have no connection to whatever was said previously, but nothing terrible that causes the game to have issues.

Overall, I wish more was done with raising the digimon like back in the old PS1 games, with feeding and exercising them. Each digimon has a personality attribute, but it only decides stat growth and not any actual character of the digimon. In the end, the fun of evolving the digimon and seeing all the awesome evolutions in a particular branch of monsters was enough for a grinder like me.",1573682611,1573682611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Q: Why it's the best?
A: Because you can put poop in your party to greatly decrease the grinding. Also, the story is great.

Q: Is it better than Pokemon?
A: They're very different games, can't compare. This game is more like a softcore Shin Megami Tensei.

Q: Why the graphics are kinda not-so-good?
A: Because it's a 2015 PS Vita port.

Q: How good is the translation?
A: Absolute garbage, but comprehensible.

Q: Why Cyber Sleuth main theme sounds so similar to Danganronpa's main theme?
A: It's the same composer, Takada Masafumi.

Combat is simple on Normal difficulty. No real need to grind unless you want to. Hard Mode, you'll grind a lot like most JRPGs want you to do. The system is easy to learn, with some interesting difficulty curves when you start to learn more complex ways to tackle situations. Hard Mode will make you structure your team very carefully, where as Normal you can basically use whatever Digimon you love the most and beat the story so long as you make sure they're properly leveled.

There's a crap ton of digimon to tame and develop through the generations of digivolution.

It helps, but you will not be stumbling around in a confused state. If you like Digimon but never played a JRPG, play it on Normal Mode and it'll be fun.

Dlcs included in it too!

It requires a lot of grinding if you want to have the most competitive digimon team possible, mostly because of the max abi being 200 and makes you being able to raise more stats of whatever digimon u are building up, but honestly I still feel its worth it.

This game is a lot of fun and a unique experience for Digimon and RPG, especially if you are a digimon franchise fan like me, but even if you aren't/dont know much of it, you most likely would still like this game.

First impression: okay I'm not a huge digimon fan at first, even to the point that I consider digimon is pokemon with guns. But make no mistake, for newcomers this game will, and I say, WILL capture your attention and make you in love with the digimon universe. Gameplay is very simple, yet the animation for both facial and movement is extremely gorgeous even I dare to say it's surpasses pokemon's animation. What's more is that you can de-digivolve, undoing your digivolution to increase your digimon max level. The only bad thing IMO that really impact gameplay is the fact that you need to go back and forth to get cases/mission. At one point you need to get to Shinjuku to talk with this guy about your mission, only for this guy to say that he will give your mission on your base, and then after you get the mission you need to go back to Shinjuku and talk with the same guy again. This happens a lot in the story, just saying.

Strategy wise, the rock-paper-scissor combat system is easy to remember and rather to simple compared to pokemon. The movesets is also rather limited and 1 move is quite similar to the other. Status effect, on the other hand is very diverse and much appreciated, they also affect your digimon facial animation like a sleeping Gargomon that is very cute and you want to tuck it into bed, not gonna work with sleeping WarGreymon though [spoiler] (hey, my 3 digimons was turned into bits and it's even cuter than before). [/spoiler]

Graphics is quite good but I still can see a few pixelated bits here and there, this game was originally meant for PS Vita so it's time consuming to upgrade the whole graphic asset for the game I think. But the character's face is fortunately good. Also, being a ported game there are a few mistranslation here and there. Voice acting is good but only a couple conversation is fully voiced.

Overall this game exceed my expectation. You get a good amount of gameplay for it's price (thanks to regional pricing I bought this game for only about $20 from Southeast Asia). The only bad thing to consider is that you will need to go back-and-forth between your objective and base to complete just 1 single mission. For new players that interested in RPG, get this game. You will love the setting, you will love your digimon, and [spoiler] you will love the virtual live and forget about the real world. [/spoiler]

The writing is, good but also crazy. Things can be nonsensical and extremely japanese at times, but it really just makes the game more fun and often the crazy things that are happening are explained in a way that grounds them in the world. When something is revealed, it really makes you go ""oh yeah that makes sense"" because you've had the way the world works explained to you well enough that it's something that seems plausible. I really applaud that the writing was able to keep me engaged as well. I generally don't like JRPGs that much because I get bored with all the constant text boxes, but this game is so full of character and surprises, I'm always paying attention and sometimes laughing at the things being said.

The evolution system with the digimon is great and always has been in the franchise, but this is the best version I've seen so far. Every digimon has a branching tree that they can go up or down to explore the various posibilities and they keep the abilities they learn from leveling up. The top tier evolutions also make it clear that you're supposed to nurture your little creatures so that they can grow into their max potential. They don't just DO IT because you throw them at enough enemies. You need to specifically cultivate their stats if you want them to go a certain route. There are over 300 digimon in the game, but only like 5-10 digimon of the lowest possible level, so each baby you start with can go into tons of completely different directions if you just experiment and make discoveries.

In terms of value, this game is a steal. You are getting 2 campaigns and all of their DLC for $50.  I'm at the very end of the 1st campaign and I haven't even finished it because I'm trying to beat all the DLC challenges before I do. This is with 60 hours of play.
If the rest of the game follows this trend, there is over 100 hours of gameplay in a singleplayer game for only $50. That is amazing. There aren't any exploitative microtransations from what I'm seeing either.

I heard it was popular, but I thought the story would be childish and just somewhat interesting, the gameplay of a turn based game would get repetitive like most games I played, and the animations stagnant, since... well it's Digimon. I have only finished 1.5 out of 7 that I played, before this one.

But... I end up being blown away thru how much emotions the characters get out of me, the good and the bad, but bad in a good way, like when you like to hate something meant to be hated.
The story has a nice amount of fun twists and turns, and even a few dark moments, especially in the required side quest parts.
The combat, while simple, it kept me on my toes, at least on hard difficulty. I have never used as many ""Potion"" equivalents in any other game as this one, so either this game can keep you on your toes, or I played baby turn based games before. 
And the animations are beautiful and lively, I even noticed nods to other digimon games/anime with some of the animations.

Overall, I am happy I have finally got to experience a digimon game that's great on every aspect, that's not a card game. :P

If you want a short version there are plenty of those but mine would be, if you like Digimon, or like turn based collection games with a Japanese anime aesthetic (JRPG) I can highly recommend it. Its not perfect but its a great game, and you get your money's worth 8/10.
Now onto the proper review.

Full disclaimer I waited to this game for years to come out on PC and it and games like Persona (and some others like Infamous) are reasons I thought about getting a PS4.
The game right now costs 40 Euros or around 50$ its only about 6 gigabytes big and is a two in one package where you get Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth and Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: hacker's memory both taking about an average of 40 to 50 hours to beat the story mode for ether (which does not include if you want to do all the optional story and side missions or collect which can bring you up to 80 to 100 hours essentially) which you get a lot of play time out of it and I will further down talk about both a bit individually but first what they have in common. For a fan of the Digimon franchise this is probably one of the best games out there if not the best one itself, but like I said its far from perfect. 
The game takes place in universe of Digimon Story and Digimon Worlds, its a turn based JRPG collection game with tactical type advantages and disadvantages elements, Think of it as Pokemon mixed with Persona or Old School Final Fantasy, and it works really well.
The games feature mechanics that are about hacking and let you interact in the virtual world besides raising and evolving and deevolving your Digimon, from which there is a huge variety with over 300 of them. The hacking abilities are a fun idea but they could have been executed better, in Hacker's Memory they have a much bigger use where you can affect the world, then they do in the regular one where they feel like just like a roadblock sometimes or something you just need to do to open a door.
The Digimon have 4 types with 3 of them work in the classic rock, paper, scissors mechanic dealing extra damage or taking extra damage, and the 4th type doing nether to any of them, the 4 of them also have subtypes which are elements which helps balance it out a bit more.
The digifarm is back and it is simpler then ever to use focusing on stats mostly
The story is good and its kinda what you expect from a Digimon game, but it keeps you interested, it works well in the modern day and is a good time for all ages altho personally I wouldn't give it to a kid as it is a bit darker compared to some
The side missions are well written, well for the major ones at least as the minor ones can get really tedious and feel grindy sometimes compared to them as they will involve you going from point A to point B and back, and not to mention that all the side missions have to be taken from a board even if you just ran into that person that asked you for help.
They implemented the customization from Hacker's memory in the base one but its extremely limiting as it is just a shirt. Speaking of limited, the options menu can only be accessed in the game while you are playing or when you start a new game, which was a major gripe for me but its not a big problem. The game has no dubbed version, the voice lines are only in Japanese while the text is in different languages listed on its steam page (where they actually can be changed as the in game menu does not have that option), for me personally that wasn't a big problem as with the whole anime aesthetic I prefer it this way, plus that might be a good thing as some characters are over the top and it just wouldn't work dubbed like most anime, while the the Japanese one works much better with the story and humor. Speaking of which the humor is on point, and I god damn love it they do a good range between funny and serious moments, but if you are not a fan of that style of anime humor it won't work for you.
The characters in both are great and and have their quirks and personalities and I loved 90% of them, story on the other hand differ a lot between the two games in quantity and quality which will bring me to talk about the two games now:

-Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth
The game takes place in the near future where people use a version of the internet called EDEN where people can virtually log in with their consciousness online. In the first 10 to 20 min of the game your character, meets up with friends he met by chance online on a dangerous server where he was called after having a app installed on his phone that lets him capture Digimon, after befriending one, something happens to your character leaving you in a half cyber state in the real world giving you the ability to travel into the data of anything, it quickly leads you to a detective agency to a detective where you found out what happened to you leaves other people in a state of coma, you decide to help each other out to regain your original body and solve the mystery.  There is ofc much much more going but this is the first 20 min of the game. During the game you run into different memorable characters, form friendships, make bonds, find out more about digimon, the world etc. all the way to saving the world and ofc you and your friends meeting per classic video game and anime fashion was not really by chance but you have a much bigger destiny. The characters are well written and it feels like your character is becoming friends with them, and they develop and change based on how the story goes and the story takes twists and turns and keeps you interested, all the way trough.

-Digimon S.C.S. .: Hacker's Memory
Hacker's Memory takes place in the same world as regular Cyber Sleuth and it actually takes place at the same time as it, making it less of a sequel but more of a spin off or side story. Which I find to be actually a bit of a shame. The concept of the game is more interesting as compared to the previous game, you are not special, you don't have a grand destiny to save the world but just a guy who's deal with something on the sidelines which is why I find it to be a shame, as the game overall would still work (even better probably) if they put it after the first one as at it is it kinda making the game feel pontless. You are a kid who's EDEN account gets stolen which leads you to a black market where you also get recruited by a hacker group that tries to do good in the EDEN. The story is good, its not on the same scale as the previous one and it is a bit shorter in retrospect, no real twists happen in this one you can't see from miles away, less characters but they are more developed, it gives you a view of a different side of this universe that gets you hooked but then it falls a bit apart when you run into characters from the previous one seeing what they were up to while they weren't around your character there. It also deals with a big thing that was only hinted in the first game which they could have made a whole story about, but its still done well.

Now in conclusion why did I rank the game so high? Well even tho with all its cons in comparison to the pros they are all minor plus while I played the game I couldn't stop, it could be because I waited for this game to come to pc for so long but also because I enjoyed every moment of it, even with the grindy quests I still had fun. The only time I took a moment was farm training but that was coz I wanted a certain digimon.
And most importantly for me when I finished the first game I was sad that it ended, not because of the ending but because there wasn't more and I wanted more, not that I needed more but I didn't want it to end. And a game that can do that is in my book a great game.",1571739776,1572380539,True,29,1,0.715275406837463379,0,True,False,False

The maps are very lazily designed. Mostly all of the dungeons in this 25+ hour game look the same and gets old very fast.

This game honestly sucks major balls, there's so many incoveniences but raising Digimon is so fun that it overrides every bad thing and it ends up as a very fun game.
[b]END OF TLDR[/b]

Some stuff to note
* Don't do Hacker's Memory first, it's pretty much a sequel.
* Hard mode is actual hell but I managed to get to the final boss without grinding so it's definitely doable if you really don't want to but really just grind if you're doing it, it's not worth the suffering.


What I personally found annoying (i.e. more details):
[b]Boss Fights[/b]
Some bosses are fun to fight against with but it'll depend on your team setup (some bosses are really hard for some and really easy for others). When they're not fun, it's usually because your team just isn't made for them and they'll be oneshotting you over and over again, speedblitz'ing you, overhealing your damage, etc etc. Either grind to keep up, change up your strategy, your Digimon or train stats in the farms. Some bosses have really long cutscenes before them so have fun with that.
I managed to beat Lucemon Satan Mode with a stupid underleveled team but it required a lot of trial for me to get a good equipment setup and I had a lot of different Digimon to choose from. You'll need dedication like that if you want to beat Hard Mode undergeared. Pretty much, if you're not tryharding your Digimon choices, you'll have to tryhard other aspects, like equipment and training.

[b]Translation[/b]
I honestly hate most of the localization changes but this isn't about that. The translation is just bad, especially for the original Cyber Sleuth. There'll be a lot of obvious mistakes made by the team and some dialogue will be straight out hard to understand (doesn't help that a lot of characters are intentionally cryptic too, so it's a double gut-punch). One of the most popular mistakes is the characters saying bakemon (as in bakemono) to refer to the Eaters (not a Digimon) and the dialogue says Bakemon (referring to a Digimon that has nothing to do with whatever's going on).

[b]Many, many incoveniences[/b]
As mentioned above, there's no cutscene skip, no fast forwarding, a lot of shops are far-away (going in and out of the DigiLab to get stuff to train your Digimon is really annoying), a lot of items are locked until late to the game, some bosses will leave you stuck with no good shops to go back to, the list goes on and on. 
A lot of minor nitpicky jankyness too. I think they missed a lot of things they could've done with a PC port. When you rename a Digimon, it shows up a new keyboard interface for you to type its name in but... It's completely undecorated and it's like the game opened a notepad for you. It's just ugly.
In Hacker's Memory, your quest board is a computer WITH A MOUSE CURSOR but you cannot use your actual mouse cursor on it. This game *is* compatible with a mouse but all it does is click to confirm.

[b]Missing Digimon[/b]
A lot of Digimon are missing. Not even talking about the popular X-Antibody variants, but just a lot of normal popular Digimon are missing. Big example: Millenniumon. Obviously shouldn't matter if you're new to the franchise or stopped keeping up. This game was what started it so hopefully the next games'll have a lot more.

[b]Bad Balancing[/b]
I think it is, at least. Not counting PvP. A lot of people are going to play this game wanting to use their favourites but this game pretty much demands you bring a Digimon with a defense penetration signature move and not every Digimon has that. You could end up with a really bad team depending on your favorites, but most popular Digimon *should* be good enough. Might only apply to Hard Mode as Normal Mode is easy as shit.  % damage like Mastemon and guaranteed/fixed damage moves are very popular picks too.

However, even all of these were really annoying, I still enjoyed this game way too much. At the time of posting this review, I have 60 hours and that was only in Cyber Sleuth (haven't even started postgame!). If you like raising and leveling Digimon, that by itself is the biggest positive and already makes the game worth playing, the game is kind of poopy beyond that but it is still very enjoyable. You may have noticed I haven't pointed out the story but I'm not good at judging those so I'll leave it to someone else.",1571783490,1572028831,True,17,5,0.584195971488952637,0,True,False,False

Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth:
I am only going to review the first Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth game because I have not finished Hacker's Memory yet.
The game was a slog.  No kidding. A very large portion of the game you don't actually spend playing the game, but instead in cutscenes reading things that have nothing to do with digimon.  At all.  Most of the people playing this game probably skip through them.  The plot, the mood, and the characters are just all over the place.  Nothing is consistant.

The non-story content is not interesting or engaging at all.  It almost feels like this game was made for children 6 and under.  Except it wasn't.  There is actual cursing in the game as well as references to adult themes.

As far as translation goes, there was definitely little to no quality assurance.  Errors, both grammatical and spelling, are very common.  Often when you get dialogue choices, they will run over each other.

Finally, there is very little variance in environments.  I think I can count the variety of ""dungeons"" you can go into on one hand.  The game gets very repetitive very quickly.

The game feels less like a digimon game and more like a detective game for kids with a premise in Tokyo that had digimon pasted into it.",1572025684,1572026536,False,19,13,0.422112226486206055,0,True,False,False

Now, I have played both of these games on PS4 when they were initially released stateside and completed nearly all the content they had to offer, with the notable exception of the DLC content the first game released a short while after the initial release which is included automatically in this version. As for any major differences, the only particularly notable thing is Digimon that were exclusive to Hacker's Memory are now available in Cyber Sleuth as well including a couple Digimon that require completion of Hacker's Memory to evolve into. Enough of that though, let's get into the actual content of the games, which I'll cover in two sections.

By the way, highly recommend using a controller rather than keyboard controls. Exploring the world without analog controls is just torturous.

Cyber Sleuth:
(As a note, I would recommend playing through at least the base storyline of Cyber Sleuth regardless of everything I'm about to say simply because it's important to understanding several things happening in Hacker's Memory.)

Cyber Sleuth is, in short, an utterly average game. It's certainly playable, the characters are generally likeable, and there are a few plot twists that can really get you amped up for the rest of the game, though these generally come fairly late into the game. The main storyline, if playing on normal mode and skipping most all side content, could reasonably be completed in ~30 hours or so if you're fast, probably closer to 40 or 45 hours and more like 70 if you do all the side content. I wouldn't recommend a first time player goes into the hard difficulty strictly because it effectively just forces you to spend a bunch of time grinding to get higher stats so you don't get completely bodied by bosses. There are some absolutely brutal difficulty spikes but they're easily managed on the normal difficulty with some decent strategy. Quick tip: Save frequently, losing a fight outside the Colosseum kicks you back to the title screen and you'll have to go back to your last save, which can be brutal if you forgot to save for the last hour. As for how the pacing goes and how interested you'll be the entire time, it's a bit hard to say. In my experience, the beginning third and final third are both really good with the beginning starting out pretty strong, but there's a decent chunk in the middle chapters where it feels like the pacing dies a bit. The story definitely has its moments, but it definitely has some utterly stupid scenes here and there. That said, the fully animated cutscenes that show up on rare occasion are an absolute treat to watch and are just beautifully done, especially if you like more ""anime"" art styles. The conclusion to the main story also hits pretty hard, in a good way. Quite memorable, and if you get attached to characters in stories you'll definitely love it. Having said that, getting invested completely and making it through to the end of the game with all the unskippable cutscenes right before tough boss fights, the occasional chore it is to do missions, the harsh difficulty spikes, and occasionally really poorly designed enemies really makes the entire thing a bit of a slog at times. So even though I think the game itself is generally quite good, the sometimes grind-y feel of the game definitely can put a dent in your enjoyment and coming back to play this game after having played Hacker's Memory makes that all the more evident. Having said that...

Hacker's Memory:

10/10 HOLY SHIT! While Hacker's Memory has a few of the same problems as Cyber Sleuth, namely the unskippable cutscenes and occasional rough difficulty spike, Hacker's Memory delivers a far superior story with nods to the main story of Cyber Sleuth littered everywhere throughout the game from start to finish. There was never a point in Hacker's Memory where I didn't enjoy my time, to the point where I did something I never do and did a 100% clear (minus the medals) on my PS4 in NG+ and also decided to do a challenge run for fun. The progression system in the game is much smoother this time around and the story is consistent the whole way through. The addition of a couple more ""Hacker Skills"" also make the whole experience a fair bit better, Free Gate and Acceleration make base-Cyber Sleuth hard to play at times. The main cast, excluding Chitose, is also much better and gets better development in my opinion than the cast of Cyber Sleuth, though they do all show up in this game as well. Honestly, I can't praise this game's story enough. While the exact same grinding process for each Digimon takes place in this game as well (you can actually speed it up in both games if you have the right party with the right gear setup) it ends up not dragging on the story nearly as much since it's fairly uncommon for it to be actually necessary to do it this time around, though the knowledge you pick up in the first game will definitely help to lessen the need to grind in this one. Honestly, the only thing about Hacker's Memory that I can't fully recommend is the fact that you have to go through Cyber Sleuth to REALLY get what's going on in the story completely since there are constant references to events that happened in that game with things you're doing in Hacker's Memory being a direct result of an event in Cyber Sleuth, which is both great and awful since you are basically forced to play the worse game first and potentially not bother playing through the second one thinking it's basically gonna be the same experience.

Having said ALL of that, I would highly recommend picking this up anyways. Hacker's Memory on its own is worth the $50 price tag and Cyber Sleuth is a perfectly enjoyable experience on its own. From just a price standpoint, I think it's completely worth it, but I would also love for everyone to experience the beautiful story that is Hacker's Memory. Honestly, just blast through Cyber Sleuth's main story ignoring the bulk of the side content to get to Hacker's Memory. It really is good enough to warrant that in my eyes.",1571998019,1571998019,True,5,0,0.592973589897155762,0,True,False,False

I can't speak for Hacker's Memory's plot as i'm going to clear the base Cyber Sleuth game first, but so far the main cast is all very likeable and the story's intriguing. To top it off, the mechanics are all very intuitive and transparent. You wanna know the statline for the digi you just got when it turns level 99? You can do that right away from the menu. It needs 120 ATK to evolve to whatevermon and you want to know at what level it'd get that exact ATK stat? just scroll through them levels.

I've heard this referred to as Steam's best monster-raising game as a replacement for Pokémon, but honestly, as a long time Pokémon fan, i liked this a lot better than most Pokémon games.
One of my biggest gripes with that franchise is that monster-raising RPGs, plotwise, really like the idea of letting you create close bonds with your monsters, sticking with them, etc etc, but then you get to the competitive level and you realize you basically have to play eugenics to make them anywhere near decent. Whoops, it was born with the wrong natures, throw it in the bin. When you finish those games, you have to throw your team in the trash and start over.
With this game, you have similar systems to Nature and EVs, but about halfway through the game, you start getting items that can revert their ""EVs"", or change their ""Natures"", so if you want to stick with the little dudes from your story playthrough, you can pretty simply just undo any stat gains you don't like so much and minmax them to your heart's content.
And to top it all off, the evolution system. By god, the evolution system. A thing i always liked about digimon (though some people dislike it, and i can see why) are the sprawling evolution trees. Thismon can become thatmon and also thatothermon, but thatothermon can also evolve from whatevermon or even whichevermon, etc etc. Well, Cyber Sleuth takes this to its logical conclusion. Through enough digivolving and unevolving, you can get from nearly any digimon to any other. And along the way, you can amass useful spells! 
Many times have i made a digimon just to fill space in my digifarm, or to help with training (by converting and unconverting over and over again until i got one with a good nature to up the others' stats), and just sort of leveling them up to see what they can become and fill up my digimon list, when suddenly i realize ""wait, i can turn this dude into that one digimon i really like!"", and it's always a great feeling. Sometimes they even happen to have really fitting acquired stats (the EV-analogue i mentioned earlier) for the final digimon, which is always nice.

All in all, this game is amazing and i'm glad i finally get to play it. Here's the best part; as of writing, i have all this praise, and i'm not even halfway done with the game!

*Editing review below on 10-20-2019----

Game is good and I have quite a few hours on it by now but it does have some issues.
1: The game will not always boot up.  Sometimes it will just bring up a white window that doesn't respond.  Trying to launch again does no good until you do a complete computer restart.  This has happened to me a few times already.
2: Using a controller does not get the cursor out of the way.  I have to manually move the mouse cursor out of the way which is annoying because I feel if you are using a controller then it should just auto hide that.

Overall still a good buy as these are issues that I can manually spend some time to deal with from time to time but I really hope they get fixed.",1571358597,1571548029,True,3,0,0.396514892578125,1,True,False,False

that being said, the port is super shoddy.  next to no graphics options.  only 4 resolutions to choose from(and the one i like to play at isnt an option (2880x1620)).  stutter every few minutes even though steams frame rate counter shows a solid 60fps.  there is no exclusive full screen mode.  borderless window will just keep the game windowed but remove the title bar, and full screen just stretches the borderless window across your whole scree.  the game never takes over the desktop.  the mouse is still visible, and from what little M\K i have used, it seems like you cant click on anything.  the LMB is just confirm.  the mouse doesn't highlight anything.  The audio is SUPER loud compared to what else you have running on the desktop.  i have never been forced to turn down the in game audio from within the game before.  even with that it is worth it and very fun though.  it is FAR from unplayable.  i just hope this one sells well so that Bandai will  release future digimon titles on pc AND that the pc versions get the care that they need.

Good Story, Good Gameplay, Amazing List of Digimon and honestly a decent price for the games you get.

The first game was slightly adjusted aswell, adding the same Digimon List as Hacker's Memory and some other minor changes. (Sadly not the additional hacking skills from the 2nd game).

Edit: Forgot to mention the multiplayer! It's the same one for both games, that being Hacker's Memory's multiplayer. With the game being on PC, this also means no subscriptions!

The only complaint I have for this one is that the prompts for Menus and Actions are all Xbox One Controller based, even if you don't have a controller plugged in. So you'll need some time learning which key does what, if you happen to play with Mouse/Keyboard. There's also no real mouse support, from what I could tell.
The options are also fairly limited, the game's options menu staying the same as it was on Vita/PS4, with the addition of Graphics Options which are not alot. You can turn Depth of Field and Anti-Aliasing on or off and you can change to Fullscreen, Borderless Windowed or Windowed. Fullscreen does have support for 1440p and 4k, however.

These complaints are just minor ones, though, it's not something that would ruin the game or anything. I haven't encountered any bugs, crashes or similar yet.",1571485012,1571485245,True,10,0,0.56624305248260498,0,True,False,False

Nice character design. Excellent voice acting. Digimon's animation are cute. Story is engaging so far. Color palettes are nice to the eyes.

also runs and looks incredibly well, specially for a port, something I feel like I need to mention as literally half of the games i bought lately had UI issues, port issues, or issues running in general, being a port or not; So finally coming across a double (almost triple) A release that actually, you know, WORKS with zero issue is blowing my mind a bit.

I know that they can't fix the cut scenes without spending a bunch of money to animate them with a bunch of extra frames so it's a small nitpick for an amazing game. I love that they've brought Costumes, DLC, and some small QOL changes from Hacker's Memory over to Cyber Sleuth.

Whether you're a veteran Digimon fan, A newbie Digimon fan or someone who hasn't even played Digimon before this game is a great choice, No prior knowledge is needed as the game explains everything you need to know, The only connection to previous games are two certain characters but you don't need to play them to know who they are, A great entry point into the franchise if you've been wanting to give it a try would 100% recommend.

It isn't a perfect port there are a couple issues such as no PS4 controller support and ingame button display, however as writing this review the game hasn't even been out for a day yet so I suspect there will be patches in future, But those issues are no problem to deal with, I hope with the success of this port and Digimon Survive in 2020 we get a steam port of Digimon World Next Order and hopefully some past games, Digimon World 3 port please it is the best one.
